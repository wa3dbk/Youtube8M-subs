these polishes because they are

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.080 
l-shape hugging at the top edges of my
nail<00:01:56.560> then<00:01:56.950> I'm<00:01:57.159> going<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.340> go<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.909> start

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
nail then I'm going to go in and start

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.029 
nail then I'm going to go in and start
drawing<00:01:58.479> in<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.780> rest<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.350> heart<00:01:59.560> while

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
drawing in the rest of the heart while

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.370 
drawing in the rest of the heart while
filling<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.579> at<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.969> same<00:02:01.329> time<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:02.140> it

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
filling it at the same time so it

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.510 
filling it at the same time so it
definitely<00:02:02.590> takes<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:03.130> little<00:02:03.310> bit<00:02:03.460> of

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
definitely takes a little bit of

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.550 
definitely takes a little bit of
practice<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.329> get<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.840> heart<00:02:05.079> shaped<00:02:05.320> down

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
practice to get the heart shaped down

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.460 
practice to get the heart shaped down
perfectly<00:02:06.430> but<00:02:07.000> I<00:02:07.450> find<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.960> that<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
perfectly but I find that that is the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.560 
perfectly but I find that that is the
easiest<00:02:08.619> method<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.459> do<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.360> make<00:02:10.509> things

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
easiest method to do and to make things

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.690 
easiest method to do and to make things
a<00:02:10.929> little<00:02:11.049> bit<00:02:11.230> easier<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.890> used<00:02:12.280> one<00:02:12.549> of<00:02:12.579> the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
add a little bit more detail and kind of

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.900 
add a little bit more detail and kind of
edge<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.260> up<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.500> little<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.040> I'm<00:02:57.489> gonna<00:02:57.640> grab

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
edge it up a little so I'm gonna grab

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.699 
edge it up a little so I'm gonna grab
one<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.209> these<00:02:58.420> smaller<00:02:58.750> brushes<00:02:59.019> from<00:02:59.530> the

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
one of these smaller brushes from the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.890 
one of these smaller brushes from the
kits<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.340> dip<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.670> back<00:03:00.910> into<00:03:01.360> my<00:03:01.510> dive<00:03:01.720> in

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
kits and dip it back into my dive in

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.259 
kits and dip it back into my dive in
polish<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.530> literally<00:03:03.280> just<00:03:03.580> draw<00:03:03.850> a<00:03:04.030> line

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
polish and literally just draw a line

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.540 
polish and literally just draw a line
through<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.720> heart<00:03:04.989> super<00:03:05.650> simple<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.190> easy

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
through the heart super simple and easy

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.300 
through the heart super simple and easy
but<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.390> gives<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:07.720> extra<00:03:08.050> kind<00:03:08.739> of<00:03:08.920> mmm

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
but it just gives that extra kind of mmm

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.600 
but it just gives that extra kind of mmm
to<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.150> guess<00:03:10.480> that's<00:03:11.320> what<00:03:11.530> people<00:03:11.830> say<00:03:12.040> so

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
to it I guess that's what people say so

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.160 
to it I guess that's what people say so
once<00:03:12.760> you're<00:03:12.910> done<00:03:13.030> with<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.239> step<00:03:13.690> just<00:03:14.019> go

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
once you're done with that step just go

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.590 
once you're done with that step just go
on<00:03:14.320> with<00:03:14.530> any<00:03:14.800> top<00:03:15.070> coat<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.519> used<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.330> big

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
on with any top coat I used the big

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.979 
on with any top coat I used the big
shiny<00:03:16.930> top<00:03:17.230> coat<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.760> seal<00:03:18.760> everything<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.540> and

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
shiny top coat to seal everything in and

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.320 
shiny top coat to seal everything in and
polish<00:03:20.590> up<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.800> entire<00:03:21.310> look<00:03:21.640> so<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.060> create

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
polish up the entire look so to create

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.210 
polish up the entire look so to create
the<00:03:22.450> other<00:03:22.630> now<00:03:22.870> look<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.260> took<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.739> exact

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
the other now look I took the exact

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.440 
the other now look I took the exact
opposite<00:03:24.820> from<00:03:25.090> silver<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.079> used<00:03:26.880> gold<00:03:27.880> this

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
opposite from silver and used gold this

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.199 
opposite from silver and used gold this
is<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.720> color<00:03:28.959> foil<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.709> shade<00:03:30.310> liquid

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
is the color foil in the shade liquid

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.600 
is the color foil in the shade liquid
gold<00:03:31.450> literally<00:03:32.200> looks<00:03:32.500> like<00:03:32.680> liquid<00:03:32.890> gold<00:03:33.070> in

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
gold literally looks like liquid gold in

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.699 
gold literally looks like liquid gold in
