have you ever heard this billions of

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.740 
have you ever heard this billions of
years<00:00:02.340> ago<00:00:02.550> there<00:00:02.879> was<00:00:02.970> an<00:00:03.090> explosion<00:00:03.300> in

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
years ago there was an explosion in

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.510 
years ago there was an explosion in
space<00:00:03.899> or<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.470> hundred<00:00:04.710> thousand<00:00:05.190> years<00:00:05.310> ago

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
space or a hundred thousand years ago

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.909 
space or a hundred thousand years ago
this<00:00:05.700> happened<00:00:05.759> or<00:00:06.240> that<00:00:06.270> happen<00:00:06.750> or<00:00:06.930> even<00:00:07.529> in

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
this happened or that happen or even in

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.650 
this happened or that happen or even in
the<00:00:08.250> beginning<00:00:08.639> God<00:00:08.820> created<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.240> heavens<00:00:09.570> in

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
the beginning God created the heavens in

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.749 
the beginning God created the heavens in
the<00:00:09.719> earth<00:00:09.900> question<00:00:10.679> how<00:00:11.130> does<00:00:11.190> anyone<00:00:11.460> know

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the earth question how does anyone know

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.970 
the earth question how does anyone know
I<00:00:12.030> mean<00:00:12.480> was<00:00:12.840> anybody<00:00:12.929> there<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.410> observe<00:00:13.799> it

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
I mean was anybody there to observe it

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.350 
I mean was anybody there to observe it
well<00:00:14.340> actually<00:00:14.490> somebody<00:00:14.940> was<00:00:15.120> but<00:00:15.299> I'm

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
well actually somebody was but I'm

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.640 
well actually somebody was but I'm
getting<00:00:15.570> ahead<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.750> myself<00:00:15.839> check<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.470> out

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
getting ahead of myself check this out

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.590 
getting ahead of myself check this out
first<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.160> all<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.760> need<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.910> recognize<00:00:18.449> that

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
first of all we need to recognize that

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.910 
first of all we need to recognize that
there<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> huge<00:00:19.170> difference<00:00:19.380> between

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
there is a huge difference between

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.070 
there is a huge difference between
observational<00:00:20.670> science<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.270> historical

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
observational science and historical

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.929 
observational science and historical
science<00:00:22.410> both<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:23.100> valuable<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.730> very

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
science both are valuable but very

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.400 
science both are valuable but very
different<00:00:24.330> let's<00:00:24.660> define<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> two<00:00:25.230> real

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
different let's define the two real

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.470 
different let's define the two real
quick<00:00:25.619> shall<00:00:25.859> we<00:00:25.939> observational<00:00:26.939> science<00:00:27.150> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
quick shall we observational science is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.150 
quick shall we observational science is
simply<00:00:27.779> when<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.080> observe<00:00:28.230> something<00:00:28.890> in

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
simply when we observe something in

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.130 
simply when we observe something in
experiment<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.910> draw<00:00:30.119> conclusions<00:00:30.330> it

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
experiment to draw conclusions it

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.229 
experiment to draw conclusions it
involves<00:00:31.619> repeatable<00:00:32.160> experimentation<00:00:33.120> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
involves repeatable experimentation and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.630 
involves repeatable experimentation and
observations<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.350> present<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.399> through

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
observations in the present it's through

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
observations in the present it's through
observational<00:00:36.210> science<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.780> find<00:00:37.020> cures

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
observational science that we find cures

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.990 
observational science that we find cures
for<00:00:37.380> diseases<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.160> build<00:00:38.370> space<00:00:38.640> shelters

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
for diseases and build space shelters

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360 
for diseases and build space shelters
stuff<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:40.230> through<00:00:40.770> historical

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
stuff like that now through historical

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.520 
stuff like that now through historical
science<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:42.180> consider<00:00:42.629> things<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.170> happened

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
science we consider things that happened

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.900 
science we consider things that happened
in<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> past<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.340> cannot<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.700> checked

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
in the past but they cannot be checked

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.850 
in the past but they cannot be checked
in<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> same<00:00:45.390> way<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.840> mean<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.710> have

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
in the same way I mean we don't have

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.200 
in the same way I mean we don't have
access<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> past<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
access to the past like we do the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
access to the past like we do the
present<00:00:48.570> because<00:00:48.690> well<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.680> gone<00:00:49.920> right<00:00:50.309> all

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
present because well it's gone right all

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.779 
present because well it's gone right all
we<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.390> speculation<00:00:51.960> or<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.469> best

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
we really have a speculation or at best

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.040 
we really have a speculation or at best
circumstantial<00:00:53.789> evidences<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.360> past<00:00:54.840> events

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
circumstantial evidences of past events

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
circumstantial evidences of past events
based<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.829> what<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.489> present

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
based on what we see in the present

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.279 
based on what we see in the present
that's<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> say<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.899> can't<00:00:58.109> make

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that's not to say that we can't make

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.080 
that's not to say that we can't make
intelligent<00:00:58.590> guesses<00:00:59.190> about<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.460> past<00:00:59.789> or

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
intelligent guesses about the past or

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.389 
intelligent guesses about the past or
form<00:01:00.629> reasonable<00:01:01.140> inferences<00:01:01.710> from<00:01:01.770> rocks<00:01:02.190> or

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
form reasonable inferences from rocks or

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.920 
form reasonable inferences from rocks or
fossils<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> present<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.750> certainly

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
fossils in the present but we certainly

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.929 
fossils in the present but we certainly
cannot<00:01:04.379> directly<00:01:04.890> test<00:01:05.220> our<00:01:05.400> conclusions

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
cannot directly test our conclusions

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.390 
cannot directly test our conclusions
because<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.390> cannot<00:01:06.600> repeat<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.110> past<00:01:07.320> got<00:01:08.250> it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
because we cannot repeat the past got it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.520 
because we cannot repeat the past got it
so<00:01:08.909> does<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.360> mean<00:01:09.570> historical<00:01:10.140> science<00:01:10.409> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
so does that mean historical science is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.679 
so does that mean historical science is
unimportant<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:11.909> let's<00:01:12.390> drop<00:01:12.540> an

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
unimportant not at all let's drop an

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.210 
unimportant not at all let's drop an
example<00:01:13.140> down<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.740> minute<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.040> take

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
example down here for a minute and take

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
example down here for a minute and take

was<00:01:31.049> true<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.799> how<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.430> test<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.820> well

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
was true but how do we test it well

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
was true but how do we test it well
applying<00:01:34.020> observational<00:01:34.799> science<00:01:35.040> we<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
applying observational science we can of

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.640 
applying observational science we can of
course<00:01:35.729> observe<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.689> Eiffel<00:01:36.990> Tower<00:01:37.020> any<00:01:37.290> time

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
course observe the Eiffel Tower any time

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.469 
course observe the Eiffel Tower any time
we're<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.920> Paris<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> present

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
we're in Paris it's here in the present

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.480 
we're in Paris it's here in the present
then<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.409> continue<00:01:40.860> by<00:01:40.979> testing<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
then we can continue by testing the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.069 
then we can continue by testing the
height<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.970> comparing<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.540> all<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.930> other

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
height and comparing it to all the other

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749 
height and comparing it to all the other
structures<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.619> Paris<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.070> confirm<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
structures in Paris and confirm the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.210 
structures in Paris and confirm the
claim<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.899> indeed<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.829> tallest

science<00:02:59.670> does<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.480> confirm<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.990> Bible<00:03:01.320> yes

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
science does it confirm the Bible yes

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.710 
science does it confirm the Bible yes
and<00:03:02.160> what's<00:03:02.730> extremely<00:03:03.270> important<00:03:03.630> to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
and what's extremely important to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.320 
and what's extremely important to
realize<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.740> observable<00:03:05.370> fact<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:06.209> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
realize is the observable fact that the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.870 
realize is the observable fact that the
universe<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.990> logical<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.770> orderly<00:03:08.430> that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
universe is logical and orderly that

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.490 
universe is logical and orderly that
makes<00:03:09.090> sense<00:03:09.300> only<00:03:09.540> if<00:03:09.750> its<00:03:09.959> creator<00:03:10.320> is

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
makes sense only if its creator is

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.620 
makes sense only if its creator is
logical<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.190> has<00:03:11.490> imposed<00:03:11.850> order<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:12.510> his

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
logical and has imposed order on his

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.300 
logical and has imposed order on his
creation<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.320> doesn't<00:03:13.650> make<00:03:13.709> sense<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:14.070> all<00:03:14.130> at

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
creation it doesn't make sense of all at

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.770 
creation it doesn't make sense of all at
the<00:03:14.400> universe<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.850> just<00:03:15.000> an<00:03:15.090> accident<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
the universe is just an accident of a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.590 
the universe is just an accident of a
big<00:03:15.959> explosion<00:03:16.260> also<00:03:17.130> our<00:03:17.370> minds<00:03:17.880> are<00:03:18.239> able<00:03:18.480> to

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
big explosion also our minds are able to

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.970 
big explosion also our minds are able to
comprehend<00:03:19.110> many<00:03:19.320> things<00:03:19.620> about<00:03:19.769> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
comprehend many things about the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.770 
comprehend many things about the
universe<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.550> that's<00:03:20.940> only<00:03:21.090> possible<00:03:21.360> if<00:03:21.750> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
universe and that's only possible if the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.810 
universe and that's only possible if the
creator<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.500> mind<00:03:22.769> gave<00:03:23.400> us<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.700> ability

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
creator of the mind gave us the ability

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.880 
creator of the mind gave us the ability
and<00:03:24.180> desire<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.840> explore<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.320> universe<00:03:25.500> it

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
and desire to explore the universe it

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.410 
and desire to explore the universe it
doesn't<00:03:26.430> make<00:03:26.489> sense<00:03:26.550> of<00:03:26.850> our<00:03:26.970> brains<00:03:27.209> are

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
doesn't make sense of our brains are

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.180 
doesn't make sense of our brains are
byproducts<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:28.110> chance<00:03:28.380> because<00:03:28.620> we<00:03:28.920> couldn't

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
byproducts of chance because we couldn't

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.860 
byproducts of chance because we couldn't
trust<00:03:29.370> their<00:03:29.580> conclusions<00:03:30.090> ever<00:03:30.300> be<00:03:30.480> accurate

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
trust their conclusions ever be accurate

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.050 
trust their conclusions ever be accurate
and<00:03:30.989> lastly<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:32.100> only<00:03:32.310> makes<00:03:32.550> sense<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.880> we

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
and lastly it only makes sense that we

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.820 
and lastly it only makes sense that we
can<00:03:33.209> observe<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.780> repeat<00:03:34.080> an<00:03:34.170> experiment<00:03:34.650> if

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
can observe and repeat an experiment if

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.740 
can observe and repeat an experiment if
the<00:03:34.950> universe<00:03:35.190> consistently<00:03:36.030> obeys<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.570> same

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
the universe consistently obeys the same

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.540 
the universe consistently obeys the same
laws<00:03:36.989> from<00:03:37.170> day<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.410> day<00:03:37.530> which<00:03:38.100> only<00:03:38.250> makes

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
laws from day to day which only makes

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.729 
laws from day to day which only makes
sense<00:03:38.760> if<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.269> lawgiver<00:03:39.780> created<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.560> way

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
sense if a lawgiver created it that way

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.009 
sense if a lawgiver created it that way
and<00:03:40.920> upholds<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.459> so<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.030> be<00:03:42.209> bluntly<00:03:42.570> honest

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
and upholds it so to be bluntly honest

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.199 
and upholds it so to be bluntly honest
science<00:03:43.590> itself<00:03:43.890> whether<00:03:44.220> observational<00:03:45.030> or

science itself whether observational or

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.540 
science itself whether observational or
historical<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.959> only<00:03:46.440> possible<00:03:46.739> because<00:03:47.070> God

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
historical is only possible because God

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.300 
historical is only possible because God
exists<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.540> Bible<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:48.959> true<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.470> could<00:03:50.160> go

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
exists and the Bible is true I could go

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.990 
exists and the Bible is true I could go
on<00:03:50.340> but<00:03:50.700> enough<00:03:51.269> said
