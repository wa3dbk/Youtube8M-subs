what<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:02.970> wanted<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.270> talk<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.570> you<00:00:03.629> today<00:00:03.899> is

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
what I wanted to talk to you today is

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.700 
what I wanted to talk to you today is
just<00:00:04.140> about<00:00:04.680> end<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.640> file<00:00:05.850> separation<00:00:06.710> now

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
just about end of file separation now

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.250 
just about end of file separation now
doctor<00:00:08.040> Hargraves<00:00:08.370> talked<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.790> us<00:00:08.880> about<00:00:09.260> not

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
doctor Hargraves talked to us about not

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.959 
doctor Hargraves talked to us about not
treating<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.740> patient<00:00:11.219> your<00:00:11.580> endodontic

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
treating the patient your endodontic

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.999 
treating the patient your endodontic
treatments<00:00:12.480> as<00:00:12.660> particularly<00:00:13.530> what<00:00:13.710> file

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
treatments as particularly what file

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.210 
treatments as particularly what file
system<00:00:14.400> are<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.639> using<00:00:15.289> are<00:00:16.289> using<00:00:16.680> rotary<00:00:17.039> or

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
system are you using are using rotary or

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.820 
system are you using are using rotary or
using<00:00:17.609> as<00:00:17.940> self<00:00:18.630> adjusting<00:00:19.020> file<00:00:19.199> or<00:00:19.380> using

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
using as self adjusting file or using

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.920 
using as self adjusting file or using
stainless<00:00:20.369> steel<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.789> more<00:00:21.029> treated<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:21.900> a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
stainless steel it's more treated as a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.950 
stainless steel it's more treated as a
treat<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> biology<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.119> cause<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.750> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
treat the biology of the the cause so I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.900 
treat the biology of the the cause so I
wanted<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> say<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.010> before<00:00:26.130> sort<00:00:26.820> of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
wanted to say that before sort of

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.570 
wanted to say that before sort of
discussing<00:00:27.439> selection<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.560> rotary<00:00:28.980> types<00:00:29.460> of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
discussing selection of rotary types of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.060 
discussing selection of rotary types of
rotary<00:00:29.880> files<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.300> mean<00:00:30.449> at<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> end<00:00:31.439> result<00:00:31.890> is

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
rotary files I mean at the end result is

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.340 
rotary files I mean at the end result is
treating<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> disease<00:00:32.989> with<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.170> being

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
treating the disease with that being

treating the disease with that being
said<00:00:34.579> with<00:00:35.579> rotary<00:00:35.880> endodontics<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
said with rotary endodontics and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.810 
said with rotary endodontics and

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
stainless steel more rotary and I type

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.220 
stainless steel more rotary and I type
endodontics<00:00:41.820> we're<00:00:42.030> seeing<00:00:42.300> typically<00:00:43.050> two

endodontics we're seeing typically two

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.160 
endodontics we're seeing typically two
different<00:00:43.620> types<00:00:43.829> file<00:00:44.579> separation<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.989> lid

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
different types file separation the lid

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.200 
different types file separation the lid
is<00:00:46.379> sort<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.770> controversial<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.820> which<00:00:47.969> type

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
is sort of controversial on which type

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.119 
is sort of controversial on which type
is<00:00:48.329> more<00:00:48.629> important<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.350> regards<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.829> file

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
is more important with regards to file

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.010 
is more important with regards to file
separation<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> want<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> show<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.390> just

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
separation but I want to show you just

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.630 
separation but I want to show you just
briefly<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.770> are<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.280> you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
briefly what they are and we you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.119 
briefly what they are and we you
probably<00:00:53.910> heard<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.210> before<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:55.260> we've

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
probably heard of it before it's we've

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.930 
probably heard of it before it's we've
got<00:00:56.309> flexural<00:00:56.850> which<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.989> essentially<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
got flexural which is essentially as the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.139 
got flexural which is essentially as the
file<00:00:59.940> goes<00:01:00.180> around<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.629> curve<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:02.460> inside<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
file goes around a curve the inside of

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.179 
file goes around a curve the inside of
the<00:01:03.239> curve<00:01:03.510> Kirt<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> curved<00:01:04.379> part<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the curve Kirt the curved part of the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
the curve Kirt the curved part of the
inside<00:01:05.610> curve<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> file<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
inside curve of the file is in a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.950 
inside curve of the file is in a
compressive<00:01:07.560> state<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:09.270> outside<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.780> an

compressive state and the outside is an

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960 
compressive state and the outside is an
attention<00:01:10.320> state<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.310> continues<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
attention state so as it's continues to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.940 
attention state so as it's continues to
go<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> around<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.140> around<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
go around and around and around that

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.850 
go around and around and around that
it's<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
it's a

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.730 
it's a
such<00:01:16.790> an<00:01:16.910> instant<00:01:17.360> change<00:01:17.450> from<00:01:18.140> one<00:01:18.470> state<00:01:18.710> to

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
such an instant change from one state to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.490 
such an instant change from one state to
another<00:01:18.890> that<00:01:19.520> that's<00:01:20.120> one<00:01:20.500> particular

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
another that that's one particular

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.350 
another that that's one particular
reason<00:01:22.010> why<00:01:22.130> our<00:01:22.460> suggestion<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.150> cause

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
reason why our suggestion of the cause

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.050 
reason why our suggestion of the cause
of<00:01:23.390> fracture<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.230> other<00:01:24.350> one<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:24.740> if<00:01:25.550> you're

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
of fracture the other one is if you're

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.470 
of fracture the other one is if you're
going<00:01:26.410> placing<00:01:27.410> your<00:01:27.530> file<00:01:27.710> apical<00:01:28.220> e<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.580> you

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
going placing your file apical e and you

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.010 
going placing your file apical e and you
haven't<00:01:29.920> developed<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:31.400> glide<00:01:32.390> path<00:01:32.660> with

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
haven't developed a glide path with

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.590 
haven't developed a glide path with
perhaps<00:01:33.260> stainless<00:01:33.740> steel<00:01:33.920> files<00:01:34.510> and<00:01:35.510> the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
perhaps stainless steel files and the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.350 
perhaps stainless steel files and the
let's<00:01:35.840> show<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:36.890> is<00:01:37.190> an<00:01:37.850> indicator

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
let's show is that that is an indicator

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.690 
let's show is that that is an indicator
to<00:01:38.450> decrease<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.229> number<00:01:39.620> of<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:40.460> file

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
to decrease the number of the file

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.240 
to decrease the number of the file
separation<00:01:41.800> so<00:01:42.800> if<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:42.950> don't<00:01:43.100> have<00:01:43.190> a

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
separation so if you don't have a

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.280 
separation so if you don't have a
straight<00:01:43.520> glide<00:01:43.880> path<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.990> apical

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
straight glide path and the apical

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.570 
straight glide path and the apical
portion<00:01:46.300> catches<00:01:48.340> engages<00:01:49.340> because

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
portion catches engages because

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.070 
portion catches engages because
essentially<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.060> is<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.240> screw<00:01:50.570> going<00:01:50.840> into

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
essentially this is a screw going into

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.190 
essentially this is a screw going into
the<00:01:51.200> dentin<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:53.240> apical<00:01:53.600> portion<00:01:53.720> stops

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
the dentin and the apical portion stops

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.249 
the dentin and the apical portion stops
and<00:01:54.530> loudly<00:01:55.570> coronal<00:01:56.570> portion<00:01:56.840> keeps<00:01:56.990> going

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
and loudly coronal portion keeps going

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.260 
and loudly coronal portion keeps going
that'll<00:01:57.500> fracture<00:01:57.710> fall<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:58.280> let<00:01:59.030> me<00:01:59.119> just

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
that'll fracture fall so let me just

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.780 
that'll fracture fall so let me just
show<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.420> what<00:01:59.660> both<00:01:59.990> look<00:02:00.229> like<00:02:01.130> I'm<00:02:01.550> using

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
show you what both look like I'm using

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.420 
show you what both look like I'm using
my<00:02:02.180> lab<00:02:02.540> handpiece<00:02:02.990> it's<00:02:03.860> gonna<00:02:03.979> be<00:02:04.160> fast

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
my lab handpiece it's gonna be fast

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.670 
my lab handpiece it's gonna be fast
until<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.030> was<00:02:05.509> I<00:02:05.750> was<00:02:06.080> showing<00:02:06.229> a<00:02:06.350> friend<00:02:06.590> of

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
until I was I was showing a friend of

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.699 
until I was I was showing a friend of
mine<00:02:06.800> when<00:02:07.130> my<00:02:07.250> resident<00:02:07.700> colleague<00:02:08.709> mates

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
mine when my resident colleague mates

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.130 
mine when my resident colleague mates
and<00:02:10.009> he<00:02:10.160> said<00:02:10.880> oh<00:02:11.030> now<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.510> that<00:02:11.660> forever

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
and he said oh now I have that forever

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.260 
and he said oh now I have that forever
in<00:02:12.440> my<00:02:12.739> brain<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.790> we're<00:02:13.940> gonna<00:02:14.030> talk<00:02:14.209> about

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
in my brain so we're gonna talk about

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.740 
in my brain so we're gonna talk about
torsional<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.110> pretend<00:02:15.680> were<00:02:15.770> going<00:02:16.010> into<00:02:16.250> the

that I lost it

that I lost it
let's<00:02:44.240> do<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.480> one<00:02:44.690> more<00:02:44.810> time<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.290> can

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
let's do that one more time so you can

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.350 
let's do that one more time so you can
see<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.920> snap<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.520> you'll<00:02:46.790> get<00:02:47.030> click<00:02:49.360> so

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
see the snap and you'll get click so

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.170 
see the snap and you'll get click so
again<00:02:50.800> imagine<00:02:51.800> it's<00:02:52.430> engaging<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.940> apical

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
again imagine it's engaging the apical

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.570 
again imagine it's engaging the apical
porch<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.690> apical<00:02:54.050> Denton<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.310> there<00:02:58.490> it

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
porch and apical Denton and and there it

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.170 
porch and apical Denton and and there it
is<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.780> that's<00:02:59.900> what<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.350> call<00:03:00.560> torsional<00:03:01.190> you

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
is so that's what we call torsional you

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.850 
is so that's what we call torsional you
can<00:03:02.330> also<00:03:02.480> see<00:03:02.750> some<00:03:02.930> deformation<00:03:03.560> here<00:03:03.710> as

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
can also see some deformation here as

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.770 
can also see some deformation here as
well<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.790> it's<00:03:04.970> also<00:03:05.120> hypothesize<00:03:05.750> that

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
well so it's also hypothesize that

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.780 
well so it's also hypothesize that
perhaps<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.920> file<00:03:07.160> goes<00:03:07.400> through<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.610> plastic

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
perhaps the file goes through a plastic

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.540 
perhaps the file goes through a plastic
that<00:03:08.440> deformative<00:03:09.440> state<00:03:09.740> before<00:03:09.920> fracture

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
that deformative state before fracture

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.240 
that deformative state before fracture
but<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.790> happened<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.120> fast<00:03:11.240> if<00:03:11.690> you're<00:03:11.780> going

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
but it happened so fast if you're going

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.550 
but it happened so fast if you're going
300<00:03:13.930> 300<00:03:15.160> RPM<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:17.360> suggested<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.080> there's<00:03:18.500> a

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
300 300 RPM it suggested that there's a

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
300 300 RPM it suggested that there's a
little<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.310> suggest<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.270> going<00:03:21.200> 160<00:03:22.100> rpm

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
little to suggest that going 160 rpm

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.210 
little to suggest that going 160 rpm
you'll<00:03:22.850> get<00:03:23.000> four<00:03:23.270> times<00:03:23.660> in<00:03:24.110> four<00:03:24.710> times<00:03:24.980> the

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
you'll get four times in four times the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.450 
you'll get four times in four times the
decreased<00:03:25.670> amount<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:27.010> fracture<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.310> any

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
decreased amount of fracture in any

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.050 
decreased amount of fracture in any
event<00:03:28.700> let's<00:03:29.300> get<00:03:29.450> cracking<00:03:30.410> here<00:03:31.060> so

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
event let's get cracking here so

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.300 
event let's get cracking here so
cyclical<00:03:32.660> like<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.530> was<00:03:33.620> mentioned<00:03:33.950> before<00:03:34.010> you

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
cyclical like I was mentioned before you

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.330 
cyclical like I was mentioned before you
have<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.430> constant<00:03:34.970> state<00:03:35.300> of<00:03:36.130> torsion<00:03:37.130> and

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
have a constant state of torsion and

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.060 
have a constant state of torsion and

earlier tests what they're doing for

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.270 
earlier tests what they're doing for
just<00:03:42.260> testing<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.890> know<00:03:42.980> you'll<00:03:43.130> see

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
just testing you know you'll see

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.880 
just testing you know you'll see

different files I mean some of the files

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.210 
different files I mean some of the files
they're<00:03:47.810> getting<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.200> little<00:03:48.440> bit<00:03:48.560> better<00:03:48.860> with

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
they're getting a little bit better with

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.250 
they're getting a little bit better with
the<00:03:49.250> lid<00:03:49.700> there's<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.450> nice<00:03:50.600> article<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:51.110> Joe

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
the lid there's a nice article in Joe

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.470 
the lid there's a nice article in Joe
essentially<00:03:51.709> this<00:03:51.830> is<00:03:51.890> what<00:03:52.160> they're<00:03:52.280> doing

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
essentially this is what they're doing

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.150 
essentially this is what they're doing
this<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.630> how<00:03:53.660> they're<00:03:53.900> testing<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:55.070> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
this is how they're testing it so the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.500 
this is how they're testing it so the
problem<00:03:55.489> one<00:03:55.700> of<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.880> problems<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.300> some<00:03:56.450> of

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
problem one of the problems that some of

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.940 
problem one of the problems that some of
the<00:03:56.570> authors<00:03:56.840> are<00:03:56.989> saying<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.350> I<00:03:57.530> mean<00:03:57.770> it's

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the authors are saying that I mean it's

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.800 
the authors are saying that I mean it's
not<00:03:58.040> really<00:03:58.190> engaging<00:03:58.550> I<00:03:59.060> mean<00:03:59.480> this<00:03:59.570> is<00:03:59.720> not

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
not really engaging I mean this is not

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.930 
not really engaging I mean this is not
real<00:03:59.989> life<00:04:00.200> at<00:04:00.320> all<00:04:00.410> but<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:01.340> mean<00:04:01.610> how<00:04:01.730> close

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
real life at all but I mean how close

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.720 
real life at all but I mean how close
can<00:04:02.300> you<00:04:02.360> get<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.620> cyclical<00:04:04.100> at<00:04:04.220> some<00:04:04.489> point

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
can you get so cyclical at some point

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.199 
can you get so cyclical at some point
you<00:04:05.270> go<00:04:05.420> around<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.720> curve<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.110> it<00:04:06.170> breaks<00:04:07.209> so

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
you go around a curve and it breaks so

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.390 
you go around a curve and it breaks so
of<00:04:08.270> course<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:08.900> is<00:04:09.080> just<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.410> dramatization

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
of course this is just a dramatization

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.030 
of course this is just a dramatization
of<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.850> but<00:04:11.480> you<00:04:11.570> can<00:04:11.720> see<00:04:11.900> that<00:04:12.080> as<00:04:12.380> that<00:04:12.860> fog

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
of that but you can see that as that fog

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.530 
of that but you can see that as that fog
goes<00:04:13.220> around<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.670> now<00:04:13.850> we<00:04:13.910> know<00:04:14.120> in<00:04:14.390> the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
goes around and now we know in the

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.080 
goes around and now we know in the
literature<00:04:14.870> shows<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:16.609> thick<00:04:16.910> of<00:04:17.030> the

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
literature shows that the thick of the

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.570 
literature shows that the thick of the
diameter<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.720> less<00:04:17.959> ability<00:04:18.500> for<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.370> file

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
diameter the less ability for the file

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.550 
diameter the less ability for the file
to

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.660 

defend<00:04:24.560> itself<00:04:24.950> against<00:04:25.550> flexural<00:04:27.670> flexural

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
defend itself against flexural flexural

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.480 
defend itself against flexural flexural
fracture<00:04:29.170> so<00:04:30.170> that's<00:04:30.350> just<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.650> quick<00:04:30.980> overview

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
fracture so that's just a quick overview

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.360 
fracture so that's just a quick overview
of<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.640> two<00:04:31.760> different<00:04:32.060> types<00:04:32.210> of
