00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
like that whether it works out a hundred

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.039 
like that whether it works out a hundred

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
know but practical aspects as far as

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.770 
know but practical aspects as far as
your<00:03:04.709> ability<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:06.000> just<00:03:06.030> create<00:03:06.360> threats

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
your ability to to just create threats

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.080 
your ability to to just create threats
and<00:03:06.989> keep<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.230> initiative<00:03:07.590> going<00:03:07.890> are<00:03:08.760> even

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and keep the initiative going are even

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.520 
and keep the initiative going are even
more<00:03:09.239> important<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.810> faster<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.320> time

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
more important to faster the time

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.050 
more important to faster the time

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
control so if you're out there thinking

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.640 
control so if you're out there thinking
why<00:03:12.390> can't<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.660> play<00:03:12.690> bullet<00:03:13.110> chess<00:03:13.320> if<00:03:13.530> you're

playing along positional struggles a lot
or<00:03:15.540> if<00:03:15.600> those<00:03:15.750> are<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:15.989> types<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.950> positions

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
or if those are the types of positions

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.350 
or if those are the types of positions
you're<00:03:17.400> more<00:03:17.489> comfortable<00:03:17.730> well<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.180> might

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
you're more comfortable well that might

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.150 
you're more comfortable well that might
be<00:03:18.390> part<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.780> why<00:03:19.019> it's<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.650> little<00:03:19.890> bit<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.010> a

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
be part of why it's a little bit of a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.479

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
struggle you have to be quick thinking I

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.479 
struggle you have to be quick thinking I
guess<00:03:23.730> as<00:03:23.970> far<00:03:24.000> as<00:03:24.299> your<00:03:24.890> intuition<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.070> ideas

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
guess as far as your intuition and ideas

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.580 
guess as far as your intuition and ideas
in<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.760> position<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:30.049> is<00:03:31.049> definitely<00:03:31.260> a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
in a position and that is definitely a

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.140 
in a position and that is definitely a
big<00:03:31.769> part<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.190> not<00:03:32.340> always<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.700> quality<00:03:33.120> of

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
big part of it not always the quality of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.360 
big part of it not always the quality of
the<00:03:33.329> moves<00:03:33.600> well<00:03:34.500> I'd<00:03:34.560> like<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.860> play<00:03:35.010> Queen<00:03:35.220> to

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the moves well I'd like to play Queen to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.360 
the moves well I'd like to play Queen to
d4<00:03:35.519> but<00:03:36.090> something<00:03:36.829> something<00:03:37.829> tells<00:03:38.040> me<00:03:38.190> I'm

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
d4 but something something tells me I'm

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.740 
d4 but something something tells me I'm
not<00:03:38.519> getting<00:03:38.820> everything<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.269> want<00:03:39.299> in<00:03:39.630> this

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
not getting everything I want in this

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.860 
not getting everything I want in this
game<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.970> may<00:03:42.329> not<00:03:42.480> really<00:03:42.630> have<00:03:42.750> a

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
game and and I may not really have a

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.259 
game and and I may not really have a
choice<00:03:43.170> but<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:44.220> make<00:03:44.489> some<00:03:44.670> sort<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:44.940> move<00:03:45.150> I

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
choice but to make some sort of move I

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.810 
choice but to make some sort of move I
don't<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:45.630> at<00:03:45.840> some<00:03:46.019> point<00:03:46.310> but<00:03:47.310> he<00:03:47.400> also<00:03:47.579> has

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
don't like at some point but he also has

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.160 
don't like at some point but he also has
to<00:03:47.910> deal<00:03:48.060> with<00:03:48.180> his<00:03:48.299> King<00:03:48.540> here<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:48.959> guess
