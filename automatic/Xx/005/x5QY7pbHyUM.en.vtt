00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.639
 in aquariums there is a lot of writing behind 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.890
 years developing water aquariums 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.120
 sweet the current trend bets on 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.220
 the sailors 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.590
 for the sailor the good thing that you have to 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.120
 you have a lot of variety of animals 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.800
 starting with the fish that we have 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.350
 good from the well-known nemo to fish 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.340
 very big as the shark would be 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.110
 logically the shark would be 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.520
 large board and then 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.540
 we have a lot on the subject of 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.860
 invertebrate valdés of prawns snails 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.030
 crabs and then what is the subject of the 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.520
 coral 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.520
 hard soft corals and anemones 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.800
 these can come from a centimeter and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.640
 half to two meters high and there 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.040
 around 1,200 species described the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.379
 anemone is the house of lemos that are 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.720
 also very curious animals that have 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.970
 your mouth you can feed them the 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.520
 mysis shrimp Artemia toritos 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.470
 the seabed is a mystery but today 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.659
 in day it is possible to have a piece of 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.520
 ocean at home 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.960
 before you could only raise the aquarium 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.719
 marine in large aquariums but now 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.579
 we can do what we did in big 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.329
 Aquariums in aquariums reduced from 20 to 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.250
 30 liters is enough to have an urn 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.140
 filtration system and a pump 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.490
 movement that circulates the water 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.630
 the first thing is to add the coral sand 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.859
 we usually put very little 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.349
 amount is valid so there is no 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.830
 accumulation of dirt in the background is 

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:41.500
 can clean easily 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.830
 then now we would add the water and the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.680
 Water 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.480
 we use osmotized water and we throw a 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.150
 special room for aquariums you have to 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.640
 throw about 34 36 let's say liter 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.500
 Leave her with a little bomb some 24 48 hours 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.390
 to exhibit good and then 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.640
 we can simply add it 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.280
 directly to the aquarium then it 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.110
 place the filters on one side the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.420
 biological and mechanical loads for 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.610
 keep the water clean by another 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.310
 skimmer or foam door that eliminates 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.590
 grease and urea once the pump is put 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.690
 let's put the rock of normal 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.880
 rock we would put rocks without anything live rock 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.470
 that it would be about 20 days a month and 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.700
 when the aquarium waiting for it to 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.080
 will generate the bacteria since 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.580
 disappear the ammonia crime of 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.260
 water in this case as we already have it 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.400
 prepared I'm going to put a rock coming 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.959
 already with the corals we already have the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.790
 glued corals are cuttings what 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.860
 it means that they are no longer coral 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.280
 wild but they are come already from 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.280
 hatchery 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.430
 the next step is to launch 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.890
 everything and incorporate the light one of the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.120
 main foods of corals without 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.120
 she would die 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.200
 as for fish you can not get 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.350
 a lot of fish is to put a couple of 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.320
 clowns or some bandit we can put 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.180
 some snail or some crab cleaner 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.980
 maintenance is about changing a 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.840
 third of the water one day to the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.360
 week and clean the filter and the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.260
 crystals and you can already enjoy the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.260
 urban reef 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.090
 but there are many who prefer to imitate a 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.849
 piece of tropical river in your living room 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.250
 casa víctor has a water aquarium 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.730
 sweet 850 liters integrated in the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.250
 wall 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.650
 started with one of small dimensions and 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.829
 his hobby was increasing 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.099
 I've finished opting for landscaping 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.049
 because it is a trend more or less 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.670
 new and also aesthetically I think that 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.709
 to have in a living room at home or in 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.140
 somewhere to see it and 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.150
 enjoy it is nice 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.240
 all the species that there are are from 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.370
 Amazonian and oriental origin 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.700
 perfectly compatible the water is at 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.310
 a temperature of 26 degrees Celsius 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.500
 opted for school fish that in a 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.900
 so big aquarium make bank effect 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.300
 so there's always a lot left 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.160
 aesthetics I used cardinal tetra 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.470
 tetra amber 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.260
 and drunkards apart from these we have 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.240
 dwarf tomes that is a pencil fish that 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.700
 is this guy and is also tiny 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.810
 I try that above all they are species 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.390
 small so that the sea breaks the harmony 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.250
 of the landscape if aesthetically here 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.370
 we put a discus fish or a big fish 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:23.590
 it would not be in accordance with the rest of the 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.480
 landscape and not only that have also 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.400
 introduced vegetarian fish for 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.340
 try to kill the algae and others 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.910
 animals like prawns and crabs all 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.030
 they have to feed, we are going to give them 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.500
 flake food is another meal apart 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.140
 of the acre of normally with the dining room 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.670
 automatic is by by variables a bit 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.730
 plus the diet, almost all of them are mine 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.280
 then any commercial food 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.680
 he serves them 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.170
 in this aquarium is automated up to 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.180
 water exchange and lighting 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:57.330
 also has a ph probe and with 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.830
 a team of co2 though every two weeks 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.830
 Victor pruned the vegetation 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.280
 in terms of plants 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.500
 is an important handicap the consumption of 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.650
 light then as I have it at home then 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.450
 I've tried putting plants that do not 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.970
 they need a lot of light 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.700
 mosses some rain some fern 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.639
 crypto colines and then growth 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.060
 more or less quickly I opted to rotate it 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.060
 rotundifolia 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.590
 an aquatic orchard that invites 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.569
 relax and disconnect sure that already 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.840
 there are those who are thinking of getting hold of 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.840
 one
