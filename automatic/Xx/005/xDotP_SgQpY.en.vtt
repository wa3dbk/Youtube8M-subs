 the world of android has created a whole 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.300
 wave of applications for 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.179
 phones of all kinds and one of the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.150
 groups that are most striking are the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.240
 applications for children and within this 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.210
 group without a doubt one of the most 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.990
 managed to make a space is the call 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.690
 pool 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.580
 the truth of Paul's story a 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.700
 pet for the control of children 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.280
 one is the absolute the pretentious and 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.460
 full of sophisticated effects or interface 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.850
 visual it's just a game 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.250
 He is a cute doll absolutely 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.190
 minimalist light brown 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.590
 of big black eyes with a mouth 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.110
 traced by only a curved line and 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.170
 without nose and with a shaped body 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.260
 triangle although without angles and something that 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.000
 draws attention without nose we had already 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.750
 seen the appearance of hello kitty without 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.460
 mouth could have some relationship could 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.240
 have something hidden behind all this 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.549
 history 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.950
 the application was developed by sake 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.409
 and it's available for both android 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.869
 from the google place for iphone and ipad 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.140
 is from itunes and for blackberry from the 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.450
 app world the official page is pop dot 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.659
 me and also has a presence on facebook 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.649
 like maipÃº and on twitter as agua a 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.470
 someone and just that is for a 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.570
 funny alien that works way 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.810
 of the well-known tamagotchis of the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.640
 90's the dynamics is also very 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.789
 similar you should create support watch it grow 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.069
 I feed him play dress 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.049
 as everything happens they are winning 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.899
 coins and go unlocking 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.979
 different levels different backgrounds 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:00.799
 up here all right without 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.040
 However, a somewhat diabolical story 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.830
 has begun to circulate about poe 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.630
 the innocent pet that even 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.480
 he needed our care 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.390
 the story tells that before 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.270
 were released as an application were 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.040
 gathered prestigious psychologists 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.960
 experts in mass behavior 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.720
 to design in a way 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.120
 entertain children to get them out of the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.300
 reality and create for them a world 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.030
 parallel a virtual world that will allow 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.150
 that they were busy 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.569
 entertained and to some extent 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.599
 alienated 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.370
 After evaluating several possibilities , 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.499
 came to the conclusion that this only 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.909
 it would be solved with an application from 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:48.609
 the same virtual world 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:53.590
 the difference between pau and the 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:55.359
 tamagotchis is that the latter still 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.549
 when they came to have a huge 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:02.620
 diffusion today wins them because he goes a lot 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.329
 further because nowadays the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.749
 majority of the population has a 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:10.989
 cell phone in this way the scope 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:12.849
 It is massive and oriented to children because 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.120
 they are just the future of the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:20.560
 society and the more entertaining one is 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.510
 have the better society but better for 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.519
 someone better to control the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.169
 same so as not to spoil the 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.530
 plans of the powers that hide 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.120
 after power in this sense would be a 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.120
 of the many lines that would be 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.379
 driving to achieve that goal 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.540
 other stories 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.030
 maybe sensationalists that also 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.919
 they start to abound on the internet they arrive 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.840
 even to talk about possessions and 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:47.629
 disappearances for fans 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.480
 true does not seem to keep going 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.930
 triumphant and already begins to leave all type 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.180
 of products among which of course 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.750
 the inevitable dolls are present 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.629
 for children and you know a story 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.319
 to share it with us in the
