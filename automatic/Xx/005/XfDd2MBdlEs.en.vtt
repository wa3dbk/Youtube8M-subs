00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
For Lily and Eva, the road of life has
been paved and challenge. But today

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.759
after three long months of training at
Lucky Dog Ranch those pads will merge

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.639
into one. Today is a big day for Eva...

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.500
it's a day she's been waiting a long
time for. I didn't even tell him I was

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.670
coming over.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.380
I wanted to be a big surprise!

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.199
I was stunned, I was in disbelief, I
couldn't believe that it was time for

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.430
Eva, Brandon's here!

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.430
Hi Brandon! Hi Lily!

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.500
Hi girl! I love Lily. She licked my face
and I gave her a hug.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.840
What are you thinking Eva? What's the
first thing you're gonna do with her?

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.050
Love her! Love her? You've already done that.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.190
Anything else? Take her everywhere!

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.840
Eva, what's that say? In training?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.140
That means you and have a lot of work
to do with their, ok?

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.770
Eva and
Lily take to the street to break in

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.240
their new partnership.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.340
Alright Eva, we're going to start walking ok?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.560
You can slow down, you can speed up

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.280
whatever you want to do and she's gonna
walk with you so you don't even have a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.390
command her.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.350
That's good Eva, keep going, keep going!

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.590
You notice when you stop, she stops.
For me it was thrilling. As a mother I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.280
was like oh my gosh this is going to
happen for her!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.860
Over the next few days Brandon builds
Eva's handling skills. Closer it gets, she

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.510
start backing up. Just like that!

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.330
Go ahead and push down and stand up!
There you go... just like that just like

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.890
that. Good, good!

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.120
There you go, that's it.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.490
But the biggest gift
of all is learning that Lily support

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.310
isn't exclusively physical.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.870
We took a walk in a public place and
Eva quickly learned the power of the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.020
social bridge. How old is she? Two.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.620
She is big!

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.280
She's still a baby! It was so surprising
to me to see that just having a dog, Eva

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.880
would really open up for social world
and it was obvious

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.630
today on this campus. And finally there
was more thing to do.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.080
Open this up.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.080
What's in there? A green collar! Put it on her.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.069
Perfect!

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.460
yeah

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.300
See this?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.819
Pull it off!

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.050
All done!

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.180
Take care of her.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.460
Thank you.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.560
Because of Eva's condition, the road that
she's had to walk through in life has

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.280
been a little bumpy, but now with the
assistance of Lily by her side,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.900
that road will be a little smoother.
