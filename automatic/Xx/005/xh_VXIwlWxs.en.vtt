00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:08.040
 speak there galerinha that human and bringing 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.599
 always gta5 once more in the depths 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.730
 of the ocean there is doing those missions 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 secondary properties of that property that I 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.880
 I bought you do not see previous 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.160
 Look what I found on the show background. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.460
 better position here 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.230
 Look, it 's a flying saucer. 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.809
 I think it's one of the hotels they have 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.010
 prevented the game from several say it has 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.980
 from theo 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.320
 about the same analyst is himself 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.700
 play lobby 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.970
 she's one more dick from here I tried 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.190
 explore this part but without much 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.190
 success it looks only at the location of the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.530
 where the map is to zoom in on the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.670
 stop only has this street below I took 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.800
 as parameter and upload what I have and has 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.379
 an island on the left then one has to 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.960
 more or less this distance and 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.830
 More or less, it's a little tricky. 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.880
 too much 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.759
 That's where you're going to find this flying saucer. 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.759
 I find nothing special about him or 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.759
 Nothing line at all. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.940
 close to 100 for a submarine to give 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.820
 a better exploited just now has taken a 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.800
 soothing plunges so only one 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.720
 flashlight and a snorkeling equipment I 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.000
 I do not know but I had the impression that I 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.720
 I already managed to dive with the flashlight. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.720
 before but I do not know how to ascend 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:50.300
 Now let's turn the smoke and the show 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.830
 only give an advance on the video floor 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.340
 Super fast 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.340
 look there work there andrea bessa 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:05.380
 good here she is mine and I want to show a 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:07.750
 another stop was just one but one thing 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.180
 I found in ocean digging there there 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.950
 just below those properties allied 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.320
 where I bought the one from the submarine in 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.730
 one without it, it is easier to 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:22.470
 find strange that submarine 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.470
 plunge back into the depths 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.020
 Our waters are very cool right? 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.240
 Look, there's only one plane here in the background. 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.130
 one more of today's nintendo 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.110
 found it 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.750
 I found this different from the others I had 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.660
 since I'm only always in pieces and 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.550
 maybe he seems to be older no more 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.260
 time on the seabed seems to be good 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.850
 more time 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.700
 If I went to give a forced what 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.060
 I found it was a briefcase and the grain 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.520
 baby and only this 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.740
 This was the desing I hope you have 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.010
 I like to leave you with the 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.010
 mascara
