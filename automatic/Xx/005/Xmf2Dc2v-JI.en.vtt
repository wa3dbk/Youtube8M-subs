was so shocked with with with the crunch
and<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.680> bite<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.250> all<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.459> different

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
and the bite and all the different

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.130 
and the bite and all the different
flavors<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.269> fact<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.720> it's

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
flavors and the fact that is it's

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.899 
flavors and the fact that is it's
primarily<00:02:48.530> made<00:02:48.739> from<00:02:48.950> beets<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:49.489> even<00:02:49.790> when<00:02:49.849> I

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
primarily made from beets so even when I

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.750 
primarily made from beets so even when I
bit<00:02:50.150> into<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:51.019> had<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.409> medium<00:02:51.860> rare<00:02:52.340> look

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
bit into it it had that medium rare look

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.509 
bit into it it had that medium rare look
to<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.150> as<00:02:53.269> well<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.450> was<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.170> enticed<00:02:54.860> by<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.129> by

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
to it as well I was so enticed by the by

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.520 
to it as well I was so enticed by the by
the<00:02:55.549> texture<00:02:56.000> flavor<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.510> even<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.780> look<00:02:57.409> of

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
the texture flavor and even the look of

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.350 
the texture flavor and even the look of
it<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.739> was<00:02:57.829> fantastic<00:02:57.980> being<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.090> it<00:02:59.239> was<00:02:59.329> a

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
it it was fantastic being that it was a

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.780 
it it was fantastic being that it was a
counter<00:02:59.720> ordering<00:03:00.110> system<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.250> felt<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
counter ordering system so I felt the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.660 
counter ordering system so I felt the
necessity<00:03:01.909> to<00:03:02.299> order<00:03:02.629> something<00:03:03.079> that<00:03:03.379> was

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
necessity to order something that was

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.800 
necessity to order something that was
something<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.790> were<00:03:04.909> order<00:03:05.150> from<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.540> counter

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
something you were order from a counter

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.569 
something you were order from a counter

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
so I ordered the spicy buffalo bites as

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.240 
so I ordered the spicy buffalo bites as
well<00:03:07.760> which<00:03:08.659> were<00:03:08.840> really<00:03:09.530> interesting<00:03:10.129> and
