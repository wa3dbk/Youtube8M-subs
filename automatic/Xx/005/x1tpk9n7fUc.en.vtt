00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.820
 welcome to gone here I bring you this 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.010
 departure of the cotes nasser water event 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.360
 nasser if it's the new end-of-event 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.630
 week the years of war 3 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.300
 what it consists of is king of the hill alone 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.590
 is born is a very hardcore mode like os 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.770
 you can imagine there are some revolts 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.260
 infinite and good I bring you this game 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.020
 which is very cool for you to see the 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.680
 event and if you like you can play it but 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.330
 we would be a game that is 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.370
 amazing and the truth that is very 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.710
 fun and just being born as there is a 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.020
 little less than general water in general 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.210
 and good very good so good I'll go 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.309
 commenting a bit the play is king 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.370
 from the normal hill just just 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.370
 we have the laser and the gun is worth and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.379
 good as always you have to go take the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.829
 ring and others have seen the beginning 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.980
 of the game 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.229
 I get a little bit sick because I'm going to go 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.630
 to support by the ring directly and it's 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.000
 a bit kamikaze but you have to break the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.710
 ring and you see that I have broken a king 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.159
 from the hill the important thing is the ring 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.220
 not how many times you die and all this well 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.340
 what good you see is how it has been 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.570
 see there a little bit is is a group of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.299
 five people what we have in the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.280
 enemy team but good we are good 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.759
 and in the end we managed to win them so 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.159
 well it 's very cool the game is without 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.500
 cuts is complete so good the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.530
 shit and such that there is in the game 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.330
 clearly see so I'm good with 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.340
 jesulÃ­n or playing and well now we are 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.190
 already taking we have already taken the ring 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.690
 new and good there you see the ones that are 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.959
 with the shotgun because how are the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.149
 shotgun is a bit like a bag and 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.869
 you see the mess that is there in the game is 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.869
 amazing 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.280
 bloodthirsty area that stays in the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.549
 floor full of blood everything here is a 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.840
 little wild this mode is very a sac and 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.970
 well, we are protecting the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.509
 ring as I tell you in this kind of 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.610
 games you always have to go 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.590
 trying to protect the ring and the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.239
 ring the important thing is how to employ the 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.010
 Lord of the Rings' a ring for 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.799
 dominate them all, because that's all 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.510
 ring and ring the important thing good 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.870
 there I see that one comes from behind so 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.270
 I will try to pick you up 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.110
 the ones that would be there good it seems that I 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.140
 I will save but not 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.180
 so good 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.870
 good and what are you going we are going again 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.870
 for the ring 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.900
 the truth is that it is I would recommend that 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.319
 try the mode because it is really 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.349
 cool and the truth is that they would be very 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.640
 cool and it 's very good and good there has been 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.420
 finished the last ring they have caught 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.370
 the enemy team this last bit and 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.550
 well there a headshot with is more is very 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.550
 pimp 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.540
 and well we are already reaching 150 points 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.590
 the games are 210 points and one 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.560
 round so you have to apply yourself thoroughly 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.480
 for the round so well there you go 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.730
 seeing how how the 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.230
 people and with the pots the savages that 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.440
 they ride there is amazing 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.080
 would be monkeys is a game very a sac 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.720
 and this is the truth that very cool to me not 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.280
 it convinced me a lot but it did not convince me 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.420
 much the idea but when you enter and try 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.700
 I like a little game pretty good 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.310
 there I have stolen a partner without wanting 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.819
 I'm sorry 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.319
 and well, it's almost finished, let's go 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.290
 see if we catch is the last ring for 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.880
 those few genocidal points and good and 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.200
 You see that we are all going to sack and with 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.860
 links you can already imagine the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.420
 results there you are going to see it look 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.310
 Look, people jump through the air, there's no 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.459
 there's no time we go there I got into the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.630
 ring to break it my career a couple 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.519
 good but there since there is good what 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.310
 important is it breaks the ring so that 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.920
 they do not surpass us in points 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.319
 there we see a little bit is a child 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.330
 and good again to the load and quickie to 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.640
 see why the ring they have and 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.319
 and let's go quickly to see if 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.319
 we can take what was very cool 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.500
 It is complicated because they are all very 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.910
 tucked and as they are a grupete of 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.930
 people can also be a little more 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.940
 coordinated 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.789
 and it looks like that ring has it 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.229
 a bit empowered there is bis that is already 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.850
 little time for the ring so what 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.259
 what I'm going to do is wait a little bit 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.810
 to see where the next one comes from and 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:42.070
 let's just go to catch him is 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.070
 up there so I 'm going to put 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.550
 and well there we are going to take it no longer 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.009
 there are practically 20 good points already 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.699
 we do not have 8 left 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.919
 is very little is 210 as I said and 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.529
 well I hope that the part of the event will 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.629
 like here you can see it and if you like it 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.119
 do not hesitate to try it before it 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:07.020
 finish so nothing a little hello and we 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:07.020
 See you later
