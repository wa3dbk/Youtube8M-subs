then coming to your base including
strong<00:01:45.950> ones<00:01:47.650> and<00:01:48.730> now<00:01:49.730> i<00:01:50.120> created<00:01:50.570> my<00:01:50.600> orb<00:01:50.930> and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
strong ones and now i created my orb and

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.950 
strong ones and now i created my orb and
once<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:52.700> frozen<00:01:53.060> there's<00:01:53.570> no<00:01:53.750> danger

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
once that frozen there's no danger

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.920 
once that frozen there's no danger
anymore<00:01:57.430> so<00:01:58.430> once<00:01:58.790> my<00:01:58.970> monument<00:01:59.360> is<00:01:59.450> done<00:01:59.660> I

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
anymore so once my monument is done I

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.530 
anymore so once my monument is done I
first<00:02:00.560> create<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:00.950> result<00:02:01.400> booster<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.060> ask

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
first create a result booster and ask

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.040 
first create a result booster and ask
that<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:03.110> stone<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:03.920> torment<00:02:04.280> which<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.930> think

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
that a stone of torment which is I think

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.770 
that a stone of torment which is I think
the<00:02:06.410> best<00:02:06.590> way<00:02:07.300> to<00:02:08.300> kill<00:02:08.630> all<00:02:08.899> these<00:02:09.160> units

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
the best way to kill all these units

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.480 
the best way to kill all these units
that's<00:02:11.780> because<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.500> can<00:02:12.680> attack<00:02:13.040> all<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.370> them

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
that's because it can attack all of them

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.970 
that's because it can attack all of them
at<00:02:13.610> once<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.180> has<00:02:14.300> no<00:02:14.770> maximum<00:02:15.770> damage

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
at once and it has no maximum damage

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
at once and it has no maximum damage
just<00:02:16.400> 55<00:02:17.210> per<00:02:17.630> unit<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:19.010> because<00:02:19.550> they<00:02:19.790> are

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
just 55 per unit and because they are

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.199 
just 55 per unit and because they are
frozen<00:02:20.300> they<00:02:20.630> take<00:02:21.250> already<00:02:22.250> have<00:02:22.459> food<00:02:25.209> and

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
frozen they take already have food and

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.440 
frozen they take already have food and
you<00:02:26.330> can<00:02:26.480> see<00:02:26.690> these<00:02:27.500> guys<00:02:28.100> die<00:02:28.400> very<00:02:28.790> fast

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you can see these guys die very fast

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.710 
you can see these guys die very fast
and<00:02:31.370> then<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.700> move<00:02:33.090> my<00:02:33.270> defender<00:02:33.870> back<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
and then I move my defender back to the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.910 
and then I move my defender back to the
first<00:02:37.110> orb<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:38.000> they<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.209> heal<00:02:39.390> there<00:02:41.750> and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
first orb and they can heal there and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.420 
first orb and they can heal there and
once<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.160> eat<00:02:44.280> tries<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.730> slip<00:02:45.000> away<00:02:45.349> the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
once you eat tries to slip away the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.710 
once you eat tries to slip away the
tower<00:02:47.430> will<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:48.380> teleport<00:02:49.380> them<00:02:49.500> back<00:02:52.489> and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
tower will just teleport them back and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.870 
tower will just teleport them back and
now<00:02:54.720> all<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:55.019> them<00:02:55.260> are<00:02:55.440> dead<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.040> destroy<00:02:56.700> my

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
now all of them are dead so I destroy my

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.570 
now all of them are dead so I destroy my
power<00:02:58.040> and<00:03:00.110> it's<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.349> waiting<00:03:01.709> for<00:03:01.890> Vidya

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580

which has a very nice ability i only

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.339 
which has a very nice ability i only
have<00:03:29.280> upgrade<00:03:29.790> one<00:03:30.000> because<00:03:30.420> i<00:03:30.690> actually

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
have upgrade one because i actually

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.700 
have upgrade one because i actually
never<00:03:31.890> used<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.370> before<00:03:32.489> this<00:03:32.819> map<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.910> only

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
never used it before this map so it only

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.980 
never used it before this map so it only
makes<00:03:38.430> my<00:03:38.700> unit<00:03:39.060> two<00:03:39.180> hundred<00:03:39.540> fifty<00:03:39.600> percent

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990

more<00:03:40.200> damage<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.650> target<00:03:41.160> instead<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.940> two

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
more damage and target instead of two

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.240 
more damage and target instead of two

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.750 

so<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.280> take<00:03:48.580> over<00:03:48.880> that<00:03:49.030> rage<00:03:49.780> playing<00:03:50.080> with<00:03:50.320> my

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760

so I take over that rage playing with my
night<00:03:51.760> guard<00:03:52.530> which<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.710> feels<00:03:54.190> quite<00:03:54.520> a<00:03:54.580> lot

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
night guard which it feels quite a lot

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.140 
night guard which it feels quite a lot
of<00:03:54.790> damage<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:59.100> also<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.220> create<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.670> mood<00:04:01.000> in<00:04:01.120> a

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
of damage I also to create the mood in a

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.350

and<00:04:06.790> that's<00:04:07.150> very<00:04:07.810> useful<00:04:08.080> against<00:04:08.950> that

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
and that's very useful against that

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.370 
and that's very useful against that
