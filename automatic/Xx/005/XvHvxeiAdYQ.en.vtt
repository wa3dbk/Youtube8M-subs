00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
all right on to the next thing which is

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.000 
all right on to the next thing which is
the<00:02:14.260> cup<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.360> little<00:02:16.660> tricky<00:02:17.110> as<00:02:17.530> looks

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
the cup this is a little tricky as looks

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.190 
the cup this is a little tricky as looks
like<00:02:18.190> rust<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.030> varnish<00:02:19.450> built<00:02:19.720> up<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.170> so

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
like rust and varnish built up in it so

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.160 
like rust and varnish built up in it so
I'll<00:02:20.590> just<00:02:20.620> use<00:02:20.920> q-tip<00:02:21.370> carb<00:02:22.240> cleaner<00:02:22.390> spray

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
I'll just use q-tip carb cleaner spray

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.680 
I'll just use q-tip carb cleaner spray
it<00:02:23.290> out<00:02:23.410> right<00:02:24.220> here<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.790> float<00:02:25.060> hinge<00:02:25.390> rod

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
it out right here is the float hinge rod

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.740 
it out right here is the float hinge rod
