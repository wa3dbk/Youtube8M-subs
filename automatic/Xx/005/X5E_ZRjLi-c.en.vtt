00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.730
 we are going to use four hooks a 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.250
 mold to make jello and this can 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.369
 use the one you have at home too 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.560
 We are going to use milk jelly or 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.990
 to prepare with milk and this is the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.119
 taste that you want if you want it 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.880
 of colors, you know, we're going to 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.800
 use two liters of milk because I 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.790
 I'm going to occupy two envelopes and what I'm going to 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.790
 to do is to paint it 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.710
 first of all let's put a liter 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.079
 of milk in a pot we are going to put it to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 boil once you're about to 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.579
 boil we are going to add our 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.710
 gelatin and we will try to dissolve it 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.879
 very well we wait for it to cool 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.379
 just a little bit and meanwhile 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.720
 our refractory for gelatin you 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.000
 let's put what is spray 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.370
 I put a kitchen spray on him and he 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.369
 let's go with a rag so that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.890
 adhere very well and pose let's 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.700
 add part of the mixture and we're going to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.660
 leave a separate part because we're going to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.660
 occupy after 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.340
 once the one that latina is already going 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.710
 to try to scrape it a little bit with a 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.250
 fork in this way so that at 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.160
 accommodate the goslings these paste well 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.680
 or put the mixture the next gelatin 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.130
 can hit very well let's accommodate in 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.330
 that moment the hooks around 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.330
 our refractory 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.140
 Once the hooks are set we are going 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.350
 to add the rest of the mixture that 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.410
 we leave and we will wait another time 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.760
 more to set and paste well those 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.460
 granites once you're ready like this 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.400
 as you will see we are going to start then 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.080
 heat the other liter of milk and 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.430
 same we are going to do we are going to add 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.170
 what is gelatin and good what I 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.210
 I did was that I put a little bit of 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.730
 coloring since I did not find gelatin from 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.270
 another flavor then I put some 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.910
 drops of this color like turquoise blue and 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.830
 That's how the jelly that prepared 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.270
 vanilla what we're going to do is 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.980
 let's wait for it to cool down 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.370
 little because it is very important not 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.900
 add it when it is very hot 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.760
 then we add it and what 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.910
 let's do is wait now for 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.700
 set to remove unmold 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.530
 sorry also a very important tip that 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.780
 I will give them if the jelly does not 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.600
 curd very fast what they can do is 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.730
 dissolve what is 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.470
 grenetina and with this they will stay 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.060
 much faster than it was of what 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.970
 I did 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.300
 once it is ready for the kilo 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.400
 demolish stores and it does not look very good what 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.290
 which is the color of the bottom part what 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.680
 What happened was that I already took it out 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.340
 night and the color does not look very good but 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.560
 in the morning I'll keep them or I'll go 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.110
 to record a video for you to see 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.569
 exactly the color that grabbed this 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.950
 gelatin the truth that nobody stuck 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:38.220
 so little was the truth that 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.910
 I loved it and it was pretty fast and 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.350
