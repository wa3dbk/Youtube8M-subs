semi-western however I recommend

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.730 
semi-western however I recommend
semi-western<00:00:26.450> because<00:00:27.020> it<00:00:27.140> enables<00:00:27.590> you<00:00:27.710> to

you don't have to be tentative on that
swing<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:32.750> can<00:00:32.930> take<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.170> good<00:00:33.530> swing<00:00:33.800> at<00:00:34.040> the

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
ball and you're going to get some

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.720 
ball and you're going to get some
topspin<00:00:36.140> which<00:00:36.710> will<00:00:36.920> pull<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.160> ball<00:00:37.460> back

of the backswing now remember as long as

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.369 
of the backswing now remember as long as
you<00:00:46.699> get<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:46.909> good<00:00:47.149> foot<00:00:47.480> below<00:00:47.659> the<00:00:47.870> contact

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
you get a good foot below the contact

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.860 
you get a good foot below the contact
point<00:00:48.620> as<00:00:48.769> you<00:00:49.129> swing<00:00:49.460> up<00:00:49.699> the<00:00:50.390> racket

I'm making contact with the ball now if

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.290 
I'm making contact with the ball now if
I<00:00:57.829> don't<00:00:58.039> play<00:00:58.249> around<00:00:58.370> with<00:00:58.699> my<00:00:58.819> wrist<00:00:59.089> and

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
for a millisecond it's gone so there's

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.209 
for a millisecond it's gone so there's
no<00:01:14.540> need<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.840> do<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:15.680> don't<00:01:15.799> have<00:01:15.950> to

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
no need to do this you don't have to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.270

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
now let's say you're up against the slow

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.980 
now let's say you're up against the slow
second<00:01:28.189> serve<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:29.090> ball<00:01:29.329> is<00:01:29.360> sailing

second serve and the ball is sailing
long<00:01:30.820> increase<00:01:31.820> your<00:01:32.060> top<00:01:32.359> spin<00:01:32.750> how<00:01:33.469> do<00:01:33.530> you

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
long increase your top spin how do you

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.830 
long increase your top spin how do you
do<00:01:33.829> that<00:01:33.859> you<00:01:34.310> increase<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.090> angle<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.659> your

do that you increase the angle of your

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.219 
do that you increase the angle of your
swing<00:01:36.200> now<00:01:36.979> watch<00:01:37.219> I've<00:01:38.000> got<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.270> topspin<00:01:38.869> swing

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
swing now watch I've got a topspin swing

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.200 
swing now watch I've got a topspin swing
here<00:01:39.469> my<00:01:39.649> racket<00:01:40.039> is<00:01:40.159> down<00:01:40.369> low<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:40.670> let's<00:01:41.030> say

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
here my racket is down low and let's say

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.679 
here my racket is down low and let's say
I<00:01:41.240> swing<00:01:41.719> up<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.549> there's<00:01:43.549> my<00:01:43.789> finish<00:01:44.240> now

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
I swing up and there's my finish now

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.270 
I swing up and there's my finish now
that's<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:45.109> load<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.380> high<00:01:45.619> swing<00:01:46.039> and<00:01:46.219> the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
that's a load of high swing and the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.130 
that's a load of high swing and the
angle<00:01:46.609> of<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:46.789> swing<00:01:47.179> was<00:01:47.210> approximately

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
angle of that swing was approximately

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.020 
angle of that swing was approximately
let's<00:01:48.320> say<00:01:48.500> like<00:01:48.679> this<00:01:48.979> this<00:01:49.579> is<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.880> low

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
let's say like this this is the low

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.060 
let's say like this this is the low
point<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.509> swing<00:01:50.810> this<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.710> finish

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
point of the swing this is the finish

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.760 
point of the swing this is the finish
now<00:01:52.969> as<00:01:53.270> long<00:01:53.479> as<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:53.719> swing<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.259> low<00:01:54.710> to

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
now as long as I swing like that low to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.279 
now as long as I swing like that low to
high<00:01:55.009> I'm<00:01:55.429> going<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.000> impart<00:01:56.509> some<00:01:56.780> forward

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
high I'm going to impart some forward

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.770 
high I'm going to impart some forward
spin<00:01:57.649> to<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:57.920> ball<00:01:58.189> some<00:01:58.460> topspin<00:01:58.939> when<00:01:59.659> you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
spin to the ball some topspin when you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.599 
spin to the ball some topspin when you
get<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.109> ball<00:02:00.320> spinning<00:02:00.679> forward<00:02:01.399> like<00:02:01.579> that

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
get the ball spinning forward like that

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.810 
get the ball spinning forward like that
it<00:02:02.090> creates<00:02:02.990> air<00:02:03.259> pressure<00:02:03.770> on<00:02:03.950> top<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.729> the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
it creates air pressure on top of the

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.940 
it creates air pressure on top of the
ball<00:02:04.999> so<00:02:05.630> it's<00:02:05.840> always<00:02:06.049> pushing<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.799> ball

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
ball so it's always pushing the ball

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.690 
ball so it's always pushing the ball
back<00:02:07.280> down<00:02:07.609> once<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.509> ball<00:02:08.660> spins<00:02:09.110> forward

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
back down once the ball spins forward

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.000 
back down once the ball spins forward
okay<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:10.940> if<00:02:11.270> we're<00:02:11.629> hitting<00:02:11.900> long<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.980> have

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
okay now if we're hitting long we have

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.080 
okay now if we're hitting long we have
to<00:02:13.280> create<00:02:13.730> more<00:02:14.180> spin

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
to create more spin

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.150 
to create more spin
or<00:02:15.150> rpms<00:02:16.140> we've<00:02:16.470> got<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.769> get<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.010> ball

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
or rpms we've got to get the ball

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.220 
or rpms we've got to get the ball
spinning<00:02:17.580> faster<00:02:18.300> because<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:18.989> going<00:02:19.170> to

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
spinning faster because that's going to

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.530 
spinning faster because that's going to
create<00:02:19.410> more<00:02:19.920> air<00:02:20.160> pressure<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.819> push<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
create more air pressure to push the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.869 
create more air pressure to push the
ball<00:02:21.690> down<00:02:21.959> quicker<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:23.099> we<00:02:23.340> increase<00:02:23.849> the

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
ball down quicker so we increase the

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.600 
ball down quicker so we increase the
angle<00:02:24.269> of<00:02:24.569> our<00:02:24.750> swing<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.860> you're<00:02:26.099> up<00:02:26.250> against

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
angle of our swing if you're up against

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.190 
angle of our swing if you're up against
the<00:02:26.700> slow<00:02:26.940> server<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.540> you're<00:02:27.629> still<00:02:27.989> hitting

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the slow server and you're still hitting

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.430 
the slow server and you're still hitting
long<00:02:29.060> increase<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.330> angle<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.930> start<00:02:31.349> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
long increase the angle so you start a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.250 
long increase the angle so you start a
little<00:02:31.620> lower<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:33.120> come<00:02:33.390> up<00:02:33.420> quicker<00:02:34.019> you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
little lower and you come up quicker you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.619 
little lower and you come up quicker you
swing<00:02:35.010> up<00:02:35.190> on<00:02:35.370> more<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.640> an<00:02:35.819> angle<00:02:36.209> let's<00:02:36.480> say

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
swing up on more of an angle let's say

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.600 
swing up on more of an angle let's say
your<00:02:36.810> angle<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.140> more<00:02:37.349> like<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.830> that's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
your angle is more like this that's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.789 
your angle is more like this that's
going<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.879> give<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.239> more<00:02:39.480> spin<00:02:39.900> more<00:02:40.170> rpms

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
going to give you more spin more rpms

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.309 
going to give you more spin more rpms
and<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.400> ball<00:02:41.610> will<00:02:41.760> come<00:02:42.000> down<00:02:42.209> quicker<00:02:42.569> so

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
and the ball will come down quicker so

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.320 
and the ball will come down quicker so
remember<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.920> semi-western<00:02:44.549> grip<00:02:44.580> works

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
remember that a semi-western grip works

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.080 
remember that a semi-western grip works
well<00:02:45.750> against<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.560> slow<00:02:46.860> server<00:02:47.280> because<00:02:47.849> you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
well against the slow server because you

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.729 
well against the slow server because you
don't<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.720> hold<00:02:48.900> back<00:02:49.049> you<00:02:49.380> can<00:02:49.530> take<00:02:49.709> a

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
don't have to hold back you can take a

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.069 
don't have to hold back you can take a
nice<00:02:50.069> healthy<00:02:50.370> swing<00:02:50.730> at<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> ball<00:02:51.180> okay

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
nice healthy swing at the ball okay

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.289 
nice healthy swing at the ball okay
remember<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.650> you're<00:02:52.799> too<00:02:53.069> risky<00:02:53.700> or<00:02:53.910> if

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
remember if you're too risky or if

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.449 
remember if you're too risky or if
you're<00:02:54.420> rolling<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:54.959> forearm<00:02:55.620> when<00:02:56.340> you're

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
you're rolling the forearm when you're

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.460 
you're rolling the forearm when you're
trying<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.849> hit<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.150> slow<00:02:57.510> serve<00:02:57.870> you're

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
trying to hit that slow serve you're

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.809 
trying to hit that slow serve you're
going<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.680> get<00:02:58.799> all<00:02:58.980> kinds<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.459> scenarios

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
going to get all kinds of scenarios

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.170 
going to get all kinds of scenarios
remember<00:03:01.040> most<00:03:02.040> players<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.700> are<00:03:02.790> risky

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
remember most players that are risky

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.850 
remember most players that are risky
you're<00:03:03.299> coming<00:03:03.690> into<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.079> hitting<00:03:04.410> zone<00:03:04.440> with

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
you're coming into the hitting zone with

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.420 
you're coming into the hitting zone with
a<00:03:04.890> slightly<00:03:05.340> open<00:03:06.000> racket<00:03:06.390> face<00:03:06.599> now<00:03:07.410> all<00:03:08.099> of

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
a slightly open racket face now all of

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.100 
a slightly open racket face now all of
these<00:03:08.579> shots<00:03:08.910> are<00:03:09.180> going<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.420> go<00:03:09.540> long<00:03:09.780> anytime

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
these shots are going to go long anytime

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.080 
these shots are going to go long anytime
the<00:03:10.470> rackets<00:03:10.860> laid<00:03:11.129> back<00:03:11.400> slightly<00:03:11.790> it's

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
the rackets laid back slightly it's

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.890 
the rackets laid back slightly it's
going<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.329> go<00:03:12.450> long<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.019> as<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.829> start<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.340> roll

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
going to go long so as you start to roll

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.900 
going to go long so as you start to roll
okay<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:15.959> all<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.379> is<00:03:16.440> long<00:03:16.860> it's<00:03:17.340> all<00:03:17.610> long

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
okay but all this is long it's all long

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.180 
okay but all this is long it's all long
until<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.930> get<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.290> here<00:03:19.560> until<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:19.889> get<00:03:20.040> to

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
until you get to here until you get to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.819 
until you get to here until you get to
vertical<00:03:20.609> okay<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:21.030> shot<00:03:21.329> will<00:03:21.510> stay<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:21.989> but

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
vertical okay that shot will stay in but

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.830 
vertical okay that shot will stay in but
now<00:03:23.010> you're<00:03:23.220> rolling<00:03:23.670> again<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.239> all<00:03:24.690> these

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
now you're rolling again and all these

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.770 
now you're rolling again and all these
shots<00:03:25.230> start<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.709> go<00:03:25.859> down<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:27.239> remember<00:03:27.540> if

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
shots start to go down so remember if

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.539 
shots start to go down so remember if
you're<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:27.989> wrist<00:03:28.319> roller<00:03:28.620> you're<00:03:29.190> only<00:03:29.340> going

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
you're a wrist roller you're only going

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.270 
you're a wrist roller you're only going
to<00:03:29.639> have<00:03:29.819> that<00:03:30.000> one<00:03:30.329> boom<00:03:31.069> opportunity<00:03:32.069> right

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
to have that one boom opportunity right

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.160
