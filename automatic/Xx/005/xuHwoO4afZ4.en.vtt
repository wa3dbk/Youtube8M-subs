 Hi, Patrick. 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.939

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:37.309
 it looks like the patric does not want hulk looks like 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.309
 fun but patric does not think so 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.550
 patrick is the sam 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:57.180
 It seems he likes it too. 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:01:01.130
 I would like to join him in the framework 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.130

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:19.520

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.520
 It's like flying. 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.249
 I would like to try out Patrick 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.139
 poor little patrick 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:33.359
 it seems that he really wanted to play 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:41.719
 with his friends only that he does not have 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:41.719
 enough courage what was that 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.029
 Look, Patrick. 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:53.759
 a little bird puppy he left the 

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:55.950
 bird's nest ops do not worry 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.320
 We 'll put the bird in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.570
 back in the nest 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.909
 patric is looking for someone who 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.280
 can put the bird back in the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.690
 nest 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.120
 patrick there's nobody else but you 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.490
 I know the tree is very high patrick 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.600
 But you have to do it, come on. 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.020
 patrick 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.020
 I know you can take it slow 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.930
 ready you got hit on 15th 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.800
 Mom of the little bird is exercising 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.489
 patrick and look who's here everybody 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.489
 came 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.300
 They are celebrating for me and Patrick. 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.760
 I agree 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.620
 it takes courage to do the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.540
 that patric just did 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.600
 I think he already has enough courage 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.090
 to experiment with toys and with 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.090
 Are you sure you're having a great time?
