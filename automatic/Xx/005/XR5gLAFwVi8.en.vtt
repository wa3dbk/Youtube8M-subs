00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.500
 who sees this lot of people sleeping 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.570
 spread the field stop can not imagine 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.640
 that there is actually a camping here 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.420
 inside is what you will check 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.420
 now in our program 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 We are here on exchange on campus. 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.700
 party where it has 5 thousand stalls for 8 thousand 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.890
 campuses 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.290
 they divide between single stalls 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.120
 and a couple and then tell us how 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.870
 It is the sleeping camp here these 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 days doing a quiet saw the problem 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.480
 It's the heat, right? 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.059
 we actually sleep a little because 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.220
 There's a lot of things going on at night. It's personal. 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.110
 because playing and such but it tastes okay 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.460
 quiet and do not get too hot 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.430
 inside the tent 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.770
 ae is a very very complicated type of 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 I can not sleep right in the morning. 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.210
 because that way I'm sleepy but the rope 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.190
 because of the very complicated heat 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.530
 problem is picking up the tent near the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.000
 arena that is quite noisy there 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.550
 also it gets a bit more complicated to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.119
 sleep but the boy caught it, then it is 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.250
 quiet 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.229
 A Volunteer Guard also has a guard 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.450
 volumes also there in the end whoever 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.140
 leave things already once, without 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.899
 padlock I was very distressed know there 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.190
 in the arena and then think that the brand 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.319
 is open everyone can enter 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.240
 understood and in the tent bigger and more 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.959
 comfortable you are there few kisses 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.069
 there is not much space difference had the 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.690
 people had to squeeze the 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.869
 carries the head because otherwise it would not 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.179
 hair but it's just the essentials and not the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.950
 it gets so tight and why it will be 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.310
 that people prefer to sleep outside 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.649
 than in here I do not think they 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.210
 bought the tent there is internet that 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.750
 You are here without 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.209
 Stop the camping tent and go 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.150
 seven days without taking a shower or doing 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.510
 nothing essential of hygiene 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.160
 I do not know how people can because it 's 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.260
 It is difficult to understand why 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.540
 people sleep even if I do or around 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.380
 of computers with so many booths here 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.530
 in the corner 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.390
 what will be the motivation of campuses 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.730
 heat inside the barracks or 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.540
 difficulty in leaving the internet 40 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.550
