00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
your hair no more consistent basis that

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.740 
your hair no more consistent basis that
reminds<00:05:57.219> me<00:05:57.219> I<00:05:57.669> would<00:05:57.940> not<00:05:58.090> advise<00:05:58.419> using

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
reminds me I would not advise using

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.010 
reminds me I would not advise using
grease<00:05:59.229> on<00:05:59.469> your<00:05:59.530> hair<00:06:00.180> it<00:06:01.180> clogs<00:06:01.569> the<00:06:01.990> pores

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
grease on your hair it clogs the pores

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.950 
grease on your hair it clogs the pores
and<00:06:02.680> everything<00:06:03.099> and<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.699> contains<00:06:04.120> petroleum

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
and everything and it contains petroleum

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.080 
and everything and it contains petroleum
and<00:06:05.169> that's<00:06:05.710> not<00:06:05.919> good<00:06:06.190> to<00:06:06.219> use<00:06:06.520> on<00:06:06.789> your<00:06:07.030> hair

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
and that's not good to use on your hair

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:17.070 
and that's not good to use on your hair
so<00:06:07.630> I<00:06:07.659> will<00:06:07.870> try<00:06:08.020> to<00:06:08.139> avoid<00:06:08.469> using<00:06:08.830> that

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.619 

I'm<00:06:17.800> definitely<00:06:18.250> going<00:06:18.819> to<00:06:18.909> be<00:06:19.030> making<00:06:19.210> a<00:06:19.389> part

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
I'm definitely going to be making a part

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.330 
I'm definitely going to be making a part
two<00:06:19.720> because<00:06:20.139> I<00:06:20.500> don't<00:06:20.680> want<00:06:20.740> this<00:06:20.949> video<00:06:21.129> to

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
two because I don't want this video to

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.920 
two because I don't want this video to
be<00:06:21.610> super<00:06:21.970> long<00:06:22.150> even<00:06:22.569> though<00:06:22.659> it<00:06:22.810> probably

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
be super long even though it probably

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.050 
be super long even though it probably
already<00:06:23.349> is<00:06:23.740> but<00:06:24.069> there's<00:06:24.669> a<00:06:24.759> lot<00:06:25.030> of

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
already is but there's a lot of

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.730 
already is but there's a lot of
information<00:06:25.780> that<00:06:25.810> needs<00:06:26.139> to<00:06:26.289> get<00:06:26.409> out<00:06:26.439> there

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
information that needs to get out there

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.050 
information that needs to get out there
