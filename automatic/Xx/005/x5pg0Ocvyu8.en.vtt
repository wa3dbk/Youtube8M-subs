00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.000

 it is here where we are and that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.430
 because we are going to teach how you can 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.849
 do the searches by voice and how we 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.849
 they can help 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.580
 the convents are mixed 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.430
 How cool the kitchen in the whole house 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.430
 then we give a review 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.050
 you are right 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.530
 see being the stay to live with 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.530
 here 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.820
 Well now welcome are Maria mode and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.119
 We are YouTube, we have two channels 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.220
 of cooking on YouTube and today we are here 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.710
 for the woman 'house to see a little 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.229
 how can we use new technologies 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.750
 and google searches in our 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.960
 cook daily because when we do 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.990
 some recipe and we put our tablet 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.759
 ask him 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.759
 how is the sugar glass 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.479
 Below is information 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.729
 about sugar and the then then we 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.270
 would appear apart from some images for 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.469
 have a clearer idea of how it is 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.289
 denominations that sugar can have 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:44.799
 which are enough and that therefore 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.280
 depending on the region region they are going to 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.929
 to be able to identify it better then 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.750
 We are preparing the palmeritas that 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:56.310
 as you can see it's a very fast thing we have 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.310
 the buttonhole here prepared 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.180
 the puff pastry 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.070
 puff pastry flour and water 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.070
 butter 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.630
 If you are recipes American English 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.260
 can confuse the subject of the degrees 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.400
 that here in Spain we are centigrade in 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.120
 other countries 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.320
 and we can also do conversions 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.320
 way we can ask 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.770
 when they are 400 degrees fahrenheit in 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.660
 degrees Celsius 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.370
 Cheap 400 is easy and it would also make us 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.920
 our conversion trains in this 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.920
 case are the usual ones 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.959
 cucumber calories 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:58.860
 16 few calories well since well this 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:03.740
 it's not going to be great like this 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.740
 show me images of chives 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.040
 check out these images of 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.040
