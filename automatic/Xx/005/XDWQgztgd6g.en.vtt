has<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.259> do<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:27.770> wait<00:01:27.979> for<00:01:28.220> them<00:01:28.340> to

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
has to do it and you wait for them to

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.029 
has to do it and you wait for them to
tweet<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.790> link<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:29.630> comes<00:01:29.899> out<00:01:30.140> it's<00:01:30.799> going

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
tweet the link it comes out it's going

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.249

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
to show all sizes are in car so it's

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.319 
to show all sizes are in car so it's
basically<00:01:33.500> sold<00:01:34.130> out<00:01:34.369> before<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:34.939> even<00:01:35.060> have
