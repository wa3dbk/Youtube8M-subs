the weekend before the biggest party
weekend<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> year<00:00:43.340> it<00:00:44.340> wouldn't<00:00:45.030> phase<00:00:45.239> me

but<00:00:45.750> walking<00:00:46.200> down<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> street<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.129> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
but walking down the street if it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.170 
but walking down the street if it
started<00:00:48.120> after<00:00:48.270> me<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:49.430> if<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.579> watched<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.030> walk

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
started after me or if I watched it walk

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.410 
started after me or if I watched it walk
by<00:00:51.539> me<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> think<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:52.680> odd

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
by me I think it would be a little odd

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.090 
by me I think it would be a little odd
as<00:00:54.420> long<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.899> kept<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.530> its<00:00:55.710> own<00:00:55.860> path

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
as long as it kept going on its own path

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.420 
as long as it kept going on its own path
I'd<00:00:56.340> probably<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.360> okay<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.840> but

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
I'd probably be okay with it but

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
I'd probably be okay with it but
definitely<00:00:59.430> odd<00:01:00.410> how<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.530> feel<00:01:01.649> about

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
definitely odd how do you feel about

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.000 
definitely odd how do you feel about
