also tests the size of the silver
particles<00:00:37.040> this<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> very<00:00:38.460> important<00:00:39.030> because

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
particles this is very important because

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.470 
particles this is very important because
we're<00:00:40.350> trying<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:40.890> control<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:42.329> we

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
we're trying to get control of what we

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.380 
we're trying to get control of what we
make<00:00:42.719> because<00:00:42.989> colloidal<00:00:43.440> silver<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
make because colloidal silver it's to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
make because colloidal silver it's to
make<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.719> commercially<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.530> make<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> equity

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
make it commercially to make it equity

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.920 
make it commercially to make it equity
to<00:00:47.489> get<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> good<00:00:47.850> standard<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> have

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
to get a good standard you have to have

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.130 
to get a good standard you have to have
a<00:00:48.960> very<00:00:49.230> tight<00:00:49.680> control<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> have

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
a very tight control so you have to have

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
a very tight control so you have to have
pieces<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.289> equipment<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.879> here

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
pieces of equipment like like this here

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.889 
pieces of equipment like like this here
this<00:00:54.420> device<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:56.059> measures<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.620> the

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
this device here which measures the the

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.389 
this device here which measures the the
conductivity<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.350> water<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.920> before<00:01:02.280> we

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
conductivity of the water so before we

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.969 
conductivity of the water so before we
start<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.530> will<00:01:04.530> measure<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
start we actually will measure the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.740 
start we actually will measure the
conductivity<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.720> here

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
conductivity and you see this one here

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.990 
conductivity and you see this one here

I'll<00:01:12.090> settle<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.720> minute<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.110> this

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
I'll settle there in a minute but this

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.060 
I'll settle there in a minute but this
is<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> sort<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.189> thing<00:01:14.460> where<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:16.200> may

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
is the sort of thing where we can do may

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.410 
is the sort of thing where we can do may
have<00:01:17.159> other<00:01:17.310> instruments<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.090> which<00:01:18.270> I've

just<00:01:18.450> done<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.080> any<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> mine<00:01:20.420> we<00:01:21.420> can

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
just done have any out of mine we can

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.540 
just done have any out of mine we can
make

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
make

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.270 
make
thank<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.670> conductivity<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:26.040> water<00:01:27.040> gold

thank the conductivity of the water gold

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.890 
thank the conductivity of the water gold
or<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.610> silver<00:01:27.730> before<00:01:28.120> we<00:01:28.360> start<00:01:28.630> we<00:01:28.750> also

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
or the silver before we start we also

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.660 
or the silver before we start we also
take<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.440> temperature<00:01:29.920> which<00:01:30.100> is<00:01:30.280> which<00:01:30.520> is

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
take the temperature which is which is

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.480 
take the temperature which is which is
pretty<00:01:30.910> interesting<00:01:31.260> and<00:01:32.260> of<00:01:32.380> course<00:01:32.620> we<00:01:32.920> yeah

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
pretty interesting and of course we yeah

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.460 
pretty interesting and of course we yeah
we<00:01:33.730> then<00:01:34.090> know<00:01:34.300> what<00:01:34.330> we're<00:01:34.690> starting<00:01:34.930> with<00:01:35.140> we

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
we then know what we're starting with we

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.980 
we then know what we're starting with we
also<00:01:36.120> have<00:01:37.120> this<00:01:37.240> little<00:01:37.300> instrument<00:01:37.960> here

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
also have this little instrument here

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.860 
also have this little instrument here
which<00:01:38.500> tests<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.010> pipes<00:01:39.760> their<00:01:40.360> conductivity

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
which tests the pipes their conductivity

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.420 
which tests the pipes their conductivity
so<00:01:41.290> we<00:01:41.410> also<00:01:42.030> check<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.650> so<00:01:44.650> now<00:01:44.800> we<00:01:44.860> but<00:01:45.100> the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
so we also check that so now we but the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.290 
so we also check that so now we but the
conductivity<00:01:45.970> we've<00:01:46.540> got<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.880> acidity<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.640> we

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
conductivity we've got the acidity so we

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.140 
conductivity we've got the acidity so we
have<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.540> starting<00:01:53.110> point<00:01:53.320> so<00:01:53.740> we<00:01:54.490> take<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.940> to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
have a starting point so we take that to

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.030 
have a starting point so we take that to
be<00:01:55.180> take<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:56.050> very<00:01:56.350> very<00:01:56.560> pure<00:01:57.010> water

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
be take the that very very pure water

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.020 
be take the that very very pure water
and<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.119> water<00:01:58.390> is<00:01:59.400> very<00:02:00.400> carefully

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
and this water is very carefully

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.420 
and this water is very carefully
selected<00:02:01.210> with<00:02:01.780> very<00:02:02.170> very<00:02:02.500> it's<00:02:03.190> been

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
selected with very very it's been

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.490 
selected with very very it's been
distilled<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.360> it's<00:02:04.570> been<00:02:04.810> filtered<00:02:05.170> and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
distilled and it's been filtered and

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.130 
distilled and it's been filtered and
there's<00:02:06.190> very<00:02:06.759> little<00:02:07.090> impurities<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.869> it<00:02:07.990> so

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
there's very little impurities in it so

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.050 
there's very little impurities in it so
let<00:02:08.350> me<00:02:08.380> take<00:02:08.649> this<00:02:08.890> water<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.340> we<00:02:09.459> put<00:02:09.670> across

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
let me take this water and we put across

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.810 
let me take this water and we put across
to<00:02:10.360> one<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.860> generators<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.310> more

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
commercial type generators and you can

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.410 
commercial type generators and you can
see<00:02:16.600> here<00:02:16.870> there's<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.140> battery<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.730> six<00:02:18.730> to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
see here there's a battery of six to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.840 
see here there's a battery of six to
leave<00:02:19.630> out<00:02:19.810> beakers<00:02:20.560> full<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.190> water<00:02:21.400> and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.610 

we're<00:02:24.850> actually<00:02:25.120> now<00:02:25.660> starting<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.140> make<00:02:26.380> a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
we're actually now starting to make a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.880 
we're actually now starting to make a
little<00:02:26.920> silver<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.410> process

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
little silver this is the the process

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.759 
little silver this is the the process
where<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.400> see<00:02:30.670> there's<00:02:30.970> two<00:02:31.530> very<00:02:32.530> very

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
where you can see there's two very very

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.979 
where you can see there's two very very
pure<00:02:33.040> silver<00:02:33.550> rods<00:02:33.700> with<00:02:34.030> but<00:02:34.360> very<00:02:34.570> little

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
pure silver rods with but very little

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.060 
pure silver rods with but very little
impurities<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.739> it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
impurities in it

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.060 
impurities in it
this<00:02:36.730> still<00:02:37.000> were<00:02:37.090> actually<00:02:37.420> tested<00:02:37.840> at<00:02:38.070> 99.9

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
this still were actually tested at 99.9

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.060 
this still were actually tested at 99.9
on<00:02:39.280> eight<00:02:39.519> percent<00:02:39.970> pure<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:40.620> know<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.680> learn<00:02:42.040> a

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
on eight percent pure I know you learn a

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.949 
on eight percent pure I know you learn a
lot<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.580> websites<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:43.239> people<00:02:43.510> have<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
lot of the websites that people have the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.979 
lot of the websites that people have the
silver<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.350> this<00:02:44.500> quality<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:45.220> don't<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.810> they

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
silver of this quality I don't but they

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.750 
silver of this quality I don't but they
copy<00:02:47.260> us<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.830> try<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.070> say<00:02:48.370> they<00:02:48.519> have

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
copy us and I try to say they have

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.990 
copy us and I try to say they have
because<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.090> silver<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.780> very<00:02:49.810> respectful

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
because that silver is very respectful

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.420 
because that silver is very respectful
alright<00:02:52.680> okay<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:53.709> then<00:02:54.160> we<00:02:54.250> have<00:02:54.400> a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
alright okay so then we have a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.880 
alright okay so then we have a
combination<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.390> very<00:02:55.810> pure<00:02:56.140> silver<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
combination of the very pure silver the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.940 
combination of the very pure silver the
very<00:02:57.760> pure<00:02:58.060> water<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.750> very<00:02:59.500> accurate

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
very pure water and very accurate

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.039 
very pure water and very accurate
control<00:03:00.160> of<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.790> voltage<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.450> current<00:03:01.690> list

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
control of the voltage the current list

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.350 
control of the voltage the current list
sort<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.380> thing<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.519> timing<00:03:04.090> is<00:03:04.120> critical

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
sort of thing and the timing is critical

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.170 
sort of thing and the timing is critical
and<00:03:05.049> we<00:03:05.560> measure<00:03:06.010> we<00:03:06.220> measure<00:03:06.250> all<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.910> time

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
and we measure we measure all the time

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.720 
and we measure we measure all the time
we<00:03:07.390> actually<00:03:07.420> take<00:03:08.310> recordings<00:03:09.310> at<00:03:09.519> least

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
we actually take recordings at least

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.970 
we actually take recordings at least
every<00:03:10.030> 10<00:03:10.360> minutes<00:03:10.680> during<00:03:11.680> this

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
every 10 minutes during this

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.860 
every 10 minutes during this
experimental<00:03:12.430> process<00:03:13.239> so<00:03:13.420> we<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.660> develop

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
experimental process so we can develop

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.330 
experimental process so we can develop
up<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.350> stage<00:03:14.620> where<00:03:14.890> then<00:03:15.070> we<00:03:15.190> can

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
up to the stage where then we can

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.950 
up to the stage where then we can
properly<00:03:15.670> say<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:17.049> we<00:03:17.170> have<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.410> good<00:03:17.680> call

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
properly say that we have a good call

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.460 
properly say that we have a good call
little<00:03:18.500> silver<00:03:19.300> quick<00:03:20.300> test<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.050> various

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
little silver quick test is the various

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.640 
little silver quick test is the various
lasers<00:03:22.070> laser<00:03:22.700> lights<00:03:23.090> we<00:03:23.360> can<00:03:23.540> we<00:03:24.200> can<00:03:24.410> shine

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
lasers laser lights we can we can shine

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.410 
lasers laser lights we can we can shine
laser<00:03:24.980> lights<00:03:25.370> anything<00:03:25.730> like<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.180> make

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
laser lights anything like that make

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.850 
laser lights anything like that make
your<00:03:26.600> camera<00:03:26.870> could<00:03:27.020> pick<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.350> up<00:03:27.410> but<00:03:27.710> you

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
your camera could pick that up but you

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.670 
your camera could pick that up but you
can<00:03:28.010> see<00:03:28.280> this<00:03:28.430> particular<00:03:28.850> sample<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:30.560> can

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
can see this particular sample you can

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.540 
can see this particular sample you can
see<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.070> green<00:03:31.340> laser<00:03:31.910> light<00:03:32.350> penetrating<00:03:33.350> it

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
see the green laser light penetrating it

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.220 
see the green laser light penetrating it
now<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.610> green<00:03:34.910> light<00:03:35.180> picks<00:03:35.540> up<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.900> smaller

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
now the green light picks up the smaller

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.060 
now the green light picks up the smaller
particles<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:38.540> red<00:03:38.750> light<00:03:38.990> picks<00:03:39.710> up<00:03:39.890> the

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
particles the red light picks up the

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.710 
particles the red light picks up the
larger<00:03:40.490> particle<00:03:40.970> see<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:41.240> see<00:03:41.420> we've<00:03:41.630> got

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
larger particle see you see we've got

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.140 
larger particle see you see we've got
far<00:03:41.990> more<00:03:42.020> green<00:03:42.590> in<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:43.340> sample<00:03:43.610> than<00:03:43.910> red

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
far more green in this sample than red

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.180 
far more green in this sample than red
you<00:03:45.110> can<00:03:45.230> see<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.470> difference<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:45.920> hope<00:03:46.100> you

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
you can see the difference I hope you

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.760 
you can see the difference I hope you
can<00:03:46.690> they<00:03:47.690> were<00:03:47.750> trying<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.140> get<00:03:48.260> smaller

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
can they were trying to get smaller

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.480 
can they were trying to get smaller
particles<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:49.760> smallest<00:03:50.090> possible<00:03:50.420> particle

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
particles the smallest possible particle

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.120 
particles the smallest possible particle
and<00:03:52.490> then<00:03:52.610> we<00:03:52.670> do<00:03:52.790> another<00:03:53.710> little<00:03:54.710> trick<00:03:55.100> here

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
and then we do another little trick here

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.920 
and then we do another little trick here
and<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.720> is<00:03:57.070> this<00:03:58.070> is<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.400> blue<00:03:58.580> laser<00:03:58.930> and

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
and this is this is the blue laser and

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.040 
and this is this is the blue laser and
you<00:03:59.960> see<00:04:00.290> there's<00:04:00.560> nothing<00:04:00.740> there<00:04:00.980> now<00:04:02.050> that's

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
you see there's nothing there now that's

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:12.180 
you see there's nothing there now that's
an<00:04:03.170> interesting<00:04:03.320> phenomena

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.250 

you
