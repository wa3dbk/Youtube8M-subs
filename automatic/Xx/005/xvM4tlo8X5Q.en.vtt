 b 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.350
 hello friends may love one here 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.480
 Greetings from the oldest city in Germany 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 I'm here in Trier and right behind 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.920
 I am generous 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.920
 pitch of trier 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.210
 what I am here then on this motorhome 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.180
 Treviris think that's very good 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.000
 whole number system that means one drives 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.340
 here at a barrier presses a basket 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.460
 and then the barrier opens 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.310
 this card has been drawn 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.250
 then you use it on everyone else 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.270
 to pay or to book things like 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.119
 stream toilet and so on at the end 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.460
 if you leave or leave 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.550
 want to go to the ticket booth 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.550
 There it has an automatic it purely 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.539
 also give the whole amount for everything 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.460
 to be booked plus the fees will pay 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.880
 and then you have to drive out 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.229
 then this again further limit 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.830
 then push in the barrier 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.500
 on and the parking operator is pleased 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.250
 Already on the next time you where 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.250

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.060
 right here in the back of the pitch we are 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.450
 as well as in the disposal of the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.070
 showers and toilets 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.250
 which is solved very well here 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.680
 this is the one detail for the cassettes 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.090
 Rinse is under other part 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.760
 freshwater ingredients 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.070
 So here we have the new one 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.960

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.010
 Toilets in no form therefore 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.950
 Flood area is this must

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.690
