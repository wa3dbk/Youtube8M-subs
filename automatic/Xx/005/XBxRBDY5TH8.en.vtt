00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.370
 on days of fuel with high gasoline price hitting the house of almost 3 Reais 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.870
 the liter the even passing this value will be that people are truly 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.570
 worried when it comes to fueling your cares about a type of fuel 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.039
 I worry about the type so I see pressure 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.300
 I joined the south 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.820
 a liter mill and eve lord howe né 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.140
 if the consumer is concerned and wants to reduce consumption 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.449
 that team that helps you achieve this goal 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.979
 the reduction 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:34.019
 in the volume of monthly investments in the supply and you have 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.570
 difference on the part of your customer 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.230
 so is a product 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.230
 Of course you can say nowadays is not for pj in a statement 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.510
 ellen tells the expense to be aware of the details 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.160
 what makes your car 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.340
 consumption - 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.950
 in your case that you sell more to ordinary gasoline or additive 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 ordinary gasoline is still the best-selling 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.260
 a tip for you 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.040
 and for this we have here 'professor' of mechanical engineering joseph antônio 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.500
 with gasoline help 9 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.260
 performance of the car and made conomy as additive 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.000
 the recommendation is that the fuel added 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.930
 the price difference is usually small relative to the fuel 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.299
 common it accounted for much better quality products 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.590
 it will keep your vehicle in the best possible condition of 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.690
 operation 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.560
 guaranteeing the potential of saving you will not have problem of clogging of 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.160
 nozzles still saves even with the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.710
 here we have for example the price 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.040
 the liter of alcohol in 99 and two reais of 85 reais and eighty-five cents a 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.880
 gasoline in the case of this stations we are recording 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.900
 matter is 2p 95 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.310
 but when the person or whistle for that percentage supply the samuel 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.140
 good ones 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.610
 another matter to talk a lot with the resident population in each case 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.630
 said that on average if the price of alcohol in this month 70% of gasoline or 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:20.419
 something pays off but this is generally worth the person it is 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.670
 the tire calibration is also extremely important 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.749
 is the role of the young 'door before 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.099
 because it will represent in that my team the music represent the 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.899
 very great resistance to bearing that sensation that we have to the 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:36.699
 pedaling a bicycle with varmus opinion the emptiness is much more difficult 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:40.729
 pedaling in the car counts that same thing he's going to be spending a lot 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:45.189
 more fuel to stay firm at year that difference between a tire 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.869
 and a properly validated tire could be responsible for itself 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:54.700
 the economy is 10% and in fuel but there is a whole set 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.460
 to take measures to achieve considerable savings in 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.939
 average and 12 months 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:07.530
 and today's program has more tips for you to drive legal and at the same time 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.039
 save money 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:13.019
 and when your vehicle is moving you consider yourself a neighbor 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.639
 driver 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.139
 expert pilot 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.689
 but if you do not pay attention to some details it may compromise your 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.639
 financial budget at the end of a month professor josé antônio 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.499
 who understands by car from little elísio in the matter to 14 years you have the 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:33.099
 teacher tips the treatments we have to have the care in driving 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.340
 to be able to use 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.400
 to all the potential of the iasi locomove vehicle with economy 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.119
 - We stopped at a traffic light. 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:42.659
 if you did not fear 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.909
 lots of people when it's time to boot 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.530
 very accelerate any recommendation the recommendation is to make 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:52.310
 speed progression smoothly then we are stopped first gear 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.329
 engaged in the clutch and brake for safety 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.429
 now when you open the signal in your hands 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.929
 accelerate moderately around one third of the stroke of the accelerator 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.689
 make your life progression at speed it is important to note that 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.149
 every time you rock your foot on the accelerator an extra amount of 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.010
 fuel that is consumed 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.949
 to ensure the functionality of the vehicle know that it will not in Kashgar 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.999
 with the cases present for example contagiado 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.300
 many people think it's on the dash just how not to decorate it 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.810
 the serial count to help in this reduction also of consumption of 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.560
 fuel 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.509
 many drivers accelerated too much is the so-called starring the car né nothing 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:33.770
 the maximum temperature 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.159
 in any perfect rotation is a gear shift 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.340
 good 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.550
 The thesis has the vehicle account-turns are a very important source of 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.559
 information 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:47.589
 recommended that the person consult his or her owner's manual 

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:52.379
 vehicle and looks at the scene on the technical sheet which is the maximum log rotation 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.050
 that is 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.300
 in this vote to where the engine is the strongest force 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.320
 and mostly colony so this varies from bank to bank if you look 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.530
 on the map in the manual I found that this vote is for example 3 thousand the idea 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.050
 say 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.990
 in the faster shift it would be interesting that you shift gears 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.449
 with a little above that vote 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.849
 here next in the next march is she the driver 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.089
 positioning around that one-hour voting efficiency 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:23.430
 already in case we'll take another route we are 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.240
 opting now I could be towards the center through florian peixoto 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.210
 the people who are going home are going to work 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.449
 the same block east by the university, I must also be aware of the 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.400
 use of these accounts is not 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.620
 The shortest route is not the most economical. 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:47.419
 and if you take a shorter path more is the tumultuous congested in 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.419
 that stays in the background walk-and-for news the vehicle stands still 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.139
 but also for a very long period 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.410
 this can also hurt economies times an alternative route was even 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.629
 that a little longer and more where you can develop 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:06.219
 at a more reasonable speed greater economy is more interesting 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.249
 now to finish I'm sure someone from home asked 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:12.759
 and air-conditioned car 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.189
 a legacy when I did it now 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.619
 the air-conditioning it represents 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:20.760
 a load the promoter 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.029
 and only sustain 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:26.159
 it will logically imply an already spent fuel list 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.089
 this is it is an issue is not user comfort 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:34.979
 now it makes more sense to use the air conditioning with keeping the windows 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:36.059
 open vehicle 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:40.319
 is this in general this varies greatly to see with profit but not bored 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.750
 transtur cloth 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.270
 economy would be better to travel with the windows open and the 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.900
 Air conditioning off 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.110
 on the highway 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.309
 put the logic there 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:55.269
 I think that this question is reversed would be more economical if it 

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:56.440
 closed windows 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.640
 and with air conditioning on
