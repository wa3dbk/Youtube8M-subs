deal with there's a couple of tactics

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.290 
deal with there's a couple of tactics
you<00:02:57.170> can<00:02:57.320> try<00:02:57.560> split<00:02:58.340> pushing<00:02:58.550> works<00:02:58.850> well<00:02:59.090> if

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
you can try split pushing works well if

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.880 
you can try split pushing works well if
you<00:02:59.420> have<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.720> team<00:02:59.900> composition<00:03:00.380> for<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.739> as

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
you have the team composition for it as

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.229 
you have the team composition for it as
you<00:03:01.040> can<00:03:01.190> use<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.519> outmaneuver<00:03:02.090> your

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
you can use it to outmaneuver your

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.640 
you can use it to outmaneuver your
opponents<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.720> take<00:03:02.900> some<00:03:03.050> free<00:03:03.170> objectives

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
opponents and take some free objectives

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.370 
opponents and take some free objectives
but<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.250> can<00:03:04.459> be<00:03:04.550> quite<00:03:04.880> difficult<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.450> do<00:03:05.690> so

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
but that can be quite difficult to do so

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.170 
but that can be quite difficult to do so
in<00:03:06.530> general<00:03:06.709> what<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.069> recommend<00:03:07.489> doing<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:08.000> to

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
in general what I recommend doing is to

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.990 
in general what I recommend doing is to
try<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:08.480> create<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.200> pic<00:03:09.590> Rome<00:03:10.370> has<00:03:10.400> five<00:03:10.790> so

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
try and create a pic Rome has five so

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.250 
try and create a pic Rome has five so
that<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.180> don't<00:03:11.360> get<00:03:11.480> caught<00:03:11.660> out<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.049> pick

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
that you don't get caught out and pick

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.960 
that you don't get caught out and pick
someone<00:03:12.560> off<00:03:12.650> using<00:03:13.010> your<00:03:13.040> CC<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.700> burst

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
someone off using your CC and burst

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.210 
someone off using your CC and burst
damage<00:03:14.239> from<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.870> opposing<00:03:15.170> team<00:03:15.560> by<00:03:15.829> warding

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
damage from the opposing team by warding

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.940 
damage from the opposing team by warding
heavily<00:03:16.730> people<00:03:17.600> often<00:03:17.989> overextend<00:03:18.739> when

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
heavily people often overextend when

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.770 
heavily people often overextend when
they<00:03:19.070> are<00:03:19.160> ahead<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:20.150> use<00:03:20.329> that<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.660> your

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
they are ahead so use that to your

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.900 
they are ahead so use that to your
advantage<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.950> then<00:03:22.160> need<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.579> use<00:03:22.880> the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
advantage you then need to use the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.210 
advantage you then need to use the
resulting<00:03:23.450> 4v5<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.230> take<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.590> objective<00:03:25.040> and

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
resulting 4v5 to take it objective and

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.310 
resulting 4v5 to take it objective and
relieve<00:03:25.489> pressure<00:03:25.730> on<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.209> map<00:03:26.420> if<00:03:27.079> you<00:03:27.170> can

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
relieve pressure on the map if you can

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.360 
relieve pressure on the map if you can
catch<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.680> your<00:03:27.799> opponent's<00:03:28.190> while

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
catch on your opponent's while

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.830 
catch on your opponent's while
preventing<00:03:28.610> them<00:03:28.970> from<00:03:29.000> catching<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:29.660> out

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
preventing them from catching you out

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.199 
preventing them from catching you out
it's<00:03:30.230> going<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.560> do<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.709> ton<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.880> bring<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.180> back
