00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:25.790

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.030 

yes<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.940> FCC<00:02:27.480> would<00:02:27.720> tell<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:28.860> is

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
yes the FCC would tell you that this is

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.120 
yes the FCC would tell you that this is
a<00:02:30.560> completely<00:02:31.560> normal<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.280> low<00:02:32.550> exposure<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
a completely normal and low exposure and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.520 
a completely normal and low exposure and
yet<00:02:35.780> here<00:02:36.780> we<00:02:36.810> look<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.320> acoustic<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:39.530> an

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
yet here we look on the acoustic and an

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.650 
yet here we look on the acoustic and an
EMF<00:02:40.980> expert<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.490> Canada<00:02:41.940> told<00:02:42.150> me<00:02:42.240> that<00:02:42.420> he<00:02:42.540> has

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
EMF expert in Canada told me that he has

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.790 
EMF expert in Canada told me that he has
clients<00:02:43.970> becoming<00:02:44.970> ill<00:02:45.360> at<00:02:45.630> ten<00:02:46.200> microwatts

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
clients becoming ill at ten microwatts

clients becoming ill at ten microwatts
per<00:02:46.920> square<00:02:47.430> meter<00:02:47.670> now<00:02:48.180> look<00:02:48.390> we're<00:02:48.540> ten

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
per square meter now look we're ten

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.660 
per square meter now look we're ten
micro<00:02:49.080> watts<00:02:49.320> per<00:02:49.500> square<00:02:49.620> meter<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.190> on<00:02:50.400> here

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
micro watts per square meter is on here

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.570 
micro watts per square meter is on here
okay<00:02:51.330> there's<00:02:51.540> one<00:02:51.600> five<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.530> ten<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.010> then

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
okay there's one five and ten and then

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.190 
okay there's one five and ten and then
look<00:02:53.760> where<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.030> thing<00:02:54.240> is<00:02:54.270> registering<00:02:54.960> on

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
look where this thing is registering on

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.030 
look where this thing is registering on
an<00:02:55.380> average<00:02:56.750> at<00:02:57.750> two<00:02:57.930> hundred<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.350> fifty<00:02:58.770> here

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
an average at two hundred and fifty here

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040 
an average at two hundred and fifty here
and<00:02:59.790> if<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.000> moved<00:03:00.240> it<00:03:00.390> around<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.870> could

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
and if I moved it around I could

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.690 
and if I moved it around I could
probably<00:03:01.290> see<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:01.980> goes<00:03:02.190> up<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.460> five<00:03:02.670> hundred

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
probably see it goes up to five hundred

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.400 
probably see it goes up to five hundred
just<00:03:03.180> moving<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.570> around<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:04.080> little<00:03:04.200> bit<00:03:06.410> and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
just moving it around a little bit and

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.180 
just moving it around a little bit and
here's<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.740> peak<00:03:07.980> signal<00:03:08.430> strength<00:03:10.190> that's

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
here's the peak signal strength that's

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.140 
here's the peak signal strength that's
closer<00:03:11.460> to<00:03:11.840> 663<00:03:12.840> or<00:03:13.190> 1299<00:03:14.190> microwatts<00:03:15.030> per

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
closer to 663 or 1299 microwatts per

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.550 
closer to 663 or 1299 microwatts per
square<00:03:15.540> meter<00:03:19.880> now<00:03:20.880> this<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.150> very<00:03:21.360> sad<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:22.080> just

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
square meter now this is very sad I just

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.190 
square meter now this is very sad I just
pulled<00:03:23.340> my<00:03:23.430> car<00:03:23.760> further<00:03:24.600> down<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.960> street

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
frequency meter because it's the only

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.029 
frequency meter because it's the only
thing<00:05:57.839> that'll<00:05:58.049> show<00:05:58.319> you<00:05:58.379> the<00:05:58.589> invisible
