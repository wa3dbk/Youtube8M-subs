00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.429
 hello dear acker friends and warmly 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.830
 Welcome to a new episode 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.690
 battlefield 4 in detail today is about 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 the target value in battlefield was him 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.930
 actually said out like he was 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.119
 and how to improve it 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.990
 So we can come to that first 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.330
 worth in itself 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.240
 skill is usually nothing else 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.039
 as your own potential of ability 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.050
 server to share through the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 own age this value certain since 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.460
 always in every shooter since the beginning of the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.230
 time that was ever published 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899
 one hashtag europe or one 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.960
 gross 1337 hirose hot money for some 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.280
 of which is closed 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.350
 but that has something quite 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.450
 special considerations who battlefield 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.219
 said not worth namely how well you 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.539
 Actually, how good you are 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.370
 just play in the last few 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.500
 This value can be beaten 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.899
 rise dramatically from game to game 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.550
 or even fall though the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.219
 real ability just play 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.840
 did not change at all but before 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.100
 I tell you more about why I am 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.200
 this value actually not at all 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.340
 I would like to explain how 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.100
 he assembles himself 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.710
 I have scoured countless frozes 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.290
 and pro gamers always ask on the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.360
 looking for the one correct answer 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.220
 and now comes the great disillusionment 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 There are no dresses that means with others 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.820
 Nobody really wisely answers 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.770
 exactly how the value is composed 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.049
 that no official statement of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.150
 dice in this regard but yes because of it 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.890
 There are unfortunately also 100 different 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.600
 Theories about this ski I will want 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.549
 Now imagine the theory to you 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.720
 I think most likely and 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.850
 the me from the people themselves 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.680
 deal with it daily as well 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.990
 was told relatively unanimously 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.600
 it is believed that the skill is off 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.220
 the kd sco from the minute and the kilb at 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.630
 However, the end of the story is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.149
 these values ​​are not equally important 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.399
 but with 60 percent is the spot 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.530
 ends the most important value comes after that 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.630
 the film ends with 30 percent and to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.369
 the kde ends with only ten percent 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.930
 whether now also the level of the opponents 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.850
 a role can still play 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.780
 prove difficult and therefore leave 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.549
 I now just outside the front 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.560
 so i already told you that i did 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.970
 This value totally stupid, which is easy to find 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.190
 because of that I find that one 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.990
 skill is the wrong name it is 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.640
 Simply more a trend as you like that 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.110
 last game was the skill in itself 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.700
 So the ability to be in one 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.650
 game is in my opinion 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.120
 after a long-term process with 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.020
 a number not recorded at all 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.610
 can be 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.319
 you can for example a super kd 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.700
 and still a pretty 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.920
 be a bad player if you just 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.510
 not playing in the team at all and that 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.340
 in my opinion belongs in a team 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.770
 just play such aspects 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.810
 how teamplay tactical approaches 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.580
 or disadvantages because the opponent 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.780
 team somehow five people majority than 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.790
 your own that will not all 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.500
 takes into account that is to know 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.330
 how good a player really should be 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.280
 you just do not get on your statistics 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.010
 but play a few rounds with him 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.810
 It's that easy and after me 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.030
 First of all, I am very happy with this 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.760
 I would like to complain now 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.769
 tell you how you can improve it 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.660
 So this value yes I know that sounds 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.790
 For now, not so logical 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.260
 but there are certainly people among you 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.000
 who like to value a higher skill 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.829
 Unfortunately, you could value this 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.570
 not just fade out and everything 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.790
 Abundance is indeed the largest 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.350
 number in the whole profile everyone immediately 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.120
 the first thing you notice 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.459
 That's why I have myself once again 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.590
 Clever and the whole sick 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.269
 types who have a skill of over 800 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.799
 Just ask a few questions and ask 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.470
 They gave me the following tips 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.530
 first games on servers where right 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.690
 a lot is going on 64er server, too 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.190
 48er servers are still okay underneath 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.140
 It should not be more 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.940
 infantry are best suited for this purpose 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.880
 annoying apps such as local 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.310
 metro or gmx just remembers 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.049
 the ideal maps are the many to each other 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.750
 have lying flags and where practical 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.060
 Everywhere something is going on secondly 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.730
 Aggressive gameplay is the a and o 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.109
 Every second counts who stops and 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.940
 he fought he lost 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.680
 but it's not about the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.209
 to be in the conurbation all the time 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.190
 but you should always try the 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.170
 to flank opponents from behind 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.519
 catch points for that 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.230
 team to work and not easy 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.760
 drive stupid kills by the whole 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.590
 time is in a corner and only on 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.269
 a door on it bangs because then you will 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.220
 maybe get more kills though 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.989
 nevertheless fewer points and points are 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.540
 simply more important than kills though 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.489
 it is about 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.259
 to increase the value third as 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.209
 game modes are really only suitable 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.829
 congress or domination if you are there 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.050
 besides many and fast kills too 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.180
 still regularly long edge proverb 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.190
 points other game modes such example 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.600
 quickly can contribute to the value 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.639
 but you can look forward to that 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.680
 in my opinion, do not leave and 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.270
 again other game modes such as defusing 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.860
 or air superiority should work best 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.169
 be avoided right away when it comes to it 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.990
 is going to push this value so I hope 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.910
 you are now enlightened what do you think 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.410
 from this skill value it writes in the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.330
 comments that was it for the first time 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.610
 Thank you again for seeing me 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.610
 and until next time your gremmels
