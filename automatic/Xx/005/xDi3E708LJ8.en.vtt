this game like I said is very short but
it's<00:01:24.200> also<00:01:24.320> cool<00:01:24.650> because<00:01:24.830> it<00:01:25.070> goes<00:01:25.190> along<00:01:25.310> a

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
it's also cool because it goes along a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.030 
it's also cool because it goes along a
little<00:01:25.970> bit<00:01:26.120> of<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.330> story<00:01:26.600> somehow<00:01:27.410> zombies

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
little bit of a story somehow zombies

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.980 
little bit of a story somehow zombies
escape<00:01:28.430> into<00:01:28.760> a<00:01:28.790> time<00:01:29.090> machine<00:01:29.120> and<00:01:29.630> you're

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
escape into a time machine and you're

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.570 
escape into a time machine and you're
going<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.290> all<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.770> different<00:01:30.860> time<00:01:31.190> periods

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
going to all the different time periods

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.010 
going to all the different time periods
to<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.950> kill<00:01:34.280> all<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.640> zombies<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.870> first

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
to to kill all the zombies so the first

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.780 
to to kill all the zombies so the first
stage<00:01:36.380> is<00:01:36.680> in<00:01:38.200> dinosaur<00:01:39.200> times<00:01:39.790> prehistoric

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
stage is in dinosaur times prehistoric

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.940 
stage is in dinosaur times prehistoric
times<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:41.420> you've<00:01:41.690> got<00:01:41.720> your<00:01:41.900> move<00:01:42.590> button

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
times so you've got your move button

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.060 
times so you've got your move button
right<00:01:43.400> there<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.909> your<00:01:44.510> shoot<00:01:44.810> button<00:01:45.080> right

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
right there and your shoot button right

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.120 
right there and your shoot button right
there<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.760> that's<00:01:46.909> pretty<00:01:47.120> much<00:01:47.830> it's<00:01:48.830> kind<00:01:49.070> of

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
there so that's pretty much it's kind of

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.860 
there so that's pretty much it's kind of
like<00:01:49.250> minigore<00:01:49.729> as<00:01:49.940> you<00:01:50.030> can<00:01:50.150> see<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:50.690> the

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
like minigore as you can see so the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.600 
like minigore as you can see so the
zombies<00:01:51.260> pop<00:01:51.530> out<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.770> their<00:01:52.070> little<00:01:52.340> time

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
zombies pop out of their little time

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.670
