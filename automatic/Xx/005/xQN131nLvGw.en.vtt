pretty<00:00:09.650> time<00:00:09.889> consuming<00:00:10.299> but<00:00:11.299> this<00:00:11.450> is<00:00:11.599> just<00:00:11.629> a

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:11.839 
pretty time consuming but this is just a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.690 
pretty time consuming but this is just a
good<00:00:11.929> way<00:00:12.110> of<00:00:12.139> doing<00:00:12.469> it<00:00:12.679> while<00:00:12.889> our<00:00:13.159> killing

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
good way of doing it while our killing

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.620 
good way of doing it while our killing
stuff<00:00:15.460> so<00:00:16.460> first<00:00:16.730> you<00:00:16.910> need<00:00:17.060> to<00:00:17.120> find<00:00:17.450> yourself

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
stuff so first you need to find yourself

stuff so first you need to find yourself
a<00:00:18.110> weapon<00:00:18.620> that<00:00:18.650> has<00:00:18.950> capture<00:00:19.610> so<00:00:19.850> on<00:00:20.150> there

then stuck it on this glass bow which is
just<00:00:34.730> a<00:00:34.850> bit<00:00:35.000> more<00:00:35.180> powerful<00:00:35.660> if<00:00:36.230> you're

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
just a bit more powerful if you're

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.069 
just a bit more powerful if you're
having<00:00:36.650> problems<00:00:37.150> finding<00:00:38.150> anything<00:00:38.720> with

having problems finding anything with

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.290 
having problems finding anything with
capture<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:39.860> on<00:00:40.070> is<00:00:40.310> really<00:00:41.060> really<00:00:41.210> easy

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
capture so on is really really easy

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.660 
capture so on is really really easy
quest<00:00:41.870> where<00:00:42.200> you<00:00:42.320> can<00:00:42.500> get<00:00:42.680> this<00:00:42.860> mace<00:00:43.280> I've

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
quest where you can get this mace I've

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.330 
quest where you can get this mace I've
included<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.780> link<00:00:44.810> for<00:00:45.560> that<00:00:45.620> quest<00:00:46.040> in<00:00:46.310> the

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
included a link for that quest in the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.120 
included a link for that quest in the
description<00:00:46.970> below<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:47.660> that<00:00:48.500> should<00:00:48.890> get<00:00:49.010> you

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
description below so that should get you

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.570 
description below so that should get you
started

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.500 

so<00:00:56.580> once<00:00:56.760> you've<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> weapon

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
so once you've got the weapon

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.300 
so once you've got the weapon
essentially<00:00:58.290> you<00:00:58.500> need<00:00:58.650> to<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:58.980> quest<00:00:59.220> for

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
essentially you need to do the quest for

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.300 
essentially you need to do the quest for
this<00:00:59.610> item<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.540> essentially<00:01:01.290> a<00:01:01.500> refillable

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
this item it's essentially a refillable

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.700 
this item it's essentially a refillable
soldier<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.600> doesn't<00:01:03.990> disappear<00:01:04.050> out<00:01:04.410> of<00:01:04.530> your

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
soldier it doesn't disappear out of your

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.460 
soldier it doesn't disappear out of your
eventually<00:01:05.129> when<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.370> use<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.350> which<00:01:07.350> is

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
eventually when you use it which is

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.380 
eventually when you use it which is
important<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:07.980> this<00:01:08.100> method<00:01:08.550> when<00:01:09.240> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
important on this method when you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.200 
important on this method when you
complete<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> quest<00:01:10.410> hand<00:01:10.950> into<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.310> guy<00:01:11.610> not

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
you to capture souls off pretty much

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.730 
you to capture souls off pretty much
anything<00:01:17.010> that's<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.700> human<00:01:18.440> which<00:01:19.440> is<00:01:19.560> very

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
anything that's like human which is very

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.560 
anything that's like human which is very
very<00:01:19.830> important<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.580> more<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.910> them<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.300> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
very important as more of them in the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.109 
very important as more of them in the
world<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.960> once<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> got<00:01:25.380> both<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.910> weapon<00:01:26.910> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

world so once you got both a weapon and
that<00:01:27.660> item<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.500> need<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.890> start<00:01:29.100> popping

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
that item you need to start popping

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.840 
that item you need to start popping
heads<00:01:29.790> kill<00:01:30.690> this<00:01:30.810> person<00:01:31.050> here<00:01:31.640> says<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.790> the

heads kill this person here says in the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.480 
heads kill this person here says in the
top<00:01:33.060> left<00:01:33.330> that<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.750> captured<00:01:34.110> their<00:01:34.500> soul<00:01:34.770> go

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
top left that I captured their soul go

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.880 
top left that I captured their soul go
to<00:01:35.550> your<00:01:35.759> items<00:01:36.380> select<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> weapon<00:01:37.860> that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
to your items select the weapon that

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.190 
to your items select the weapon that
you're<00:01:38.100> using<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.000> recharge<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.810> using

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
you're using and then recharge it using

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.780 
you're using and then recharge it using
the<00:01:40.290> black<00:01:40.500> star

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.540 

and<00:01:44.720> that's<00:01:44.900> it<00:01:45.110> essentially<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:46.010> keep<00:01:46.280> on

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
and that's it essentially just keep on

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.200 
and that's it essentially just keep on
killing<00:01:47.030> people<00:01:48.310> recharging<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.400> weapon<00:01:49.790> every

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
killing people recharging a weapon every

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.590 
killing people recharging a weapon every
single<00:01:50.510> time<00:01:50.690> you<00:01:50.720> do<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:52.030> I'm<00:01:53.030> not<00:01:53.330> entirely

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
single time you do it I'm not entirely

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.650 
single time you do it I'm not entirely
sure<00:01:53.810> how<00:01:54.500> quick<00:01:55.250> it<00:01:55.670> levels<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.180> up<00:01:56.330> in<00:01:56.570> the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
sure how quick it levels you up in the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.520 
sure how quick it levels you up in the
lower<00:01:56.870> levels<00:01:57.260> but<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:57.880> think<00:01:58.880> I'm<00:01:59.120> level<00:01:59.900> 95

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
lower levels but I think I'm level 95

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.880 
lower levels but I think I'm level 95
here<00:02:01.160> this<00:02:01.490> video<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.930> captured<00:02:03.410> worry

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
here this video and I captured worry

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.990 
here this video and I captured worry
about<00:02:04.190> 10<00:02:05.120> people<00:02:05.510> souls<00:02:05.900> before<00:02:06.170> leveled<00:02:06.710> up

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
about 10 people souls before leveled up

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.900 
about 10 people souls before leveled up
but<00:02:08.000> yeah<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.360> see<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.690> keep<00:02:09.200> on<00:02:09.380> doing<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:09.910> and

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
but yeah I see it keep on doing that and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.290 
but yeah I see it keep on doing that and
if<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.360> combine<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.350> with<00:02:13.300> conventional
