hello everyone it's MHL speaking and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.600 
hello everyone it's MHL speaking and
I've<00:00:06.960> made<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.350> video<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.770> show<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.189> several

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
I've made the video to show you several

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.669 
I've made the video to show you several
places<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.540> can<00:00:09.570> hide<00:00:09.929> in<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.380> where

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
places that you can hide in and where

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.680 
places that you can hide in and where
the<00:00:10.830> bomb<00:00:11.040> simply<00:00:11.429> won't<00:00:11.550> kill<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.059> even

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the bomb simply won't kill you even

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.390 
the bomb simply won't kill you even
though<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.290> few<00:00:13.469> steps<00:00:13.799> from<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.219> in

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
though you are just few steps from it in

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.269 
though you are just few steps from it in
my<00:00:15.179> opinion<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.660> c-4<00:00:16.170> damage<00:00:16.529> range<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.070> too

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
my opinion the c-4 damage range is too

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.880 
my opinion the c-4 damage range is too
small<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.880> should<00:00:18.390> be<00:00:18.539> increased<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> 1.6

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
small and should be increased to the 1.6

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
small and should be increased to the 1.6
level<00:00:20.250> because<00:00:21.000> for<00:00:21.180> now<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.570> simply<00:00:21.900> allows

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
level because for now it simply allows

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.080 
level because for now it simply allows
the<00:00:22.410> terrorists<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.340> watch<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> bomb<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the terrorists to watch the bomb to the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.939 
the terrorists to watch the bomb to the
very<00:00:24.390> last<00:00:24.570> seconds<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.289> still<00:00:25.590> managed<00:00:25.920> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
