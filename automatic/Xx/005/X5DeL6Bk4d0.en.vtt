started<00:04:19.209> about<00:04:19.360> six<00:04:19.660> weeks<00:04:19.750> ago<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.170> as<00:04:20.290> you

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
started about six weeks ago and as you

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.750 
started about six weeks ago and as you
can<00:04:20.500> see<00:04:20.560> it's<00:04:20.860> still<00:04:21.130> putting<00:04:21.310> out<00:04:21.459> buds

probably<00:04:24.010> got<00:04:24.250> another<00:04:24.490> three<00:04:24.700> to<00:04:24.850> four<00:04:25.030> weeks

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
probably got another three to four weeks

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.950 
probably got another three to four weeks
