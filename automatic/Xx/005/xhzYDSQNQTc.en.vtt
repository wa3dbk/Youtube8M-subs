earning<00:00:14.519> anything<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.920> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.070> how<00:00:17.190> you

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
earning anything so this is how you

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.300 
earning anything so this is how you
adjust<00:00:17.430> your<00:00:17.640> brakes<00:00:20.779> these<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:22.310> v-brake

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
adjust your brakes these are v-brake

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.779 
adjust your brakes these are v-brake
style<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.859> they're<00:00:25.859> usually<00:00:26.369> used<00:00:26.609> for

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
style so they're usually used for

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.709 
style so they're usually used for
cyclocross<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.449> going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> need<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
cyclocross and so I'm going to need a

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.959 
cyclocross and so I'm going to need a
balun<00:00:33.719> wrench<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.170> adjust<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.700> after<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> too

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
balun wrench to adjust it after the too

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.950 
balun wrench to adjust it after the too
tight<00:00:36.239> or<00:00:36.829> they're<00:00:37.829> out<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.040> alignment<00:00:38.960> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
tight or they're out of alignment that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.479 
tight or they're out of alignment that
means<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.920> won't<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.160> able<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.370> stop<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> I

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
means you won't be able to stop so I

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.959

right size I have this type of tool and

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.779 
right size I have this type of tool and
all<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:57.859> yep<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.430> right<00:00:59.550> size

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:18.280 

all<00:01:06.039> you<00:01:06.159> do<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.549> you<00:01:08.490> put<00:01:15.990> you

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
all you do is you put you

all you do is you put you
listen<00:01:19.250> up

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.020 

it<00:01:23.690> should<00:01:23.960> spring<00:01:24.260> out<00:01:24.380> like<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.790> so<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:25.850> has

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
it should spring out like that so it has

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.850 
it should spring out like that so it has
little<00:01:26.240> spray<00:01:26.420> more<00:01:26.660> depending<00:01:27.530> on<00:01:27.650> where<00:01:27.770> the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
little spray more depending on where the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.850 
little spray more depending on where the
brakes<00:01:28.070> are<00:01:28.250> mounted<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.090> all<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.080> do<00:01:30.230> you

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
brakes are mounted and all you do you

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.090 
brakes are mounted and all you do you
squeeze<00:01:31.730> them<00:01:31.970> together<00:01:32.740> get<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:33.980> the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
squeeze them together get it to the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.200 
squeeze them together get it to the
adjusted<00:01:34.550> about<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.360> adjustment<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:35.840> want

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
hold it put the allen wrench back into

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.490 
hold it put the allen wrench back into

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
that's not my friend break this is my

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.670 
that's not my friend break this is my
firm<00:01:59.240> or<00:01:59.479> rear<00:01:59.930> brake<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.390> got<00:02:03.260> spin<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
firm or rear brake and so I got spin the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.500 
firm or rear brake and so I got spin the
tire<00:02:05.229> let's<00:02:06.229> see<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:07.610> stuff<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.149> want<00:02:08.420> to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
tire let's see the stuff so I want to

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.830 
tire let's see the stuff so I want to
that's<00:02:11.510> pretty<00:02:13.030> pretty<00:02:14.030> much<00:02:14.300> bottoming<00:02:14.690> out

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
that's pretty pretty much bottoming out

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.690 
that's pretty pretty much bottoming out
so<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.950> tighten<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.400> little<00:02:16.610> bit

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
so you have to tighten that a little bit

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:26.490 
so you have to tighten that a little bit
more<00:02:16.910> so

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:35.850 

look<00:02:27.040> at<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.250> camera<00:02:27.520> stay

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.650 

okay<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:37.480> was<00:02:37.660> hard<00:02:38.500> okay<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.480> maybe<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
okay that was hard okay so maybe the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.990 
okay that was hard okay so maybe the
same<00:02:40.840> thing<00:02:41.020> I<00:02:41.110> just<00:02:41.290> did<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:43.000> far<00:02:44.790> I'm<00:02:45.790> going

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
same thing I just did so far I'm going

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.570 
same thing I just did so far I'm going
to

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.080 
to
so<00:02:48.270> again<00:02:49.730> pull<00:02:50.730> them<00:02:50.760> together<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:52.640> just<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.880> up

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
so again pull them together I just it up

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.880 
so again pull them together I just it up
just<00:02:54.750> get<00:02:54.900> out<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:56.310> going<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.850> pull<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.180> tight

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
just get out and going to pull it tight

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
usually holding the brake pads works a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.490 
usually holding the brake pads works a
little<00:03:00.030> bit<00:03:00.240> better<00:03:01.190> stick<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.370> one

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.820 

let's<00:03:08.100> get<00:03:08.430> too<00:03:08.670> full

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:40.870 

ok

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.630 

okay<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.660> should<00:03:41.690> be<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.930> little<00:03:42.170> bit<00:03:42.320> better

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
okay it should be a little bit better

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.840 
okay it should be a little bit better
that's<00:03:43.640> too<00:03:43.940> tight<00:03:45.100> I'll<00:03:46.100> just<00:03:46.280> go<00:03:46.400> look<00:03:46.550> it<00:03:46.730> up

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
that's too tight I'll just go look it up

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.930
