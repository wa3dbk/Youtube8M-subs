00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
this paper though this paper is it's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.670 
this paper though this paper is it's
close<00:04:11.750> enough<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:12.140> know<00:04:12.200> it<00:04:12.319> looks<00:04:12.380> kind<00:04:12.590> of

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
close enough I know it looks kind of

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.710 
close enough I know it looks kind of
funky<00:04:12.980> but<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:13.580> is<00:04:13.970> close<00:04:14.150> enough<00:04:14.390> for<00:04:14.510> the

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
funky but it is close enough for the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.759 
funky but it is close enough for the
back<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.080> I<00:04:15.110> can<00:04:15.290> stick<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.620> onto

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
back that I can stick this onto

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:16.780 
back that I can stick this onto
something<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.250> says<00:04:16.400> Merry<00:04:16.609> Christmas

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
something and it says Merry Christmas

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.969 
something and it says Merry Christmas
inside<00:04:17.329> so<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:17.840> could<00:04:18.079> do<00:04:18.200> like<00:04:18.350> two<00:04:18.650> from

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
inside so you could do like two from

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.460 
inside so you could do like two from
tags<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.669> all<00:04:19.820> sorts<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.870> varieties<00:04:20.959> of

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
drying glue and it actually works really

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.129 
drying glue and it actually works really
well<00:04:47.440> on<00:04:48.440> this<00:04:49.400> it's<00:04:50.090> like<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.300> paper<00:04:50.540> paper

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
based clay so I'm just going to line the

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.960 
based clay so I'm just going to line the
frame<00:04:53.169> and<00:04:54.169> then<00:04:55.600> stick<00:04:56.600> my<00:04:57.340> paper<00:04:58.340> down<00:04:58.610> stick

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
however long it takes but zip dry does

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.430 
however long it takes but zip dry does
dry<00:05:10.039> very<00:05:10.280> very<00:05:10.700> fast<00:05:10.970> and<00:05:11.320> there<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:12.410> have
