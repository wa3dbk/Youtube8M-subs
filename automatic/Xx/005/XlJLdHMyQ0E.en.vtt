apply that to the surface of the paint

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.240 
apply that to the surface of the paint
last<00:01:44.770> but<00:01:44.979> not<00:01:45.100> least<00:01:45.369> let's<00:01:46.090> add<00:01:46.330> some<00:01:46.570> heat

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
now because we had the paint protection

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.570 
now because we had the paint protection
applied<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.050> surface<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:56.560> vehicle<00:01:57.039> that

damage should be real easy to remove

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.139 
damage should be real easy to remove
we'll<00:01:59.890> apply<00:02:00.069> just<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.580> little<00:02:00.850> bit<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.060> the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
we'll see how easily that wipes right

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
we'll see how easily that wipes right
off<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:06.009> surface<00:02:06.399> of<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.610> paint

also<00:04:29.790> simulate<00:04:30.300> acid<00:04:30.720> rain<00:04:30.900> damage<00:04:31.290> we're

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
also simulate acid rain damage we're

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.750 
also simulate acid rain damage we're
gonna<00:04:31.650> go<00:04:31.860> ahead<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.040> use<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.280> full

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
gonna go ahead and use that full

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.060 
gonna go ahead and use that full
strength<00:04:33.180> battery<00:04:33.570> acid<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:34.050> we<00:04:34.200> had<00:04:34.350> taken

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
strength battery acid that we had taken

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.340 
strength battery acid that we had taken
a<00:04:35.220> little<00:04:35.340> bit<00:04:35.490> earlier<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.350> generously

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
a little bit earlier and generously

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.020 
a little bit earlier and generously
apply<00:04:37.980> that<00:04:38.160> to<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.400> surface<00:04:38.760> of<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:38.970> paint

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
apply that to the surface of the paint

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:50.530 
apply that to the surface of the paint
last<00:04:42.030> but<00:04:42.270> not<00:04:42.390> least<00:04:42.660> let's<00:04:43.350> add<00:04:43.590> some<00:04:43.860> heat

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.700 

now<00:04:51.540> because<00:04:51.870> we<00:04:52.020> have<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.200> paint<00:04:52.410> protection

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
now because we have the paint protection

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.860 
now because we have the paint protection
applied<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.340> surface<00:04:53.700> that<00:04:53.820> vehicle<00:04:54.330> that

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
applied to the surface that vehicle that

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.659 
applied to the surface that vehicle that
damage<00:04:55.260> should<00:04:55.470> be<00:04:55.620> real<00:04:55.890> easy<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:56.370> remove

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
damage should be real easy to remove

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.400 
damage should be real easy to remove
we'll<00:04:57.180> apply<00:04:57.360> just<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.840> little<00:04:57.870> bit<00:04:58.230> of<00:04:58.350> the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
we'll apply just a little bit of the

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.960 
we'll apply just a little bit of the
paint<00:04:58.650> shield<00:04:58.860> cleaner<00:04:59.130> to<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.370> surface<00:04:59.790> and

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
paint shield cleaner to the surface and

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.720 
paint shield cleaner to the surface and
we'll<00:05:00.600> see<00:05:00.750> how<00:05:00.840> easily<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:02.340> wipes<00:05:02.580> right

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
we'll see how easily that wipes right

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:12.720 
we'll see how easily that wipes right
off<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.300> surface<00:05:03.480> of<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.870> paint

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:28.050 

now<00:05:13.270> look<00:05:13.450> at<00:05:13.540> that<00:05:13.600> looks<00:05:13.990> just<00:05:14.350> like<00:05:14.500> no

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.120
