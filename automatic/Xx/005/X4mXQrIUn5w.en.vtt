00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello everyone at all we find ourselves 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.670
 today for a new video the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.500
 fifa platinum 14 hours I have not put 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.240
 long time to you the platt idea because 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.769
 I made my discovery there are less 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.139
 15 days or fifteen days three weeks 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.559
 Besides, you will see it in my 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.199
 videos 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.850
 it does not go back so long then 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.029
 when you talk about platinum platinum 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.650
 it's extremely easy it requires 20 to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.310
 30 hours I think for a player 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.539
 pro fifa it's going to m 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 good he'll put 20 hours I put 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.820
 a little more time because I was 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.840
 more about pes is necessarily the playability 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.640
 I put a little time to do myself and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.340
 besides I have not managed to make myself 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.170
 from next year I think back on 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 pes 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.020
 I was a little disappointed with the ultimate mode 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.989
 team 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.750
 so it's a very good way to spread 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.170
 all that but it was summed up in two 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.539
 buttons it in triangle is 90% 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.670
 matches that was played out for me 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.530
 for my part and also a little bit at the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.030
 connection so I was a little disappointed with 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.829
 his yet I have a good connection I 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.580
 would be pretty regular I have no 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.500
 worry so I had ten matches that lag 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.440
 and then whissell a triangle me 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.890
 clearly screwed up my 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.600
 my ultimate team mode after there was 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.490
 co-op trophies that I made with 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.290
 paulo pato so thank you for your coop 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.090
 there were technical games or it was 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.870
 a bit of a headache I must tell you that 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.670
 I I'm a bit shit on this mode 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.160
 there was 1 where you had to unlock 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.930
 after gold I do not know if you are platinum 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.120
 or will be asked what but I day I 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.970
 had a little trouble after for the rest of the 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.530
 good trophies overall this was it 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.750
 not bad because it allowed me to do 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.030
 really the game in full 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.280
 because there were so trophies 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.810
 really every mode and for that it's 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.850
 the advantage of doing the turntables is 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.960
 we really do the game long 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.740
 wide and across 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.080
 so it's true that it's not bad 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.420
 mode that I liked is the pro club where 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.090
 we take a player and here we finally play 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.370
 in coop with someone and I made some 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 good parts trust me so here you go 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.880
 it's still a good game anyway 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.620
 but it's fifa so I know 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.540
 that there are some who are pros fifa but 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.400
 fifa it's not for me I prefer 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.830
 my pes then y'en who will shoot me 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.989
 on it but never mind, so here I am 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.570
 kisses I leave you with the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.550
 delivers the little sound on which form 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.680
 as usual I tell you very well 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.450
 very little I leave you my new 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.780
 stream in the description I'm doing 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.170
 kisses 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.170
 ciao
