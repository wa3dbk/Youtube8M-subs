who knows anyway

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.350 
who knows anyway
there<00:00:30.599> she<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.900> pretty<00:00:31.349> nice<00:00:32.180> start<00:00:33.180> with

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
there she is pretty nice start with

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.030 
there she is pretty nice start with
sanding<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:34.140> right<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> decided<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
sanding all right I decided that it

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.500 
sanding all right I decided that it
would<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.250> easier<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.760> took<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.120> roof<00:00:36.270> off

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
would be easier if I took the roof off

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.209 
would be easier if I took the roof off
was<00:00:36.780> pretty<00:00:36.989> easy<00:00:37.110> couple<00:00:37.530> screws<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> then

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
was pretty easy couple screws and then

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.310 
was pretty easy couple screws and then
the<00:00:38.850> front<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.270> kind<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.540> fit<00:00:39.960> into<00:00:40.140> these

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the front just kind of fit into these

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.700 
the front just kind of fit into these
tabs<00:00:41.100> mechanically<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.090> came<00:00:42.329> off<00:00:42.540> super<00:00:43.410> easy

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
tabs mechanically it came off super easy

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.830 
tabs mechanically it came off super easy
I've<00:00:44.219> scuffed<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.969> 600<00:00:45.570> grit

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
