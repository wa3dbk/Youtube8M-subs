00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 that's like guys it's just 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.009
 back on my chair why does that want 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.450
 say mercato show but a mercato show 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.500
 special we will talk about mercato 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.790
 so I do not even have why that would be 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.950
 not the mercato show this video but 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.780
 it's not here it was for you to see 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.190
 that basically I'm talking to you so I 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.139
 wanted to make a small assessment of copa 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.740
 america from my team so from 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.210
 Argentina 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.770
 when you know it I was very disappointed 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.480
 we lost in the final it's normal 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.240
 as everyone was disappointed as I was 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.490
 disappointed in the final in 2006 against France has 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.410
 lost as I was disappointed a year ago 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.820
 in the World Cup in 2007 when 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.349
 argentina lost that's how it's 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.850
 that you and where is the football you 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.440
 want to make a point with you on the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.690
 course of Argentina I remind you 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.890
 just the results of this copa in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 the first match against paraguay in 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.760
 goal hen everywhere while we were leading 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.410
 2 0 at the half time then win 1 0 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.629
 face Uruguay in a match really 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.820
 very very chopped then victory against 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.500
 face to jamaica sorry to 1 0 in a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.449
 really despicable match from us 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.270
 quarter -final against Colombia 0 0 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.329
 we go to the winning penalty 5 to 4 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.399
 then semi final there it was easy in 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.930
 semi-final 6-1 against paraguay 1-1 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.329
 heavy score because the paraguay not the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.640
 all deserved 236 then so we lost 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.110
 in the final against the chili it was his copa 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.070
 america they won their home 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.570
 first major title 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.570
 congratulations to them they deserve it 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.010
 place they do not deserve is the name 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.229
 Fair whistle play our anthem 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.200
 Argentinian and that's it but hey it's not 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.360
 serious if it is decimated kessÃ© cnt they 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.350
 know what to do 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.850
 historically speaking so for me 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.990
 overall the copa of argentina 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.670
 it was still a good copa 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.509
 america when we love it we deserve 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.090
 to go to the final 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.229
 after losing it i think chile 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.939
 it's good for them that they win it 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.990
 more and he deserves it here it was played 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.360
 on details 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.590
 they have dominated the match but the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.570
 biggest opportunities were argentine 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.280
 that's how it's football what 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.450
 I have to criticize we'll say it's 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.460
 maybe the choices of the coach of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.810
 tata martino which for me makes of 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.170
 bad choice or tell me what you 're saying 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.689
 think 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.100
 getting iguana back I think 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.509
 that it was a bad thing me to his 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 I would rather bring in tevez 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.369
 who has the soul who is really a 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.100
 fighter while higuain ben here 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.149
 he did it to us it's not him who's us 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.469
 did lose the final in cup of the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.750
 world but there balls that must not 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.920
 miss with the napoli misses a penalty 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.110
 to qualify them in League of 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.750
 champions and there he misses the penalty and 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.340
 a america copa ball at the end on 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.510
 a pass from 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.099
 daisy even though we can say that she is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.080
 difficult but now I do not know if 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.269
 it was a good choice after it's a 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.310
 point I put on tata martino but 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.900
 I will say in its place we do not know what 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.550
 I could have dreamed 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.349
 tvs i do not know if that would have 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.790
 given me I would have bet after we also 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.040
 insect damage and maria gets hurt 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.879
 in first half as in the final 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.500
 did not hurt in the first half 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.489
 but he was hurt could not play her 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.230
 and I think it's still 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.280
 really very very big loss for 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.269
 we at this moment of the match 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.379
 they said they come back I 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.730
 thought he would bring more than 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.049
 that he did what he could not 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.400
 serious and after on the whole of the 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.390
 coopaq what was also a problem in 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.470
 final but on both sides 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.510
 it's really the problem of 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.709
 arbitration but hey that's the way 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.030
 South American referees for those who do not 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.560
 are not aware they really have 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.510
 badly to get out of the boxes there really are 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.190
 a big challenge in the championship 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.200
 Argentinian or two holes in all 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.519
 South America it's really necessary 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.360
 of the time that come out the boxes but there 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.519
 I still thought it was 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.660
 really it was almost necessary that there is 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.209
 a dead man so that he gets out a red card 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.010
 because messi the mistakes of anti-game 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.090
 after all the games but there I 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.579
 really going to talk about the final but 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.980
 on the removal of faults of anti play 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.140
 pulling jerseys of tincks he 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.129
 from behind on the sides for really 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.109
 stop the action there is not even 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.609
 cardboard I did not even see any yellow then 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.380
 here I do not understand too much after there is 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.489
 a penalty on the euro also on a sudden 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.170
 franc where he is girded he can 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.760
 not even jump but after that it's 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.079
 really did not really let go of 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.459
 Argentina since I was not watching 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.139
 the other side is safe for your 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.010
 team you look at your team but 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.859
 I think on the other side there has been 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.299
 also had errors for example their due 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.739
 and could take a red 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.150
 so here we are after both sides 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.840
 it was really all over the copa 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.450
 I would like to report 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.099
 here I was really proud of my 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.359
 argentina team and that I hope that 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.200
 next year there are 100 years of 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.790
 the america copa 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.590
 normally they have to play themselves out 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.220
 America I hope that this time we 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.720
 will win 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.829
 I hope it will be with Messi because 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.940
 that I do not know if you know it but 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.200
 apparently he would have decided to do 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.430
 a break is a rumor and 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.810
 that apparently he would like to leave the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.069
 national selection and come back for the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.519
 qualifications of the world cup the 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.049
 next 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.940
 but is this really about me I think I 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.169
 think he's actually making himself there 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.880
 Wants a lot of criticism in Argentina 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.019
 the indicated did not do enough while I 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.639
 think he can not do everything 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.650
 only here when you get stopped 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.609
 irregularly late does what he has 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.720
 did what he could do it really 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.549
 a very big friends it's not because 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.169
 that he does not mark who does not make big 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.340
 matches I think that fortunately he 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.380
 was there he must continue to be 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.789
 with us and here are ramos in fresnes tina 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.319
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.760
 it was true as I saw guys 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:23.580
 I know 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.580
 and 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.580
 and 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.169
 so 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.090
 fuction 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.530
 the ema he added
