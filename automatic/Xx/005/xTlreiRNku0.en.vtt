exact features i'm going to do with the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.210 
exact features i'm going to do with the
most<00:00:26.880> basic<00:00:27.090> things<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.800> do<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> lot<00:00:29.160> of

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
most basic things that you do a lot of

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.349 
most basic things that you do a lot of
times<00:00:29.429> when<00:00:29.550> you're<00:00:29.670> starting<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.029> new<00:00:30.179> asset

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
times when you're starting a new asset

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.479 
times when you're starting a new asset
which<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.019> setting<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.769> image<00:00:31.980> planes<00:00:32.219> all

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
which is setting up image planes all

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.490 
which is setting up image planes all
right<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.329> we're<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> reset<00:00:34.020> max<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
right so we're going to reset max to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.440 
right so we're going to reset max to
everything<00:00:34.890> default<00:00:35.460> nice<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.940> clean<00:00:36.149> air

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450

by 1266 and I'm just going to drop a
plane<00:01:20.100> into<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.640> new<00:01:20.820> port<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.270> alright<00:01:22.140> so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
plane into the new port here alright so

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.340 
plane into the new port here alright so
i'm<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> divide<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.369> size<00:01:24.150> by<00:01:24.630> 10<00:01:24.990> just

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
i'm going to divide the size by 10 just

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.600 
i'm going to divide the size by 10 just
so<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.650> fits<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.189> more<00:01:26.310> sets

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
so that it fits a little bit more sets

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.840

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.370 
change layer properties that sucker
froze<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.880> reason<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.300> did<00:05:06.480> that<00:05:06.690> is<00:05:06.900> because

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
froze the reason it did that is because

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.840 
froze the reason it did that is because
the<00:05:07.590> object<00:05:09.170> in<00:05:10.170> its<00:05:10.200> object<00:05:10.590> properties<00:05:11.010> has

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
the object in its object properties has

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.000 
the object in its object properties has
to<00:05:12.000> also<00:05:12.180> be<00:05:12.540> set<00:05:12.780> so<00:05:13.530> that<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.740> display

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
to also be set so that the display

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.040 
to also be set so that the display
properties<00:05:14.490> are<00:05:14.730> not<00:05:15.150> controlled<00:05:15.510> by<00:05:15.570> object

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
properties are not controlled by object

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.620 
properties are not controlled by object
but<00:05:16.290> rather<00:05:16.500> by<00:05:16.800> layer<00:05:17.240> so<00:05:18.240> this<00:05:18.480> should<00:05:18.600> be

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
but rather by layer so this should be

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.440 
but rather by layer so this should be
changing<00:05:19.050> back<00:05:19.550> just<00:05:20.550> like<00:05:20.700> that<00:05:20.730> all<00:05:21.300> right

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
changing back just like that all right

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.020 
changing back just like that all right
so<00:05:22.140> now<00:05:22.230> we<00:05:22.290> come<00:05:22.440> over<00:05:22.560> here<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:22.980> if<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.460> tap<00:05:23.670> f3

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
so now we come over here and if I tap f3

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.240 
so now we come over here and if I tap f3
again<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:25.440> one<00:05:25.590> that's<00:05:25.740> on<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.890> default

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
again the one that's on the default

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.610 
again the one that's on the default
layer<00:05:26.400> goes<00:05:27.120> to<00:05:27.270> wireframe<00:05:27.420> with<00:05:28.320> this<00:05:28.440> one

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
layer goes to wireframe with this one

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.930 
layer goes to wireframe with this one
here<00:05:28.890> stays<00:05:29.520> as<00:05:29.790> it<00:05:30.450> is<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:30.900> so<00:05:31.500> by<00:05:32.400> just<00:05:32.460> using

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
here stays as it is and so by just using

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.000 
here stays as it is and so by just using
layers<00:05:33.480> that<00:05:33.780> have<00:05:33.840> specific<00:05:34.500> layer

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
layers that have specific layer

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.800 
layers that have specific layer
properties<00:05:35.280> assigned<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:35.910> them<00:05:36.030> you<00:05:36.660> can

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
properties assigned to them you can

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.160 
properties assigned to them you can
change<00:05:37.080> all<00:05:37.290> sorts<00:05:37.830> of<00:05:37.890> useful<00:05:38.070> things<00:05:38.280> um<00:05:39.170> the

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
change all sorts of useful things um the

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.870 
change all sorts of useful things um the
two<00:05:40.680> main<00:05:40.860> ones<00:05:40.950> I<00:05:41.070> showed<00:05:41.100> you<00:05:41.370> there<00:05:41.520> is<00:05:41.700> like

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
two main ones I showed you there is like

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.270 
two main ones I showed you there is like
how<00:05:42.660> to<00:05:42.720> have<00:05:42.930> something<00:05:43.140> like<00:05:43.260> frozen<00:05:43.800> like<00:05:44.070> I

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
how to have something like frozen like I

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.860 
how to have something like frozen like I
can't<00:05:44.820> interact<00:05:45.030> with<00:05:45.390> this<00:05:45.510> thing<00:05:45.690> right<00:05:45.840> now

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
can't interact with this thing right now

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.200 
can't interact with this thing right now
because<00:05:46.170> it's<00:05:46.260> on<00:05:46.380> this<00:05:46.500> leg<00:05:46.740> I<00:05:46.950> got<00:05:47.820> as<00:05:48.030> much

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
because it's on this leg I got as much

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.880 
because it's on this leg I got as much
as<00:05:48.360> I<00:05:48.420> want<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:48.690> move<00:05:48.780> it<00:05:48.900> around<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.530> select

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
as I want to move it around and select

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.350 
as I want to move it around and select
it<00:05:50.010> whenever<00:05:50.190> I<00:05:50.370> can<00:05:50.640> which<00:05:50.940> is<00:05:51.090> great<00:05:51.330> for

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
it whenever I can which is great for

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.790 
it whenever I can which is great for
image<00:05:51.810> planes<00:05:52.080> anything<00:05:52.410> else<00:05:52.560> that<00:05:52.710> you

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
image planes anything else that you

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.620 
image planes anything else that you
don't<00:05:53.010> want<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.280> fool<00:05:53.910> with<00:05:53.970> in<00:05:54.300> your<00:05:54.390> scenes

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
don't want to fool with in your scenes

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.930 
don't want to fool with in your scenes
just<00:05:54.960> frozen<00:05:55.200> by<00:05:56.160> heading<00:05:56.400> to<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.550> Slayer<00:05:56.760> but

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
just frozen by heading to the Slayer but

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.010 
just frozen by heading to the Slayer but
you<00:05:57.000> can<00:05:57.120> still<00:05:57.240> see<00:05:57.360> what's<00:05:57.510> going<00:05:57.720> on<00:05:57.810> there

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
you can still see what's going on there

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.980 
you can still see what's going on there
also<00:05:58.830> obvious<00:05:59.460> rendering<00:05:59.790> one<00:05:59.940> um<00:06:00.120> you<00:06:00.840> can

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
also obvious rendering one um you can

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.650 
also obvious rendering one um you can
get<00:06:01.440> a<00:06:01.590> lot<00:06:01.770> fancier<00:06:02.250> with<00:06:02.400> rendering<00:06:03.300> tricks

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
get a lot fancier with rendering tricks

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.880 
get a lot fancier with rendering tricks
by<00:06:03.810> changing<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.170> layer<00:06:04.320> properties<00:06:04.470> because

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
by changing the layer properties because

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.070 
by changing the layer properties because
there's<00:06:05.040> a<00:06:05.070> rendering<00:06:05.370> control<00:06:05.700> also<00:06:06.080> for

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
there's a rendering control also for

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.450 
there's a rendering control also for
example<00:06:07.380> if<00:06:07.440> you<00:06:07.530> wanted<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:08.010> you<00:06:08.100> multi

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
passes and you wanted certain things to

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.160

be rendered out separately this is the
easiest<00:06:13.440> way<00:06:13.650> rather<00:06:13.860> than<00:06:13.980> going<00:06:14.310> setting<00:06:15.300> up

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
easiest way rather than going setting up

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.260 
easiest way rather than going setting up
