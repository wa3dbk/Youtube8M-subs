that you can find on our videos and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.330 
that you can find on our videos and
we're<00:01:20.759> showing<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.240> first<00:01:22.130> obvious<00:01:23.130> hand

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
we're showing the first obvious hand

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:33.250 
we're showing the first obvious hand
position<00:01:23.729> which<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.090> double<00:01:24.299> palm<00:01:24.659> strike

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.600 

let's<00:01:34.260> see<00:01:34.440> how<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:35.010> increase<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
let's see how we can increase the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.150 
let's see how we can increase the
effectiveness<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.990> double<00:01:37.440> palm<00:01:37.680> strike

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
effectiveness of this double palm strike

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.660 
effectiveness of this double palm strike
we've<00:01:38.970> explored<00:01:39.480> we<00:01:39.930> realized<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.980> not<00:01:41.460> only

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
we've explored we realized that not only

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.790 
we've explored we realized that not only
by<00:01:41.910> striking<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.510> opponent<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:43.230> the<00:01:43.470> chest

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
by striking the opponent in the chest

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.870 
by striking the opponent in the chest
that<00:01:44.760> if<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.360> target<00:01:45.900> accuracy<00:01:46.740> we<00:01:47.640> want

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
that if we have target accuracy we want

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.390 
that if we have target accuracy we want
to<00:01:48.000> strike<00:01:48.450> under<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> clavicle<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
to strike under the clavicle or the

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.000 
to strike under the clavicle or the
collarbone<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.690> increase<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> effectiveness

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
collarbone to increase the effectiveness

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.200 
collarbone to increase the effectiveness
of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.580> technique<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:55.080> my<00:01:55.560> paw<00:01:55.890> heal<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.730> not

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
of the technique so my paw heal is not

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.700 
of the technique so my paw heal is not
just<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> strike<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.470> strike

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
just going to strike here you can strike

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.370 
just going to strike here you can strike
under<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.190> clavicle<00:01:59.720> let's<00:02:00.720> see<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.080> we<00:02:01.229> can

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
under the clavicle let's see if we can

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.800 
under the clavicle let's see if we can
make<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.710> even<00:02:02.100> more<00:02:02.130> effective<00:02:02.610> by<00:02:03.270> finding<00:02:03.690> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
make it even more effective by finding a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.290 
make it even more effective by finding a
hidden<00:02:03.990> technique<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.910> strike

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
hidden technique so we have to strike

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.890 
hidden technique so we have to strike
here

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
here

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.210 
here
now<00:02:08.360> we<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.720> here<00:02:10.050> what<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.040> hidden

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
now we have it here what is the hidden

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.980 
now we have it here what is the hidden
technique<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.660> can<00:02:12.780> figure<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.080> out

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.070 

not<00:02:18.990> only<00:02:19.020> am<00:02:19.440> i<00:02:19.530> striking<00:02:20.070> on<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.190> clavicle

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
not only am i striking on the clavicle

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.040 
not only am i striking on the clavicle
I'm<00:02:22.080> using<00:02:22.380> my<00:02:22.560> fingers<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:24.420> Tiger<00:02:24.870> Claw

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
I'm using my fingers and Tiger Claw

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.699 
I'm using my fingers and Tiger Claw
afterwards<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.800> grab<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.550> squeeze<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:28.500> is

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
afterwards to grab and squeeze this is

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.979 
afterwards to grab and squeeze this is
the<00:02:28.860> trapezius<00:02:29.550> muscle<00:02:30.000> upper<00:02:30.420> back<00:02:30.630> here

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the trapezius muscle upper back here

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.670 
the trapezius muscle upper back here
when<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.890> hit<00:02:32.250> my<00:02:32.820> fingers<00:02:32.880> are<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:34.200> behind

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
when I hit my fingers are going behind

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.729 
when I hit my fingers are going behind
and<00:02:35.040> I'm<00:02:35.160> squeezing<00:02:35.989> now<00:02:36.989> because<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
and I'm squeezing now because the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.110 
and I'm squeezing now because the
muscles<00:02:38.070> are<00:02:38.160> strong<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.640> nothing's<00:02:38.970> going

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
muscles are strong and nothing's going

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.050 
muscles are strong and nothing's going
to<00:02:39.150> happen<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:40.200> inside<00:02:40.860> here<00:02:41.519> is<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> pressure

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
to happen but inside here is a pressure

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.000 
to happen but inside here is a pressure
point<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:43.260> when<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.530> strike<00:02:43.920> here<00:02:44.489> my<00:02:44.880> thumb

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
point so when I strike here my thumb

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.470 
point so when I strike here my thumb
knuckles<00:02:47.010> are<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:47.489> into<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.269> pressure

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
knuckles are going into the pressure
