and I think I've written a gap between

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.200 
and I think I've written a gap between
people<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:57.410> communicate<00:01:57.649> with<00:01:58.220> each<00:01:58.520> other

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210

you know and the best way for me to
bridge<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.520> gap<00:02:04.970> is<00:02:05.360> through<00:02:05.600> music<00:02:06.080> in<00:02:06.320> part

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
let's make it let's make it other way

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.110 
let's make it let's make it other way
while<00:03:35.690> we<00:03:35.870> get<00:03:35.990> it<00:03:36.140> put<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.500> out<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.920> hole<00:03:37.120> and

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
while we get it put it out the hole and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.850 
while we get it put it out the hole and
so<00:03:38.270> they<00:03:38.420> still<00:03:38.810> in<00:03:38.960> there<00:03:38.990> fighting<00:03:39.170> across

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.160 

I<00:03:41.890> figured<00:03:42.820> out<00:03:42.940> what<00:03:43.270> how<00:03:43.390> humans<00:03:44.080> are

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170

reacting<00:03:44.710> and<00:03:45.190> I'm<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:45.790> trying<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.360> activate

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050
