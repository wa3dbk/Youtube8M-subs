00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello people welcome once again one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.400
 for everyone in this video we will be 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.230
 doing double a great 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.820
 origami to be able to do this double 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.980
 boomerang the first thing we have to 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.110
 do is put together two boomerang of the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.759
 simple origami those that we already teach to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.609
 do in the channel I'll be leaving 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.680
 here the link the thumbnail or else in the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.150
 description of the video will be able to go in 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.430
 any time of the video because below 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.170
 I'll be leaving the link to the video and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.150
 once they have armed both 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.560
 simple origami boomerang now let's 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.260
 go on to explain how we have to 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.809
 hit to make the double boomerang of 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.399
 origami let's take the boomerang of the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.820
 next way we have two sides one 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.250
 has a straight line here that goes together 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.710
 with the wing and the other is a line 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.620
 diagonal is a fold here diagonally 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.570
 that goes from the tip to the angle then 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.910
 we have to take the two boomerang of 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.399
 the same way we have in the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.100
 We will have to pass the right hand 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.109
 down and the one on the left does not go 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.710
 to stay above we have to do 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.309
 match the tip of the boomerang 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.950
 with the angle of the other boom this has 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.670
 be well aligned and when we give it 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.970
 turn this one will also urge dress 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.520
 and we are going to paste 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.010
 the first one here we have a kind of 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.450
 pocket and there we're going to have to paste 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.450
 with ribbons 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.229
 but what's inside 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.190
 the second one we 're going to hit now it's going to 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.150
 be this side here 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:47.600
 with that pocket you can see these 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.540
 children and not be stuck any 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.869
 let's put the tape and we were at 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.869
 reverse 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.659
 i 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.360
 let's see 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.270
 Now let's turn 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.140
 and on this side we are going to do the same in 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.140
 this pocket 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.940
 let's open let's say 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.850
 and finally we are going to paste here not 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.730
 we have no pocket so I'm 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.570
 Direct pasted is the only one of all that 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.570
 they have hit directly 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.670
 and in the way launch this summer is 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.080
 quite similar to the previous one if 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.210
 we have to take into account how 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.550
 let's grab this side here the one 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.040
 It has the three folds that you see in 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.230
 Incomplete square shape will remain 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.540
 down and this side that has a 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.910
 single diagonal line is the one that we're going to 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.470
 have to leave up we're going to 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.410
 take it this way and we will use 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.900
 quite the doll not so much arms but 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.060
 doll because that's what turns it 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.130
 let's throw considering that it's going 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.660
 to be a circular tour if you do not 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.000
 we are going to pull up like that but 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.710
 we are going to throw it in 45 degrees 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.710
 let's test if it works here in 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.459
 but one more a human 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.400
 and now you will wonder how it is 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.110
 that some great return we will try to 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.760
 explain it in the shortest way and 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.550
 possible dynamic we are going to separate into 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.140
 four parts parts number 1 each 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.850
 of the wings of a boomerang work of 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.620
 the same way wings work 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.620
 of airplanes unlike these 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.060
 they are in the opposite direction and a look with 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.250
 attention the format of the wings of the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.410
 planes are going to see that they have this way 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.690
 in this way makes the air that passes 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.640
 from below go to much lower speed 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.040
 that the air that passes above passing 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.290
 much faster this generates that there 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.690
 more pressure down and produce a 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.670
 elevation part number 2 as we did 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.140
 in the boomerang the wings are in 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.630
 opposite unlike airplanes 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.459
 then when you turn the wing that 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.780
 is up that is the one that goes in front 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.880
 the wind will be the one that will generate 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.640
 the address will produce the 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.260
 elevation part number 3 the objects that 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.240
 they rotate around an imaginary line 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.760
 called axis is transformed into a 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.550
 gyroscope a good example a gyroscope 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.140
 it would be the wheel of a bicycle when taking 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.850
 a bicycle wheel by the axle and 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.680
 drop one of the sides they will see that 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.139
 obviously the new bicycle is going to 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.509
 to fall but if it was we took the action 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.099
 when releasing one of the sides the shaft goes away 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.620
 to maintain and this is going to make the 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.389
 wheel retains the same position but if 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.849
 I take the rue say it's the axes and 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.520
 he tried to alter that axis the wheel 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.990
 bicycle will oppose a resistance and 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.460
 now we combine these two 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.099
 ideas let's understand why the 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.529
 Boomerang come back to us number 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:08.620
 4 conclusion when we throw the 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:10.360
 boomerang this is going to start turning 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.340
 which is the one above that goes towards 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.249
 ahead is what will cause 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.770
 number you want to double want to alter that 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.180
 axis and as we said in the gyroscope and in 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.060
 this case that is functioning as 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.069
 gyroscope will start to bend and it's going to 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.199
 generate that uniqueness that is what 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.360
 is going to make the number go back to 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:33.120
 us if we want video like this 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.120
 so I went to the page of one for all 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.819
 good
