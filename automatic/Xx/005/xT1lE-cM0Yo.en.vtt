00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
a little bit harder to come by in the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.310 
a little bit harder to come by in the
same<00:00:34.020> sense<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.469> crocodile<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.250> Jinbei<00:00:35.610> and

same sense as crocodile and Jinbei and

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.360 
same sense as crocodile and Jinbei and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
something about this figure there's a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
something about this figure there's a
lot<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:40.820> debate<00:00:41.820> over<00:00:42.120> why<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.260> good<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.739> not

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
lot of debate over why it's good or not

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.510 
lot of debate over why it's good or not
and<00:00:44.270> some<00:00:45.270> people<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:46.829> eyes<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.370> too

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and some people think the eyes are too

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.110 
and some people think the eyes are too
close<00:00:47.550> together<00:00:48.059> or<00:00:48.629> too<00:00:48.930> far<00:00:49.170> apart<00:00:49.789> I'm<00:00:50.789> not

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
close together or too far apart I'm not

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.459 
close together or too far apart I'm not
entirely<00:00:51.420> sure<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.989> something<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
entirely sure it's something with the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.380 
entirely sure it's something with the
face<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.730> looks<00:00:53.910> perfectly<00:00:54.270> fine

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
face but I think it looks perfectly fine

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.840 
face but I think it looks perfectly fine
it<00:00:55.260> looks<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.800> law<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.610> no

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
it looks just like law and I have no

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.080 
it looks just like law and I have no
complaints<00:00:57.300> about<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.629> face<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.879> that's<00:00:59.879> just

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
complaints about the face so that's just

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.310 
complaints about the face so that's just
something<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.629> aware<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.870> though<00:01:01.109> some

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
you how that works this arm at first I

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.130 
you how that works this arm at first I
didn't<00:02:19.330> really<00:02:19.390> know<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.780> difference

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
didn't really know the difference

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
didn't really know the difference
between<00:02:20.319> these<00:02:20.620> two<00:02:20.860> arms<00:02:21.280> but<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.510> one<00:02:22.810> as

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
between these two arms but this one as

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.130 
between these two arms but this one as
you<00:02:24.160> can<00:02:24.310> see<00:02:24.519> is<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> little<00:02:25.120> bit<00:02:25.239> wider<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:25.989> it

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
you can see is a little bit wider so it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.550 
you can see is a little bit wider so it
has<00:02:26.290> room<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.829> grip<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.250> giant<00:02:27.670> shaft<00:02:28.599> yeah

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560

uhh
there<00:03:12.480> we<00:03:12.570> go<00:03:13.640> but<00:03:14.640> there's<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.260> like<00:03:16.260> that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
there we go but there's that like that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.950 
there we go but there's that like that
and<00:03:16.740> then<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:18.000> other<00:03:18.180> arm<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:18.750> kind<00:03:18.930> of

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
and then the other arm you just kind of

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.130 
and then the other arm you just kind of
hold<00:03:21.960> on<00:03:22.490> just<00:03:23.490> kind<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.760> snap<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.330> thing<00:03:24.900> into

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
hold on just kind of snap the thing into

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.510 
hold on just kind of snap the thing into
place<00:03:25.290> kind<00:03:25.710> of<00:03:25.740> watch<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.130> between<00:03:26.220> his

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
place kind of watch it in between his

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.930 
place kind of watch it in between his
fingers<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:30.020> it<00:03:31.020> will<00:03:31.170> fit<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.820> there<00:03:32.820> is

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
fingers and it will fit and there is

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.280 
fingers and it will fit and there is
like<00:03:33.210> that<00:03:33.390> which<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.720> actually<00:03:33.960> a<00:03:34.020> really

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
like that which is actually a really

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.550 
like that which is actually a really
cool<00:03:34.560> pose<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:35.040> think<00:03:35.280> because<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.700> sword<00:03:35.970> is

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
cool pose I think because the sword is

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.810 
cool pose I think because the sword is
practically<00:03:37.560> as<00:03:37.980> big<00:03:38.550> as<00:03:38.730> him<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:40.730> it's<00:03:41.730> just

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
practically as big as him and it's just

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.970 
practically as big as him and it's just
really<00:03:42.090> cool<00:03:42.210> cause<00:03:42.570> overall<00:03:42.990> but<00:03:43.230> typically

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
really cool cause overall but typically

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.010 
really cool cause overall but typically
law<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.670> know<00:03:44.760> just<00:03:45.030> kind<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.210> has<00:03:45.360> his<00:03:45.780> sword

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
law you know just kind of has his sword

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.500 
law you know just kind of has his sword
relaxed<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.770> his<00:03:46.920> shoulder<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:47.490> I<00:03:48.000> wouldn't

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
relaxed on his shoulder so I wouldn't

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.000 
relaxed on his shoulder so I wouldn't
necessarily<00:03:48.660> pose<00:03:49.170> him<00:03:49.290> like<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.560> because

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
necessarily pose him like this because

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.860 
necessarily pose him like this because
he's<00:03:50.700> not<00:03:50.880> really<00:03:51.060> seen<00:03:51.360> wheeled<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.780> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
he's not really seen wheeled in the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.800 
he's not really seen wheeled in the
store<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.110> lot<00:03:52.380> but<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:53.180> got<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.510> admit<00:03:54.570> that

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
store a lot but I got to admit that

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.400

figure and so yeah that's it and the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.090 
figure and so yeah that's it and the
head<00:04:24.660> does<00:04:24.900> rotate<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.350> little<00:04:25.440> bit<00:04:25.770> so<00:04:25.980> you<00:04:26.070> can

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
head does rotate a little bit so you can

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.830 
head does rotate a little bit so you can
kind<00:04:26.340> of<00:04:26.400> turn<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:26.940> like<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.180> yeah<00:04:27.390> that
