00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
doing is not almost top control because

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.960 
doing is not almost top control because
he<00:01:24.930> has<00:01:25.189> those<00:01:26.189> rockets<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:26.670> he's<00:01:26.790> made<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
he has those rockets but he's made a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.100 
he has those rockets but he's made a
really<00:01:27.240> nice<00:01:27.390> position<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.930> he's<00:01:28.020> just

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
really nice position here he's just

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.649 
really nice position here he's just
poked<00:01:28.350> his<00:01:28.380> head<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.890> little<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:30.360> as

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
poked his head out a little bit but as

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.880 
poked his head out a little bit but as
you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:30.990> see<00:01:31.340> Rockets<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.579> flying<00:01:33.210> toy<00:01:33.600> him

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
you can see Rockets just flying toy him

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.289 
you can see Rockets just flying toy him
but<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.490> nice<00:01:35.670> battle<00:01:36.030> rifle

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
but that is a really nice battle rifle

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.969 
but that is a really nice battle rifle
to<00:01:36.390> take<00:01:36.540> him<00:01:36.689> down<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> pretty<00:01:37.650> clutch

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
to take him down so it's a pretty clutch

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.539 
to take him down so it's a pretty clutch
kill<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.520> he<00:01:39.210> told<00:01:39.450> me<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:40.590> an<00:01:40.740> email<00:01:40.770> on

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
kill and he told me in an email on

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.850 
kill and he told me in an email on
YouTube<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.390> he's<00:01:42.750> terrible<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.439> rockets

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
YouTube that he's terrible with rockets

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.399 
YouTube that he's terrible with rockets
so<00:01:44.549> he<00:01:44.670> isn't<00:01:44.820> exactly<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> T<00:01:45.600> squared<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.990> MLG

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
so he isn't exactly the T squared of MLG

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.609 
so he isn't exactly the T squared of MLG
with<00:01:46.560> those<00:01:46.680> Rockets<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.579> still<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
with those Rockets but still so as you

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.870 
with those Rockets but still so as you
can<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.009> he<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.250> doing<00:01:50.490> there<00:01:50.520> he<00:01:50.759> was

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
can see what he was doing there he was

but<00:02:34.830> night<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.550> lights<00:02:35.700> was<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.970> lot<00:02:36.150> better

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
but night of lights was a lot better

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.229 
but night of lights was a lot better
predicting<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.040> spawns<00:02:38.310> right<00:02:38.580> there<00:02:38.819> I

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
predicting the spawns right there I

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.660 
predicting the spawns right there I
think<00:02:39.780> he's<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.019> come<00:02:40.230> from<00:02:40.319> snipe<00:02:40.680> no

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
think he's going to come from snipe no

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.009 
think he's going to come from snipe no
doubt<00:02:44.030> which<00:02:45.030> there<00:02:45.269> he<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.720> he's<00:02:45.840> trying

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
doubt which there he is so he's trying

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.259 
doubt which there he is so he's trying
to<00:02:46.110> be<00:02:46.170> sneaky<00:02:46.230> right<00:02:46.709> there<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.130> he<00:02:48.030> doesn't

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
to be sneaky right there and he doesn't

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.180 
to be sneaky right there and he doesn't
really<00:02:48.360> work<00:02:48.540> out<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:48.900> night<00:02:49.260> spots<00:02:49.950> him

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
really work out because night spots him

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.300 
really work out because night spots him
a<00:02:50.720> nice<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> disgusting<00:02:52.560> no<00:02:52.680> scope<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.010> take<00:02:53.160> him

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
a nice a disgusting no scope to take him

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.830 
a nice a disgusting no scope to take him
out<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:53.790> he's<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.150> gonna<00:02:54.390> look<00:02:54.599> for<00:02:54.780> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
out so he's just gonna look for the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.069 
out so he's just gonna look for the
spawn<00:02:55.049> right<00:02:55.200> here<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> flag<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.870> looks

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
spawn right here on the flag so looks

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.059 
spawn right here on the flag so looks
like<00:02:58.110> he<00:02:58.230> spawned<00:02:58.500> man<00:02:58.739> Canada<00:02:59.069> side<00:02:59.280> so<00:03:01.069> he's

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
like he spawned man Canada side so he's

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.940 
like he spawned man Canada side so he's
just<00:03:02.099> have<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.519> do<00:03:02.610> his<00:03:02.730> best<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.560> not<00:03:04.560> like

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.440 
just have to do his best to not like
almost<00:03:05.220> not<00:03:05.489> challenge<00:03:05.880> him<00:03:06.060> right<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.420> I

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
almost not challenge him right here I

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.000 
almost not challenge him right here I
would<00:03:06.690> have<00:03:06.780> backed<00:03:06.900> up<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.140> little<00:03:07.260> bit<00:03:07.590> but<00:03:07.859> he

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
would have backed up a little bit but he

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.099 
would have backed up a little bit but he
had<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.160> really<00:03:08.310> nice<00:03:08.430> battle<00:03:08.970> rifle<00:03:09.299> on<00:03:09.900> him

had a really nice battle rifle on him
the<00:03:10.350> last<00:03:10.560> shot<00:03:10.799> could<00:03:10.920> have<00:03:10.980> been<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> little

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the last shot could have been a little

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.809 
the last shot could have been a little
bit<00:03:11.630> fresh<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.900> love<00:03:13.079> with<00:03:13.170> fresher<00:03:13.640> if<00:03:14.640> you

went for the head shot but I don't know
what<00:03:16.350> sensitivities<00:03:16.950> playing<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.400> but<00:03:17.720> what<00:03:18.720> I

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
what sensitivities playing on but what I

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.170 
what sensitivities playing on but what I
know<00:03:18.870> was<00:03:19.489> that<00:03:20.489> could<00:03:20.639> have<00:03:20.730> been<00:03:20.790> his<00:03:20.850> kill

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
know was that could have been his kill

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.250 
know was that could have been his kill
with<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.420> be<00:03:21.569> i<00:03:21.600> was<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> little<00:03:22.019> bit<00:03:22.170> better

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
with this be i was a little bit better

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
look for the spawn on the flag right

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.550 
look for the spawn on the flag right
here<00:03:58.650> is<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.739> really<00:03:59.010> nice<00:03:59.100> decision<00:04:00.319> I'd<00:04:01.319> look

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
here is a really nice decision I'd look

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.170 
here is a really nice decision I'd look
I'd<00:04:01.709> be<00:04:02.010> looking<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.370> get<00:04:02.459> top<00:04:02.700> control<00:04:03.030> right

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
I'd be looking to get top control right

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.690 
I'd be looking to get top control right
here<00:04:03.209> but<00:04:03.859> it<00:04:04.859> looks<00:04:04.889> like<00:04:05.190> he's<00:04:05.400> trying<00:04:05.639> to

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
here but it looks like he's trying to

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.160 
here but it looks like he's trying to
throw<00:04:05.880> those<00:04:06.000> rockets<00:04:06.359> off<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.599> map<00:04:06.780> which<00:04:07.019> he

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
throw those rockets off the map which he

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.170 
throw those rockets off the map which he
does<00:04:07.349> so

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
does so

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.180 
does so
even<00:04:10.180> though<00:04:10.240> it<00:04:10.270> resulted<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:10.870> her<00:04:10.959> death

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
even though it resulted in her death

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.250 
even though it resulted in her death
that<00:04:12.190> probably<00:04:12.610> he's<00:04:13.569> probably<00:04:13.599> saved

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
that probably he's probably saved

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.780 
that probably he's probably saved
himself<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.739> further<00:04:14.950> four<00:04:15.280> deaths<00:04:15.580> by

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
himself a further four deaths by

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.780 
himself a further four deaths by
chucking<00:04:16.359> those<00:04:16.480> rockets<00:04:16.840> off<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.200> map<00:04:17.410> so<00:04:17.790> it

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
chucking those rockets off the map so it

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.430 
chucking those rockets off the map so it
was<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.970> really<00:04:19.150> good<00:04:19.540> decision<00:04:19.959> for<00:04:19.989> him<00:04:20.230> to<00:04:20.320> do

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
was a really good decision for him to do

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.390 
was a really good decision for him to do
that<00:04:22.260> him<00:04:23.260> being<00:04:23.410> horrible<00:04:23.889> with<00:04:24.010> rockets<00:04:24.280> at

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
that him being horrible with rockets at

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.720 
that him being horrible with rockets at
all<00:04:26.130> but<00:04:27.130> as<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.250> can<00:04:27.340> see<00:04:27.490> he's<00:04:27.580> probably

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
all but as you can see he's probably

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.820 
all but as you can see he's probably
dropped<00:04:28.060> down<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.419> power<00:04:28.660> not<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.320> power<00:04:29.530> up<00:04:29.620> to
