of paper and I'm gonna mark where the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.620 
of paper and I'm gonna mark where the
screws<00:00:25.410> are<00:00:25.680> with<00:00:26.160> these<00:00:26.340> circles<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.510> what

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
screws are with these circles so what

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.730 
screws are with these circles so what
I'm<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.109> once<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.410> take<00:00:28.619> the

I'm going to do is once I take the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.189 
I'm going to do is once I take the
screws<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:29.550> by<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.970> I'm<00:00:30.630> gonna<00:00:30.840> put<00:00:31.050> them

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
screws out one by one I'm gonna put them

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.630 
screws out one by one I'm gonna put them
into<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.529> circle<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.219> way<00:00:32.399> when<00:00:32.579> I'm

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
into the circle so this way when I'm

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.889 
into the circle so this way when I'm
going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> put<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> screws<00:00:33.390> back<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.780> know

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
going to put the screws back I know

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.790 
going to put the screws back I know
exactly

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
exactly

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.530 
exactly
each<00:00:34.920> screw<00:00:35.219> belongs<00:00:35.579> since<00:00:36.239> they're<00:00:36.420> all

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
each screw belongs since they're all

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.209 
each screw belongs since they're all
different<00:00:36.750> sizes<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.739> don't<00:00:37.920> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> be

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
different sizes and I don't want to be

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.729 
different sizes and I don't want to be
figuring<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.730> out<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:40.170> know<00:00:40.260> which<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.620> goes

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
figuring it out you know which one goes

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.560 
figuring it out you know which one goes
where<00:00:40.850> since<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.270> they're<00:00:42.420> all

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
where since you can see they're all

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.240 
where since you can see they're all
different<00:00:42.780> sizes<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.739> once<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> screws<00:00:44.219> are

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
different sizes and once the screws are

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.310 
different sizes and once the screws are
out<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:44.820> pry<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.300> back<00:00:45.600> off<00:00:45.870> by

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
out you can just pry the back off by

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.150 
out you can just pry the back off by
pulling<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.829> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
pulling on it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.760 
pulling on it
it's<00:00:47.550> almost<00:00:47.670> feels<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.260> it's<00:00:49.260> stuck<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
it's almost feels like it's stuck on a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.439 
it's almost feels like it's stuck on a
little<00:00:50.070> bit<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> guess<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.180> know<00:00:51.270> just

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
little bit but I guess you know just

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.029 
little bit but I guess you know just
haven't<00:00:51.690> been<00:00:51.780> removed<00:00:52.140> until<00:00:52.469> now<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.860> that's

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
haven't been removed until now so that's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.040 
haven't been removed until now so that's
why<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.340> feels<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.780> once<00:00:54.930> you

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
why it feels like this so once you

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.920 
why it feels like this so once you
remove<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.489> inside<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.120> right

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
remove it you can look inside and right

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.779 
remove it you can look inside and right
away<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.190> RAM<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.579> here

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
away we can see the the RAM right here

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.830 
away we can see the the RAM right here
in<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.940> middle<00:01:00.210> that's<00:01:00.449> what<00:01:00.570> we're<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.809> to

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
going to unclick these little flaps here

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.130 
going to unclick these little flaps here
and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.000> grab<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> rim<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and then you can grab the rim from the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.770 
and then you can grab the rim from the
side<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:08.490> ink<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> pulls<00:01:09.659> right

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

it's a 16 gigabyte ddr3 and as you can

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
it's a 16 gigabyte ddr3 and as you can
see<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.549> 1600<00:01:27.390> megahertz<00:01:27.689> instead<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
see it's 1600 megahertz instead of the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
see it's 1600 megahertz instead of the
1333<00:01:29.490> which<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.509> little

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
1333 which is in there so it's a little

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.170 
1333 which is in there so it's a little
faster<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.860> -<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> gigabyte<00:01:32.610> modules<00:01:33.030> as

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
faster and it's - a gigabyte modules as

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.550 
faster and it's - a gigabyte modules as
you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.600> from<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> back<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.350> see

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
you can see from the back you can see

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.219 
you can see from the back you can see
the<00:01:34.680> actual<00:01:34.979> units<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.810> back<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the actual units on the back here you

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.170 
the actual units on the back here you
can<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.430> model<00:01:38.700> number<00:01:38.970> I'm<00:01:39.060> going

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and now it's not gonna be so hard to

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.480 
and now it's not gonna be so hard to
hunt<00:02:33.300> for<00:02:33.600> screws<00:02:33.900> gonna<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.410> just<00:02:35.130> grabbing

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
hunt for screws gonna be just grabbing

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.430 
hunt for screws gonna be just grabbing
the<00:02:35.580> screws<00:02:35.850> where<00:02:36.060> they<00:02:36.180> belong<00:02:36.510> it's<00:02:37.320> going

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
the screws where they belong it's going

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.620 
the screws where they belong it's going
to<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> much<00:02:37.860> faster<00:02:38.100> process<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.420> once<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
to be a much faster process so once the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.160 
to be a much faster process so once the
screws<00:02:39.870> are<00:02:39.990> in<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.610> sternness<00:02:41.900> getting<00:02:42.900> around

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
screws are in I sternness getting around

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.500 
screws are in I sternness getting around
and<00:02:43.440> let's<00:02:43.620> see<00:02:43.860> what<00:02:44.520> we<00:02:44.670> did<00:02:44.820> here<00:02:45.030> open<00:02:45.450> it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
and let's see what we did here open it

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.060 
and let's see what we did here open it
up<00:02:45.630> turn<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:47.340> see<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.820> works<00:02:48.060> at<00:02:48.300> all

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
up turn it on and see if it works at all

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.710 
up turn it on and see if it works at all
okay<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:50.280> once<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.850> turns<00:02:51.030> on<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.420> want<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.600> go

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
okay so once it turns on you want to go

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.390 
okay so once it turns on you want to go
on<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.050> other<00:02:52.080> type<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.530> icon<00:02:52.770> on<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.190> top

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
on to the other type of icon on the top
