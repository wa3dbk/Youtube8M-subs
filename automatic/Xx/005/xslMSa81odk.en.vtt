very<00:02:20.500> very<00:02:20.880> tired<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:22.630> think<00:02:22.930> after<00:02:23.020> Daniel

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
very very tired I think after Daniel

very very tired I think after Daniel
Craig<00:02:23.530> finish<00:02:23.800> he's<00:02:23.920> such<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.130> great<00:02:24.250> actor

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760

films<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.920> go<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.489> almost<00:02:27.970> think<00:02:28.300> they<00:02:28.480> should

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
films to go I almost think they should

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.990 
films to go I almost think they should
the<00:02:28.930> Bond<00:02:29.440> franchise<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:30.310> may<00:02:30.459> be<00:02:30.520> humpback

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
the Bond franchise it may be humpback

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.270 
the Bond franchise it may be humpback
and<00:02:31.030> do<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:32.739> know

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
and do you know

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.550 
and do you know
so<00:02:33.880> fun<00:02:34.150> begin<00:02:34.540> with<00:02:34.780> like<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.960> Batman<00:02:35.350> Begins

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
so fun begin with like a Batman Begins

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.710
