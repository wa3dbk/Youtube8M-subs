00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060

controller but because of the active
noise-cancelling<00:04:34.360> feature<00:04:35.350> this<00:04:36.220> is

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
noise-cancelling feature this is

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.140 
noise-cancelling feature this is
required<00:04:37.060> for<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.570> bose<00:04:37.840> headphones<00:04:39.150> so

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
required for the bose headphones so

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.469 
required for the bose headphones so
we'll<00:04:40.300> just<00:04:40.330> slop<00:04:40.780> this<00:04:40.990> out<00:04:41.199> oh<00:04:42.479> it's

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
we'll just slop this out oh it's

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.129 
we'll just slop this out oh it's
actually<00:04:43.600> pretty<00:04:43.990> slim<00:04:44.800> not<00:04:45.700> as<00:04:45.850> thick<00:04:46.240> or<00:04:46.479> big

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
actually pretty slim not as thick or big

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.640 
actually pretty slim not as thick or big
as<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.500> expected<00:04:47.950> it<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.460> be<00:04:49.320> that's<00:04:50.320> good

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
as I expected it to be that's good

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.310 
as I expected it to be that's good
because<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:51.700> didn't<00:04:51.940> want<00:04:51.970> this<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.510> be<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.900> huge

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
because I didn't want this to be a huge

because I didn't want this to be a huge
Bowl<00:04:53.650> July<00:04:54.010> pocket<00:04:54.490> whereas<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.479> already<00:04:55.660> had

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
Bowl July pocket whereas I already had

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.879 
Bowl July pocket whereas I already had
my<00:04:55.930> big<00:04:56.410> phone<00:04:56.770> in<00:04:57.010> there<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:59.680> then<00:05:01.710> there<00:05:02.710> is

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
my big phone in there and then there is

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:11.370 
my big phone in there and then there is
an<00:05:03.100> inline<00:05:04.090> mic<00:05:04.479> and<00:05:04.780> remote<00:05:04.810> control<00:05:10.380> so

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
an inline mic and remote control so

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.439 
an inline mic and remote control so
there<00:05:11.710> must<00:05:11.830> be<00:05:12.039> the<00:05:12.190> volume<00:05:12.400> up<00:05:12.820> volume<00:05:13.060> down

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
there must be the volume up volume down

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.719 
there must be the volume up volume down
and<00:05:14.080> probably<00:05:14.289> the<00:05:14.590> pause<00:05:14.889> and<00:05:15.130> play<00:05:15.280> button

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
and probably the pause and play button

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.330 
and probably the pause and play button
in<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:15.970> middle<00:05:17.550> now<00:05:18.550> we<00:05:18.610> have<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.419> headphones

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
in the middle now we have the headphones

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:32.450 
in the middle now we have the headphones
earphones<00:05:21.340> earbuds<00:05:21.840> itself<00:05:28.950> Slava<00:05:29.950> stop

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.110 

there<00:05:33.460> are<00:05:33.700> they<00:05:33.849> are<00:05:34.060> they<00:05:35.760> look<00:05:36.760> pretty

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
there are they are they look pretty

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.300 
there are they are they look pretty
funny<00:05:37.510> compared<00:05:38.020> to<00:05:38.139> normal<00:05:38.320> headphones<00:05:39.070> but

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
funny compared to normal headphones but

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.010 
funny compared to normal headphones but
that's<00:05:39.520> probably<00:05:39.789> because<00:05:39.940> of<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.479> earbuds

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
that's probably because of the earbuds

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.560 
that's probably because of the earbuds
which<00:05:41.770> try<00:05:42.130> to<00:05:42.160> keep<00:05:42.460> out<00:05:42.700> as<00:05:42.910> much<00:05:43.180> noise<00:05:43.510> as

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
which try to keep out as much noise as

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.770 
which try to keep out as much noise as
possible<00:05:44.669> this<00:05:45.669> means<00:05:45.910> you<00:05:46.180> can<00:05:46.210> probably<00:05:46.750> use

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
possible this means you can probably use

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.529 
possible this means you can probably use
it<00:05:47.080> on<00:05:47.200> airplane<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.190> you<00:05:48.880> won't<00:05:49.120> have<00:05:49.240> as

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
it on airplane and you won't have as

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.040 
it on airplane and you won't have as
much<00:05:49.750> noise<00:05:50.590> airplane<00:05:51.400> noise<00:05:51.669> as<00:05:52.050> their

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
much noise airplane noise as their

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.320 
much noise airplane noise as their
regular<00:05:53.500> headphones<00:05:53.979> you'd<00:05:54.190> get<00:05:54.430> from<00:05:54.460> the

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
regular headphones you'd get from the
