00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
changes in policies I believe Microsoft

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.689 
changes in policies I believe Microsoft
have<00:00:57.690> given<00:00:58.170> themselves<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.829> chance<00:00:58.859> from

humiliation<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.930> may<00:01:01.199> even<00:01:01.230> succeed

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
humiliation they may even succeed

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.520 
humiliation they may even succeed
because<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:03.059> forces<00:01:03.629> them<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.809> listen<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
because this forces them to listen to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.980 
because this forces them to listen to
their<00:01:04.680> users<00:01:04.890> even<00:01:05.280> greater<00:01:05.939> than<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.840> they
