00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 very good to all those who fierce 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.320
 maybe this is good we are here in the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.420
 weekly top of nba 2k 15 this appointment that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.030
 you have every Sunday on my channel and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.070
 Well, let's start with a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.789
 about 3 or 4 parties I do not remember that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.080
 before they were and that top of 10 plays 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.630
 Matte plays and also some other to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.510
 another sheet that is in the middle and now what 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.850
 we will see and the truth is interesting 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.030
 so without further denial we start with 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.030
 the topic of the top 10 so far 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.510
 so this is done 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.440
 specialist in this type 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.579
 a little over a minute and a half 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.579
 catch the bounce 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.190
 these do not fail many 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.630
 ball arrives no bis 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.610
 completely at rest 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.610
 when 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.350
 and enter 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.320
 l 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.290
 They have not had any problems at the time 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.290
 to catch rebounds 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.970
 strong under the basket and at 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.170
 limited 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.170
 according to the options of the rival 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.000
 that with this good defense 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.110
 to see if he let go of the ball before 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.380
 sounded the horn had to review that 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.380
 video 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.640
 the view seems like a decision 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.540
 to the repetition was conclusive but 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.209
 even in slow motion is very difficult 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.159
 the arbitrators have already decided there is no 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.290
 basket so they keep their decision 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.290
 initial at the end of this control 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.050
 like this 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.190
 impressive and very difficult to do 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.290
 this is a show of the good is 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.629
 easy to get carried away by these actions 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.629
 spectacular and the mates produce
