 chicago to go seventh march with 18 points in the conference this 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.460

 porsche aronson of the fredy montero state while by the painters of forlán 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.010
 diego chará played here Jorge Perlaza 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.190
 by montero would be the first to score 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.550
 to place his fourth goal in the season at that time 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.590

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.040
 admiral

 that was the first free throw score they put one by one but 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.610
 after the intervention of being here of pearls 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.260
 we have to recover balls diego chará 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
 and the one who runs out is Jorge Perlaza 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.330
 pearl with this comes to four goals in 17 games 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.740

 and the fifth of the season 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.660
 efe that already has five goals during the championship would be far from his best 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.250
 record in the year 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.250
 since when he scored 12 goals in 27 games 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.179
 in the absence of nine per regular tournament it would behoove him to place almost 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:17.639
 one goal per game finally the match offered by two contributions and Aaron for 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.989
