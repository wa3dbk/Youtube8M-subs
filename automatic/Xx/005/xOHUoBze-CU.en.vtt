over<00:06:53.370> the<00:06:53.490> next<00:06:53.520> week<00:06:53.970> or<00:06:54.180> two<00:06:54.360> and<00:06:54.510> perhaps<00:06:54.660> we

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
over the next week or two and perhaps we

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.659 
over the next week or two and perhaps we
can<00:06:55.110> schedule<00:06:55.380> a<00:06:55.620> review<00:06:56.010> in<00:06:56.130> about<00:06:56.400> two<00:06:56.640> weeks
