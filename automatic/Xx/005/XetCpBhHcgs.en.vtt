how<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> am<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.460> too<00:00:44.610> much

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
how I am if I if it's just too much

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.910 
how I am if I if it's just too much
trouble<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:46.140> put<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.590> then<00:00:46.800> I'm

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
trouble to to put it on then I'm

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.160 
trouble to to put it on then I'm
probably<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> wear<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.539> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
probably just not going to wear it so it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.369 
probably just not going to wear it so it
has<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.590> easily<00:00:50.520> accessible<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:52.079> not

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
has to be easily accessible and then not

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.260 
has to be easily accessible and then not
only<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:53.160> needs<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.670> also<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:54.090> easily

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
only that it needs to also be easily

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.689 
only that it needs to also be easily
able<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.780> put<00:00:58.140> away<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.890> stored<00:00:59.370> because

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
able to be put away to be stored because

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.090 
able to be put away to be stored because
if<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> chore<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.590> put<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.890> up

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
if it's going to be a chore to put it up

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.390 
if it's going to be a chore to put it up
it<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.359> either<00:01:03.690> number<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:05.040> put<00:01:05.280> up

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400

because it's too much trouble to put
back<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.890> think<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:11.760> all<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.090> those<00:01:12.420> things
