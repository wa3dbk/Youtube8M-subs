00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:08.160
 how about friends in this new tutorial 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.650
 I will teach them to common 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.740
 improve the performance of what are your 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.389
 games on the cell phone is to run 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.570
 a little faster in the event that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.630
 go slower or to be 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.170
 they run in case they do not lock 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.580
 a lot of things that good style what 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.769
 we have to do is download this 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.930
 application and I've already taught them in 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:37.500
 another video called clean master is 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.160
 this how can you see if we get to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.520
 that 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.810
 once here within this application 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.660
 we remove in optimize 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.370
 this is the memory there is that is going to 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.280
 it seems like how much memory we are 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 using we are going to give you here in 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.649
 optimize 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.469
 with that I'm here we 're not going to improve the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.019
 ram memory to use it in what 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.900
 are the video games then we go here 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.280
 where he says optimize his games as 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.600
 you can see in case you do not 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.270
 appear this can also do 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.909
 from here up 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.520
 and here we have this that says 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.399
 scanned games I do not have now 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.640
 installed many good indeed had 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.229
 others but in the end they finished me 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 boring then eliminate them and 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.070
 I just stayed with these three you 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.250
 we give here in optimize 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.810
 and here we will create a folder like 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.270
 can see here tells us 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.810
 which has been successfully optimized 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.360
 we accept and with this we are already 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.930
 optimizing what our games are 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.530
 As you can see we believe this folder in 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.020
 which at the time of entering the game 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.470
 optimizes our memory so that it is in 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.520
 the second slow east of pig does not pull 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.130
 a lot of memory 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.950
 but in short for other big games the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.740
 Truth is very good if very 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.270
 advantageous 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.240
 well now is the other one is with that already 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.190
 let's improve what memory is in 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.790
 our cell optimizes them 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.070
 automatically when you start the game something 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.050
 What I am going to recommend is that before 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.650
 each game do that they clean the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.470
 ram memory either here or as there 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.040
 taught the other day from here 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.040
 and here 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.750
 tremble 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.569
 from here right now you are not using 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.340
 a lot so better do not talk about today and 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.030
 after that 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.250
 wait for about 5 minutes because this 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.930
 I 've done it the truth starts a game 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.400
 and as you start to work more on 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.880
 instead of doing it faster it does 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.580
 slower 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.710
 that's because we just eliminated everything 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.140
 and then he runs us slow and starts to 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:09.320
 drop again the programs 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:14.610
 well once done this let's what 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:17.850
 it is to this part adjustments 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.760
 since adjustments this you have to 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.319
 leave 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.200
 this option 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.030
 what says development options in given 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.359
 if that option does not appear 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.469
 you can search it online or 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:36.190
 I think it's here in the number of 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:40.270
 compilation 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.180
 we press seven times if it's not here is 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:47.019
 here the truth I do not remember very well 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.060
 but we press him seven times in given 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.269
 if it does not appear regularly 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.910
 all cell phones are already showing up 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.120
 appear this 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.330
 I convinced of this menu 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.769
 good here we in case given that 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.730
 We want to improve the performance of 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:10.590
 our cell phone we can also go to 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.220
 these parts that are like here 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.609
 the animation here if we want between 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.180
 less has faster is going to be our 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:25.139
 cellular I here I put point 5 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.260
 here also point 5 and we already selected 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.260
 in all points 5 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.860
 as it is said 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.600
 already in case we have a we want 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.710
 run a program that plainly we 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.530
 encourage the cell phone a lot because it 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.569
 we have a lot of ram memory what we can 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:52.069
 do us this is to go 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:55.710
 here to see where this option is here 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:58.469
 force acceleration gpu use 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.349
 2d hardware acceleration in 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.119
 applications this also improves the 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.330
 performance of what are the 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:08.060
 applications nothing more then it is not very 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.760
 recommendable 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.760
 but because they could be used in given 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.220
 If they are back playing again 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.880
 to the example of fifa which is one of the 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.010
 programs that the cell phone encourages us 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.790
 that we open it and that we see that it is 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:28.360
 slow we went out we closed them well and 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.490
 we get in here we give in using the 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.620
 celebration we wait as I said 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.790
 five minutes and we get to the 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:40.410
 application and you will see that there is the 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.410
 application will have improved 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:48.030
 good friends it seems to me that that would be 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:51.870
 everything right now I do not remember but if 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:56.189
 It would be everything to improve performance 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:59.610
 in their games and I hope that they have 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:02.039
 liked like you subscribe to my channel 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.259
 to see the other videos and we 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.259
 we see until the next video
