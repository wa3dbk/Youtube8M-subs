00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:18.150
 So give gas it's gonna start 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:20.910
 I firmly so I'm with the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.720
 super fast in berlin today i'm sitting 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.080
 in a car 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.430
 We are here at the berlin vital fair 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.560
 and because I have two weeks left 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.660
 until I match my goal kilometers 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.550
 I still need to dispute 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.960
 a few tips from her what to train 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.880
 I am most effective in the now 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.230
 next two weeks 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.090
 yes, I say so to run fast 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.010
 Of course, you need both 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.980
 his muscular efficiency 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.980
 similar to 43 that too fast for antonia 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:01:22.560
 you just have to be careful 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:29.729
 If the lady on the tax tremendously great 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.729
 a car driver convinced but with the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.210
 Interval training is the most effective 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.470
 method to get faster for the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.780
 ten kilometers I would actually you 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.780
 Guess something like five times three minutes 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.860
 to walk fast or 54 minutes at a time 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.200
 to do so 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:55.599
 how does that feel really fast? 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:56.340
 means a possible race pace completely 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.899
 important in ten kilometers 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.580
 preparation workout makes you a 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.200
 interval workout then take the tempo 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.300
 recently done this before with that 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.009
 good training and new kilometers 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.620
 but then you know what I'm interesting 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:19.709
 but I have not once I am 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.709
 just good 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.690
 otherwise motivated were foreigners 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.640
 run before so I would always on 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.170
 day before race the easy start 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.640
 making and doing quite well because you just 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.490
 So the legs loose war is called ten 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.830
 minutes a run 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.830
 Run a little faster for 23 minutes 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.460
 in the evening world on band off because of that
