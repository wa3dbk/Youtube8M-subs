00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
in the neck sting is the master code

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.619 
in the neck sting is the master code
which<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.970> four<00:02:16.209> things<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.569> just

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
which is the four things I just

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.869 
which is the four things I just
highlighted<00:02:17.260> these<00:02:17.709> are<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.950> most<00:02:18.220> important

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
highlighted these are the most important

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.199 
highlighted these are the most important
thing<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.500> cheating<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.620> game<00:02:20.860> because<00:02:21.670> if

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
thing to cheating the game because if

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.789 
thing to cheating the game because if
you<00:02:22.299> don't<00:02:22.480> have<00:02:22.629> it<00:02:22.810> if<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.500> don't<00:02:23.650> have<00:02:23.769> a

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
you don't have it if you don't have a

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.750 
you don't have it if you don't have a
magic<00:02:24.010> code<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.760> won't<00:02:24.940> work<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:27.340> four<00:02:27.519> lines

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
magic code it won't work it's four lines

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.400 
magic code it won't work it's four lines
only<00:02:27.970> just<00:02:28.299> because<00:02:28.569> that's<00:02:28.690> how<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.959> VBA

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
only just because that's how the VBA

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.190 
only just because that's how the VBA
cheese<00:02:30.250> system<00:02:30.579> works<00:02:30.760> I'll<00:02:31.239> separate<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
cheese system works I'll separate the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.620 
cheese system works I'll separate the
codes<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.859> two<00:02:33.010> different<00:02:33.190> lines<00:02:33.549> but<00:02:34.299> still

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
codes in two different lines but still

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.080 
codes in two different lines but still

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
will not use them because they are just

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.040
