00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I think it's massively informed because

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.449 
I think it's massively informed because
it<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.970> only<00:02:12.000> sort<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.020> learn<00:02:13.459> abilities

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
it not only sort of you learn abilities

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.420 
it not only sort of you learn abilities
agility<00:02:15.209> balance<00:02:15.510> coordination<00:02:16.110> it's<00:02:16.950> a

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
agility balance coordination it's a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
agility balance coordination it's a
fitness<00:02:17.700> thing<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.330> obviously<00:02:18.660> with<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
fitness thing and obviously with the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.650

think<00:02:22.410> what<00:02:22.680> we<00:02:22.830> do<00:02:23.040> here<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.450> important

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
