and<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.350> ministry<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:31.630> woman<00:03:32.630> and

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
and it is a ministry of a woman and

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.699 
and it is a ministry of a woman and
family<00:03:33.350> she<00:03:34.310> was<00:03:34.569> president<00:03:35.569> of<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.959> angel<00:03:36.109> and

I think she can she can do something and
so<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.910> governments<00:03:41.480> can<00:03:41.660> do<00:03:41.870> something

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
so the governments can do something

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.000 
so the governments can do something
about<00:03:42.980> rural<00:03:43.639> woman<00:03:44.180> these<00:03:44.600> five<00:03:44.930> years<00:03:45.380> so
