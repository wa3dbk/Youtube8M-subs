00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.370
 the inconvenient time we'll call from 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.430
 another name he held the zero that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.060
 authentic self-determination and wants the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.890
 things are because he is like this and that's it 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.599
 You think so, too. 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 authenticity lack of education are two 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.600
 totally different things 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.329
 I'll be talking to you of some 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.790
 images some figures in the world 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 that you should stay very 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.230
 far from them because at that moment their 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.920
 the chief supervisor can anyone be 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.190
 I look at its authenticity 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.710
 the first figure is the claim 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.289
 You know that guy who complains about everything that 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.719
 nothing is good talking about colleagues who 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.290
 talk about the work that talks about the company 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.210
 for example I met a woman who 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.040
 colleagues run away from it 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.350
 they did not want to have a good day at 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.080
 corridor of fear of the subject to continue 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.000
 because she complained so much that she put 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.689
 everyone in a difficult situation because 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.850
 the claim it exposes itself exposes the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.670
 colleagues exposes the work the situation is 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.740
 It is quite unpleasant to take 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.340
 caution 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.479
 Then there's the gossipy gossip people at 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.820
 corporate world is what burns worst is 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.630
 considered to be a very serious offense 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.140
 care is usually one that does not have 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.729
 arrives as he wants nothing and then attacks 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.490
 that he does not even know that story 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.560
 so look I'll tell you about this guy more 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.729
 It's because I really like it is for the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.100
 well of him 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.250
 Then there is the one who arrives as 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.700
 Look, I saw the guy and the cyclone having lunch. 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.880
 in the greatest intimacy but does not count and this 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.850
 for the boss and no sir have you seen 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.179
 understood that is the figure 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.819
 then he has the late he does not he 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.130
 knows what punctuality he is late 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.440
 both at times and in the delivery of 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.490
 work and that the worst it always has 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.830
 sorry 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.709
 he is late because the mother 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.600
 became the father ill son finally he 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.000
 delays in work because of the customer 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.050
 of the supplier's colleague he is always 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.650
 putting the responsibility on the other and there 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.739
 I cri cri cri it hurts is that guy 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.280
 boring on the foot of everyone who 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:45.810
 No one can take it once, I got one 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.630
 problem in training on the one 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.440
 dysfunction of a team all because of 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.930
 that they could not stand the image anymore 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.880
 of a colleague who was very black and 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.640
 gabriel asks for everything and then 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.400
 that good square gets along well with 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.500
 Everyone comes at the time he wants 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.200
 he picks up things he does not borrow 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.829
 much less returns 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.340
 At first the colleagues even relieved but with 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.239
 time no one can take so much face 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.810
 bad 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.290
 and then which of these figures bothered 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.780
 plus what do you think needs to change the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.269
 your behavior so that your 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.739
 professionalism you look better 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.739
 feel better in the corporate world 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.030
 stay tuned next come on 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.720

 totally unacceptable and you need 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.489

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.799
