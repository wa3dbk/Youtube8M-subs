00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
not be that hard in a couple of weeks

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.410 
not be that hard in a couple of weeks
but<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:52.799> right<00:01:52.950> now<00:01:53.000> senate<00:01:54.000> shards<00:01:54.299> are

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
but for right now senate shards are

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.880 
but for right now senate shards are
pretty<00:01:54.630> rough<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.710> this

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
pretty rough to get so that is this

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.819 
pretty rough to get so that is this
variant<00:01:56.719> of<00:01:57.719> dust<00:01:58.110> walker<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:58.680> there's

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
variant of dust walker and then there's

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.270 
variant of dust walker and then there's
also<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.189> variant<00:01:59.670> over<00:01:59.909> here<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.210> i<00:02:00.270> have

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
also this variant over here that i have

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.530 
also this variant over here that i have
this<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.549> uh<00:02:03.079> focused<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.200> discipline<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
this is uh focused on discipline and

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.330 
this is uh focused on discipline and
strength<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.110> doesn't<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.770> anything<00:02:08.160> for

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
strength so it doesn't do anything for

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.240 
strength so it doesn't do anything for
your<00:02:08.399> cooldown<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.090> your<00:02:09.899> special<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
your cooldown on your special but it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.410 
your cooldown on your special but it
does

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
does

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.640 
does
decrease<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.599> cooldown<00:02:13.989> for<00:02:14.140> your<00:02:14.290> grenades
