00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
pen which nicely is store it right over

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.760 
pen which nicely is store it right over
here<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:13.960> is<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.880> Wacom<00:01:15.880> pen

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
here so this is a Wacom pen

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.300 
here so this is a Wacom pen
and<00:01:17.270> by<00:01:18.270> tapping<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> screen<00:01:19.649> the

and by tapping on the screen the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.910 
and by tapping on the screen the
digitizer<00:01:20.759> board<00:01:21.179> recognized<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> pen<00:01:22.259> up

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
digitizer board recognized at the pen up

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.190 
digitizer board recognized at the pen up
on<00:01:23.100> top<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.579> we<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> power<00:01:24.119> button<00:01:24.240> it's

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
controller board that's in here up here

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.130 
controller board that's in here up here
on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> middle<00:01:38.909> you'll<00:01:39.060> notice<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> familiar

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140

on the middle you'll notice the familiar
iSight<00:01:40.890> camera<00:01:41.340> when<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:41.939> modify<00:01:42.719> the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
iSight camera when they modify the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.340 
iSight camera when they modify the
MacBook<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.670> make<00:01:44.819> a<00:01:44.850> mod<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.329> they<00:01:45.899> take<00:01:46.170> out

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
MacBook to make a mod but they take out

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.230 
MacBook to make a mod but they take out
the<00:01:46.500> eye<00:01:46.530> sight<00:01:46.950> put<00:01:47.429> it<00:01:47.490> aside<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.819> then<00:01:48.030> when

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the eye sight put it aside and then when

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.760 
the eye sight put it aside and then when
they<00:01:48.329> rebuild<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> front<00:01:49.140> they<00:01:49.319> actually<00:01:49.619> put

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
they rebuild the front they actually put

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.609 
they rebuild the front they actually put
it<00:01:49.860> back<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> original<00:01:51.619> iSight

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it back in so it is the original iSight

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.520 
it back in so it is the original iSight
camera<00:01:53.039> there<00:01:53.239> the<00:01:54.239> back<00:01:54.450> looks<00:01:54.780> pretty<00:01:55.380> much

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.729 
camera there the back looks pretty much
like<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:56.069> MacBook<00:01:56.729> because<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.599> the<00:01:58.409> ports

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739
