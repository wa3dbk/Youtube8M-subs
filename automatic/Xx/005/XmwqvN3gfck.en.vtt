00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.590
 how to put a staircase because turning 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.840
 difficulty level of hammer delivered in 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.670
 two elements ready to assemble the stopover 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.920
 rotating yaakaar can reduce 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.449
 ground implantation the assembly of 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.310
 elements does not present any real 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.230
 difficulties but you have to get help 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.960
 to lift everything when setting 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.689
 place you will need a staircase 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.699
 because turning with its accessories 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.920
 wood glue of a little plaster or 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.809
 prompt cement for two seals 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.550
 concrete pegs and advanced head 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.340
 of man provide you with a big 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 stepladder a meter from a pencil a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.440
 spirit level of a screwdriver of a 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.289
 percussion drill with a hammer of a 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.230
 set of 2c keys joined with a chisel 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.500
 of a cattail with a trowel tongues 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:01.739
 cat of a gauge predict a pair of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.270
 gloves and goggles for 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.739
 install a staircase you need 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.260
 have an opening whose 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.540
 task floor ap the hoppers it's 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.880
 the finished floor height to only finished which 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.110
 account for buying your staircase in 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.110
 up and down you need a 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.200
 clearance of 80 cm minimum to access 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.330
 at the stairs the height of the breakaway 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.470
 is an important data for not getting 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.009
 bang your head in passing 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.820
 count between 200 and 230 cm for a 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.619
 free passage 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.079
 especially if you are sometimes brought to 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.970
 to assemble furniture by the staircase 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.040
 width of the hopper therefore corresponds to 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.900
 that of the stairs and the length of the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.320
 hopper must provide enough 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.000
 height to escape upon receipt of 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.649
 bullets and the elements of your stairs 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.960
 it is advisable to apply without 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.729
 wait for a finishing coat on 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.860
 all surfaces that will be hidden 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.750
 after installation as the side of the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.750
 silt that will be pressed against the wall 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.840
 locate the top of the stairs rests on 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.690
 an assault solid attached to the opening 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.060
 of the hopper 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.280
 raise the thickness of the step then 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.940
 removed this measure from the ground 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.190
 finished tasks place and the tasso on 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.810
 the markers check the position at 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.520
 bubble level and trace its outline 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.830
 mark the piercing points through 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.550
 the heap jump with a tip or in 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.320
 marking with the screws set breakthrough leakage 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.930
 install dowels adapted to 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.000
 support life is then securely the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.520
 tasso 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.530
 if your hopper is lined with joists 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.410
 screwing says aso is done directly 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.600
 in the wood of the soul yves a to my 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:50.110
 hole smaller in diameter than 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.860
 vices facilitate screwing the set 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.930
 arrival post 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.180
 protect your soil with falls 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.920
 wood placed on your flight is 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.080
 to arrive so the point 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.750
 anchor the arrival pole or to 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:07.090
 the top secure the finish post with 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.190
 lag bolt and washer seemed to fly 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.440
 of arrival turning gap engaged the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.459
 trunnion and then assembled the two 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.459
 elements of the stairs 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:23.330
 ceret the assembly with the vices of 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:25.430
 reminder present the stairs well in 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.860
 lax of the hopper is raised to 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.810
 several to spread the placed load 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.060
 the good in support on the heap this support to 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.020
 dairy products and check that it is 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.020
 perfectly wedged 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.829
 ground blocking on the first step of the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.299
 down draw the piercing points of the 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.609
 squares loaded with block 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.400
 later the bottom of the silt 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:51.060
 the stairs back down the stairs time 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.810
 to pierce the ground to engage the ankles 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.480
 and vices and the ground squares fix 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.079
 the staircase replace the stairs against the 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.389
 shard and squares check that he 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:07.230
 is well wedged and screwed for the 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:09.389
 solidarize at the level of the pile saw vi is 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:17.280
 also the bottom brackets against the 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:19.829
 silt in order to complete the blockage at 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.019
 arrival post lay the ramp on the 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.940
 above the silt and present the cons 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.419
 the arrival pole life it's 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.419
 assembly 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.259
 then finally fix the starting post 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.870
 stick the caches the staircase delivered with 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:43.840
 caches to hide the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.490
 screwed assemblies glued lightly 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.490
 and in box and every cash 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.250
 to the connection between car turning and 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.199
 arrival shutters depressed a few 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.210
 tips man's head the spikes 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.160
 crosses the back of the riser 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.530
 then sinks into the thickness of the 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.349
 walking crows distributed under the 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.120
 arrival volley complete anchor placed 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.940
 under the bed my essence and the highs 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.740
 walls for more discretion it is 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.539
 also possible to put big 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.470
 ankle and vi through the silt 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.750
 to the wall 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.880
 all that remains is to withdraw the 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.949
 cardboard boxes on the steps and 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.110
