night okay and here's just a old tea jar
that<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.990> bought<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.440> one-off<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.950> couple

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
that I bought at the one-off a couple

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.099 
that I bought at the one-off a couple
bucks<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.969> I'm<00:00:15.179> not<00:00:15.299> even<00:00:15.599> claiming<00:00:15.780> it

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
bucks and I'm not even claiming it

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.630 
bucks and I'm not even claiming it
because<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.470> just<00:00:16.800> dumped<00:00:17.039> some<00:00:17.250> dough<00:00:17.430> off

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
because I just dumped some dough off

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.140 
because I just dumped some dough off
into<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> oven<00:00:18.510> okay<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.760> make<00:00:20.910> this

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
into the oven okay and so to make this

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.109 
into the oven okay and so to make this
bread<00:00:21.480> all<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.470> need<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.430> little<00:00:23.880> bit<00:00:24.000> of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
bread all you need is a little bit of

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.050 
bread all you need is a little bit of
salt<00:00:24.420> little<00:00:25.140> bit<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.439> yeast<00:00:25.820> some<00:00:26.820> bread

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
salt little bit of yeast some bread

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.759 
salt little bit of yeast some bread
flour<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.810> some<00:00:28.050> water<00:00:28.429> and<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.769> don't

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
flour and some water and really I don't

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.350 
flour and some water and really I don't
even<00:00:32.189> measure<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.669> anymore

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
even measure this anymore

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840 
even measure this anymore
but<00:00:34.170> let's<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.530> say<00:00:34.710> six<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> half<00:00:35.399> cups

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
but let's just say six and a half cups

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.410 
but let's just say six and a half cups
of<00:00:36.059> flour<00:00:37.640> tablespoon<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> half<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.210> salt

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
of flour tablespoon and a half of salt

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
of flour tablespoon and a half of salt
tablespoon<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.320> half<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.590> yeast<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.129> then

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
tablespoon and a half of yeast and then

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.529 
tablespoon and a half of yeast and then
enough<00:00:42.030> water<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.750> make<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.960> good<00:00:43.700> loose<00:00:44.700> wet

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
enough water to make a good loose wet

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.119 
enough water to make a good loose wet
dough<00:00:45.870> okay<00:00:47.600> but<00:00:48.600> really<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.440> think<00:00:49.890> about

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
dough okay but really I just think about

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.729 
dough okay but really I just think about
how<00:00:50.520> much<00:00:50.789> bread<00:00:51.149> I'm<00:00:52.140> gonna<00:00:52.469> want<00:00:54.020> in<00:00:55.020> my<00:00:55.379> jar

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
how much bread I'm gonna want in my jar

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.500 
how much bread I'm gonna want in my jar
because<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> good<00:00:56.550> thing<00:00:56.730> about<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.329> you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
because a good thing about this is you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.209 
because a good thing about this is you
can<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.750> pull<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.350> off<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> little<00:00:58.829> bit<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
can just pull it off a little bit at a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.840 
can just pull it off a little bit at a
time

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
time

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.779 
time
you<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.989> pull<00:01:01.170> off<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> hunk<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.010> bake

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
you know just pull off a hunk and bake

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.899 
you know just pull off a hunk and bake
it<00:01:03.000> leave<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> rest<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> dough<00:01:04.760> but<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it leave the rest of the dough but you

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.609 
it leave the rest of the dough but you
want<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> also<00:01:06.270> leave<00:01:06.570> room<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:06.840> two<00:01:07.140> expands

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
want to also leave room for two expands

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.969 
want to also leave room for two expands
so<00:01:07.799> we'll<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.130> put<00:01:08.310> about<00:01:09.439> half<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.770> in

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
so we'll just put about half of that in

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.340 
so we'll just put about half of that in
there<00:01:11.189> okay

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
there okay

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:23.210 
there okay
and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:20.930> that's<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.080> lot<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.439> yeast<00:01:22.619> time<00:01:22.920> I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and then that's a lot of yeast time I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.030 
and then that's a lot of yeast time I
know<00:01:23.460> right<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.840> probably<00:01:25.619> wouldn't<00:01:25.890> need

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
know right it probably wouldn't need

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:35.210 
know right it probably wouldn't need
that<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:28.549> there<00:01:29.549> some<00:01:29.729> salt<00:01:33.979> they<00:01:34.979> probably

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that much there some salt they probably

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.649 
that much there some salt they probably
wouldn't<00:01:35.700> need<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.150> much<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:36.860> cause<00:01:38.659> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
wouldn't need that much but cause you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.670 
wouldn't need that much but cause you
know<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:39.990> going<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:41.360> affirm<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
know it's going to affirm it

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.260 
know it's going to affirm it
plus<00:01:43.680> you've<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.130> yeast<00:01:44.490> left<00:01:44.790> over<00:01:45.119> from

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
plus you've got the yeast left over from

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.469 
plus you've got the yeast left over from
the<00:01:45.479> dirty<00:01:45.689> container<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.970> we'll<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.299> stir

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the dirty container and we'll just stir

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
the dirty container and we'll just stir
that<00:01:48.689> up<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.110> bit<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.470> mix<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.829> yeast<00:01:50.009> in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that up a little bit to mix the yeast in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.880 
that up a little bit to mix the yeast in
there<00:01:50.930> then<00:01:51.930> we'll<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.229> put<00:01:52.380> some<00:01:52.590> warm

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
there then we'll just put some warm

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:03.330 
there then we'll just put some warm
water

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.190 

then<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.460> want<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.790> incorporate<00:02:05.030> as<00:02:05.720> much<00:02:05.960> as

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
then you want to incorporate as much as

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.080 
then you want to incorporate as much as
you<00:02:06.320> can<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:06.980> don't<00:02:07.490> want<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.730> leave<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:07.970> he

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
you can you don't want to leave that he

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.520 
you can you don't want to leave that he
dry<00:02:09.070> down<00:02:10.070> at<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.340> bottom<00:02:10.900> this<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.140> good

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
dry down at the bottom this is a good

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.320 
dry down at the bottom this is a good
bread<00:02:12.860> recipe<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.490> get<00:02:13.610> somebody<00:02:13.940> started

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
bread recipe to get somebody started

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.300 
bread recipe to get somebody started
with<00:02:14.420> making<00:02:14.600> bread<00:02:14.930> because<00:02:15.800> it's<00:02:15.980> almost

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
with making bread because it's almost

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.860 
with making bread because it's almost
foolproof<00:02:17.470> time<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:19.010> takes<00:02:19.640> place<00:02:19.880> labor<00:02:22.870> so

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
foolproof time it takes place labor so

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.410 
foolproof time it takes place labor so
here's<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.350> dough<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:25.430> see<00:02:25.640> how<00:02:25.820> kind<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.210> wet

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
here's the dough you see how kind of wet

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.050 
here's the dough you see how kind of wet
it<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:26.720> okay<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:28.310> all<00:02:28.460> we're<00:02:28.640> gonna<00:02:28.730> do<00:02:29.030> is
