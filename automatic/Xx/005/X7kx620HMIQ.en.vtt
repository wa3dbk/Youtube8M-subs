00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello, youtube. 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 I'm here to holm oak 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.940
 how to plant a 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.580
 peach 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.080
 dwarf 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.980
 You're going to pick up a black plastic bag. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420
 19X25 and inside 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.180
 You will put a mixture 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400
 of 5 parts 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.340
 of yellow clay 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340
 with a part 

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:44.294
 of well-hewn manure 

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.294
 the chestnut 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.540
 should be planted in the bag 

00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:56.436
 ha 2 cm deep 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.520
 with this little point down here 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.520
 and 

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:10.528
 the regiment means 

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:12.528
 water the plant 3 times a week 

00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:14.528
 3 times a week 

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.361
 and after 60 days 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 the change 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.440
 already good to be transplanted 

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:29.589
 in definitive place 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.580
 in definitive place 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.980
 you will dig a hole 30cm wide by 30 long and 30 deep 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 In this hole, will you 

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:49.201
 the land that remained on the surface 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 with 10 liters of well-hewn corral manure 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.140
 100g triple superphosphate 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 and 200 g of araxa phosphate 

00:02:09.793 --> 00:02:11.793
 and 400g of wood ash 

00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:14.743
 make a fire 

00:02:14.743 --> 00:02:16.743
 then strip the ash 

00:02:16.743 --> 00:02:18.743
 and make the fire and then draw the ash 

00:02:18.743 --> 00:02:20.743
 and makes a blast 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.100
 transplant in the rainy season 

00:02:25.024 --> 00:02:27.024
 What is it to have? 

00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:29.634
 a good use 

00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:33.916
 and 

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:35.916
 the spacing 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.840
 and 7m by 5m 

00:02:45.174 --> 00:02:47.174
 and after you've planted 

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:49.174
 one year later 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
 You can already reap 

00:02:52.376 --> 00:02:54.376
