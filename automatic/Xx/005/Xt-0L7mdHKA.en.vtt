00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
went wild I remember we used to actually

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.869 
went wild I remember we used to actually
take<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.140> vehicle<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> track<00:00:38.129> used<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
take this vehicle to the track used to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.400 
take this vehicle to the track used to
run<00:00:39.030> some<00:00:39.210> really<00:00:39.540> impressive<00:00:39.780> times<00:00:40.230> with

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
run some really impressive times with

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.520 
run some really impressive times with
this<00:00:40.590> would<00:00:41.160> very<00:00:41.520> very<00:00:41.910> little<00:00:42.149> done

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
this would very very little done

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.450 
this would very very little done
actually<00:00:43.530> other<00:00:43.860> people<00:00:44.129> had<00:00:44.250> more

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
actually other people had more

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.910 
actually other people had more
modifications<00:00:45.180> than<00:00:45.360> he<00:00:45.510> did<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.140> yet<00:00:46.559> he<00:00:46.800> was

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
modifications than he did and yet he was

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.549 
modifications than he did and yet he was
still<00:00:47.100> running<00:00:47.219> faster<00:00:47.730> times<00:00:48.410> it's<00:00:49.410> all

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
still running faster times it's all

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.150 
still running faster times it's all
about<00:00:49.829> how<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.160> drive<00:00:51.920> does<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
about how you drive does have the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:04.880 
about how you drive does have the
compass<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.640> mirror<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.059> top

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.460 

is<00:01:04.950> that<00:01:05.610> nice<00:01:05.930> hood<00:01:06.930> scoop<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.410> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
is that nice hood scoop for the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.930 
is that nice hood scoop for the
intercooler<00:01:08.900> there's<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.700> duct<00:01:11.700> tape

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
intercooler there's a little duct tape

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.450 
intercooler there's a little duct tape
there<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.890> guess

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
there I guess

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.610 
there I guess
the<00:01:14.670> tabs<00:01:14.970> must<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.390> broken<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.170> fog

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
the tabs must have broken on the fog

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.450 
the tabs must have broken on the fog
light<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.560> easily<00:01:19.560> actually<00:01:20.010> or<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
light to get that easily actually or I

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.220 
light to get that easily actually or I
would<00:01:20.880> try<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> little<00:01:21.600> bit<00:01:21.750> better<00:01:21.900> job

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
would try to do a little bit better job

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.230 
would try to do a little bit better job
but<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.190> way<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> was<00:01:23.490> traded<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.940> is

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
but it's the way it was traded in is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.640 
but it's the way it was traded in is
