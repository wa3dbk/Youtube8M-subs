then<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.770> maybe<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.430> switch<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.060> use<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> so

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
then you maybe you switch and use it so

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.510 
then you maybe you switch and use it so
a<00:01:48.390> brush<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.110> you're<00:01:49.229> you're<00:01:49.470> brushing<00:01:50.220> away

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
a brush and you're you're brushing away

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.639 
a brush and you're you're brushing away
the<00:01:50.820> dust<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.840> sometimes<00:01:52.290> use<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the dust or sometimes use it as a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.960 
the dust or sometimes use it as a
grabber<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.220> grabbing<00:01:53.610> bits

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
grabber and you actually grabbing bits

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.850 
grabber and you actually grabbing bits
the<00:01:54.090> dinosaur<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.170> you're<00:01:55.290> constructing

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the dinosaur and you're constructing

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.130 
the dinosaur and you're constructing
this<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.490> skeleton<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.630> discover<00:01:57.960> what

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
this little skeleton to discover what

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.670 
this little skeleton to discover what
the<00:01:58.259> dinosaur<00:01:58.680> was<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.880> real<00:02:00.390> life<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:01.619> I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the dinosaur was like in real life but I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.069 
the dinosaur was like in real life but I
think<00:02:01.710> what<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> BBC<00:02:02.270> bring<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.869> sort<00:02:04.049> of

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
think what the BBC bring to the sort of

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.020 
think what the BBC bring to the sort of
the<00:02:04.140> wonder<00:02:04.409> book<00:02:04.530> experience<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
the wonder book experience is that is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.520 
the wonder book experience is that is
much<00:02:06.270> more<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.750> sort<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.020> dramatic

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
much more of a sort of a dramatic

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
friends on the way now this does mean

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.060 
friends on the way now this does mean
some<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.110> means<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.650> does<00:02:40.830> sort<00:02:40.980> of

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
some of this means that it does sort of

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.430 
some of this means that it does sort of
skew<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.430> slightly<00:02:41.850> younger<00:02:42.690> than<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.230> might

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
skew a slightly younger than it might

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.550

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
much they've learnt about the dinosaurs

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.090 
much they've learnt about the dinosaurs
that<00:03:03.120> they've<00:03:03.270> just<00:03:03.510> been<00:03:03.720> hearing<00:03:04.020> about<00:03:04.320> now

this<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.370> not<00:03:05.580> only<00:03:05.610> facts<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.450> figures<00:03:06.570> but

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
this is not only facts and figures but

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.420 
this is not only facts and figures but
that<00:03:06.990> you<00:03:07.080> have<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.410> remember<00:03:07.650> what<00:03:08.280> they<00:03:08.400> did

that you have to remember what they did
with<00:03:08.700> those<00:03:08.790> dinosaurs<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:09.450> one<00:03:09.690> moment<00:03:09.900> you

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
with those dinosaurs so one moment you

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.320 
with those dinosaurs so one moment you
weren't<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.380> were<00:03:10.470> feeding<00:03:10.740> a<00:03:10.980> dinosaur

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
weren't you were feeding a dinosaur

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.570 
weren't you were feeding a dinosaur
different<00:03:12.330> plants<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.350> likes<00:03:13.620> particular

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
different plants and it likes particular

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.750 
different plants and it likes particular
sorts<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.060> foliage<00:03:15.540> rather<00:03:16.170> than<00:03:16.380> others<00:03:16.760> so

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
sorts of foliage rather than others so

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.250 
sorts of foliage rather than others so
you<00:03:17.820> have<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.000> remember<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.570> if<00:03:19.020> for<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
what sort of food that dinosaur likes to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.850 
what sort of food that dinosaur likes to
eat<00:03:24.209> as<00:03:24.720> well<00:03:24.989> as<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.470> learn<00:03:25.830> the
