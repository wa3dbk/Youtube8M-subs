we're going to demonstrate here is s

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.550 
we're going to demonstrate here is s
goes<00:00:03.840> bead<00:00:04.770> pusher<00:00:05.330> this<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> very<00:00:07.319> useful

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
goes bead pusher this is a very useful

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.610 
goes bead pusher this is a very useful
tool<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.309> tires<00:00:08.639> like<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.300> here<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:10.440> have<00:00:10.590> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
tool on tires like this here we have a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.099 
tool on tires like this here we have a
385<00:00:11.630> 65<00:00:12.630> our<00:00:12.929> 22<00:00:13.620> 5<00:00:13.920> truck<00:00:14.280> tire<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.960> it's<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.080> a

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
385 65 our 22 5 truck tire and it's on a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.279 
385 65 our 22 5 truck tire and it's on a
steel<00:00:16.470> rim<00:00:16.740> it's<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.400> wide<00:00:17.609> tire<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.289> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
steel rim it's a wide tire and the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.900 
steel rim it's a wide tire and the
reason<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.770> need<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> book<00:00:20.220> be<00:00:20.430> pusher

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
reason that you need the book be pusher

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.170 
reason that you need the book be pusher
is<00:00:21.029> because<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.750> hangs<00:00:22.020> up<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> backside

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
is because it hangs up on the backside

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.519 
is because it hangs up on the backside
now<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.300> order<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.570> remove<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.019> tire<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
now in order to remove this tire the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.700 
now in order to remove this tire the
first<00:00:25.800> thing<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.710> remove

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
first thing that we have to do is remove

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.939 
first thing that we have to do is remove
the<00:00:28.769> first<00:00:29.130> bead<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.230> in<00:00:31.230> order<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.769> that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the first bead and in order to do that

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.700 
the first bead and in order to do that
we're<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.430> use<00:00:32.579> esko's<00:00:33.260> impact<00:00:34.260> driven

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
we're going to use esko's impact driven

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.440 
we're going to use esko's impact driven
tire<00:00:35.610> d<00:00:35.910> mounter<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.450> remove<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> first<00:00:37.140> bead

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
tire d mounter to remove the first bead

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.880 
tire d mounter to remove the first bead
so<00:00:39.450> I'm<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.690> insert<00:00:43.579> engage<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.000> impact

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
so I'm going to insert engage the impact

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:56.510 
so I'm going to insert engage the impact
gun

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.540 

and<00:00:57.030> remove<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.900> first<00:00:58.170> bead<00:00:58.470> now<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.250> can

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and remove the first bead now you can

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.460 
and remove the first bead now you can
tell<00:00:59.760> right<00:00:59.790> there<00:01:00.240> that<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.750> hanging<00:01:00.990> up<00:01:01.260> on

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
tell right there that it's hanging up on

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.500 
tell right there that it's hanging up on
the<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> backside<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> second<00:01:03.330> bead

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the on the backside on the second bead

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.930 
the on the backside on the second bead
so<00:01:04.200> now<00:01:04.440> all<00:01:04.620> I<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.950> do<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.190> remove<00:01:05.490> the<00:01:05.700> tool

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
so now all I can do is remove the tool

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.410 
so now all I can do is remove the tool
so<00:01:06.210> I've<00:01:06.330> reversed<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.910> we<00:01:08.910> remove<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
so I've reversed it and we remove the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:18.740 
so I've reversed it and we remove the
tool<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:09.990> tire<00:01:16.310> now<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.460> order<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.760> get

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
tool from the tire now in order to get

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.650 
tool from the tire now in order to get
that<00:01:18.960> second<00:01:19.380> bead<00:01:19.560> off<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.980> have<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.510> lean<00:01:21.510> it

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
that second bead off we have to lean it

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.110 
that second bead off we have to lean it
up<00:01:21.750> against<00:01:22.230> something<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.970> our

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
up against something and we have our

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.730 
up against something and we have our
stand<00:01:24.480> you<00:01:24.690> could<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.140> easily<00:01:25.260> lean<00:01:25.620> it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
stand you could just as easily lean it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.250 
stand you could just as easily lean it
up<00:01:25.830> against<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.250> wall<00:01:26.720> now<00:01:27.720> we're<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
up against the wall now we're going to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.469 
up against the wall now we're going to
insert<00:01:29.720> ESCOs<00:01:30.720> beat<00:01:30.960> pushing<00:01:31.470> device<00:01:32.479> we're

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
insert ESCOs beat pushing device we're

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.969 
insert ESCOs beat pushing device we're
going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.660> do<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.110> about<00:01:34.350> 10:00<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.800> 2:00
