 hello that such good friends welcome in 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.550
 this time I have a new tweet 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.410
 it's called camp time this tweet is very 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.529
 interesting because what allows us 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.349
 do is add a timer to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.630
 our camera from our phone good 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.000
 as you know the camera of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.110
 phone does not enter the timer what 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 The only thing that makes this tweet is to add this 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.660
 icon on the bottom of the button 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.239
 photo that is like a clock 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.940
 simply type on that clock and 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.180
 here we choose the number of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.460
 seconds that we want it to happen so that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.860
 our bed so that our picture is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.840
 taken by means of our camera by 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.110
 example if I put it here 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.000
 I am second 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.480
 and I give him ok I'll wait 6 seconds now 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.480
 the 6 seconds 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.330
 my camera is going to touch I'm going to take the photo 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.119
 automatically how do you see this is something 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.270
 very useful and something that I really believe 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.939
 what is missing from ios devices and 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.369
 good to install it 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:29.040
 it's very easy we just have to 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.920
 enter as always to idea 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.520
 and in Syria we will wait for him to load 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.220
 once it has loaded we will enter the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.150
 search section and we will search for this 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.880
 tweet that is called camp time this tweet 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.070
 is free on the network can big box by 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.580
 so we do not have to add any 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.950
 repository so we just walked in 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.770
 we look for we write camps time as 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.280
 see our part of up here goes to 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.470
 appear a install button and then 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.650
 when to confirm once 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.729
 done that we will have our 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.940
 timer without needing to do 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.130
 no adjustment or some change our 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.920
 phone automatically adds the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.840
 timer to our options good 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.060
 friends this has been everything I hope there is 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.400
 liked the video if you liked the video 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.800
 leave me a like comment how about them 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.190
 it seemed if our writings on the channel 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.190
 do it and nothing we see in the next
