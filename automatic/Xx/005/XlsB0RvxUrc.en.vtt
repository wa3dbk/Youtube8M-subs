needs the other white source so will

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.369 
needs the other white source so will
this<00:02:12.730> keep<00:02:12.940> keep<00:02:13.420> doing<00:02:13.720> what<00:02:14.200> we're<00:02:14.349> doing

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
this keep keep doing what we're doing

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.220 
this keep keep doing what we're doing
there's<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.160> mountain<00:02:15.930> will<00:02:16.930> hoarding

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
there's the mountain will hoarding

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.690 
there's the mountain will hoarding
outbursts<00:02:17.530> here<00:02:19.560> he<00:02:20.560> counters<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.130> still<00:02:21.519> an

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
outbursts here he counters is still an

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:38.520 
outbursts here he counters is still an
extra<00:02:21.970> two<00:02:22.090> damage

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.070 

so<00:02:39.130> it's<00:02:39.340> still<00:02:39.520> 5<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.180> he's<00:02:40.480> down<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> seven

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
so it's still 5 and he's down to a seven

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.930 
so it's still 5 and he's down to a seven
and<00:02:46.920> it's<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:48.010> temple<00:02:48.340> of<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.490> seat<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:48.819> he's

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
and it's a temple of the seat so he's

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.640 
and it's a temple of the seat so he's
going<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.090> be<00:02:49.180> easy<00:02:49.450> before<00:02:49.690> color<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:52.650> scoop

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
going to be easy before color and scoop

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.420 
going to be easy before color and scoop
so<00:02:54.010> not<00:02:54.520> much<00:02:54.850> knowledge<00:02:56.160> exactly<00:02:57.160> what<00:02:57.310> he's

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
so not much knowledge exactly what he's

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.750 
so not much knowledge exactly what he's
playing<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:59.069> looks<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.250> me<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.400> i<00:03:00.580> said

he'll<00:03:26.050> cutters<00:03:26.410> fine<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:27.040> don't<00:03:27.940> quite<00:03:28.600> know<00:03:28.660> if

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
he'll cutters fine I don't quite know if

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.240 
he'll cutters fine I don't quite know if
like<00:03:29.110> all<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.470> scabbard<00:03:29.769> is<00:03:29.920> fine<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:32.250> haven't

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
like all the scabbard is fine I haven't

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.770 
like all the scabbard is fine I haven't
seen<00:03:33.489> any<00:03:34.230> like<00:03:35.230> bio<00:03:35.500> blights<00:03:35.970> we<00:03:36.970> do<00:03:37.180> know<00:03:37.390> we

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
seen any like bio blights we do know we

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.479 
seen any like bio blights we do know we
can<00:03:37.959> eliminate<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.590> cars<00:03:38.800> that<00:03:38.950> are<00:03:39.040> bad<00:03:39.220> here

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
can eliminate the cars that are bad here

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.910 
can eliminate the cars that are bad here
wild<00:03:39.880> slash<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:40.660> does<00:03:40.840> give<00:03:40.989> us<00:03:41.230> four

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
wild slash so this does give us four

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.520 
wild slash so this does give us four
cards<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.420> think<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.019> going<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.260> be<00:03:44.290> Hall

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
cards so I think it is going to be Hall

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.430 
cards so I think it is going to be Hall
of<00:03:44.560> triumph<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.190> then<00:03:45.900> double<00:03:46.900> obelisk<00:03:47.320> of

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
of triumph and then double obelisk of

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.710 
of triumph and then double obelisk of
birds<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:50.850> maybe<00:03:51.850> double<00:03:52.269> halls<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:54.720> guess

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
birds and maybe double halls I guess

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.300 
birds and maybe double halls I guess
we're<00:03:55.840> going<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:55.989> go<00:03:56.079> triple<00:03:56.440> obelisk<00:03:56.860> I'm

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
we're going to go triple obelisk I'm

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.250 
we're going to go triple obelisk I'm
thinking<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:58.269> three<00:03:58.540> or<00:03:58.690> four<00:03:58.870> obolus

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
thinking that the three or four obolus

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.080 
thinking that the three or four obolus
is<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.440> bit<00:03:59.799> too<00:04:00.070> much<00:04:00.220> even<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.640> what<00:04:01.000> we

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
is a bit too much even it what we

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.500 
is a bit too much even it what we
haven't<00:04:01.360> seen<00:04:02.670> being<00:04:03.670> able<00:04:03.820> to<00:04:03.880> cast<00:04:04.120> versus

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
haven't seen being able to cast versus

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.539 
haven't seen being able to cast versus
like<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.690> bio<00:04:04.930> light<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.500> mean<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.160> drown<00:04:06.430> in

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
like a bio light I mean a drown in

crucible of the spirits this has got to

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.820 
crucible of the spirits this has got to
be<00:05:26.380> some<00:05:26.590> sort<00:05:26.740> of<00:05:26.860> five<00:05:27.010> colored<00:05:27.340> dragons<00:05:31.830> so

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
be some sort of five colored dragons so

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:41.010 
be some sort of five colored dragons so
swissbear<00:05:33.160> here

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:50.010 

and<00:05:41.620> I<00:05:41.710> guess<00:05:41.860> frenzied<00:05:42.250> goblin

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:58.710 

and<00:05:50.139> swim<00:05:51.009> for<00:05:51.039> three<00:05:51.430> down<00:05:52.419> to<00:05:52.569> a<00:05:52.599> 16<00:05:57.539> so<00:05:58.539> we

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
and swim for three down to a 16 so we

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.899 
and swim for three down to a 16 so we
have<00:05:58.900> 11<00:05:59.740> reliable<00:06:00.370> damage<00:06:00.699> in<00:06:00.819> our<00:06:00.940> hand<00:06:01.440> and

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
have 11 reliable damage in our hand and

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.290 
have 11 reliable damage in our hand and
just<00:06:03.909> scoops<00:06:04.240> okay<00:06:05.110> well<00:06:05.949> I<00:06:06.250> think<00:06:06.819> that<00:06:07.150> we

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
just scoops okay well I think that we

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.360 
just scoops okay well I think that we
are<00:06:07.509> the<00:06:07.750> worst<00:06:07.930> match-up<00:06:08.169> imaginable<00:06:09.069> for<00:06:09.310> a

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
are the worst match-up imaginable for a

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.129 
are the worst match-up imaginable for a
