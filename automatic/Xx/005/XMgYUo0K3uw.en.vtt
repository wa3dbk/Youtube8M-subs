00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.600 
full-bodied so you know it's okay I'll
give<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.209> see<00:03:25.450> its<00:03:25.720> average<00:03:26.760> it's<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:29.610> see

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
give it a see its average it's a see

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.660 
give it a see its average it's a see
across<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.000> board<00:03:31.360> it's<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.600> see<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.400> light

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
across the board it's a see for a light

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.440 
across the board it's a see for a light
beer<00:03:34.860> maybe<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.980> C+<00:03:36.459> for<00:03:36.670> light<00:03:36.790> beer<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.150> maybe

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
beer maybe a C+ for light beer and maybe

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:45.699 
beer maybe a C+ for light beer and maybe
a<00:03:37.540> C<00:03:37.840> or<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:38.080> c-minus<00:03:38.680> for<00:03:38.709> beer<00:03:39.130> in<00:03:39.250> general

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.830 

so<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.640> make<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.819> simple<00:03:47.239> it's<00:03:47.450> just<00:03:47.510> a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
so just to make it simple it's just a

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.140 
so just to make it simple it's just a
see<00:03:48.079> it's<00:03:48.349> average<00:03:48.829> so<00:03:49.099> I<00:03:49.430> mean<00:03:49.790> if<00:03:49.879> you<00:03:49.969> like

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
see it's average so I mean if you like

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.910 
see it's average so I mean if you like
light<00:03:50.390> beer<00:03:50.569> you'll<00:03:50.840> probably<00:03:50.989> like<00:03:51.260> this<00:03:51.290> is

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
light beer you'll probably like this is

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.750 
light beer you'll probably like this is
it<00:03:52.129> worth<00:03:52.250> paying<00:03:52.489> extra<00:03:52.849> for<00:03:52.969> no<00:03:53.469> no<00:03:54.469> way

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
it worth paying extra for no no way

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.789 
it worth paying extra for no no way
just<00:03:56.269> when<00:03:56.989> you<00:03:57.079> drink<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.379> light<00:03:57.560> beer<00:03:57.739> is

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
just when you drink it light beer is

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.020 
just when you drink it light beer is
probably<00:03:58.040> best<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.310> go<00:03:58.370> with<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.640> cheapest

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
probably best to go with the cheapest

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.399 
probably best to go with the cheapest
stuff<00:03:59.180> you<00:03:59.299> can<00:03:59.450> find<00:03:59.629> long<00:03:59.989> as<00:04:00.140> it's<00:04:00.290> not

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
stuff you can find long as it's not

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.220 
stuff you can find long as it's not
awful<00:04:01.400> like<00:04:01.579> maybe<00:04:01.790> beer<00:04:02.120> 30<00:04:02.420> light<00:04:02.689> which

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
awful like maybe beer 30 light which

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.649 
awful like maybe beer 30 light which
probably<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.709> bad<00:04:04.719> so<00:04:05.719> I<00:04:06.019> may<00:04:06.560> in<00:04:06.680> this<00:04:06.799> review

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659
