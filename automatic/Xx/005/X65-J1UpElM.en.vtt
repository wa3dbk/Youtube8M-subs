super high range the quantity is

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.570 
super high range the quantity is
humongous<00:03:00.130> for<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:01.140> price<00:03:02.140> because<00:03:03.010> look<00:03:03.489> at

humongous for this price because look at

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.810 
humongous for this price because look at
this<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:05.110> opens<00:03:05.380> up<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.830> lot<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.280> for<00:03:06.610> each

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
this it opens up a lot and for each

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.360 
this it opens up a lot and for each
application<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.780> use<00:03:07.810> super<00:03:08.620> less<00:03:08.890> as<00:03:09.070> I<00:03:09.160> told

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
application you use super less as I told

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.870 
application you use super less as I told
you<00:03:09.550> just<00:03:09.580> one<00:03:10.000> application<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:10.840> it's<00:03:11.170> done

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
you just one application and it's done

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.910 
you just one application and it's done
so<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.269> think<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.750> actually<00:03:14.350> will<00:03:14.470> expire

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
so I think it actually will expire

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.190 
so I think it actually will expire
before<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.519> manage<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.030> finish<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.810> use
