00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.529
 Tell me guys on youtube 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.809
 I'm here with my knife. Notice that the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.849
 tone paste a knife that I bought 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.460
 do the schraft but then the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.440
 research a little more and saw her 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.100
 it was not an ideal knife or better it was not 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.660
 nor a recommended knife for the task 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.680
 why she is not competent or 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.900
 either it does not have a continuous blade 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.590
 she has this screw here where we 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.320
 tighten blade and theoretically fix 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.030
 this blade and cut and knock it to the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.730
 people beat us to do jobs 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.309
 that we need to be there in the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.860
 practice does not work 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.559
 I've seen some reeves get that knife out a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.559
 guy leave youtube he puts a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.059
 Colby Porks think he in his case 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.910
 He tried a little there and said that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.969
 It worked but I decided to do it differently. 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.460
 and solved it only gives the blade in that part 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.619
 here I even by a magnet to this part here 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.680
 one he got a little weak to know 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.810
 if it had some iron content and it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.869
 made contact despite the most 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.790
 strong and on the knife blade but on time 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.130
 to probe how you can see there 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.890
 I know if you can see the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.200
 solder has not set in this part of the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.189
 cabula fixed only on the blade then 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.320
 who to buy this knife and by a chance tv 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.840
 The idea of doing what I did is not 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.360
 do it because I tried with welding mig 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.119
 I tried electrode soldering with no 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.729
 of the two probes there was able to 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.820
 fixing the student on the cable 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.020
 and I'll try another one, I'll go 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 soon to do is a one or two 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.280
 author funds still decided if I do 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.159
 a hole here tries to stick the blade too 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.159
 a professional drill or two 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.729
 holes and I will try to screw this blade 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:04.259
 on the cable to see if it solves this 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.090
 problem there gives alana stay is union 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.910
 to turn purple on the cable as people 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.099
 go knocking with the knife, i'll go 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.710
 To do this, I'm going to do some tests there. 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.840
 see if it will work this way 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.890
 Ah, I like it here for you, thanks people. 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.890
 a hug
