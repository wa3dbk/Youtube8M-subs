00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.880
 we play that it is very simple and useful 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.340
 It's a bookmark I thought I'd 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:18.869
 I did with newspaper even you can 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:21.090
 make any sheet in cash're here 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.250
 seeing he does not fall 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.230
 The cool thing is that over time the book is 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.210
 great our part here goes 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.820
 Then wearing page marker 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.950
 beautiful to be outside know why I go 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.930
 to use an origami sheet is 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.760
 stamped on one side and another but can 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 to be a notebook sheet even if any 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.020
 sheet was even white 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.309
 so we will do is put the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:01:04.409
 diagonal line and you will find this 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:05.129
 with this tip that will bend to the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.920
 square 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.360
 Now we're going to double again. 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.360
 finding these two points here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.619
 We're going to open it. 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.100
 Marquinha is watching the line will put 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.140
 this first little point here at the end 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.250
 on the line that you just 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:38.130
 mark in the middle will stay that way and is now 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.390
 just take these two tips here and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.390
 meet this one 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.920
 this is also true if you open only one 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.200
 you will only see that there is a 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.770
 kind of bag here 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:20.790
 now it's just going to push this well the talent 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:30.500
 in the goal pocket was also 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:30.500
 book that tell you that you can not 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.480
 right mark win 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.140
 so it 's not easy
