00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.679
 hi friends of Sardinian ton and italy 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.400
 welcome to this droid episode 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.510
 where we will briefly talk about project ara 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.530
 when we buy a terminal there 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.349
 we base on its characteristics 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.519
 internal techniques and components knowing 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.320
 that we will not have the possibility of 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.539
 change almost nothing without having to 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.310
 replace the whole phone well google 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.869
 with project area tries to change the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.669
 cards on the table offering a platform 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.679
 modular where we will be free to 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.259
 buy configure our own 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.150
 cpu terminal ram memory camera 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.530
 Internal battery will be all modules 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.300
 external that we can assemble and 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.220
 replace in the future without having to 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.860
 changing the whole device is a 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.940
 ambitious project of an evolutionary step 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.590
 very important where the user becomes 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.040
 master in the interest of his own 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.540
 purchase 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.950
 there are people who maybe buy a new one 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.570
 phone because it is interested in one 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.310
 best camera and in this case 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.260
 you can still save what you have 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.180
 want the project started 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.190
 take shape in 2012 the development 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.600
 main occurred in the motorola home the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.460
 team that took care of the project was 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.890
 transferred to the android division first 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.449
 of the sale of the company at 9 a 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.119
 almost functioning product was 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.530
 shown to google i 2014 but that 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.319
 unfortunately he was not able to 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.579
 complete the boot sequence anyway 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:14.289
 we won't have to wait long because 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.299
 this technology finally on 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.159
 Indeed market release is established with 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.170
 the first quarter of 2015 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.030
 google said it will be possible 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.609
 buy modules ranging from 50 to 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.139
 $ 500 and probably those 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.179
 we'll see already at the mobile world congress 

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:30.039
 in the coming weeks also the house 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.380
 of notes n'dour and well sell a starter 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.119
 kit for the cost of 50 dollars in order to 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.689
 give a boost to the spread of 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.249
 project 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.869
 the kit would include the frame a 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:40.450
 display the battery a processor of 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.829
 low end and the wifi module we will have the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.299
 possibility of buying frames of 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.259
 different sizes so we can 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.020
 choose whether to have a smartphone 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.909
 compact as we just have to wait 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.039
 and see if they actually design 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.359
 will arrive in the coming weeks let us 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.950
 know what you think of this 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.520
 project and smartphone concept 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.520
 modulate 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.630
 and also this short episode of droid 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.040
 has come to an end I recommend you

 leave a like a comment 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.160
 subscribe to the tom's hardware channel 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.030
 italy and maybe come and take a leap 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.390
