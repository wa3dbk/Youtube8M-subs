00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:07.210
 Yes Hi, let's get out of here that arrived this time 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.969
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:14.800
 What I bought this time is the extension note for desktop is the model number w 3 u 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.930
 1600 hq 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:24.279
 It is a thing called 8 gc 11. One piece of this memory 8 gb 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:30.099
 Well Kedomo it I bought a total of 16 gb this time in the fact that two 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:34.360
 Taking to the PC Memoria is Well probably because they are a very important in determining the processing speed 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.820
 I think 16 e doesn't use, but I bought it at the same time 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.070
 now 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.380
 I 'm doing it in my own way, but there was originally a mountain tree, but it's not that way 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.809
 When you say whether half-hearted numbers 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.510
 Kedomo I'm riding my chip set of mother board Well x 58 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:56.870
 It corresponds to a triple channel 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:01:01.489
 We shall say that it is possible to do at high speed to see it with one by three times the memory of the same standard 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:06.439
 Kedomo now Kedomo it's made to this time this two Nde dual channel 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.729
 Speed does not change much with bodily sensation whether it is triple channel or dual channel 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.500
 Because it was 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:16.030
 12 gigs with 3 drawings that can draw yonggi 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.650
 16 cut at 8 gb rather than a full channel 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.920
 I thought it would be better if it was dual channel but the capacity was more 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.939
 Pas it this capacity was in here. 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.270
 The price was about roughly pinching 6000 yen Well Amazon 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:37.090
 The front wing great memory is soaring 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.810
 If you do not buy when you want to buy Kedomo I think that the buy in price near half bought in the fact that loss 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.549
 It was 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.909
 So immediately attachment I want to Well attach forest Kedomo I know ago 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.760
 Very static 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:52.060
 It's weak, so it wo n't break- something that is hard to cause static electricity 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.940
 It is good news that you should have been there, but memory exchange 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.510
 It is said that it is best to do naked 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.350
 The other it so much memory is very weak in static electricity 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:06.160
 So yes I 'm not really good if it really increases now 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:11.520
 Please be careful and do not get in first 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:15.900
 Just pull out the pin or let's do from where you remove the memory 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:19.130
 This is I want to Once upon a time you come out is to take here 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.130
 Let's take another also take one 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.130
 If you look at the manual of the other board 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.770
 Where was the dual channel? 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.740
 Here and Cobo 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:40.070
 It will be said that two books as a caution when you put on 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:42.850
 To the contrary it gives direction you will break and not put in the same direction as the cut statement in this cut-out 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.740
 And I have to be careful there 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:51.370
 Dont cut it out 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.370
 I'm here it is necessary to put as well fit and there 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:01.910
 Also I put first the most was completed Yes Let's put also another piece in the same way 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.810
 Have you it here total 16 giga 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:10.010
 I still I'd have increased imitated used Gachotto Well Te 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.330
 We only use 12%, but first 14 arguments are waiting 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.130
 Oh no 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.130
 The best is we are able to this in anything anymore
