00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.660 
I'm at that I'm better at getting you
silver<00:03:01.829> maps<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.220> know<00:03:02.280> because<00:03:02.430> everyone's

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
silver maps you know because everyone's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.099 
silver maps you know because everyone's
already<00:03:02.819> figure<00:03:03.090> out<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.269> old<00:03:03.389> map<00:03:03.599> so<00:03:03.870> if<00:03:04.019> I

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
already figure out the old map so if I

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.619 
already figure out the old map so if I
can<00:03:04.489> I'll<00:03:05.489> think<00:03:05.849> people<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.180> new<00:03:06.329> maps<00:03:06.540> that

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
can I'll think people in new maps that

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.849 
can I'll think people in new maps that
they<00:03:06.750> haven't<00:03:06.900> played<00:03:07.139> it<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.500> that's<00:03:07.680> my

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
they haven't played it and that's my

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.039 
they haven't played it and that's my
strength<00:03:08.400> there<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.030> fortunately<00:03:09.870> I

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
strength there and fortunately I

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.210 
strength there and fortunately I
actually<00:03:10.230> worked<00:03:10.530> that's<00:03:10.799> what<00:03:10.889> got<00:03:10.980> me<00:03:11.010> back

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
actually worked that's what got me back

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.360 
actually worked that's what got me back
to<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.400> plus<00:03:12.079> but<00:03:13.079> everybody<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.590> seems<00:03:13.950> so

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
to a plus but everybody just seems so

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.069 
to a plus but everybody just seems so
much<00:03:14.609> better<00:03:14.819> than<00:03:15.030> when<00:03:15.180> first<00:03:15.449> you<00:03:15.780> know<00:03:15.870> try

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
much better than when first you know try

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.280 
much better than when first you know try
to<00:03:16.139> get<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.349> plus<00:03:17.299> you<00:03:18.299> see<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.870> lot<00:03:19.260> of

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
to get to a plus you see a lot of

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.390 
to get to a plus you see a lot of
Americans<00:03:19.709> have<00:03:19.829> actually<00:03:20.069> gotten<00:03:20.220> that

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
Americans have actually gotten that

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.640 
Americans have actually gotten that
skill<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.790> we've<00:03:21.030> seen<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.359> JP<00:03:21.690> for<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> little

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
skill that we've seen in JP for a little

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.289 
skill that we've seen in JP for a little
bit<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:23.190> know<00:03:23.220> all<00:03:23.549> because<00:03:23.910> they<00:03:24.030> the

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
bit you know all because they the

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.000 
bit you know all because they the
Japanese<00:03:24.989> players<00:03:25.169> had<00:03:25.349> it<00:03:25.470> for<00:03:25.620> about<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.799> day

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
Japanese players had it for about a day

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.089 
Japanese players had it for about a day
a<00:03:26.280> full<00:03:26.669> day<00:03:26.849> extra<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.510> think<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:28.919> course

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
a full day extra I think so of course

a great advantage or something you know

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.080 
a great advantage or something you know
like<00:04:58.530> maybe<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:58.979> try<00:04:59.490> something<00:04:59.789> else<00:04:59.909> is

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
like maybe you try something else is

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.640 
like maybe you try something else is
good<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:00.509> they<00:05:00.780> did<00:05:00.990> really<00:05:01.169> well<00:05:01.319> in<00:05:01.470> the

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
good that they did really well in the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.480 
good that they did really well in the
game<00:05:02.030> because<00:05:03.030> definitely<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:04.069> arrow<00:05:05.069> sprays

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
game because definitely the arrow sprays

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.460 
game because definitely the arrow sprays
are<00:05:05.849> definitely<00:05:06.449> out<00:05:06.479> of<00:05:06.599> favor<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:07.050> think

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
are definitely out of favor I think

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.939 
are definitely out of favor I think
