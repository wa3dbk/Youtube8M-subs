00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.750
 and greet everyone this is sir 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.660
 quinton find themselves today for 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.640
 the 5th tutorial on ps 2015 after having 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.230
 talked about the corner dp native shots 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.470
 francs and strikes we will be interested 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.090
 in the center in the game you surely have 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.830
 noticed it's very difficult to score 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.450
 against iia on centers or is this 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.010
 who takes the whole head and counts 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.000
 humans it's not that obvious then 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.739
 we will see in this video 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.879
 what are the different types of 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.739
 centers and what are the different 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.030
 head types also at the reception so 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.620
 we start with the classical center 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.540
 press round it's a pretty center 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.890
 tense it is a center that is useful 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.970
 when the player is really demarcated 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.620
 that he is really alone 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.670
 but when one of the beautiful defenders 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.409
 French days in general take 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.850
 all the head the second center alone 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.150
 without character so head twice round 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.229
 and the c1 seems much more dangerous 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.460
 especially if there is a day for poles 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.710
 as we just saw him with real him 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.030
 ceded center here is to use 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.090
 from time to time you have to vary especially 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.560
 against against humans we could see here 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.790
 not good it takes to missteps are very 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.470
 too close to the guardian because otherwise 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.030
 guardian learns it but it remains a 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.710
 center still very dangerous and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.510
 that it takes a little mess in the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.830
 area 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.810
 the third type of center is the 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.280
 floating center and those there I the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.509
 uses very often they are very 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.520
 centers that are dangerous 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.979
 worked so we make we look like 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.450
 telecentres who are the lan who are who 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.159
 go very high and that are enough 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.270
 worked so it's very useful when it 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.430
 are a lot of defenders in the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.500
 surface and especially when you have a 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.780
 very good player from the front head by 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.979
 example like ibrahimovic 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.689
 in my opinion this is the center most 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.189
 dangerous game even if you feel very 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.780
 very close to the goalkeeper the keeper is going 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.219
 have trouble intervene and it's 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.270
 centers that go dawn and defense 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.000
 so just have a very good 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.049
 player's head and it will be fine 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.509
 fourth type of center is the center 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.920
 far behind you l l support 1 euro on 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.390
 beyond 18 meters and the player goes 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.410
 can center from anywhere these 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.610
 descents that can be dangerous 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.220
 but they have to have someone well 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.450
 sure around the surface so at the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.620
 receiving centers you press 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.910
 art and puff a classic head 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.780
 everyone knew her there is everything 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.430
 the world uses may 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.770
 also exists the smashed head you 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.270
 press square and r1 the animation is 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.650
 a little different the player is really going 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.810
 give the balloon a big head 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.100
 and finally the stung head that few of 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.200
 players use the plane you press 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.970
 on square and triangle this is so this tutorial 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.970
 you helped me and it's great more
