new Easter eggs that have been
discovered<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.049> dragostea<00:00:13.679> as<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.610> saw<00:00:14.759> at

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
discovered in dragostea as you saw at

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.820 
discovered in dragostea as you saw at
the<00:00:15.000> start<00:00:15.269> there<00:00:15.570> there's<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.109> little<00:00:16.379> drawing

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
the start there there's a little drawing

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.279 
the start there there's a little drawing
or<00:00:17.039> an<00:00:17.160> equation<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.090> broad<00:00:18.330> boxes<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
or an equation on the broad boxes the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.529 
or an equation on the broad boxes the
drawing<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> map<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.340> paracel<00:00:20.970> storm<00:00:21.000> I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
drawing of the map is paracel storm I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.390 
drawing of the map is paracel storm I
think<00:00:21.720> that's<00:00:21.869> quite<00:00:22.050> obvious<00:00:22.400> plus

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
think that's quite obvious plus

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.620 
think that's quite obvious plus
something<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.060> can't<00:00:24.300> see

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
something we can't see

scribbled out equals Megalodon those are

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.380 
scribbled out equals Megalodon those are
the<00:00:28.080> jaws<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.650> Megalodon<00:00:29.010> ie<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.670> big<00:00:30.090> shark

the jaws of the Megalodon ie a big shark

the jaws of the Megalodon ie a big shark
which<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.779> course<00:00:30.810> we've<00:00:31.260> seen<00:00:31.560> already<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:32.189> an

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
which of course we've seen already as an

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
equation we can see the writing I had to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.110 
equation we can see the writing I had to
hide<00:00:37.050> part<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.250> were<00:00:38.370> making<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.879> too

keep finding now you might wonder to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
keep finding now you might wonder to
yourself<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:09.119> looks<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> obvious<00:01:10.320> why

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
yourself this looks kind of obvious why

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.100 
yourself this looks kind of obvious why
hasn't<00:01:10.920> anyone<00:01:11.189> noticed<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.939> yet<00:01:12.240> well<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
hasn't anyone noticed this yet well the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380 
hasn't anyone noticed this yet well the
reason<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> Box

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
reason is that this is what the Box

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.600 
reason is that this is what the Box
normally<00:01:16.020> looks<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.500> nothing<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
normally looks like nothing out of the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.789 
normally looks like nothing out of the
ordinary<00:01:17.640> no<00:01:18.299> pictures<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
ordinary no pictures on there this is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
ordinary no pictures on there this is
what<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.479> 95%<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> time

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
what you're going to see 95% of the time

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.410 
what you're going to see 95% of the time
on<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.619> new<00:01:22.770> dragon's<00:01:23.250> teeth<00:01:23.430> maps<00:01:23.759> now<00:01:24.390> I

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
on the new dragon's teeth maps now I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.030 
on the new dragon's teeth maps now I
think<00:01:24.540> I've<00:01:24.869> deduced<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.530> there's<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.830> very

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
think I've deduced that there's a very

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.980 
think I've deduced that there's a very
small<00:01:26.189> chance<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.090> map<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.509> load<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
small chance for a map to load with the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.289 
small chance for a map to load with the
easter<00:01:28.500> egg<00:01:28.619> texture<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> raw<00:01:29.520> boxes<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
easter egg texture on the raw boxes and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.319 
easter egg texture on the raw boxes and
I<00:01:30.750> think<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> only<00:01:31.860> happens<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.700> official

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
I think that it only happens on official

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.990 
I think that it only happens on official
preset<00:01:33.840> servers<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.369> does<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.700> mean

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
preset servers so what does this mean

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.630 
preset servers so what does this mean
well<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.020> think<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.710> either<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
well I think it's either this is a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.520 
well I think it's either this is a
genuine<00:01:39.119> hint<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.229> another

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
genuine hint that there is another

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.590 
genuine hint that there is another
Megalodon<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> big<00:01:41.700> easter<00:01:42.210> egg<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.360> be

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
Megalodon or a big easter egg to be

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.660 
Megalodon or a big easter egg to be
found<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.960> paracel<00:01:43.439> storm<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.490> always

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
found on paracel storm like we always

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.300 
found on paracel storm like we always
thought<00:01:44.970> from<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> beginning<00:01:45.840> or<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:47.130> just

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
thought from the beginning or it's just

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
thought from the beginning or it's just
a<00:01:47.399> bit<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> troll<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> bit<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.420> joke<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.049> I

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
a bit of a troll a bit of a joke but I

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.020 
a bit of a troll a bit of a joke but I
don't<00:01:49.380> know<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.680> sure<00:01:49.740> now<00:01:50.670> I'm<00:01:50.820> more

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
don't know for sure now I'm more

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.880 
don't know for sure now I'm more
inclined<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.600> believe<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> legit

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
inclined to believe that this is a legit

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.069 
inclined to believe that this is a legit
and<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.640> backed<00:01:53.970> up<00:01:54.180> by<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.479> fact<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.899> on

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and that's backed up by the fact that on

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.740 
and that's backed up by the fact that on
one<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> new<00:01:55.530> maps<00:01:55.770> lumpini<00:01:56.369> garden<00:01:56.939> under

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
one of the new maps lumpini garden under

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.249 
one of the new maps lumpini garden under
water

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
water

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.850 
water
written<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> wall<00:01:59.340> over<00:01:59.759> here<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.149> this

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
written on the wall over here is this

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.709 
written on the wall over here is this
again<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.430> see<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> same<00:02:03.000> map<00:02:03.360> that's

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
again you see the same map that's

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.080 
again you see the same map that's
paracel<00:02:04.259> storm<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.280> some<00:02:05.579> Chinese

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
paracel storm and then some Chinese

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.059 
paracel storm and then some Chinese
writing<00:02:06.600> next<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.170> which<00:02:07.320> translates<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
writing next to it which translates to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.850 
writing next to it which translates to
the<00:02:08.700> monster<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.360> real<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.470> believe<00:02:10.739> that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the monster is real and I believe that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.730 
the monster is real and I believe that

completely<00:03:23.840> normal<00:03:24.260> like<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:24.530> always<00:03:24.680> does<00:03:25.070> so

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
completely normal like it always does so

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.190 
completely normal like it always does so
again<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.150> leads<00:03:26.300> me<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.570> believe<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:26.930> this

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
again that leads me to believe that this

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.410 
again that leads me to believe that this
is<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.380> fake<00:03:27.710> but<00:03:27.980> this<00:03:28.370> dude<00:03:28.580> is<00:03:28.730> insisting

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
is a fake but this dude is insisting

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.190 
is a fake but this dude is insisting
that<00:03:29.570> it's<00:03:29.720> real

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
that it's real

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.990 
that it's real
but<00:03:30.380> again<00:03:30.650> I'm<00:03:30.830> joined<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.280> service<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.760> test

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
but again I'm joined in service to test

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.520 
but again I'm joined in service to test
it<00:03:32.150> out<00:03:32.240> and<00:03:32.540> it's<00:03:32.690> not<00:03:32.870> happening<00:03:33.290> it's<00:03:33.440> not

different<00:04:53.539> servers<00:04:54.050> it<00:04:54.289> happened<00:04:54.770> so<00:04:55.520> there

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
different servers it happened so there

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.939 
different servers it happened so there
it<00:04:55.879> is<00:04:56.029> like<00:04:56.659> I<00:04:56.689> said<00:04:57.020> I<00:04:57.229> think<00:04:57.379> there's<00:04:57.710> a<00:04:57.800> very

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050

experts<00:05:39.229> out<00:05:39.379> there<00:05:39.409> maybe<00:05:39.860> you<00:05:40.009> can<00:05:40.370> figure

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
experts out there maybe you can figure

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.240 
experts out there maybe you can figure
out<00:05:41.150> what's<00:05:41.629> behind<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.319> squiggle<00:05:42.800> because

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
out what's behind the squiggle because

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.399 
out what's behind the squiggle because
that<00:05:43.430> could<00:05:43.699> lead<00:05:43.909> to<00:05:43.939> some<00:05:44.270> pretty<00:05:44.810> good<00:05:45.110> clue

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
that could lead to some pretty good clue

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.409 
that could lead to some pretty good clue
is<00:05:45.560> obviously<00:05:46.039> also<00:05:46.550> we<00:05:46.939> still<00:05:47.120> haven't

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
is obviously also we still haven't
