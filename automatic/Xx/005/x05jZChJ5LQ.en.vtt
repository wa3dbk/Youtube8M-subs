what's nice about it is that it has a
lot<00:03:46.570> of<00:03:46.600> versions<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.740> for<00:03:47.980> example<00:03:48.370> if<00:03:48.490> you

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
lot of versions so for example if you

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:57.000 
lot of versions so for example if you
have<00:03:49.240> cs4<00:03:51.480> this<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.840> key<00:03:53.050> for<00:03:54.960> for<00:03:55.960> cs4<00:03:56.890> if

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
have cs4 this is the key for for cs4 if

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.180 
have cs4 this is the key for for cs4 if
you<00:03:57.130> have<00:03:57.250> cs4<00:03:58.030> betas<00:03:58.570> he<00:03:58.810> has<00:03:58.930> three<00:03:59.350> just

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
you have cs4 betas he has three just

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.820 
you have cs4 betas he has three just
three<00:04:00.340> beta<00:04:01.110> cs2<00:04:02.370> CSP<00:04:03.370> know<00:04:03.430> any<00:04:04.390> of<00:04:04.840> these

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
three beta cs2 CSP know any of these

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.730 
three beta cs2 CSP know any of these
versions<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:07.630> has<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.840> sear<00:04:08.200> on<00:04:08.290> under<00:04:08.530> four

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
versions it has a sear on under four

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:15.660 
versions it has a sear on under four
loops<00:04:09.210> or<00:04:10.210> not<00:04:10.540> for<00:04:12.030> at<00:04:13.030> those<00:04:13.360> it<00:04:14.290> has<00:04:14.490> all<00:04:15.490> of

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
loops or not for at those it has all of

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.770 
loops or not for at those it has all of
these<00:04:15.850> share<00:04:16.120> ownership<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:19.299> even<00:04:19.570> has<00:04:19.750> a

these share ownership it even has a

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.940 
these share ownership it even has a
Windows<00:04:20.410> serial<00:04:20.920> number<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:23.200> that's<00:04:23.590> how<00:04:23.830> it

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
Windows serial number so that's how it

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.350 
Windows serial number so that's how it
works<00:04:25.410> it's<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.470> very<00:04:26.680> nice<00:04:26.860> app<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.820> compared

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
works it's a very nice app and compared

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.410 
works it's a very nice app and compared
to<00:04:29.220> 80<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.430> screwed<00:04:30.760> I'm<00:04:30.910> just<00:04:31.150> showing

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
to 80 and screwed I'm just showing

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.810 
to 80 and screwed I'm just showing
together

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.720 

kei-chan<00:04:35.570> Scrooge<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.260> much<00:04:36.800> faster<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.430> just

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
kei-chan Scrooge is much faster you just

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.080 
kei-chan Scrooge is much faster you just
type<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.150> in<00:04:39.100> Adobe<00:04:40.100> Photoshop<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:42.910> just<00:04:43.910> get

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
type it in Adobe Photoshop and just get

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.910 
type it in Adobe Photoshop and just get
the<00:04:44.210> zero<00:04:44.420> number<00:04:44.800> that's<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:47.410> right<00:04:48.410> here<00:04:48.860> you

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
the zero number that's it right here you

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.220 
the zero number that's it right here you
have<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.520> install<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:50.090> cereal<00:04:50.540> box<00:04:50.810> and

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
have to install the cereal box and

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.410 
have to install the cereal box and
everything<00:04:51.590> but<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.550> know<00:04:52.670> it<00:04:52.850> might<00:04:53.120> have

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
everything but you know it might have

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.990 
everything but you know it might have
more<00:04:53.810> serial<00:04:54.230> numbers<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.830> more<00:04:55.220> versions<00:04:55.760> of

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
more serial numbers and more versions of

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.400 
more serial numbers and more versions of
each<00:04:56.180> app<00:04:57.490> so<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.910> recommend<00:04:59.420> you<00:04:59.510> having<00:05:00.110> both

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.460 
each app so I recommend you having both
of<00:05:00.560> them<00:05:00.680> like<00:05:00.920> I<00:05:01.070> do<00:05:01.130> right<00:05:01.430> here<00:05:02.320> if<00:05:03.320> you
