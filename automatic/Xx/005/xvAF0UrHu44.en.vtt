 Generally begin to engage in music 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.600
 some kind of brief history how do you 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.079
 life has led to this but this conversation is not 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.940
 for five minutes of course the parents brought 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.500
 us separately each time 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.670
 music schools do not fly 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.270
 started here how i was transferred sharply 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.910
 I think I'm the chief so well, that parents 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.559
 yes it is good so here and here it is 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.510
 as I said looks young and we would 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.750
 a bit like some motivation or something 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.310
 for them 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.670
 who can friends motivation 1 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:07.960
 never give up if you love your 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.090
 go about your business and everything will be 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.350
 OK 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.360
 the most real most important thing when 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.910
 don't give up because in order not to 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.910
 it was like life and bending down to you 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.670
 You are here if you love your business and networks 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:25.159
 bathe him if you understand that what 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.649
 you can't live without it all without it 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.869
 do it and don't give up because 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.819
 there will be many difficulties, in any case, and 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.140
 we still have a lot of difficulties ahead 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.289
 and 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.620
 but in any case it is always rewarded. 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.940
 here we have evgeny let's say 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.190
 they were given 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.230
 thanks, oh, how about motivation 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.850
 as the hero of one said very much 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.130
 famous movie through this practice 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.110
 exercise 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.220
 always be engaged in any condition 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.050
 in any of the 20 wolf counts 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.540
 a turning point in childhood is very important 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.430
 but that is, we recently communicated with one 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.540
 businessman sock such a thing that 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.380
 and if in childhood the child tasted 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.069
 wins it is much easier for him to rise 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.560
 above 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.049
 I think this is right and this again 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.689
 there is a moment of education when parents 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.079
 tell the child the right words when they 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:25.120
 believe in him when they support him 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.069
 like all of us probably the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.560
 I think 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.930
 yes this moment it is very important and taste 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.819
 Victory is of course very important. 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.319
 not the most important thing is the taste of defeat 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.549
 further it is important and imaginary part 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:44.129
 wins this position and they they 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.590
 happen and this here we have life 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.049
 there is death sorry what is sad but 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.329
 death is the part of life that 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.970
 there will also be victories and defeats 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.900
 birth of growth otherwise it will not be easy 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.160
 yes, Eugene, well, here you are now 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.780
 the beginning of the performance 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.670
 and what emotions but feelings you experience 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.220
 excitement can like or she already from all 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.250
 he is no more 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.450
 the excitement went away with 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:22.420
 with us the youth is looking at but censorship 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:25.420
 have we got the excitement gone with the first bye 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.350
 lambesc olya certainly not necessary cuts 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.890
 no need no, well, excitement but there is always 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.340
 when you realize that it is not easy 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.160
 club party namely 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.920
 people are going to the steward concert this 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.970
 of course the excitement rolls over 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.650
 well at least my guys are calm 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.800
 this outer shell of course worried 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.720
 naturally 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.390
 but such excitement is pleasant and joyful and 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.230
 such anticipation 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.230
 anticipating a lack of people 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.990
 in fact there are thousands of people just 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.990
 No, we are for 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.379
 we did not shoot the hall so we have a video 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.930
 everyone will think that there you are strong and you 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.580
 we throw a video with warm-up when we 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.030
