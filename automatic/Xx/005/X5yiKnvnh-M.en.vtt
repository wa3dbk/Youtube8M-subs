00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 He's a very strategic guy, I just want to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.680
 who has these attitudes thinks his actions 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.780
 think about your next moves is 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 show a game for you that matches 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.650
 Your part is a nice legal strategy. 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.660
 This game is really because it is good. 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.090
 and cheap by the games the league are 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.039
 Nice guys with 60 bucks and not a case 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.820
 since you can with few dollars 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.840
 have access to them on iphone iphone is 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.699
 a mobile phone business and and if you play it 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.189
 that they do not have separate studies there 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.059
 and you can play an hour the uncertainties 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.969
 his matter 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.010
 then it is a set of three separate, 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.260
 Come on, my dear. 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.950
 played after an hour after two 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.840
 hours 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.070
 then you can create multiple games and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.200
 while at the same time helping 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.289
 strange people played by 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.500
 there you think yours is looks good 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.449
 Dynamic minus game left celebrated 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.180
 all the time this is it is this 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.460
 happens because we need to give a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.410
 played we were without games same time 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.690
 when you sent a letter recommending or 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.309
 then the last play and told him to 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.119
 she is responding, it was not clear 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.119
 develop 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.500
 it is amazing how sometimes our 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.149
 laughing attitudes 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.590
 it goes there and was economical during a good 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.990
 time to buy an iphone an ipad 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.539
 over the weekend we spend 15 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.310
 real snack and other 21 go out there and 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.770
 when you are faced with a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.899
 u $ 1 spend hours searching to see if 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.070
 worth or sometimes not even that if 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.439
 content only with the library 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.060
 free apple games and apps 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.649
 but we understand it is still difficult 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.350
 convinced by mobile applications 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.289
 even more with so much crap out there 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.350
 the agent got pedro malan the game of 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.569
 today river aqmi is free and you should 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.630
 be immediately downloading and there 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.580
 Wait, wait, wait, I'm not going. 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.770
 speak soon of what is the first 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.810
 Wolf Producer Entertainment Game 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.340
 took that same kind of chess from the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.259
 it was digital only instead of parts 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.539
 white and black you have your choice 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.369
 five different classes and the 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.470
 Council are the only 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.690
 free and all other options come out 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.000
 for $ 2 each each class owns 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.640
 different units with soldiers archs 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.070
 Dwarven magicians ninjas and even look even 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.989
 Team Fortress 2 character 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.880
 The game works through shifts with 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.890
 attacks being made on 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.840
 a square board of which only breed 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.150
 distribution units and can move 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.250
 attack and use vehicles of each 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.230
 session costs one point for each shift and 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.820
 already has five possible actions the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.799
 the first few hours of the title may 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.660
 random that just hit the key you 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.269
 wait animations show out 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.060
 from here but only after trying to complete 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.709
 the way challenges that require show your 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.480
 true image of a game 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.459
 complex strategy 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.560
 each unit has different attributes 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.090
 so with the board itself is that 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.040
 we can call it so it's possible to create 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.930
 how different to attack so that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.730
 even after hours of experimenting 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.739
 will still amaze 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.959
 moreover, it is necessary to explain how 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.670
 the sharing system you need 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.799
 essentially will be online by 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.510
 internet only challenge mode is 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.370
 available after creating your account if 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.139
 begins to assemble the games and how we are 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.569
 talking about a turn-based game can 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.489
 anyone on the planet without 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.049
 worry about behind the connection what 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.240
 facilitates a large number of new 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.310
 players the big difference from this to 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.170
 all other games is that matches 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.910
 are not in real time you do your turn 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.620
 and opponents in all the time in the world 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.690
 to respond to their actions may 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.580
 take even a few days 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.200
 that force with what rigor he wants it to be 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.510
 a game that must be played in a 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.550
 completely different from what you are 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.020
 accustomed to 1 will be the cases that 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.130
 You 'll be in similar moments in 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.870
 different games 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.880
 during our first hours fulfilling 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.710
 the title we will have more than 30 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.020
 game while in some states still 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.940
 units in other battles already 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.720
 arrived the final results 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.720
 This is the nature of the game. 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.660
 for better or for worse it takes a 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.400
 time to get accustomed to this system 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.890
 I can not think about strategy. 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.900
 of each game than his opponent's only 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.730
 will respond two or three hours later 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.680
 your move making it very difficult not to 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.960
 remember why exactly it is left 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.270
 that blessed archer is the greatest 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.530
 negative point is the total absence of a 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.540
 local multiplayer 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.220
 it would be wonderful to be able to create a section 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.080
 to put the ipad on top of a 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.740
 table and work battles live with a 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.900
 friend 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.060
 concluding the game quickly from the 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.980
 beginning to end a single session that 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.540
 that's addictive, and then you 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.150
 install there but it's hard to be a 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.340
 minute your life when a little shift 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.720
 fast will pull your attention to the game 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.670
 How can you resolve the move in 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.280
 few seconds the temptation will only cover 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.020
 asking for a play to respond is strong 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.790
 because the games appear on the screen as if they 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.550
 be twitter messages for example 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.290
 he lady in reply to all young people 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.730
 awaiting your decision 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.130
 now that there is also a strong volume of 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.650
 advertisements that appear without stopping the 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.240
 each turn played and manned one of them 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.920
 If you want to end the 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.540
 have to shell out $ 2 to 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.800
 buy a new selectable team 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.840
 because it's not all bad since 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.700
 investment in the other game variety 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.710
 feature is cool here swing academy 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.270
 is also available for pc in steam 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.410
 the game allows interaction between 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.940
 platforms 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.770
 only that the computer the player needs 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.780
 pay $ 5 there is not a version 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.090
 free to talk to those who catch 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.670
 on the pc already releases face the team of 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.830
 characters from team fortress 2 when 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.600
 talking on your ipad and iphone will have the 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.910
 same content available there too 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.110
 can play wherever they want 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.700
 any way you want 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.360
 cross-platform sport is really 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.360
 total 

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:40.029
 there is no reason to stop 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:40.689
 conferring the aqmi is deep fun and 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:42.999
 addictive 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.739
 this slow game in regular is the only 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:46.149
 option for now that we expect 

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:47.409
 anxiously for the inclusion of 

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:48.759
 local multiplayer 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.979
 Can not argue is a title. 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:06:01.139
 really fun as infinity of 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:06:05.459
 players available to face the 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.459
 olympic games evolve to play game 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.990
 www.playtv.com.br and 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:12.699
 I'm growing when they reached 5 thousand 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.709

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.899
 written the Greeks who take you face 

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:19.360

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:21.219
 square there, do you want to know where 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.110
 what are the subjects that 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.569
 is putting on youtube is not everything in 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.879
 first hand is just to help and I hope too 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.649

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.419

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:35.619
 stay connected to everything inside 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:38.889

 You do not click will want to get beans. 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:46.479
