right in Salt Lake City Utah all

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.010 
right in Salt Lake City Utah all
different<00:00:31.880> types<00:00:32.059> of<00:00:32.239> modular<00:00:32.510> flooring<00:00:32.809> and

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
different types of modular flooring and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.720 
different types of modular flooring and
we<00:00:33.500> found<00:00:33.710> that<00:00:33.920> some<00:00:34.100> of<00:00:34.190> our<00:00:34.280> flooring<00:00:34.610> like

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
we found that some of our flooring like

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.060 
we found that some of our flooring like
the<00:00:34.879> basement<00:00:35.360> or<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.570> decking<00:00:36.019> flooring<00:00:36.650> was

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
the basement or the decking flooring was

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.770 
the basement or the decking flooring was
ending<00:00:37.430> up<00:00:37.550> in<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.940> garage<00:00:38.210> it<00:00:38.390> was<00:00:38.480> finding

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
ending up in the garage it was finding

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.270 
ending up in the garage it was finding
its<00:00:39.080> way<00:00:39.140> there<00:00:39.410> finding<00:00:39.800> its<00:00:39.920> way<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.190> it

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
its way there finding its way and it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.710 
its way there finding its way and it
really<00:00:40.460> is<00:00:40.580> not<00:00:40.730> designed<00:00:41.059> for<00:00:41.180> that<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:41.570> we'd

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
really is not designed for that so we'd

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.049 
really is not designed for that so we'd
set<00:00:41.989> out<00:00:42.140> as<00:00:42.320> a<00:00:42.350> car<00:00:42.680> guy<00:00:42.890> I<00:00:43.100> said<00:00:43.520> you<00:00:43.880> know<00:00:43.969> we

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
set out as a car guy I said you know we

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.430 
set out as a car guy I said you know we
need<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.270> build<00:00:44.450> something<00:00:44.690> that<00:00:44.989> can

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
need to build something that can

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.750 
need to build something that can
withstand<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:45.920> harsh<00:00:46.070> elements<00:00:46.219> of<00:00:46.520> a<00:00:46.579> garage

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
withstand the harsh elements of a garage

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.760 
withstand the harsh elements of a garage
well<00:00:47.360> now<00:00:47.480> this<00:00:47.570> goes<00:00:47.840> over<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.230> floor<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:48.680> all

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
well now this goes over a floor and all

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.650 
well now this goes over a floor and all
that<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.160> but<00:00:49.640> it<00:00:49.850> can<00:00:50.000> really<00:00:50.239> take<00:00:50.329> the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
that and but it can really take the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.150 
that and but it can really take the
pounding<00:00:51.050> can<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:51.230> take<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.530> load<00:00:51.770> of<00:00:52.040> a

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
pounding can it take the load of a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.040 
pounding can it take the load of a
garage<00:00:52.399> absolutely<00:00:53.329> what<00:00:53.510> we<00:00:53.600> did<00:00:53.780> here<00:00:53.960> if

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
garage absolutely what we did here if

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.569 
garage absolutely what we did here if
you<00:00:54.170> look<00:00:54.320> underneath<00:00:54.590> our<00:00:54.829> race<00:00:55.160> deck<00:00:55.340> tile

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
you look underneath our race deck tile

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.190 
you look underneath our race deck tile
this<00:00:56.180> support<00:00:56.600> structure<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:56.989> extremely

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
this support structure is extremely

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.290 
this support structure is extremely
stout<00:00:57.739> it<00:00:57.980> can<00:00:58.100> handle<00:00:58.250> row<00:00:58.520> loads<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.910> excess

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
stout it can handle row loads in excess

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.690 
stout it can handle row loads in excess
of<00:00:59.469> 25,000<00:01:00.469> pounds<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.309> one<00:01:01.430> of<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:01.579> big

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
of 25,000 pounds and one of the big

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.400 
of 25,000 pounds and one of the big
problems<00:01:01.910> with<00:01:02.059> garage<00:01:02.329> floors<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.899> the

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
problems with garage floors is the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.469 
problems with garage floors is the
moisture<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:04.759> see<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.000> bubbling<00:01:05.330> of

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
moisture and you see the bubbling of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.570 
moisture and you see the bubbling of
paints<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:05.960> epoxies<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.649> what<00:01:07.130> we<00:01:07.220> did<00:01:07.399> here

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
paints and epoxies and what we did here

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.830 
paints and epoxies and what we did here
is<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.759> can<00:01:07.880> see<00:01:08.000> there's<00:01:08.210> channeling<00:01:08.690> and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
is you can see there's channeling and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.410 
is you can see there's channeling and
this<00:01:09.140> allows<00:01:09.410> liquid<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.950> flow<00:01:10.039> freely<00:01:10.430> air<00:01:11.060> to

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
this allows liquid to flow freely air to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.830 
this allows liquid to flow freely air to
flow<00:01:11.539> that<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:12.560> prohibits<00:01:13.550> mold<00:01:14.450> mildew

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
flow that it prohibits mold mildew

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.050 
flow that it prohibits mold mildew
bacteria<00:01:15.350> buildup<00:01:16.040> so<00:01:16.220> it's<00:01:16.340> both<00:01:16.490> support

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
bacteria buildup so it's both support

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.940 
bacteria buildup so it's both support
structure<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:17.510> it<00:01:17.720> lets<00:01:17.900> it<00:01:18.049> breathe<00:01:18.200> lets<00:01:18.770> it

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
structure and it lets it breathe lets it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.890 
structure and it lets it breathe lets it
breathe<00:01:19.040> it's<00:01:19.310> alive<00:01:19.640> it's<00:01:20.000> high<00:01:20.360> now<00:01:20.750> it

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
breathe it's alive it's high now it

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.690 
breathe it's alive it's high now it
snaps<00:01:21.170> together<00:01:21.409> like<00:01:21.920> really<00:01:22.460> fairly

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
snaps together like really fairly

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.100 
snaps together like really fairly
quickly<00:01:22.970> right<00:01:23.240> yeah<00:01:23.450> we<00:01:23.570> made<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:23.900> true

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
quickly right yeah we made it a true

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.780 
quickly right yeah we made it a true
do-it-yourself<00:01:24.619> Lord<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.310> what<00:01:25.430> you<00:01:25.520> do<00:01:25.640> is

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
do-it-yourself Lord so what you do is

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.340 
do-it-yourself Lord so what you do is
you<00:01:25.909> simply<00:01:26.090> line<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:26.450> up<00:01:26.689> where<00:01:27.110> you're<00:01:27.259> gonna

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you simply line it up where you're gonna

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.460 
you simply line it up where you're gonna
start<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:27.890> start<00:01:27.950> snapping<00:01:28.460> it<00:01:28.549> together

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
start you start snapping it together

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.990 
start you start snapping it together
very<00:01:30.470> very<00:01:30.680> simple<00:01:31.040> you<00:01:31.159> could<00:01:31.280> do<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.460> two-car

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
very very simple you could do a two-car

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.730 
very very simple you could do a two-car
garage<00:01:32.330> in<00:01:32.570> less<00:01:32.750> than<00:01:32.930> three<00:01:33.320> hours<00:01:33.350> Wow<00:01:35.740> that

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
garage in less than three hours Wow that

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.920 
garage in less than three hours Wow that
is<00:01:36.860> simple<00:01:37.189> it's<00:01:37.640> kind<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:37.970> loop<00:01:38.390> system<00:01:38.780> or

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
is simple it's kind of a loop system or

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.210 
is simple it's kind of a loop system or
loop<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.320> what<00:01:39.409> do<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:39.500> call<00:01:39.650> a<00:01:39.680> loop<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.159> a

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
loop and what do you call a loop and a
