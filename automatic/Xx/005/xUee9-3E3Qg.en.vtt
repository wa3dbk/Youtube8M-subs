00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.389
 hi everybody this is our new video lesson on 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:15.360
 playing guitar that is today with us 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.630
 The fifth edition is a small anniversary for 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.679
 Well, I think for you too today we 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.300
 we will not study the seventh chord 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.710
 go into the theory that such a stop 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.499
 what if you didn't study music 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.270
 school you still do not understand today 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:34.860
 he will give six chords but 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.330
 that will not be very simple 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.670
 these will be the same chords that we are with 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:43.310
 you already know only a little bit 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.310
 changed but that rushed 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:51.480
 we all remember our chord d 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.180
 Now you need to know what is 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.540
 ds this card is a recipe chord this 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.930
 there will be a chord exactly the same only 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.930
 put a collar on top 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.970
 that is, put the first finger forefinger 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.150
 finger put on the second string 1 lat 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.400
 middle finger for three hours 2 fret 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:17.280
 ring finger on 1 string 2 is played 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:20.390
 4 strings here is our seventh chord further all 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.390
 we remember a chord 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.429
 what is a seventh chord this is the same chord 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:32.909
 only without middle finger here it is 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:35.700
 further chord em we all know it when 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.939
 we studied how a re chord is put 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.829
 sept with up the cord cleaned unnamed 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.480
 index finger is placed on the third 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.040
 string 1 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:52.150
 that's the whole chord on 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:57.040
 chord c how to put cs this card is 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:00.840
 before the seventh chord an elementary little finger set 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.840
 on the third string 3 fret 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.990
 that's the whole set the cord further chord g 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.590
 the base of these two fingers remains 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.460
 only presses and other fingers and then 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.960
 have mean and nameless and index 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.960
 finger on the first string 1 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.300
 here's a seventh chord salt without it weighs the accord 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.000
 and now I'll show you a chord which we 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.900
 you have not been taught that is h or b or c 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 accord 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.800
 because it is mainly played sets 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.790
 no other way 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.650
 but a seventh chord is played without a bar he 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.520
 put so now more 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.959
 little finger put on the first string 2 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.500
 ring finger put on the third string 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.580
 2 middle finger put on the fifth string 2 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.080
 put your index finger on 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.959
 fourth string 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.959
 first thing here 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.440
 she reported the port 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.130
 where to apply these chords you ask 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.630
 yes in ordinary songs and apply on 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.110
 An example will show you a little song patrol 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:19.459
 the moment that is Dad gave me a gun 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:23.209
 we c seventh chord and a grandfather and his grandfather 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.110
 threaded that is and grandfather plucked for 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.989
 seventh chord dies at the cord 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:35.180
 they were all gangsters and I usually became 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:37.640
 the patrolman had this and apply them 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.370
 can such a cool dish in and 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.590
 the sound does not give 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.670
 well here I think on these chords you can 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.670
 will stop 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.390
 he taught you 6 chords and now I 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.590
 I'll give you one such small sovetik 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.120
 before starting to learn new 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.390
 chords remember to 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.090
 taught before not to forget and be able to 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.770
 It is used well , in general, that's all 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.760
