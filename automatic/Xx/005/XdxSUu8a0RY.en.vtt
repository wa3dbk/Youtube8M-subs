00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:26.500
 Today 's Basic Nec Surely introduce gt 125 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:34.360
 As you can see, it looks like a simple bike that looks very natural 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:39.260
 Exactly like gt 250 of big brother while 125 come from class to say the same size of the car case 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:44.180
 It is finished in such a Rup place not overlooked just because it is 125 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:50.000
 Furthermore, in fact there are also tank capacity and 17 returns 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:53.450
 It's Ali also to Tteyuu essay touring with this bike by say 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.500
 For example even though it looks you place a simple do of 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:03.250
 Riding This is also a bike with a very neutral character . 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:08.500
 Bikina is a beginner 's bike basics 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.670
 That the Tteyuu basis of writing to learn if this bike is also a veteran rider 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:17.170
 Even if you get on this 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:22.409
 It is unique to this small displacement class, but I used up a lightweight vehicle and power 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:27.719
 I think it is such a bike that enjoys running a new area 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:33.270
 Although it is an engine, while adopting 125 parent and child living v type is adopted 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:35.490
 I think you can imagine it already , but there is no very smooth vibration 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.610
 To blow up 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:44.010
 You are good at expressing it further 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.640

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.940
 a 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:53.659
 Not only town riding but also Winding brings to the circuit 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.380
 You can wait for natural handling and attack it with it 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.090
 With a firm natural handling of the basic performance 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.869
 gt 120 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.340
 Of course it is the second bike of a veteran rider, but after all it says 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.640
 I want the rider who just got a license to run this bike and brush up his arm 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.640
 is
