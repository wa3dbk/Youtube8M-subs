00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 And the exposure of a trick of playing cards magic is very much it is before Hello Edo remains is the 531 this time 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.070
 I want to go there 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.240
 This magic is the last video 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:17.740
 Also that gold virtual was the clothes to people who say ace is on 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.940
 So, I think that I would like to start commentary First of all, there is a trick to this soul 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.520
 From above 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.930
 ac 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.730
 base 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.180
 It's an ace so it's another one 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.990
 king king 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:39.080
 Organize to be Gold End of Magic 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:40.800
 Prepare to begin with Magic and tell your opponent to choose a half soul 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.370
 I will 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.520
 It will choose perhaps partner to around 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:52.180
 And that chosen card is black to me 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:55.360
 You can get it, but you can't use this card anymore, so I'll keep it. 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.040
 And at this time I will first show an example 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.600
 Example 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.079
 in this way 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.280
 I will tell you to distribute evenly to 4 pieces 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.239
 This time child 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.239
 I will advance this card 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.890
 This 0 of Nodeeee 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:19.800
 Collectively we will already Michi Yamamura directly below and say you sweat 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.850
 And please and distribute them to pass it to the other party the same way 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.430
 Yes 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:30.380
 It is Kumaru Ward, there is a ward Maruko opponent 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.220
 The bottom of this card that the other party is in trouble is all 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.140
 It is king 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.140
 And the other party will change in the same way 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.500
 I 'm sorry 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.160
 It does not matter if the number does not match 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.580
 Don't worry if the number doesn't match And at the other party happiness kit 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.689
 Tell your opponent to flip this top card and you must 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.580
 Doing this street looks like ace comes out I say 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.290
 Ace is supposed to come out 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:18.280
 And this Yamatama that the ace of eco came out 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:23.270
 Ask me what is the opposite of the ace in the turn of the ace and maybe it's open 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.860
 I think I will answer King does not know Let's see this maybe the opposite 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.130
 Then King 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.130
 King 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.180
 King 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.220
 Clothes 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.400
 Well it is not become like say 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.400
 Thank you for watching the magic of the feeling that
