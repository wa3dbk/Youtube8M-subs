00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
opportunity that I can't turn down I

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.520 
opportunity that I can't turn down I
said<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:33.420> would<00:02:33.569> definitely<00:02:33.900> go<00:02:33.989> for<00:02:34.019> one<00:02:34.350> year

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
for some people the move just isn't

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.710

I<00:03:39.530> think<00:03:40.220> our<00:03:40.400> problem<00:03:40.940> is<00:03:41.000> at<00:03:41.150> the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
I think our problem is at the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.300 
I think our problem is at the
there's<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.960> lot<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.200> people<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:44.770> city<00:03:45.070> and

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
there's a lot of people in this city and

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.310 
there's a lot of people in this city and
we<00:03:45.400> have<00:03:45.580> a<00:03:45.610> hard<00:03:45.790> time<00:03:45.970> filling<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.390> ring<00:03:46.540> we've

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
we have a hard time filling a ring we've

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.089

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.000 

the<00:03:51.400> only<00:03:51.599> thing<00:03:52.599> I<00:03:52.719> think<00:03:53.019> is<00:03:53.319> when<00:03:53.739> they<00:03:53.860> go

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
the only thing I think is when they go

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
will be good for the

we don't really have a lot of support
but<00:04:30.150> used<00:04:30.570> something<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.020> get<00:04:31.110> used<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.730> you

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.190 
but used something you get used to you
know<00:04:32.850> a<00:04:32.880> few<00:04:33.330> times<00:04:33.510> we<00:04:33.600> talking<00:04:33.900> about<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.140> we

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
know a few times we talking about it we

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.630 
know a few times we talking about it we
compare<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.950> next<00:04:35.160> season<00:04:35.460> two<00:04:35.610> like

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
compare the next season two like

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.760 
compare the next season two like
Winnipeg<00:04:36.150> Jets<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.660> think<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.290> fans<00:04:37.560> are<00:04:37.740> just

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
Winnipeg Jets I think the fans are just

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.899 
Winnipeg Jets I think the fans are just
gonna<00:04:38.070> go<00:04:38.220> nuts<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.820> first<00:04:39.030> evening

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
gonna go nuts the first evening

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.209 
gonna go nuts the first evening
I<00:04:39.990> think<00:04:40.990> I'd<00:04:41.080> be<00:04:41.199> lying<00:04:41.409> if<00:04:41.589> I<00:04:41.709> said<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:42.099> the

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
I think I'd be lying if I said that the

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.189 
I think I'd be lying if I said that the
community<00:04:42.610> would<00:04:42.759> genuinely<00:04:43.149> be<00:04:43.509> affected<00:04:43.959> by

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
community would genuinely be affected by

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.439 
community would genuinely be affected by
the<00:04:44.259> loss<00:04:44.770> of<00:04:45.009> our<00:04:45.249> team<00:04:45.490> but<00:04:45.789> I<00:04:45.999> mean<00:04:46.300> at<00:04:46.419> least

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
the loss of our team but I mean at least

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.119 
the loss of our team but I mean at least
for<00:04:46.689> them<00:04:46.839> they<00:04:47.020> have<00:04:47.139> mississauga<00:04:47.679> to<00:04:48.009> go

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
for them they have mississauga to go

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.199 
for them they have mississauga to go
through<00:04:48.369> like<00:04:48.550> five<00:04:48.759> minutes<00:04:48.909> down<00:04:49.089> the<00:04:49.149> road

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:49.209 
through like five minutes down the road

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:51.540 
through like five minutes down the road
so<00:04:49.689> it's<00:04:50.469> not<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:50.830> know<00:04:50.919> there<00:04:51.399> could<00:04:51.520> be

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
so it's not you know there could be

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.399 
so it's not you know there could be
worse<00:04:51.699> things<00:04:51.759> since<00:04:52.689> news<00:04:52.929> of<00:04:52.959> the<00:04:53.139> move

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409

a<00:04:58.449> huge<00:04:58.830> transition<00:04:59.830> to<00:05:00.219> move<00:05:00.399> from<00:05:00.610> Brampton

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
a huge transition to move from Brampton

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.519 
a huge transition to move from Brampton
