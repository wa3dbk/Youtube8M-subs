zero<00:03:48.530> okay<00:03:51.020> these<00:03:52.020> are<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.530> ideas<00:03:53.280> for<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
zero okay these are the ideas for the

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.290 
zero okay these are the ideas for the

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
firework okay now for the color every

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.830 
firework okay now for the color every
time<00:04:00.330> you<00:04:00.780> change<00:04:01.020> these<00:04:01.350> numbers<00:04:01.680> here

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
time you change these numbers here

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.470 
time you change these numbers here
let's<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.890> just<00:04:05.190> delete<00:04:05.520> it<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.820> number<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.420> don't

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
let's I just delete it to number I don't

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.820 
let's I just delete it to number I don't
know<00:04:06.810> exactly<00:04:06.990> what<00:04:07.500> color<00:04:08.490> I'm<00:04:08.760> going<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.360> get

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
know exactly what color I'm going to get

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.190 
know exactly what color I'm going to get
and<00:04:10.830> you<00:04:10.950> see<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.160> got<00:04:11.550> this<00:04:11.820> blue<00:04:12.330> color

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
and you see I got this blue color

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.569 
and you see I got this blue color
so<00:04:14.090> every<00:04:15.090> time<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:15.360> just<00:04:15.889> change<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.340> color

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
so every time you just change the color

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.720 
so every time you just change the color
and<00:04:17.880> something<00:04:18.299> like<00:04:18.480> that<00:04:19.100> for<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.459> number

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
and something like that for that number

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.500 
and something like that for that number
you<00:04:21.419> can<00:04:21.660> get<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.230> different<00:04:22.530> color<00:04:23.270> I'm<00:04:24.270> gonna

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510

the board right now is messy I tried the

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.670 
the board right now is messy I tried the
execute<00:05:05.580> command<00:05:05.610> on<00:05:06.270> me<00:05:06.479> every<00:05:06.870> time<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.169> step

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
like this next time and for the clock I

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.520 
like this next time and for the clock I
already<00:05:33.990> show<00:05:34.169> you<00:05:34.229> the<00:05:34.440> clock<00:05:34.710> in<00:05:34.979> the<00:05:35.610> in<00:05:35.970> my

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
already show you the clock in the in my

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.880 
already show you the clock in the in my
last<00:05:37.530> command<00:05:38.039> tutorial<00:05:39.050> it's<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.229> very<00:05:40.530> fast

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
last command tutorial it's a very fast

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.510 
last command tutorial it's a very fast
clock<00:05:41.340> if<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.479> break<00:05:42.870> this<00:05:43.110> as<00:05:43.650> it's<00:05:44.130> coming

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
clock if I break this as it's coming

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.529 
clock if I break this as it's coming
back<00:05:45.830> if<00:05:46.830> I<00:05:47.070> break<00:05:47.400> this<00:05:47.640> it<00:05:47.910> going<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.330> turn

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
back if I break this it going to turn

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.159 
back if I break this it going to turn
into<00:05:48.930> redstone<00:05:49.770> block<00:05:50.300> so<00:05:51.300> it's<00:05:51.510> very<00:05:51.840> easy

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
into redstone block so it's very easy

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.950 
into redstone block so it's very easy
and<00:05:52.590> you<00:05:52.620> could<00:05:53.100> go<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.460> see<00:05:53.820> how<00:05:54.000> I<00:05:54.030> did<00:05:54.510> it<00:05:54.660> in

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
and you could go and see how I did it in

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.290 
and you could go and see how I did it in
the<00:05:55.970> previous<00:05:57.470> tutorial<00:05:58.470> so<00:05:58.850> that's<00:05:59.850> all<00:06:00.120> what

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
the previous tutorial so that's all what

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.390 
the previous tutorial so that's all what
