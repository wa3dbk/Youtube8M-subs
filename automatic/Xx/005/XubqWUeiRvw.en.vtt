00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
is like a little secret technique of

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.680 
is like a little secret technique of
mind<00:01:20.440> this<00:01:20.800> technique<00:01:21.250> has<00:01:21.400> been<00:01:21.640> with<00:01:22.150> me<00:01:22.180> for

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
mind this technique has been with me for

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.290 
mind this technique has been with me for
about<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.140> past<00:01:23.380> two<00:01:23.860> years<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.580> I<00:01:24.940> just<00:01:24.970> find

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
about the past two years and I just find

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.150 
about the past two years and I just find
that<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.570> works<00:01:25.690> great<00:01:26.080> for<00:01:26.380> people<00:01:26.530> with<00:01:26.710> very

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
that it works great for people with very

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.100 
that it works great for people with very
thin<00:01:27.460> eyebrows<00:01:27.940> typically<00:01:28.540> you<00:01:28.750> would<00:01:28.900> use<00:01:28.930> a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
thin eyebrows typically you would use a

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.050 
thin eyebrows typically you would use a
brow<00:01:29.500> gel<00:01:29.530> after<00:01:30.400> you're<00:01:30.610> done<00:01:30.850> with

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
brow gel after you're done with

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.610 
brow gel after you're done with
everything<00:01:31.300> I'm<00:01:31.810> going<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.050> use<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.440> before

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
everything I'm going to use it before

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.730 
everything I'm going to use it before
first<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.550> all<00:01:33.610> this<00:01:34.270> applies<00:01:34.750> some<00:01:35.110> brow<00:01:35.410> gel

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
first of all this applies some brow gel

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.920 
first of all this applies some brow gel
up<00:01:35.950> in<00:01:36.160> here<00:01:36.370> it<00:01:36.580> doesn't<00:01:36.610> have<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.270> be<00:01:37.420> perfect

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
up in here it doesn't have to be perfect

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.470 
up in here it doesn't have to be perfect
just<00:01:38.230> brush<00:01:39.070> it<00:01:39.100> on<00:01:39.340> there<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.790> lightly<00:01:40.270> and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
just brush it on there and lightly and

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.960 
just brush it on there and lightly and
let<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.140> dry<00:01:41.440> because<00:01:41.710> after<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.370> dries<00:01:42.670> if

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
let it dry because after it dries if

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.150 
let it dry because after it dries if
this<00:01:43.120> formula<00:01:43.600> does<00:01:43.780> not<00:01:43.840> get<00:01:44.170> flaky<00:01:44.620> but<00:01:45.010> what

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
this formula does not get flaky but what

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.820 
this formula does not get flaky but what
it<00:01:45.280> does<00:01:45.520> instead<00:01:45.760> is<00:01:46.300> give<00:01:46.600> your<00:01:46.810> brows<00:01:47.110> more

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
it does instead is give your brows more

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.010 
it does instead is give your brows more
texture<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:48.730> just<00:01:49.060> because<00:01:49.420> there's<00:01:49.780> that

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
texture to it just because there's that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.290 
texture to it just because there's that
gel<00:01:50.440> layer<00:01:50.920> on<00:01:51.280> there<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.790> will<00:01:51.910> give<00:01:52.150> your

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
gel layer on there it will give your

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.830 
gel layer on there it will give your
brows<00:01:52.570> more<00:01:53.050> of<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.820> heavy<00:01:54.820> effect<00:01:55.510> so<00:01:55.810> that
