we<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.890> too<00:00:44.070> much<00:00:44.250> into<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.550> let's<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:44.940> what

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
we get too much into it let's see what

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.100 
we get too much into it let's see what
else<00:00:45.090> comes<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> package<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:45.989> I

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
else comes in the package because I

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.510 
else comes in the package because I
always<00:00:46.320> tend<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.649> forget<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.219> until

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
always tend to forget to do that until

always tend to forget to do that until
later<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.870> three<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> half<00:00:49.440> millimeter

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

half millimeter jack right here you have

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.849 
half millimeter jack right here you have
the<00:00:56.370> USB<00:00:56.699> charging<00:00:57.360> cable<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.500> keep

the<00:01:38.549> layers<00:01:38.729> there's<00:01:39.119> rubber<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.049> then<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the layers there's rubber and then a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.920 
the layers there's rubber and then a
little<00:01:40.290> bit<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> metal<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.390> sponge<00:01:42.390> layer<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
then you've got 23 watt speakers i think

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.700 
then you've got 23 watt speakers i think
they<00:01:45.840> said<00:01:46.020> something<00:01:46.170> about<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.409> 40

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710

millimeter<00:01:47.070> driver<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.610> don't<00:01:47.790> know<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
millimeter driver I don't know the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.330 
millimeter driver I don't know the
specifics<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.689> pretty<00:01:49.409> decent<00:01:50.130> size

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
specifics of that pretty decent size

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.569 
specifics of that pretty decent size
hefty<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.119> guy<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.899> guess<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
hefty little guy here I guess this is to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.520 
hefty little guy here I guess this is to
give<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> little<00:01:54.210> bit<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> extra<00:01:54.720> reflex<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
give it a little bit of extra reflex a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.249 
give it a little bit of extra reflex a
little<00:01:55.920> extra<00:01:56.219> sound<00:01:56.729> bump<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.390> you've<00:01:58.079> got<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
little extra sound bump and you've got a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.560 
little extra sound bump and you've got a
couple<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.710> rubber<00:01:59.700> pads<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> bottom

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
couple of rubber pads here on the bottom

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.649 
couple of rubber pads here on the bottom
so<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.140> doesn't<00:02:01.530> slide<00:02:01.710> around<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.189> easily

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
so it doesn't slide around so easily

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.520 
so it doesn't slide around so easily
definitely<00:02:03.659> very<00:02:03.810> solid<00:02:04.170> once<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.409> actually

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
definitely very solid once you actually

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
definitely very solid once you actually
set<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.950> down<00:02:05.040> got<00:02:05.790> some<00:02:05.939> buttons<00:02:06.149> here<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
set it down got some buttons here on the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.449 
set it down got some buttons here on the
top<00:02:06.540> bluetooth<00:02:07.020> volume<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.829> down<00:02:07.860> you've

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
top bluetooth volume up and down you've

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.740 
top bluetooth volume up and down you've
got<00:02:08.610> power<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> side<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.720> just

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
got power here on the side you just

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.630 
got power here on the side you just
switch<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.440> three<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.190> half<00:02:11.280> millimeter

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
switch it on three and half millimeter

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.320 
switch it on three and half millimeter
in<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:11.970> i<00:02:12.090> said<00:02:12.270> earlier<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.810> five

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
in and that's about all there is to it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.370
