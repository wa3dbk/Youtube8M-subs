00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
the automatic like you know what's going

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.280 
the automatic like you know what's going

to happen and then third would be that

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.490 
to happen and then third would be that
you<00:04:27.360> whenever<00:04:28.360> your<00:04:28.810> opponent<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.470> playing

you whenever your opponent is playing

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.810 
you whenever your opponent is playing
covers<00:04:29.890> you<00:04:30.160> can<00:04:30.310> see<00:04:30.430> if<00:04:30.490> they're<00:04:30.640> only

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
covers you can see if they're only

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.170 
covers you can see if they're only
blitzing<00:04:31.720> one<00:04:32.050> player<00:04:32.400> they<00:04:33.400> should<00:04:33.669> not<00:04:33.880> be

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
blitzing one player they should not be

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.210 
blitzing one player they should not be
able<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:35.070> get<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:37.090> one-on-one<00:04:37.960> situation<00:04:38.350> where

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
able to get a one-on-one situation where

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.590 
able to get a one-on-one situation where
it's<00:04:39.370> like<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.640> defensive<00:04:40.150> inning<00:04:40.390> is<00:04:40.510> to

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
it's like the defensive inning is to

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.120 
it's like the defensive inning is to
love<00:04:40.780> tackles<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.290> he<00:04:41.380> block<00:04:41.650> sheds<00:04:41.919> and

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
love tackles and he block sheds and

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.880 
love tackles and he block sheds and
sacks<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.580> in<00:04:42.700> two<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:42.970> a<00:04:43.000> half<00:04:43.090> seconds<00:04:43.890> it's

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
sacks you in two and a half seconds it's

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.650 
sacks you in two and a half seconds it's
very<00:04:45.220> annoying<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.820> other<00:04:45.940> four<00:04:46.240> linemen<00:04:46.419> are

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
very annoying the other four linemen are

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.270 
very annoying the other four linemen are
not<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:46.960> dumb<00:04:47.169> they<00:04:47.500> would<00:04:47.620> go<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:47.919> help

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
not that dumb they would go and help

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.890 
not that dumb they would go and help
protect<00:04:48.639> that<00:04:48.730> I<00:04:49.090> think<00:04:49.510> there<00:04:49.630> should<00:04:49.780> be<00:04:49.810> a

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
protect that I think there should be a

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.590 
protect that I think there should be a
big<00:04:50.230> emphasis<00:04:50.620> if<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.889> block<00:04:51.730> like<00:04:52.090> if<00:04:52.450> you

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
big emphasis if you block like if you

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.320 
big emphasis if you block like if you
rush<00:04:52.990> less<00:04:53.320> than<00:04:53.530> three<00:04:53.770> players<00:04:54.070> that<00:04:54.850> you

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
rush less than three players that you

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.020 
rush less than three players that you
should<00:04:55.510> have<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.960> long<00:04:56.680> time<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.950> throw<00:04:57.310> not

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
should have a long time to throw not

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.330 
should have a long time to throw not
necessarily<00:04:58.510> every<00:04:58.750> single<00:04:58.990> time<00:04:59.169> but<00:04:59.440> you

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
necessarily every single time but you

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.310 
necessarily every single time but you
should<00:05:00.520> be<00:05:00.639> rewarded<00:05:01.180> less<00:05:01.419> for<00:05:01.810> you<00:05:02.230> know

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
should be rewarded less for you know

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.230 
should be rewarded less for you know
