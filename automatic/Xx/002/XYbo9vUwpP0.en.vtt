well<00:00:23.010> there's<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.400> thing<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.939> sure<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:25.019> life

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
well there's one thing for sure in life

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.339 
well there's one thing for sure in life
we<00:00:25.769> all<00:00:25.980> need<00:00:26.400> energy<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:28.140> absolutely

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
hot or warm objects let's have a look at

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.090 
hot or warm objects let's have a look at
a<00:02:09.560> few<00:02:09.890> less<00:02:10.220> obvious<00:02:10.820> ones<00:02:11.260> this<00:02:12.260> moving<00:02:12.799> car

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
a few less obvious ones this moving car

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.910 
a few less obvious ones this moving car
all<00:02:13.400> my<00:02:13.820> hand<00:02:14.120> pushing<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.810> has<00:02:15.320> kinetic

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
all my hand pushing it has kinetic

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.819 
all my hand pushing it has kinetic
energy<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:17.360> faster<00:02:17.959> it<00:02:18.110> moves<00:02:18.290> the

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
energy and the faster it moves the

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.390 
energy and the faster it moves the
greater<00:02:19.190> its<00:02:19.579> kinetic<00:02:20.090> energy<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.410> any<00:02:21.739> moving

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
greater its kinetic energy so any moving

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.110 
greater its kinetic energy so any moving
object<00:02:22.670> has<00:02:23.209> kinetic<00:02:23.780> energy<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:25.120> finally

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
object has kinetic energy and finally

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.330 
object has kinetic energy and finally

have<00:03:01.650> sound<00:03:03.810> electrical<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.019> thermal<00:03:06.689> we<00:03:07.689> can

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
have sound electrical and thermal we can

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.860 
have sound electrical and thermal we can
now<00:03:08.049> add<00:03:08.349> kinetic<00:03:09.280> energy<00:03:09.760> energy<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.720> a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
now add kinetic energy energy of a

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.380 
now add kinetic energy energy of a
moving<00:03:11.230> object<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.920> finally<00:03:12.489> potential

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
moving object and finally potential

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.899 
moving object and finally potential
energy<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.530> stored<00:03:14.920> energy<00:03:15.159> which<00:03:15.730> is

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
energy this is stored energy which is

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.960 
energy this is stored energy which is
ready<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.390> be<00:03:16.540> released

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.390 

so<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.120> question<00:03:22.569> is<00:03:22.720> what<00:03:23.290> forms<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.829> energy

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
so the question is what forms of energy

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.750 
so the question is what forms of energy
does<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.939> burning<00:03:25.540> candle<00:03:25.750> give<00:03:26.230> out<00:03:26.470> if<00:03:26.829> you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
does a burning candle give out if you

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.940 
does a burning candle give out if you
need<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.090> think<00:03:28.389> about<00:03:28.659> it<00:03:28.870> why<00:03:29.260> not<00:03:29.470> stop<00:03:29.799> the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
need to think about it why not stop the

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.159 
need to think about it why not stop the
tape<00:03:30.159> or<00:03:30.549> you<00:03:30.939> can<00:03:31.120> move<00:03:31.239> straight<00:03:31.510> on<00:03:31.780> for<00:03:32.079> the

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
tape or you can move straight on for the

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:40.080 
tape or you can move straight on for the
answer<00:03:37.379> so<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.739> answer<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.609> question

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
answer so the answer to the question

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.449 
answer so the answer to the question
what<00:03:40.450> forms<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:40.959> energy<00:03:41.470> does<00:03:41.799> a<00:03:41.950> burning

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
what forms of energy does a burning

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.349 
what forms of energy does a burning
candle<00:03:42.700> give<00:03:43.150> out<00:03:43.329> well<00:03:44.290> there<00:03:44.919> is<00:03:45.040> light<00:03:45.359> heat

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
candle give out well there is light heat

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.949 
candle give out well there is light heat
and<00:03:46.769> sometimes<00:03:47.769> sound<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:49.030> three<00:03:49.599> different

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
and sometimes sound so three different

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.860 
and sometimes sound so three different
types<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.680> energy<00:03:51.189> how<00:03:51.970> did<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.269> get<00:03:52.419> on<00:03:52.569> if

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
types of energy how did you get on if

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.050 
types of energy how did you get on if
you<00:03:53.409> weren't<00:03:53.650> sure<00:03:53.859> why<00:03:54.189> not<00:03:54.370> rewind<00:03:54.819> this

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
you weren't sure why not rewind this

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.520 
you weren't sure why not rewind this
section<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.629> go<00:03:55.900> through<00:03:56.169> the<00:03:56.290> different

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
section and go through the different

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.719 
section and go through the different
energy<00:03:57.220> forms<00:03:57.579> again<00:04:01.859> much<00:04:02.859> of<00:04:02.889> the<00:04:03.250> energy

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:03.729 
energy forms again much of the energy

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.819 
energy forms again much of the energy
used<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.120> run<00:04:04.359> our<00:04:04.479> homes<00:04:04.810> industries<00:04:05.650> and
