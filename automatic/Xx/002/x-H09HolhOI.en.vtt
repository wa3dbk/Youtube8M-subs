00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
is you're going to peel off enough to

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.249 
is you're going to peel off enough to
cover<00:00:22.589> your<00:00:23.630> glossy<00:00:24.630> piece<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.990> card<00:00:25.199> stock

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.890 
cover your glossy piece of card stock
here<00:00:25.730> so<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.820> would<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.119> kind<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.509> estimate

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
here so you would just kind of estimate

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.120 
here so you would just kind of estimate
it<00:00:28.259> about<00:00:28.980> how<00:00:29.160> long<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.460> want<00:00:30.589> and<00:00:31.589> then<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
it about how long you want and then you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.830 
it about how long you want and then you
would<00:00:32.390> rip<00:00:33.390> your<00:00:33.800> masking<00:00:34.800> tape<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.280> half<00:00:35.840> so

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
would rip your masking tape in half so

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.320 
would rip your masking tape in half so
you're<00:00:36.960> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.380> look<00:00:37.910> make<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.180> all

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
you're going to look make it that all

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.280 
you're going to look make it that all
the<00:00:39.450> way<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.840> you're<00:00:40.380> going<00:00:40.560> to<00:00:40.650> tear<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.400> in

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
the way here you're going to tear it in

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.670 
the way here you're going to tear it in
sections<00:00:45.770> like<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.630> but<00:00:48.630> then<00:00:48.840> today<00:00:49.050> I'm

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
sections like that but then today I'm

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.290 
sections like that but then today I'm
going<00:00:50.040> to<00:00:50.190> actually<00:00:51.440> tear<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:53.520> halves<00:00:53.850> in

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
going to actually tear the halves in

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
going to actually tear the halves in
half<00:00:55.130> so<00:00:56.130> you<00:00:56.190> would<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.520> tear<00:00:56.970> a<00:00:57.950> half<00:00:58.950> piece

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
half so you would just tear a half piece

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.530 
half so you would just tear a half piece
in<00:00:59.640> half<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.450> get<00:01:00.570> smaller<00:01:01.350> strips<00:01:02.360> now<00:01:03.360> I've

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
in half to get smaller strips now I've

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.289 
in half to get smaller strips now I've
done<00:01:03.810> this<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.009> full<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.119> like

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
done this with the full you know like

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.020 
done this with the full you know like
when<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.509> tear<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:06.960> half<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.520> two<00:01:08.759> halves

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
when you tear it in half the two halves

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.570 
when you tear it in half the two halves
I've<00:01:09.359> done<00:01:09.749> this<00:01:09.929> card<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.890> that

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.390 

sighs<00:01:14.580> masking<00:01:15.480> tape<00:01:15.710> but<00:01:16.710> I'm<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.190> use

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
sighs masking tape but I'm going to use

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.210 
sighs masking tape but I'm going to use
the<00:01:17.730> the<00:01:18.390> smaller<00:01:18.750> pieces<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.920> look

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the the smaller pieces to get this look

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.740 
the the smaller pieces to get this look
here<00:01:20.550> so<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.000> would<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.210> where<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.600> would

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
here so this would be where you would

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.580 
here so this would be where you would
tear<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.410> half<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.310> half

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.880 

I<00:01:25.969> got<00:01:26.969> four<00:01:27.329> pieces<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.990> masking<00:01:28.380> tape
