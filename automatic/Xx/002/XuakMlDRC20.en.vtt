00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.010
 we go back to football information and 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.130
 Of course we have information from 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.490
 there in the blue stadium I do not know if it is already 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.580
 the match between blue cross and the team 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.290
 from toluca one by one your team 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.860
 never reaches with goalscorer goal 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.020
 Paraguayan Pablo Velázquez and with this 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.680
 draw will be cross elimination 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.700
 blue 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.280
 and ends a difficult tournament for the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.809
 machine but what's important I think that 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.340
 it is no longer the past the important thing is 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:47.440
 know again what future you cross 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.930
 blue why 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.930
 we talk about changes in the directive that 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.559
 must come in the high commands week in 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.559
 the high commands 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.699
 you talk about technical direction you talk 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.399
 of sports management players 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.939
 sports management 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:10.189
 the heads already blue cross finish good 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.200
 to bryant and for the end reaches not what 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.479
 you know that it caught my attention and 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.149
 I do not want to make a mockery or anything like that but 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.590
 but you have seen bone, we know 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.270
 memo vázquez and we know what your 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.039
 philosophy the its character its way of being 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.590
 north when directing a football team 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.830
 when I have blue cross through 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.280
 El Chapo in a penalty in the first half 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.980
 he got like crazy memo vázquez and you give 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.850
 account says is not he is not he or is not 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.560
 it does not fit you or you're one or you're another 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.820
 I am convinced that he crossed the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.650
 needs to 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.370
 ferré or someone of character someone 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.960
 time that is more 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.420
 it has been very mention to the name of 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.670
 Fernando Tena to reach the team 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.610
 the machination as a character does not either 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.620
 it's because it's not what you ask, it's not like that 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.870
 like that with a warm heart or anything 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.580
 see your technician tested is a technician and 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.340
 has been champion in Mexican soccer is 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.720
 the last the last championship outside the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.890
 Cup championship is the last 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.060
 championship that has consul 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.240
 conditioning 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.740
 and that's where the issue of 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.140
 technical direction guillermo vázquez said 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.270
 I'm six months older with blue cross and 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.190
 I'm going to just said that when he finished the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.560
 national tournament that can against 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.900
 america is practically a fact that 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.640
 is this Mexican technician but we talk 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.550
 also from sports management to 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.980
 lake also the directive part is 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.630
 this team 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.400
 unfortunately again he will have 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.800
 that come a change to look for new 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 airs that unfortunately that your 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.630
 new airs - that the title and it is 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.340
 turning a true curse for 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.340
 the healing team the title theme 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.800
 already this goes beyond issues and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.560
 football grounds this is already going by 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.069
 mentality this leads by aspirations 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.040
 this is a slab 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.959
 gigantic that is not seen but that weighs 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.150
 hard in the breast with actions that 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.909
 themselves that cross themselves south 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.069
 they put the specific weight because 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.249
 become a big team and when 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.189
 you have those reaches then and the 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:12.409
 height then it 's harder and when 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.209
 you start falling and falling and falling 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.430
 win no longer win no longer go to this 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.639
 causes many problems I am 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.790
 a convinced that I say is not in my 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:26.419
 role say or judge but yes I am 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.939
 convinced that the extra football is 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:32.480
 affecting the institution to the club 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:34.609
 sports and the lawsuits between 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.889
 graduates alvarez the lawsuits with the 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.319
 cooperative all this one or the other 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:42.859
 way even if the player does not even know 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.650
 what's going on but the atmosphere is 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.940
 thin and can cause many 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.290
 problems 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.880
 if the process to talk about blue macros 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.250
 unfortunately it is to speak on behalf of 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.510
 a negative story in the past 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.830
 years that still remains is still 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.420
 near that second place in the cup 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.390
 liberators that was the last 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.360
 and great blue cross achievements that's why the 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.940
 gomera brown is a palencia for the 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.450
 oscar pérez the same saturnine josebr 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.410
 cardozo that reinforced that team 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.870
 the habit that made the gutierrez Juan 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.370
 Reynoso we are talking about a team of 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.919
 epoch that did not reach it for the title 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.820
 of liberator but good already what 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.650
 drag blue cross is dulling is that 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.720
 history of tip of great titles in the 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.060
 era of the 70 who lived that this 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.450
 Machine equipment important to highlight 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.150
 also that some photos of 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.260
 christian el chaco giménez at the stadium 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.930
 without public as I do thank 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.000
 not thanking the fans as they 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.500
 is dismissing these is a rumor 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.720
 at the beginning after your account 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.669
 twitter clarified I'm not going blue cross 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.470
 this one simply a thank you to the 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.110
 hobby that both supported one 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.419
 renews contract but is the outlined 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.919
 the being he sentenced that he does not go cross 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.110
 that's a guy with shame to me 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.289
 the iac likes a tier with others or not 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.930
 I like myself as a player 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.020
 he has pulled his face 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.490
 by this celestial machine what many 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.139
 many players who come to this 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.690
 team do not know what it means with 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.039
 surfing do not want to find out in the story 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.360
 that they have and think they reach 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.979
 any team and many of them say 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.900
 I have reached a great team but 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.669
 they really do not realize what it is 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.490
 if it's a pity what I was seeing 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.070
 blue cross although you could see coming in this 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.710
 tournament were not like the one before and also 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.060
 I believe that the most serious of all has been 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.770
 the defeat of the last tournament when 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.770
 lost with the America missing 2 minutes
