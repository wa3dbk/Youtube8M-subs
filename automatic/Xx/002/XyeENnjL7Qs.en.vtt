00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.880 
six of these experiments and make sure
our<00:02:17.980> snip<00:02:18.430> criteria<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.270> again<00:02:19.630> set<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.590> select

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
our snip criteria is again set to select

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.930 
our snip criteria is again set to select
nonsynonymous<00:02:21.670> snips<00:02:23.310> again<00:02:24.310> search<00:02:24.670> by<00:02:24.880> this

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
nonsynonymous snips again search by this

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.860 
nonsynonymous snips again search by this
criteria<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:27.000> again<00:02:28.000> once<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.480> search<00:02:28.660> is

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
criteria and again once the search is

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.030 
criteria and again once the search is
complete<00:02:29.290> we<00:02:29.560> can<00:02:29.590> save<00:02:30.100> this<00:02:30.370> as<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.670> snip<00:02:30.970> set

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.740 

we<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.190> then<00:02:36.310> compare<00:02:36.670> these<00:02:36.880> two<00:02:37.150> snip<00:02:37.480> sets

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
we can then compare these two snip sets

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.530 
we can then compare these two snip sets
in<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.990> Venn<00:02:38.140> diagram<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.760> green<00:02:40.000> segment<00:02:40.270> of

in a Venn diagram the green segment of

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.540 
in a Venn diagram the green segment of
the<00:02:40.660> diagram<00:02:41.110> represents<00:02:41.710> snips<00:02:41.980> unique<00:02:42.400> to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
the diagram represents snips unique to

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.910 
the diagram represents snips unique to
Kabuki<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:43.990> click<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:44.470> segment

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
Kabuki so if you click on this segment

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.490 
Kabuki so if you click on this segment
we<00:02:45.340> can<00:02:45.520> then<00:02:45.640> select<00:02:45.880> filter<00:02:46.500> filter

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
we can then select filter filter

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.540 
we can then select filter filter
selected<00:02:49.350> here<00:02:50.350> we<00:02:50.620> will<00:02:50.740> filter<00:02:50.950> only<00:02:51.220> these

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
selected here we will filter only these

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.740 
selected here we will filter only these
snips<00:02:51.910> by<00:02:52.360> their<00:02:52.660> snip<00:02:52.990> annotation<00:02:53.650> text

snips by their snip annotation text

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.120 
snips by their snip annotation text
again<00:02:55.750> we<00:02:55.959> are<00:02:56.080> looking<00:02:56.350> for<00:02:56.560> snips<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:56.950> have

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
again we are looking for snips that have

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.300 
again we are looking for snips that have
been<00:02:57.280> predicted<00:02:57.610> by<00:02:57.970> polyphen<00:02:59.130> to<00:03:00.130> be

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
been predicted by polyphen to be

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:09.470 
been predicted by polyphen to be
probably<00:03:00.850> damaging<00:03:06.630> click<00:03:07.630> search<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.930> filter

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
probably damaging click search to filter

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.020 
probably damaging click search to filter
and<00:03:11.400> finally<00:03:12.400> we<00:03:12.580> have<00:03:12.670> narrowed<00:03:13.000> down

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and finally we have narrowed down

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.650 
and finally we have narrowed down
thousands<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.959> possible<00:03:14.410> snips<00:03:14.770> to<00:03:15.070> just<00:03:15.660> 176

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660
