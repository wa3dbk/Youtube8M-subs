00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
compare I'll think of them like in a

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.760 
compare I'll think of them like in a
little<00:02:01.860> bit<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.960> they<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.290> came<00:02:04.590> in

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
little bit so that was they just came in

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.779 
little bit so that was they just came in
this<00:02:04.890> little<00:02:05.270> brown<00:02:06.950> case<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.160> open<00:02:08.429> tuck<00:02:08.580> this

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
this little brown case to open tuck this

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.670 
this little brown case to open tuck this
and<00:02:09.209> then<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.509> guy<00:02:09.720> like

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
and then this guy like

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.179 
and then this guy like
and<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.430> believe<00:02:13.180> these<00:02:13.599> are<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:15.299> ones<00:02:16.299> that<00:02:16.810> I

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
and I believe these are the ones that I

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.670 
and I believe these are the ones that I
had<00:02:18.189> before<00:02:18.849> these<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:19.840> not<00:02:19.870> they're<00:02:20.409> very

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
had before these if not they're very

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.720 
had before these if not they're very
soon<00:02:21.069> after<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:24.010> I'm<00:02:24.099> pretty<00:02:24.310> sure<00:02:24.459> these<00:02:24.579> are

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
soon after but I'm pretty sure these are

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.970 
soon after but I'm pretty sure these are
the<00:02:24.790> ones<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.180> got<00:02:25.209> before<00:02:25.540> these<00:02:27.060> again

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.119 

these<00:02:32.980> are<00:02:36.599> again<00:02:37.599> thicker<00:02:38.500> than<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
these are again thicker than the

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.750 
these are again thicker than the
previous<00:02:39.849> ones<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:43.180> they're<00:02:43.299> just<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:43.629> this

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
previous ones and they're just like this

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.539 
previous ones and they're just like this
and<00:02:47.790> they<00:02:48.790> have<00:02:48.819> like<00:02:49.889> this<00:02:50.889> little<00:02:51.129> red<00:02:51.519> thing

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
and they have like this little red thing

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.240 
and they have like this little red thing
is<00:02:52.120> skinnier<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.720> believe<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:54.220> then<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.489> has

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
is skinnier I believe and then it has

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:06.619 
is skinnier I believe and then it has
the<00:02:57.250> nose<00:02:57.519> pieces<00:02:58.920> let's<00:02:59.920> see<00:03:00.220> right<00:03:02.760> there

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:16.319 

anyway<00:03:07.629> and<00:03:08.430> then<00:03:11.519> again<00:03:12.519> they're<00:03:13.090> just<00:03:15.329> black

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
anyway and then again they're just black

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:24.150 
anyway and then again they're just black
they're<00:03:16.989> like<00:03:17.139> really<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:22.349> I<00:03:23.349> just<00:03:23.949> have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
they're like really and then I just have

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.430 
they're like really and then I just have
them<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.489> this<00:03:24.609> little<00:03:25.859> Disney<00:03:26.859> Princess<00:03:27.549> case

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:55.040 

try<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.489> get<00:03:45.610> them<00:03:46.060> mixed<00:03:46.239> up<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.810> can<00:03:53.370> kinda

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
try to get them mixed up you can kinda
