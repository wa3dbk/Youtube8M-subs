so<00:00:37.120> we<00:00:37.329> have<00:00:37.539> decided<00:00:37.989> that<00:00:38.170> we<00:00:38.500> are<00:00:38.530> going<00:00:38.950> to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
so we have decided that we are going to

did my master's program I did it in
classroom<00:00:46.510> environments<00:00:47.109> and<00:00:47.230> I<00:00:47.289> meant<00:00:47.559> the

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
classroom environments and I meant the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.380

a<00:00:49.629> classroom<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.769> largest<00:00:51.309> tool<00:00:51.550> you<00:00:51.699> have<00:00:51.730> to

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
a classroom the largest tool you have to

a classroom the largest tool you have to
teach<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:53.379> color<00:00:53.649> of<00:00:53.920> an<00:00:54.309> environment<00:00:54.999> is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
teach the color of an environment is

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.329 
teach the color of an environment is
extremely<00:00:55.719> important<00:00:56.199> and<00:00:56.350> I<00:00:56.559> chose<00:00:56.979> the

extremely important and I chose the

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.819 
extremely important and I chose the
colors<00:00:57.670> of<00:00:57.940> blue<00:00:57.969> and<00:00:58.300> purple<00:00:58.749> because<00:00:59.649> it's

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
colors of blue and purple because it's

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.219

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
that generates power and passion and we

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.309 
that generates power and passion and we
found<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.620> 15<00:02:35.100> minutes<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.700> cycling<00:02:36.450> stores

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
found that 15 minutes of cycling stores

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.530 
found that 15 minutes of cycling stores
enough<00:02:37.530> energy<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:38.010> run<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.430> classroom<00:02:39.000> for

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
enough energy to run the classroom for

enough energy to run the classroom for
an<00:02:39.660> hour<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:41.660> wanted<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.840> somehow<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:44.040> be<00:02:44.130> able

an hour I wanted to somehow to be able

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.080 
an hour I wanted to somehow to be able
to<00:02:44.580> have<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.630> kids<00:02:45.810> experience<00:02:46.410> what<00:02:47.250> energy

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
to have the kids experience what energy

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.259 
to have the kids experience what energy
is<00:02:48.269> they<00:02:49.080> pedal<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.590> bicycle<00:02:50.269> they

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
is they pedal that bicycle they

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.110 
is they pedal that bicycle they
understand<00:02:51.930> now<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.769> motion<00:02:53.100> can<00:02:53.970> be

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
understand now that motion can be

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.090 
understand now that motion can be
changed<00:02:54.690> into<00:02:54.930> electricity

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
changed into electricity

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.280 
changed into electricity
and<00:02:57.049> when<00:02:58.049> they<00:02:58.290> understand<00:02:59.269> that<00:03:00.269> they<00:03:00.780> have

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
and when they understand that they have

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.500 
and when they understand that they have
the<00:03:01.530> power<00:03:02.329> to<00:03:03.329> make<00:03:03.600> energy<00:03:05.150> then<00:03:06.150> it's<00:03:06.299> real

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
the power to make energy then it's real

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.539 
the power to make energy then it's real
easy<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.870> say<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.350> have<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> power<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:08.100> save
