00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.710
 mdc is therefore in the rhythm of competition and uefa cup duels that meet each other quickly 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.650
 follow-up this european week is good with his six victory over volendam 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.650
 Very sure that it was a must and that it is not always there 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.900
 easy and the european west that recharge for the next 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.360
 but i must say that the team did an excellent job mario leg 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.300
 put well in his attackers a pick they made yesterday also emerged there 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.849
 was not available for a long time due to injuries and mental problems 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.340
 debut you also notice that he is not completely match fit yet, of course one 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.530
 I haven't played any real matches all the time, but to be honest there 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.950
 you the sharpness and and the condition 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.900
 but he is now fully engaged in this, so we hope within a few weeks 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.760
 have new ones that could possibly play for nine minutes 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.210
 it was a long wait how close the neighborhood 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630
 because actually it is coming anyway 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.050
 there was no playing with a normal game so I was very happy about that 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.330
 to fall in 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
 from how far I have come 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.270
 rtv utrecht 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.120
 also mentally known men 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.240
 hopefully in the upper arm 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.190
 yes and your teammates were already trying to give you a goal today 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.090
 silent looking at you 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.890
 the woman was sick the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.580
 of course they have become a good friend of mine a few times with stitches 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.170
 to have a bit that your game rhythm misses it a bit 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.550
 male choir okay but no worries in the uefa cup, nsc plays at home against the 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.030
 spurs and how to do this and there is the away match of Wednesday against fir branch 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.120
 moscow in between 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.660
 a spicy pole 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.030
 yes that is clear there were no easy stress 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.560
 it's a matter of doing it well until ten minutes before time, otherwise you can 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.560
 maybe take a good result back there 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.320
 to one of the group 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.410
 yes, normally no chance, but it has proved so 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.350
 yes and now spartak moscow that is again a terribly difficult team one 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.640
 good soccer team in a big stadium to make sure we have something 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.420
 different 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.929
 so then morgan go so we can look at it with open arms 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.239
 but for the very difficult match stadium will certainly not be full so the 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.670
 ambiance other too 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.939
 but those moments were my team as we are to learn from and yes me 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.430
 have complete faith in the team so we can win from everyone
