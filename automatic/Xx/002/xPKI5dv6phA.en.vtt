in terms of build quality there's not a

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.319 
in terms of build quality there's not a
lot<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.649> difference<00:00:50.980> except<00:00:51.370> that<00:00:51.550> canon<00:00:52.120> has

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
lot of difference except that canon has

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.360 
lot of difference except that canon has
stuck<00:00:52.629> with<00:00:52.660> their<00:00:53.020> guns<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.620> left<00:00:53.920> the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
and Canon have really gone for a small

and Canon have really gone for a small
size<00:02:19.070> on<00:02:19.340> this<00:02:19.490> one<00:02:19.670> it's<00:02:19.880> only<00:02:20.000> 15<00:02:20.690> grams

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
heavier than the DX censored 60d okay so

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.640 
heavier than the DX censored 60d okay so
it's<00:02:26.210> certainly<00:02:26.570> very<00:02:26.660> streamlined

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
it's certainly very streamlined

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.530 
it's certainly very streamlined
especially<00:02:28.190> around<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.670> sides<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.180> can<00:02:29.330> see

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
especially around the sides you can see

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.090 
especially around the sides you can see
they've<00:02:29.720> removed<00:02:29.990> all<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.560> buttons<00:02:30.890> on

they've removed all of the buttons on

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.460 
they've removed all of the buttons on
here<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:32.030> side<00:02:32.210> is<00:02:32.450> really<00:02:32.810> nice<00:02:32.960> and<00:02:33.200> thin

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
here this side is really nice and thin

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.310 
here this side is really nice and thin
and<00:02:33.680> tape<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.040> out<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:35.090> does<00:02:35.300> have<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.600> mic<00:02:35.900> input

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
and tape it out it does have a mic input

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.930 
and tape it out it does have a mic input
which<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.530> great<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.070> know<00:02:37.100> canons<00:02:37.760> been

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940

now also as I said no pop-up flash the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.320 
now also as I said no pop-up flash the
build<00:02:54.620> quality<00:02:54.770> it<00:02:55.370> certainly<00:02:55.850> feels<00:02:56.000> nice

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
polycarbonate resin it feels about the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.100 
polycarbonate resin it feels about the
same<00:03:01.220> kind<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:01.670> weight<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.150> distribution<00:03:02.300> as

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
same kind of weight and distribution as

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.510 
same kind of weight and distribution as
its<00:03:03.709> as<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.340> 7d<00:03:05.560> but<00:03:06.560> unfortunately<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.250> can't

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520
