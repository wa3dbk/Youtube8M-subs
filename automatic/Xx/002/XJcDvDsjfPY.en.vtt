decided to get this palette because I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.270 
decided to get this palette because I
needed<00:01:06.720> something<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> start<00:01:07.650> practicing<00:01:08.159> my

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500

thirty<00:01:10.860> forty<00:01:11.250> dollars<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.640> our<00:01:11.880> contouring

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
thirty forty dollars for our contouring

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
palette so that's the reason why I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.370 
palette so that's the reason why I
decided<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
decided to get this one this is what it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.490 
decided to get this one this is what it
looks<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.460> has<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.759> contour<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.600> bronze<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
looks like it has a contour a bronze and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.160 
looks like it has a contour a bronze and
a<00:01:19.590> highlight<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> they're<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.270> patters<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
a highlight and they're all patters I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.780 
a highlight and they're all patters I
know<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:22.890> are<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.100> people<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.640> prefer

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
know there are some people that prefer

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510 
know there are some people that prefer
creams<00:01:24.299> when<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> comes<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> contour<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
creams when it comes to contour but I

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.990 
creams when it comes to contour but I
think<00:01:27.119> powders<00:01:27.659> aren't<00:01:28.320> great<00:01:28.590> either

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
think powders aren't great either

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.219 
think powders aren't great either
especially<00:01:30.000> when<00:01:30.479> you're<00:01:30.600> starting<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.049> learn

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
especially when you're starting to learn

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.760 
especially when you're starting to learn
how<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> contour<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.060> had<00:01:33.450> no<00:01:33.930> idea<00:01:34.079> how

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
how to contour because I had no idea how

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.539 
how to contour because I had no idea how
to<00:01:34.799> contour<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.320> once<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.979> palette<00:01:38.400> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
to contour and once I got this palette I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.630 
to contour and once I got this palette I
started<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> practice<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:40.100> I'm<00:01:41.100> getting

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
started to practice and I'm getting

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.990 
started to practice and I'm getting
better<00:01:42.270> every<00:01:42.840> single<00:01:42.869> time<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.759> even

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
better every single time so it even

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.060 
better every single time so it even
tells<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.450> where<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.840> contour<00:01:46.290> bronze<00:01:46.770> and
