00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.800
 Pull it over Pull it over I believe that what happened to Carmen 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.450
 we came 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.450
 the direction of the state college 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.199
 near the judge's final whistle 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.509
 this line 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.130
 this movement which is a drag movement 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.020
 it will end up generating very accelerated and regular wear on the band of 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.480
 increasingly shifting its definition of trajectory and its stability 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.950
 will be harmed 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.950
 maria netto and the geometry of the wheels the disable devices defended this 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.050
 is a system of measures that will leave all the wheels parallel now is the turn 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.249
 important for various reasons. 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.810
 the first would be to secure the vehicle well aligned and become more secure 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.840
 comfort 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.040
 because it is a well aligned car also becomes more behaved 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.350
 the direction begins to vibrate 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.290
 your car was unbalanced 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.030
 in general the process goes from the bar of the rest rope of the whole day 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.000
 The people that 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.830
 dungan contains error in a more aggressive way no hit did not calibrate the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.770
 regularly, and this lack of care and affection with the tires is what 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.690
 will determine if you are going to have to do balance with more 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.860
 frequency or less frequent 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.530
 if you go back to workshops 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.570
 the digital machine can predict what analysts say from small wheels 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.750
 recognized as all small lead plates 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.979
 The fact is that 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.390
 if you do not balance with a certain frequency 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.219
 vibrate resolve fast you will generate a regular wear band 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.520
 Shooting country you generate a sequel on the tire that no more launch 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.009
 You'll have to live with this vibration until you change it. 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.610
 with the caravan alignment and balancing should be done every 10 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.660
 thousand kilometers of the well almost does not leave the line the pope will make stop to the street of the 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.880
 palms
