right click it to open and it will bring
up<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.320> page<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:32.009> except<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.610> will<00:00:32.759> be

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
up a page like this except it will be

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.000 
up a page like this except it will be
blank<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> way<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.739> do<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
blank and so the way that we do the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.400 
blank and so the way that we do the
formatting<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.940> type<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.450> hello<00:00:37.140> like

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
formatting we can type like hello like

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.440 
formatting we can type like hello like
this<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.610> put<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> special

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
this and if we put in a special

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.510 
this and if we put in a special
character<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.170> will<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.410> able<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.829> change<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
character we will be able to change the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.190 
character we will be able to change the
color<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.270> different<00:00:42.600> properties<00:00:42.750> of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
color and the different properties of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
color and the different properties of
that<00:00:43.379> text<00:00:43.829> now<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> way<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.090> this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that text now the way that you get this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.380 
that text now the way that you get this
character<00:00:45.890> is<00:00:46.890> by<00:00:47.340> copying<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.239> your

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
character is by copying it on to your

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.520 
character is by copying it on to your
clipboard<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.200> can't<00:00:49.410> actually

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
clipboard because you can't actually

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.760 
clipboard because you can't actually
directly<00:00:50.219> input<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> book<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:51.870> if

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
directly input it into the book so if

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.470 
directly input it into the book so if
you<00:00:52.949> were<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> open<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> notepad<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.239> then

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you were to open up a notepad and then

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.139 
two and then one a special character
would<00:00:58.949> appear<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> could<00:00:59.640> go<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
would appear so you could go and do that

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.970

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and it won't work with the two and one

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
and it won't work with the two and one
above<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> letter<00:01:04.739> keys<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.159> has<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.610> from

above the letter keys it has to be from
the<00:01:05.850> number<00:01:06.240> pad<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.260> will<00:01:07.350> create<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the number pad and that will create a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.080 
the number pad and that will create a
special<00:01:07.979> character<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.909> highlight

it's<00:01:22.890> flashing<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.759> basically<00:01:24.119> waiting

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's flashing and it's basically waiting

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.990 
it's flashing and it's basically waiting
for<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.840> input<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.799> format<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> text<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
for your input to format the text so

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
for your input to format the text so
let's<00:01:27.330> press<00:01:27.600> E<00:01:27.869> which<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.290> for<00:01:28.470> yellow<00:01:28.619> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
type me yellow and that is actually

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.600 
type me yellow and that is actually
really<00:01:31.290> difficult<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:32.040> let's<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.400> back

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
really difficult to see let's go back

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.340 
really difficult to see let's go back
there<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.090> change<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.140> now<00:01:34.259> I've

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
there and change that so now I've

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.840 
there and change that so now I've
deleted<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> text<00:01:34.979> yellow<00:01:35.430> when<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.610> press

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
deleted the text yellow when I press

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.310 
deleted the text yellow when I press
delete<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.420> actually<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> go<00:01:36.990> back<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
delete it's actually going to go back to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.560 
delete it's actually going to go back to
that<00:01:37.439> zero<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.890> seven<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.150> input<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that zero and seven and we can input a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.929 
that zero and seven and we can input a
different<00:01:40.040> number<00:01:41.040> or<00:01:41.189> letter<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.790> let's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
different number or letter so let's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.929 
different number or letter so let's
press<00:01:42.119> C<00:01:42.420> which<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.020> red<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.700> see

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
press C which is for red and you can see

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.420 
press C which is for red and you can see
there<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.110> now<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.500> red<00:01:46.710> text<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.100 
there and that we now have red text and
I<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.030> again<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.540> press<00:01:48.720> control

I can do this again I can press control
V<00:01:49.140> bring<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> zero<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.310> seven<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
V bring up the zero and seven and this

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.539 
V bring up the zero and seven and this
time<00:01:52.110> let's<00:01:52.380> go<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.100> number<00:01:53.369> two<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
time let's go with the number two I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.010 
time let's go with the number two I
forget<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.119> one<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.540> think<00:01:54.659> it's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
forget what one that is I think it's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.490 
forget what one that is I think it's
blue<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:55.710> green<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:57.030> type<00:01:57.329> green<00:01:57.689> like

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
blue now it's green so a type green like

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
blue now it's green so a type green like
that<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.579> how<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.790> change<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.479> colors

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that so that's how you change the colors

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.020 
that so that's how you change the colors
and<00:02:01.079> there<00:02:01.979> are<00:02:02.100> sixteen<00:02:02.490> different<00:02:02.640> colors

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and there are sixteen different colors

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.280 
and there are sixteen different colors
that<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.600> total<00:02:03.960> there'll<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.200> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
that you can do in total there'll be a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.770 
that you can do in total there'll be a
full<00:02:04.500> list<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.860> them<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> description<00:02:06.570> box

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
full list of them in the description box

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.960 
full list of them in the description box
of<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.170> video<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.310> there<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.580> zero<00:02:08.849> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
of this video and but there is zero to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.020 
of this video and but there is zero to
nine<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.629> then<00:02:09.720> there<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:09.989> ABCDE<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> F<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
nine and then there is ABCDE and F and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.550 
nine and then there is ABCDE and F and
so<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.270> simply

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so you simply

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
so you simply
control<00:02:13.980> V<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:14.970> input<00:02:15.209> one<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.510> those

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
control V and then input one of those

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.559 
control V and then input one of those
numbers<00:02:16.050> or<00:02:16.260> letters<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.670> one<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.180> gold

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
numbers or letters and this one is gold

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.830 
numbers or letters and this one is gold
so<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:20.099> type<00:02:20.310> gold<00:02:20.610> like<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.330> then<00:02:21.690> you

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
so the type gold like that and then you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.610 
so the type gold like that and then you
change<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.349> color<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.739> your<00:02:22.890> text<00:02:24.319> so<00:02:25.319> we<00:02:25.500> know

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
change the color of your text so we know

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
change the color of your text so we know
how<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.830> change<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.489> color<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.940> text<00:02:27.150> but

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
how to change the color of the text but

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.180 
how to change the color of the text but
there<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.810> other<00:02:27.989> formatting<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.800> we<00:02:28.920> can<00:02:29.069> do

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
there is other formatting that we can do

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.860 
there is other formatting that we can do
as<00:02:29.280> well<00:02:29.459> for<00:02:29.910> example<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.390> see<00:02:30.569> at<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.720> top

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
as well for example you see at the top

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.600 
as well for example you see at the top
here<00:02:30.930> we<00:02:31.170> have<00:02:31.200> bold<00:02:31.500> text<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.069> underlined

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
here we have bold text and underlined

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.240 
here we have bold text and underlined
text<00:02:32.849> as<00:02:33.180> well<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> do<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.830> start<00:02:35.160> a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
text as well so to do this that start a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.890 
text as well so to do this that start a
new<00:02:35.370> line<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.849> what<00:02:36.030> we<00:02:36.120> would<00:02:36.239> do<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.599> remove

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
new line and what we would do to remove

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.180 
new line and what we would do to remove
all<00:02:37.110> formatting<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.800> we've<00:02:37.980> previously

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
all formatting that we've previously

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.729 
all formatting that we've previously
done<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:39.209> put<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.660> special<00:02:39.900> character<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.560> and

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
done is put the special character in and

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.800 
done is put the special character in and
press<00:02:40.920> off<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.489> that's<00:02:41.640> our<00:02:41.910> for<00:02:42.150> reset<00:02:42.630> and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
press off so that's our for reset and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.229 
press off so that's our for reset and
what<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.410> see<00:02:43.650> happens<00:02:44.040> here<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.849> I'll<00:02:45.030> type

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
what you see happens here and I'll type

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.300 
what you see happens here and I'll type
in<00:02:45.390> reset<00:02:45.750> there<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.230> see<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.650> still<00:02:46.980> gold

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
in reset there you can see is still gold

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.490 
in reset there you can see is still gold
so<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:47.819> thing<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.030> realize<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
so one thing to realize is that the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.470 
so one thing to realize is that the
reset<00:02:49.860> doesn't<00:02:50.220> apply<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.819> color<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.269> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
reset doesn't apply to the color of the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.660 
reset doesn't apply to the color of the
text<00:02:51.690> itself<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.069> way<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:53.489> would

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
text itself so the way that we would

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.370 
text itself so the way that we would
reset<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.180> back<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.600> actually<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
reset that back is actually just to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.670 
reset that back is actually just to

go back to the default so black is the
default<00:03:00.989> one<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.470> basically<00:03:02.220> rather<00:03:02.700> than

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
default one and basically rather than

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.490 
default one and basically rather than
telling<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.239> reset<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.900> default<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.319> just

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
telling it to reset to default you just

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.020 
telling it to reset to default you just
simply<00:03:04.799> define<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.430> should<00:03:05.640> use<00:03:05.819> that

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
simply define that it should use that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.630 
simply define that it should use that

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
spinning text is now bold so where I've

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.550 
spinning text is now bold so where I've
added<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.819> bold<00:03:33.060> formatting<00:03:33.959> it's<00:03:34.260> actually

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
added the bold formatting it's actually

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.660

applied<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.220> one<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.549> had

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
applied it to the one that we had

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.280 
applied it to the one that we had
previously<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.780> where<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:36.959> would<00:03:37.140> use

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
previously so this is where I would use

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.590 
previously so this is where I would use
the<00:03:37.620> reset<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.280> I'm<00:03:38.340> going<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.519> press<00:03:38.670> R<00:03:38.850> after

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
I've put in the special character and

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.830 
I've put in the special character and
this<00:03:40.980> time<00:03:41.190> I'm<00:03:41.340> going<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.489> press<00:03:41.670> L<00:03:41.880> for<00:03:42.600> bold

this time I'm going to press L for bold

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.990 
this time I'm going to press L for bold
and<00:03:43.079> now<00:03:43.290> when<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:43.470> type<00:03:43.709> bold<00:03:44.069> you'll<00:03:44.579> see<00:03:44.760> it's

and now when I type bold you'll see it's

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.240 
and now when I type bold you'll see it's
just<00:03:45.150> going<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.359> be<00:03:45.480> bold<00:03:45.720> text<00:03:46.109> like<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.530> so

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
well there is M for strikethrough and

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.930 
well there is M for strikethrough and

you can see we've still got the bold

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.210 
you can see we've still got the bold

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
has the strike fruit again because I

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.979

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
which is zero and again that's spelt

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.150 
which is zero and again that's spelt
wrong<00:04:09.870> again<00:04:10.620> it's<00:04:10.739> got<00:04:10.889> all<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.040> the

formatting<00:04:11.730> there<00:04:11.880> together<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.420> can

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
formatting there together so you can

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.780 
formatting there together so you can
actually<00:04:12.660> use<00:04:13.170> all<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.190> these<00:04:14.280> together<00:04:14.519> the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
actually use all of these together the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.879 
actually use all of these together the
one<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:14.970> don't<00:04:15.359> have<00:04:15.569> there<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.620> spinning

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
one I don't have there is the spinning

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.770 
one I don't have there is the spinning
text<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.669> K<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.000> let's<00:04:18.389> input<00:04:18.600> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
text so that is K so let's input the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.680 
text so that is K so let's input the
special<00:04:19.229> character<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.799> press<00:04:20.010> K<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.690> then

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
special character and press K and then

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.480 
special character and press K and then
it<00:04:21.989> will<00:04:22.080> be<00:04:22.169> spinning<00:04:22.470> as<00:04:22.740> well<00:04:22.950> like<00:04:23.460> that

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
it will be spinning as well like that

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.640 
it will be spinning as well like that
and<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.659> there<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:24.930> lot<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.140> you<00:04:25.289> can<00:04:25.470> do

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
with this you combine all of those

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.300 
with this you combine all of those
formatting<00:04:27.870> examples<00:04:28.560> that<00:04:28.680> I've<00:04:28.830> showed<00:04:29.100> you

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
formatting examples that I've showed you

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.840

now<00:04:50.940> one<00:04:51.120> thing<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.360> note<00:04:51.509> about<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.530> reset<00:04:52.979> is

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
now one thing to note about the reset is

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.100 
now one thing to note about the reset is
that<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.370> resets<00:04:53.880> everything<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.690> let's<00:04:54.900> say

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
that it resets everything so let's say

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.480 
that it resets everything so let's say
you've<00:04:55.440> done<00:04:55.650> what<00:04:55.800> we've<00:04:55.919> done<00:04:56.070> here<00:04:56.310> we've

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
you've done what we've done here we've

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.879 
you've done what we've done here we've
inputted<00:04:56.729> bold<00:04:57.300> then<00:04:57.870> we've<00:04:58.050> done<00:04:58.199> strike<00:04:58.650> and

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
inputted bold then we've done strike and

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.350 
inputted bold then we've done strike and
we<00:04:59.130> want<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.370> get<00:04:59.460> rid<00:04:59.639> of<00:04:59.669> strike<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.210> just

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
we want to get rid of strike and just

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.080 
we want to get rid of strike and just
have<00:05:00.509> bold<00:05:00.840> you'd<00:05:01.349> have<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.770> reset<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.490> then

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
have bold you'd have to reset and then

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.150 
have bold you'd have to reset and then
do<00:05:03.270> bold<00:05:03.570> again<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:04.470> that's<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.740> way<00:05:04.860> it<00:05:04.949> works

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
do bold again so that's the way it works

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.830 
do bold again so that's the way it works
it's<00:05:05.340> not<00:05:05.400> going<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.669> undo<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.090> last<00:05:06.270> one<00:05:06.599> it's

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
it's not going to undo the last one it's

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.110 
it's not going to undo the last one it's
going<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.020> undo<00:05:07.380> everything<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:08.220> so<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:08.910> is

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
going to undo everything and so that is

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.339 
going to undo everything and so that is
pretty<00:05:09.300> much<00:05:09.449> everything<00:05:09.750> there<00:05:10.139> is<00:05:10.199> to<00:05:10.320> know
