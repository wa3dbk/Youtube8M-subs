00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 shoulder arthroscopy is surgery 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.000
 in which a camera called 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.740
 arthroscope that is inserted through 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.050
 a small incision in the skin to 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.660
 examine or repair the tissues inside or 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.370
 around the shoulder joint 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.560
 the rotator cuff is a group 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.270
 of muscles and tendons that cover the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.189
 shoulder joint and that can 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 tear when they are overloaded or they 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.930
 hospital trauma patients are injured 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.240
 nisa October 9 Joseph prayed and dialed 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.390
 Dovecot explain this procedure 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.390
 surgical 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.650
 this case is a median patient 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.559
 old with pain for quite a while 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.180
 time on his right shoulder that I've 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.640
 come a medical treatment 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.129
 it meant pharmacological there is a 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.450
 rehabilitative treatment and even you 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.190
 they put the infiltrations without improvement 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.420
 in the study of the patient the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.800
 clinical exploration and then with the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.680
 complementary tests with 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.480
 resonance especially confirms that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.730
 have an injury with a break in the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.100
 supraspinatus tendon of the cuff 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.450
 the rotators here as we already have the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.090
 certainty that there is a rupture of the tendon 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.540
 and the planning is all oriented to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.580
 that kind of repair the first time 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.860
 joint we try to see injuries 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.330
 associated for example the tendon of the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.580
 biceps that in case of being damaged 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.010
 you also have to treat it and explore 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.720
 from under the tendon here will be confirmed 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.100
 probably that is totally from 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.590
 down I like a thick break 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.600
 complete of the tendon and there we propose a 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.740
 repair that we call double in 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.910
 the top floor in the part where 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.670
 are the tendons of the compartment 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.990
 subacromial as we know that the patient 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.640
 has gone through many episodes of 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 bursitis and has limited mobility 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.720
 everything is the inflammatory tissue that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.149
 clean it then after cleaning 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.770
 all that tissue we will see the tendon and 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.410
 we will see the break and depending on that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.910
 break is designed repair where 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.500
 place the implants what kind of 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.400
 implants place the number of 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.040
 structures that you need 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.980
 after that we are going to proceed 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.720
 make a scratch with a strawberry 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.060
 fern where we are going to implant the 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.620
 tendon this is done with the purpose of 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.510
 that fresh blood comes from having a 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.410
 tendon healing potential 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.110
 that we are going to suture in that bed 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.420
 first make a first row of 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.270
 implants in this case in this case 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.970
 we use some last implants 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.980
 generation they no longer carry is not metal 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.170
 it's not a free fatty tissue but it's already 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.530
 they do not carry any kind of screw van 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.709
 tucked inside the bone marrow and 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.480
 once they get stuck they expand in the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.210
 interior without leaving any rest inside 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.920
 they allow you too 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.840
 and treat patients with certain 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.100
 osteoporosis because you can choose the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.080
 depth to which he implanted 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.030
 then yes you can customize a 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.450
 little bit more the treatment gives us more 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.150
 confidence in terms of the subjection of 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.150
 implant that is an osteoporotic bone 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.830
 it's a weak bone and the implants have 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.840
 have to tie well since all the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.730
 suture and all the strength you're going to do 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.100
 about the implant then these 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.780
 new generation implants that said 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.000
 the doctor doves allow us to give us 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.530
 the security that they are well tied 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.940
 in the bone and therefore we can do 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.460
 all the necessary force with the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.860
 structure with the logo with the knots 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.110
 to secure the tendon the implant 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.420
 It has several several various threads of 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.420
 various colors that allows you to use 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.310
 one or two or one and have more references 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.820
 we use one for each 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.820
 implant 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.000
 its natural insertion 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.580
 we put another row 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.350
 to ensure every time we operate up 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.940
 older before now only young people and 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.070
 now but look for the older people and 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.170
 you can repair the tendon because you're 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.680
 older people have a lower 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.720
 quality 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.670
 in that tendon then having a 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.500
 double row helps you distribute the 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.640
 pressure also so as not to leave 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.980
 to damage the tendon by their own 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.610
 sutures thanks to this technique of 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.500
 arthroscopic surgery that allows you to 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.110
 lose less blood the patient have 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.670
 less rigidity have less stay 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.170
 hospital have less pain te 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.000
 also allows to mobilize soon 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.000
 we prefer to keep all three 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.010
 first weeks 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.990
 quiet the banner with a 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.520
 sling and from the third 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.560
 week starts with some movements 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.930
 passive when they go to the physiotherapist 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.489
 the rehabilitator and starting well with 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.859
 passive movements then assets 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.180
 assisted the assets then already active 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.220
 with resistance in time that the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.840
 feedback is a progressive thing and 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.560
 always followed and controlled by a 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.699
 physiotherapist and a rehabilitator 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.699
