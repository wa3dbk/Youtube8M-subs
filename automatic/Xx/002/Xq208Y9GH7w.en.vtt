00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
found that if items been there a long

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.190 
found that if items been there a long
time<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> looks<00:01:41.460> pretty<00:01:41.700> delicate<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:43.049> do

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
time and it looks pretty delicate you do

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.260 
time and it looks pretty delicate you do
not<00:01:43.350> want<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> use<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> higher<00:01:44.220> setting<00:01:44.729> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
not want to use the higher setting it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.179 
not want to use the higher setting it
tends<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:46.040> make<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.869> any<00:01:48.869> Wells<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.590> say<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.100> a

tends to make the any Wells and say in a

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.700 
tends to make the any Wells and say in a
ring<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:52.020> very<00:01:54.020> brittle<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.470> can

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
ring to be very brittle and that can

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.490 
ring to be very brittle and that can
break<00:01:56.009> I've<00:01:56.219> had<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> couple<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.820> them<00:01:56.909> break<00:01:57.500> so

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
break I've had a couple of them break so

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.929 
break I've had a couple of them break so
there<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.950> method<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.090> using<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> setting

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
there is a method to using the setting

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.840 
there is a method to using the setting
but<00:02:02.990> that's<00:02:03.990> my<00:02:04.290> setup<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.460> cleaning<00:02:05.759> my

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
but that's my setup for cleaning my

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.040 
but that's my setup for cleaning my
jewelry<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.619> gets<00:02:08.280> plenty<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.640> use<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.840> you

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
jewelry and it gets plenty of use as you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.270 
jewelry and it gets plenty of use as you
can<00:02:10.170> tell<00:02:10.379> from<00:02:10.410> my<00:02:10.619> other<00:02:10.800> videos
