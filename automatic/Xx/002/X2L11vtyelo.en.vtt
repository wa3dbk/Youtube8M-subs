00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
fingers through it so we'll have to wait

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.900 
fingers through it so we'll have to wait
and<00:01:50.660> see<00:01:50.869> when<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.260> dries<00:01:51.560> oh<00:01:54.369> but<00:01:55.369> how<00:01:55.640> it's

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
and see when it dries oh but how it's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.150 
and see when it dries oh but how it's
going<00:01:56.150> to<00:01:56.240> turn<00:01:56.390> out<00:01:56.690> friend<00:01:57.650> of<00:01:57.710> mine<00:01:57.830> did<00:01:58.040> it

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
going to turn out friend of mine did it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.680

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.130 
and her doll's hair turned out super
super<00:02:00.200> frizzy<00:02:00.580> so<00:02:01.840> hopefully<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:03.020> won't

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
super frizzy so hopefully that won't

super frizzy so hopefully that won't
happen
