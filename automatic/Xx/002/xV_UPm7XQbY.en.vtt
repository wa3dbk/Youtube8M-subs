00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.360
 He said 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.320
 why 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.850
 what happens people here give 0 and well then 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.440
 sorry for uploading we can upload videos 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.020
 on Wednesday and Friday that I was very 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.910
 busy and we can guys here I bring you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.640
 a terrarium tutorial of how 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.210
 get gold platinum copper coins and 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.850
 silver 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.670
 Well first thing we need 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:57.199
 active stone we occupy as four or 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.589
 six active stones with 322 gold and 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.309
 two of the shadows occupy what comes 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.200
 being this a prestante a pigeon 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.860
 we occupy six loose stones that come 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.530
 being the stones 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.820
 the pressure plate and well then since 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.970
 we have all that we will occupy 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.380
 the goods being the spanner 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.760
 pliers and wires we get it with 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.240
 mechanical mechanics 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.950
 we got in the dungeon and when 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.850
 we vote is that tron ​​and good because 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850
 let's have all this 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.820
 now let's do the circuit 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:38.880
 we grab onto the simple clip of the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.270
 English and we started doing that is the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.270
 game 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.890
 he has to cover everything 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.450
 now yes since it is like this 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.500
 but we have all went 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.649
 everything all everything 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.649
 since it is here 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.680
 a fallito 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.560
 what creates me 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.170
 and out of the big holes 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.730
 but by let's fix the error 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.730
 is 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.860
 the cook says nothing the truth 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.879
 that seriously walk on the tip 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.430
 good guys well that 's great favorite 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.560
 and well, since we have all this 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.280
 now yes activate 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.370
 our is our mechanism now 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.590
 we pricked the pressure plate is 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.400
 the time we press and make the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.580
 bats 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.970
 these buttons and in general 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.300
 we are going to generate a lot of purchases of 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.300
 those 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.550
 since we have most of chests 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.090
 that would be all of that 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.090
 all 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.670
 and we wait for everything to be filled 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.180
 they lack eggs they know that we must do 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.180
 this 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.860
 it's an egg to remove that 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:46.639
 and all of them that have everything full 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.639
 almost there 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.580
 m 

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:59.169
 Now as it suits you do not have to 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.899
 give to the merchant 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.129
 the merchant is the one we bought him 

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:07.509
 He knows that we have bought him 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.509
 Well what has been 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.840
 eat no safe 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.770
 good brand highlights 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.770
 we already have the merchant 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.820
 m 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:31.569
 If as understand and rely on every 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.639
 thunder sell sell sell sell 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.669
 sell sell sell sell sell 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:40.590
 sell sell sell and as you see is the 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:44.600
 new gold precisely silver 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.600
 and this trick very effective the truth 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.880
 and if enough now let's see the 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.529
 Inventory 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:00.039
 the gold 4 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:04.539
 juana since in book that counts and 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:06.069
 when you have more than 90 coins and 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.539
 spend the moment up you 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.399
 delete all and start again say 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:13.739
 well then this trick if it serves very 

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:13.739
 effective and the truth is still too 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.580
 and good guys and I think everyone is 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.580
 helped like to subscribe this person
