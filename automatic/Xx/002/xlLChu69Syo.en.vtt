00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.349
 Hello everybody 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.740
 Monday is not good but 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.109
 Today is July 20, 201 day of the year and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.480
 International day of chess and also day 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.760
 cake so break off a piece of yourself on 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.980
 breakfast and get cozier on 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.599
 your morning screens in fact 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.090
 microphone max fists 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.009
 now the call of duty brand has become something 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.719
 rare guest on the front page you are not 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.790
 find reasons somehow not 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.440
 detected apparently while the series sinks into 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.239
 absurd and hollywood characters first 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.920
 magnitudes cannot health 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.809
 affect sales statistics 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.710
 however, just now did not go unheeded 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.120
 fleeting discussion 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.640
 space potential blockbuster 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.010
 as you probably remember in the guest gave us 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.050
 try on an astronaut's spacesuit to shoot 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.410
 in zero gravity and visit the orbital 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.789
 station but that was all 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.739
 speculate about possible space 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.650
 motives took the director of multiplayer 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.840
 black ops 3 dan bunting which is not very 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
 categorically reasoned that so far from 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.580
 our blue globe call of duty 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.680
 catch absolutely nothing he thinks that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.049
 entourage must be believable and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.229
 appropriate otherwise identification effect 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.540
 yourself with the main character will go to ashes 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.220
 I do not know who was identified with whom 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.259
 futurism is stubborn for me 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.390
 turned the series into a circus animation 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.240
 but a solid takeoff into space and you 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.310
 in general space is shorter I do not know 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.259
 speak out comments and generally 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 Why am I not from Batman started here because 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.100
 need to keep the brand right here warner 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.470
 brothers hatched with preliminary 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.720
 tender excuses and promises 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.670
 contrary to the disturbing rumors of the recording version 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.340
 sort of quietly moving on 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.229
 amendment and even more will get your 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.799
 the long-suffering first patch is already in 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.170
 august 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.340
 truth with a reservation in the spirit if everything 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.680
 will go according to plan 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.320
 themselves responsible persons call this 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.360
 the patch is nothing but intermediate 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.159
 the exit is not at all obliged to symbolize 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.649
 the triumphal return of the game on 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.810
 computer counters however the authors are not 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.700
 be lazy to remind how grateful to everyone 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.140
 to your fans for stamina and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.879
 priceless reviews 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.760
 therefore work on solving their 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.610
 problems tirelessly and how we see 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.860
 childbirth and by the way about patches since Batman 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.930
 there was no place to disregard and 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.480
 Heralt who finally waited 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.910
 patch number 1 070 caches 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.830
 updated inventory of the new system 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.110
 control and other wonderful 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.269
 things as intelligence reports under 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.640
 flag digitalfoundry long-awaited patch 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.110
 not only cool my slightly stupid 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.510
 to the extent that the console versions 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.330
 pretty lost in performance in 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.610
 some episodes having lost here and there h8 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.099
 fps which is pretty tragic when their 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.660
 nominally only 30 as long as the version 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.180
 there is no information on her tests 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.580
 held on consoles but unfortunately 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.870
 This is the case for all 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.790
 other items testers 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.319
 satisfied and light brakes 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.780
 will surely fix hot and 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.610
 impetuous hotfix on that thing just 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.980
 warn and caution but I personally 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.870
 update immediately upon installing though still 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.940
 I did not check it and I have a version for pitch 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.550
 This is not a Batman in which everything will be 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.500
 Well, well, by the way about the version here 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.810
 see a sudden prototype on the next gene 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.730
 collapsed crept without warning 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.860
 and the first fruits of the release already safely 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.330
 sarcasm collect commentators on 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.060
 youtube them thanks to all the same 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.890
 specialists from digital foundry guys 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.290
 not lazy and learned how to 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.629
 reprint on their xbox one compared where 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.720
 it is necessary and as it should and then sadly 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.220
 reported that everything is very bad 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.440
 the number of frames per second does not leave 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.140
 mark limits of 30 but at times 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.849
 demonstrates and all 18 while 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.069
 grafon has not changed a jot 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.019
 Shadow resolution texture similar 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.790
 versions for gene pasta and generally not 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.099
 even banal vertical 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.220
 synchronization however it concerns 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.720
 the second part in the first all a little better 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.560
 synchronization delivered yes and she runs 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.739
 a little smoother 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.720
 the result is that for dessert only 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.939
 1080 pi I have a whole host of problems 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.849
 A bouquet therefore expediency such 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:08.069
 shopping is a big question what will we do 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.099
 follow the events though on 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.189
 in fact, I probably will not lie 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.900
 meanwhile capcom under the guise of the tournament his 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.729
 2015 shared plans and ideas 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.430
 on account of additional content for 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.440
 future street fighter 5 news quite 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.750
 could take pride of place in the category 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.669
 all shit if not for one important and 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.830
 even moderately innovative factor 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.960
 buy different dil se with characters 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.660
 it will be possible not only for real money 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.590
 but also for a virtual currency called 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.139
 for dra dollars 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.139
 just kidding but not really salt is that 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.490
 developers are concerned about the rapid decline 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.580
 popularity of fighting games soon after 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.680
 release but what to do and how effective 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.199
 don't let fall in arenas dried out 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.540
 and cooled the decision asked the Japanese 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.280
 quite curious for loyalty and 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.650
 long march wars and successes will be 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.840
 charge the so -called fight money 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.550
 for which will allow to acquire all 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.250
 further updates without any 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.410
 real money investment in my idea 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.970
 pretty cool otherwise the same on 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.310
 Today, perhaps enough so 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.740
 curl up and say goodbye wish you all 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.680
 productive week of cloudless days and 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.900
 not very intermediate release packs 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.500
 so far but promising ahead 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.810
 game 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.060
 and prorva juicy new information and there 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.639
 even before the fruitful winters 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.710
 we are not far from happy and see you on 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.710
