00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.330
 I have a story with saints like this. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.160
 since I was born until today of love 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.870
 I fell in love with the saints on the radio and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.160
 I also fell in love with the radio that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.049
 I wanted to hear all that was game 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.639
 the relationship of supporter with the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.830
 your team's shirt is a relationship 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.449
 totally of passion, no one knows that it is 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.369
 main guard shirt clothing 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.310
 any fan has training cause 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.260
 I have two of my father's and have 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 one and a half dozen so to speak is 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.160
 a family thing we all go 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.160
 together the stadium goes out with the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.079
 head and I keep shirt number 2 on 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.450
 end of the cup of Brazil that I had 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.829
 opportunity to score the title goal is 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:46.140
 It will be kept safe from my 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:49.410
 life for my children also for 2011 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.489
 uru wanted to create a very special product 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.489
 for a very special club 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.440
 we have our two shirts on 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.660
 liberators to oxfam and alvinegra was 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.970
 all the way 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.850
 we can bring this new aesthetic 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.250
 shirt that brings details that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.680
 represent a lot of football has in the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.100
 cast or use of tailoring techniques 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.280
 to finish the shirt the details as 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.460
 You think you can stay slow but fair 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.460
 player entering the field well in style 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.299
 to this here for example in the shirt one 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:39.310
 My face is very cool, I like it 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.420
 of cleaning the drawing the simple ones 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.810
 nice, right 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.930
 I liked the one used here along with 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.659
 shoulder works with one with stories 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.850
 So one more story to tell and 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.810
 one more shirt to represent these 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.700
 victories 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.799
 the two stars that we expect 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.509
 which turns the club's history into 3 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.700
 the titles that the club won then 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.700
 You see we're a little bit, right? 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.330
 I liked the yellow green that 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.820
 saints will play liberators loading 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.360
 The flag of Brazil, any place 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.360
 of the sanctuary 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.160
 the UN began to work there is connection 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.740
 between technology plus a style and I 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.960
 athlete speaking to the media 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.410
 weight has no right to it escolhinhas 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.980
 heat makes a difference because we 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.980
 runs a lot 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.450
 without doubt if this bid of the 10 here 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.810
 A little choir was just a detail. 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.260
 huh 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.620
 an is a team not crowned nor every team has the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.620
 Kingdom 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.080
 football is passion and the shirt is one of 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.410
 better translations of this passion, more 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.410
 liked it was the little brother who the part of the 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.040
 anthem born to live and in the saints to die 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.959
 This is the fan it is magic, right? 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.660
 that's it we do not change teams a 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.380

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.300
