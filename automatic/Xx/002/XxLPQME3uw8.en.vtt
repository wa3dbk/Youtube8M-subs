00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.000
 Our only goal is to have the tracks trodden at 9 in the morning 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.820
 Weather conditions do not have to be an excuse at all 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.700
 The days we work at 4 in the morning because it's snowing 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.380
 It is to have the tracks trodden to open it to the public. 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.360
 Our way of working with machines is in a group. 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.800
 We are 4 machines that always work together, we are 100% complementary 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.780
 We started all the tracks and we finished them together. 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.700
 It's a matter of synchronization and complementation. 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.260
 The machine in front is the one that sets the pattern of how to start a track. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.640
 But the machines that go behind, 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.760
 they do the same work to get a complete, flat and well-milled track. 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.680
 Stepping on the snow is much more complex than we think. 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.780
 Every day is different because every day the quality of the snow is different. 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.860
 It is a natural element that varies constantly. 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 And this snow has to be worked. 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.040
 The machine is composed, from front to back, of many elements. 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.800
 The first is the shovel, with which you break the layer that is on top of the snow. 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.900
 The bands, which are these iron chains ... 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.140
 break and chop all this snow that you are breaking with the shovel underneath the machine. 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.340
 The strawberry finishes crushing the snow until it aerates it. 

00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:09.755
 The winch is a cable 800 meters long. 

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:13.655
 Help, on slopes with a lot of slope, 

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:17.135
 to leave them as well as possible as we would on a flat track 

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:20.515
 A standard machine could not do this job or it would not do so well. 

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:26.595
 And with the cable you have a help to be able to fulfill your work as best as possible. 

00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:31.815
 And to finish, the classic finish of a ski slope with these typical stripes, 

00:02:31.815 --> 00:02:35.015
 He gives it some flaps behind the strawberry, 

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:38.615
 and that is already the finishing of the pass of the machine. 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.880
 The sunrises, when you're still in Cap de la Coma, 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.500
 which means that maybe you do not have enough work ahead of time, 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.260
 They are of exceptional beauty. 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.540
 Some colors that I have tried to photograph myself and they are so beautiful that they do not even appear in the photo. 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.240
 Either you live it or you can not appreciate it, no matter how much they explain it or show it to you.
