00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello everyone and welcome back to the big g in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.299
 this video I will introduce you 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.090
 the application I have ever TV that as it says 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.150
 the name itself is obviously a bit 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.610
 interesting portable television 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.890
 because it does not need to install 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.100
 other parts other applications 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.560
 it works all in one because it takes advantage of 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.880
 streaming already present online 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.880
 if we go to see this application 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.240
 obviously it needs to work 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 be connected to the internet because 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.770
 otherwise it could not exploit the various 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.290
 streaming present on the network 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.469
 then how do you see the home page yes 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.140
 opens with a slide in which we can 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.649
 see let's say the trend channels of the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.219
 moment and immediately under 4 small cards 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.930
 covering from the bottom last 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.510
 therefore seen the last channel seen in 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 this case in real time out now the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.160
 channel let's say trend what I saw 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.859
 or its application that of max and then 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.080
 immediately above genius tv and up recommended 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.689
 which we are not so interested in here 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.930
 at the top we have written foreground though 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.510
 we switchando we can go to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.119
 therefore, choose the country first 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 what national televisions we want 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.409
 go see the Italians 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.479
 US English Spanish and so on 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.189
 obviously we chose that one 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.360
 Italian because what we care about going 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.790
 to watch French television either 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.740
 German and therefore we can choose the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.570
 channel channel category that we 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.650
 we want to go to view for 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.430
 typology 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.290
 so it's a live entertainment event 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.270
 music news and so on 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.670
 this is the starting page continuing 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.770
 to peel we end up in the tops 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.840
 favorites we can choose ours 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.700
 favorite channels by putting one 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.220
 starlet here on the side and in fact we will have 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.740
 a list of our favorite channels 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.229
 I hadn't put any favorite either 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.280
 a series of random channels then i 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.799
 rai reality channels on rai 4 sky la7 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.140
 switchando still top then seen the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.000
 list of the most viewed channels on this one 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.489
 application always concerning the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.410
 our nation and then news then i 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.630
 channels last entered 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.720
 updating 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.100
 update going back I believe in the 30's 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.340
 December so it's still one 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.210
 relatively new test application a 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.250
 to revise 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.260
 here is how I see this 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.120
 chosen sky tg24 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.970
 there is a banner ad above here 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.870
 but in any case it is very clear if 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.740
 On TV 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.410
 the audio is excellent and in any case the audio of the 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.960
 substantially and therefore cellular 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.810
 works like this for notes 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.220
 digital the channel we watch it 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.740
 often it happens that some channels do not 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.210
 we are available but as mentioned 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.980
 yes how they work 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.010
 based on the streaming present on 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.960
 network if there are not them here 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.290
 obviously it is not available also at 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.040
 friction of the canal in applying all 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.350
 my tv was developed by uncle giuseppe 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.150
 iuculano that by the way it was already 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.950
 tested in the realization of one of 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.650
 similar application but did not have 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.800
 very successful and this works instead 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.990
 very well and quick to use 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.540
 find the link to download it in info 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.780
 box unfortunately I see I have to tell you is 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.670
 only for android and in any case besides the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.070
 link to download it on google play 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.630
 I also put you in the info box if there is one 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.440
 still the official website of this 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.380
 application 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.040
 that was all we see each other at 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.040
 next video
