00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.840
 hello in this tutorial I want 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.549
 share this idea to make some 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.799
 Brooches for girls very quickly 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.789
 and easy what we are going to need 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.440
 it is only lace of preference of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.890
 these who already sell us so they are 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.890
 double 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.640
 since it is going to give much more 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.680
 our brooch we need 20 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.660
 centimeters 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.560
 of the ribbon 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.600
 a needle with thread 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.790
 we will also take care of these flowers 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.730
 They sold in stores 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.980
 craft books and it's numerous as 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.100
 of the silicon good first thing 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.310
 what we're going to do is we're going to baste what 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.940
 what is the lace 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.870
 to close it and form what this will be 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.870
 which is like a little flower 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.719
 A) Yes 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.710
 once we have it in this way 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.100
 let's hit what is the brooch 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.370
 placing some silicon in the part 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.370
 medium 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.670
 Now let's cut out 3 little flowers 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.670
 these 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.130
 and we go again to place here 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.130
 silicone in the middle part 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.460
 and now we are going to place the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.460
 little flowers 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.930
 you have to leave this part like this with a 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.879
 little bit of wire that is what brings 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.290
 to bury what is the 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.290
 silicone and be well attached 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.950
 and look, you have already been 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.049
 completely finished what is 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.939
 our brooch now yes we have the 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.010
 bread ready to look in our 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.540
 lines 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.129
 good friends, I hope this is 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.650

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.420
