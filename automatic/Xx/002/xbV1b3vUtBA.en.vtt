all right looked all over for some kind
of<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:06.410> winter<00:00:07.410> boat<00:00:07.710> coming<00:00:08.160> cover<00:00:08.820> frame<00:00:09.269> for

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
of a winter boat coming cover frame for

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.839 
of a winter boat coming cover frame for
winter<00:00:11.790> storage<00:00:12.150> up<00:00:13.080> here<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.530> New<00:00:13.679> England

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
winter storage up here in New England

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.120 
winter storage up here in New England
and<00:00:14.849> wasn't<00:00:15.570> able<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.020> find<00:00:16.289> anything<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.890> found

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
and wasn't able to find anything I found

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.510 
and wasn't able to find anything I found
some<00:00:17.340> PVC<00:00:17.730> stuff<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.720> forth<00:00:19.279> so<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.310> went

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
some PVC stuff and so forth so I went

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.460 
some PVC stuff and so forth so I went
through<00:00:20.699> Lowe's<00:00:21.240> looking<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.109> something

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
through Lowe's looking for something

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.000 
through Lowe's looking for something
other<00:00:22.619> than<00:00:22.800> PVC<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.529> I<00:00:25.529> come<00:00:25.920> across

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
other than PVC and I come across

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.529 
other than PVC and I come across
something<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> think<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> work

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
something that I think is going to work

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.709 
something that I think is going to work
pretty<00:00:27.779> good<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.080> 16-foot<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.719> it

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
pretty good so this is a 16-foot and it

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.209 
pretty good so this is a 16-foot and it
would<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.989> easier<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> flip<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> upside

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
would be easier just to flip it upside

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.610 
would be easier just to flip it upside
down<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.570> don't<00:00:36.660> want<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.410> deal

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
down but I don't want to have to deal

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.369 
down but I don't want to have to deal
with<00:00:37.890> unbolting<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> motor<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.020> forth

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
with unbolting the motor and so forth

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.950 
with unbolting the motor and so forth
and<00:00:40.649> plus<00:00:41.489> critters<00:00:41.940> would<00:00:42.120> probably<00:00:42.600> end<00:00:42.719> up

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and plus critters would probably end up

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.240 
and plus critters would probably end up
finding<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.160> home<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.289> we're

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
finding a home in there and and so we're

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.410 
finding a home in there and and so we're
going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.579> cover<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.920> this<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.100> part<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.390> of

wobbly
we<00:03:04.889> can<00:03:05.280> fix<00:03:05.489> that<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.870> what<00:03:06.989> I'm<00:03:07.109> thinking<00:03:07.500> of

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
we can fix that so what I'm thinking of

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.430 
we can fix that so what I'm thinking of
doing<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:08.720> I'm<00:03:09.720> probably<00:03:09.810> gonna<00:03:10.049> go<00:03:10.230> out<00:03:10.350> and

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
doing is I'm probably gonna go out and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.979 
doing is I'm probably gonna go out and
get<00:03:10.560> some<00:03:10.739> strapping<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:12.030> then<00:03:12.180> I'll<00:03:12.269> run<00:03:12.930> a

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
get some strapping and then I'll run a

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.830 
get some strapping and then I'll run a
piece<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.380> strapping<00:03:13.829> here<00:03:14.359> zap<00:03:15.359> it

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
piece of strapping here zap it

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.039 
piece of strapping here zap it
zap<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:16.769> is<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.940> fit<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.630> one<00:03:18.930> I'm

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
zap it here is that fit to this one I'm

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.400 
zap it here is that fit to this one I'm
gonna<00:03:19.139> put<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.519> then<00:03:21.209> zap<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.930> here<00:03:22.230> and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
gonna put in and then zap it here and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.539 
gonna put in and then zap it here and
then<00:03:22.859> do<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.220> same<00:03:23.430> on<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.819> other<00:03:23.850> side

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
then do the same on the other side

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.580 
then do the same on the other side
probably<00:03:26.549> up<00:03:26.670> around<00:03:26.970> here<00:03:27.359> with<00:03:28.079> these<00:03:28.260> with

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
probably up around here with these with

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.129 
probably up around here with these with
these<00:03:28.739> holes<00:03:29.010> here<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.609> don't<00:03:30.569> know<00:03:30.840> what<00:03:31.019> I'm

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
these holes here I don't know what I'm

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.550 
these holes here I don't know what I'm
gonna<00:03:31.290> do<00:03:31.530> yet<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:32.010> might<00:03:32.609> run<00:03:33.079> this<00:03:34.079> is<00:03:34.290> about

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
gonna do yet I might run this is about

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.629 
gonna do yet I might run this is about
35<00:03:35.370> inches<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.150> go<00:03:36.269> from<00:03:36.540> here<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:38.190> next

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
35 inches to go from here to this next

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.569 
35 inches to go from here to this next
one<00:03:38.849> and<00:03:39.090> then<00:03:39.750> another<00:03:40.019> 35<00:03:40.650> from<00:03:40.980> here<00:03:41.340> to

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
one and then another 35 from here to

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.319 
one and then another 35 from here to
here<00:03:41.849> so<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:42.090> may<00:03:42.389> just<00:03:42.420> pick<00:03:43.019> put<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.739> two<00:03:44.190> by<00:03:45.169> one

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
here so I may just pick put a two by one

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.990 
here so I may just pick put a two by one
bites<00:03:48.329> three<00:03:48.930> there<00:03:49.199> are<00:03:49.470> two<00:03:49.739> by<00:03:49.919> three

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
bites three there are two by three

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.260 
bites three there are two by three
and<00:03:51.420> across<00:03:51.830> and<00:03:52.830> I'll<00:03:53.490> do<00:03:53.640> one<00:03:53.820> on<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.120> other

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
and across and I'll do one on the other

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.500 
and across and I'll do one on the other
side<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:55.220> then<00:03:56.220> we'll<00:03:56.370> see<00:03:56.520> how<00:03:56.670> things<00:03:56.940> go

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
side and then we'll see how things go

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.380 
side and then we'll see how things go
if<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.830> wanted<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.890> improve<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.340> snow<00:03:59.790> load<00:04:00.060> I

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
if I wanted to improve the snow load I

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.370 
if I wanted to improve the snow load I
could<00:04:01.200> run<00:04:01.380> something<00:04:01.740> from<00:04:02.400> here<00:04:03.350> down<00:04:04.350> to

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
could run something from here down to

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.520 
could run something from here down to
the<00:04:04.710> floor<00:04:05.210> in<00:04:06.210> that<00:04:06.450> way<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.960> don't<00:04:07.140> have<00:04:07.350> to

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
the floor in that way I don't have to

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.560 
the floor in that way I don't have to
worry<00:04:07.800> about<00:04:07.980> how<00:04:08.310> much<00:04:08.370> snow<00:04:08.700> work<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.210> get<00:04:09.390> on

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
worry about how much snow work to get on

worry about how much snow work to get on
it<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:10.230> should<00:04:10.500> hold<00:04:10.740> but<00:04:11.670> I'm<00:04:12.360> going<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.750> be

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
probably going to bring that snow fence

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.310 
probably going to bring that snow fence
down<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:49.110> about<00:04:49.320> here<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:50.520> tie<00:04:51.450> it<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:54.050> on<00:04:55.050> the

my top bring it over the top of my motor
and<00:05:03.120> have<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:03.650> sort<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.800> open<00:05:05.160> so<00:05:05.430> we<00:05:05.520> get

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
and have this sort of open so we get

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.600 
and have this sort of open so we get
some<00:05:05.880> decent<00:05:06.570> ventilation<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.680> there<00:05:08.460> which

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
some decent ventilation in there which
