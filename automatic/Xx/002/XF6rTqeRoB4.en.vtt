00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.830
 one of Latin America in this video les 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.240
 I'm going to talk about one of the processes 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 that occur within the reticle 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.549
 endoplasmic that is the phenomenon of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.730
 bilic oscillation that you call the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.730
 ico oscillation is the aggregate 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.680
 the aggregate of carbonaceous structures is 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.900
 say that they have carbon atoms like 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.900
 for example glucosamine 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.310
 also other glucose examples 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.460
 hands as 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.090
 and other aquarium friends also to the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.880
 protein that have synthesized those this 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.670
 endoplasmic reticulum and that 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.360
 introduced inside the reticle then 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.080
 is going to generate a compartment 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.240
 luminal of the reticulum topographically 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.320
 identical to the outer face of the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.330
 plasma membrane 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.210
 then it is the aggregate of structures 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.210
 carbonated to whom to proteins 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.070
 synthesized 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.820
 and introduced 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:29.690
 where in the endoplasmic reticulum and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.690
 that a luminal compartment is generated 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.540
 topographically 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:44.280
 photographic really identical to the face 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.070
 external of the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.590
 and plasma membrane remember that the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.830
 plasma membrane had on his face 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.170
 External carbohydrates associated 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.820
 forming glucose proteins and glÃ¼ck or 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.560
 lipids then this is what is going to 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.420
 happen well as this process of 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.810
 the following way I here elaborate 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.899
 a very simple graphic so that what 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.720
 can understand we have in blue the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.660
 reticle 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.290
 from the top side the sun cycle and the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.810
 side down the face illuminates the lumen 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.350
 of the reticle then what happens first 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.640
 look at the site sun hydrolyzes atp 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.860
 to get dp and phosphate this phosphate 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.240
 is going to join 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.420
 endo liquor 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.730
 we have here is the liquor the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.310
 of liquor is an alcohol that is found 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.220
 anchored in the membrane of the article 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.330
 endoplasmic forming in this case 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.319
 look two liquor 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.670
 phosphate 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.660
 what would this be 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.340
 well what happens is also going to 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.340
 idealize vp 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.450
 which brings glucose mines or glucose and 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:13.140
 also gp that will bring hands as 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.140
 then what will happen 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.770
 are going to bind haldol and phosphate 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.879
 and this would be the mannose 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.879
 and glucose 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.610
 glucose hands sorry well then 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.020
 what they are going to do they are going to join 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.020
 the tonic the phosphate 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:48.750
 and they will continue like this in this way 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:53.730
 and you will experience this phosphate alcohol 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:58.340
 with this hand sa and today this glucose 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.340
 united a philip movement 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.680
 flower that is to say it is reversed 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:11.210
 change towards look to the side 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:15.020
 lit up then then what will happen 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:19.330
 is going to see hand givers ah 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:22.790
 and glucose players in this case 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:26.620
 givers of 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:30.020
 hands ao of glucose that they're going to do 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.210
 they are going to add more molecules of hands to 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.900
 glucose to this carbon chain that 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.380
 Is generating 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.009
 then an enzyme moves the portion 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.240
 carbon that was incorporated 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.050
 to the lumen 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.190
 a nascent protein 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.069
 and a n-type glycosylation occurs 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:56.419
 because because asparagine is involved 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:58.380
 as the amino acid in which they go to 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:02.790
 occur these unions 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.010
 so good basically notice that from 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.540
 beside this light will be 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.320
 would come to be the carbohydrate yes and 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.790
 notice that a compartment is generated 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.130
 totally identical as if it were the 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.200
 external face of the plasma membrane 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.030
 only that it remains on an internal side or 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.750
 on the illuminated face of the reticle 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.750
 endoplasmic 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.510
 educational I recommend the following 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.510
 videos so you can keep learning
