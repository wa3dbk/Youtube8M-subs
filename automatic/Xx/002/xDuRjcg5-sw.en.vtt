00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello all, this is TheTruexXnthnjX(x) again.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I beleive this will be the final video for tonight.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm here, because there seems to be some very serious problems.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Oh, really? Do I need to remind you of the groundbreaking work that we're doing here?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
No, but I've been authorized by the board to look at everything.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The board authorized you? The board doesn't know the first thing about science. All they want is something to make them more money, some product. Don't worry, they'll get their product...

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
[Me]: Sound evil, huh?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
[Swann]: After how many accidents, tell me Doctor Betruger, why are so many workers spooked, complaining, requesting transfers off Mars?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
[Me]: 'Cause that totally can't be a plot setup...

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.000
[Betruger]: They just can't handle life here, they're exhausted and overworked, if I had a larger, more competent staff, and bigger budget, even these few accidents could have been avoided...

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:09.010
I'm afraid you'll get nothing more until my report is filed with the board, I will need full access Doctor Betruger, Delta included, I won't have any difficulty doing that will I?

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:18.010
Only if you get lost Swann, just stay out of my way, amazing things will happen here soon, you just wait.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.010
Let's go.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:32.010
Well, as you saw there, some weird crap is going down, on a weird planet, that's not Earth.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
Listen buddy, you don't have clearance for this area, move along.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.010
I can't help you here, head to Marine Command, they can help you.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.010
If you don't move out now, they're gonna bust both our asses.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.010
If you're wondering, what this game is about, I will be glad to tell you...

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.010
...But, I want it to be a surprise.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.010
'Scuse me.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.020
I don't think I've seen you before, you must be a replacement for one of the guys we lost

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:22.020
Well, I'll just give you this hint, it involves the forces of Hell, and lots, and lots, and lots of firepower.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.020
Yeah...

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:41.020
By the way, once we get to the main part of this game, with the fighting and such, I WILL be using the god mode cheat, because I suck at this game.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.020
[TV]: Your universe now...

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.020
That's cool, there's even, like, news.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.020
Ah, someone new, always nice seeing new faces around here, hope you enjoy your stay.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.020
Look, that's a PDA, you can collect other people's PDA's, which are lying around.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.020
See, now I can look through his audio logs and e-mails.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.020
Miller, hear about Corporal Allen?

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.020
Yeah, heard he just lost it, shipped home this week.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.020
Lose one, gain another.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.020
No shit.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.030
You can mess with the surroundings sometimes, if you have certain control panels around.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:37.030
There are, other conversations that go on, even if you don't initiate them, which is kinda cool.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.030
Super Turbo Turkey Puncher 3!

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.030
These are the graphics of the very first Doom game, in fact, this was a hidden level in the very first Doom game

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.030
Yes, you can even play this.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.030
If you get over 25000 points, you get a secret e-mail, but I'm not going to sit here and subject you to that boredom.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.030
Yeah, I saw those suits arrive, too.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.030
Another conversation...

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.030
Another thing to download.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.030
Another locked door.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.040
[Intercom]: Attention, Doctor Braddock, please report to Environment Management office 4 Alpha.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.040
You need to report to Sergeant Kelly, ASAP. He's in Command HQ.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.040
Actually, I want to show you guys something cool, you can only do (this before seeing Kelly).

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.040
Got to look quickly, though, you see that guy?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.040
If you pay attention to what you're doing later on in the game, you actually have to fight that guy later, the guy laying down?

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.040
It's pretty creepy, how you have to fight him, though.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.040
This is Delta Science Management, I would like to request another security team, here in Delta.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.040
Yes, sir.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040
Thank you.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:37.040
If you haven't already realized it, in the bottom over to the left a little bit, it says my location, but all the way to the left on the bottom, it shows my health, which is at 100 right now, my armor, which is at 0 right now, and a yellow-orangish bar underneath, which is my stamina, which tells you how long I can run.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.050
It goes down pretty slowly, so you can pretty much run all the time.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:06:01.050
Of course I know the code to this door, but it doesn't work right now, you have to wait until later. And here is another video log, I beleive it is an explanation on the plasma gun, but you don't get that weapon until way later in the game.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.050
Let's do what the person asked us to.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:20.050
Took your sweet time marine? Well, here's the situation, another member of the science team's gone missing, since you're the ranking FMG, you get to find him.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:33.050
I want you to check out the old decommisioned comm facility, we heard he might be heading that way, the only way there is through the service passage under Mars City, I programmed this sentry to guide you to the maintenance elevator, hope you follow the sentry better than you've followed orders so far.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:44.050
Pick up your gear at the security checkpoint at the bottom of the elevator. Oh, and when you find him, just bring him back, do not hurt him, now move out.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.050
In fact, that missing scientist was one of the downloadable e-mails from one of the machines.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.050
But down here, you got some people working

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.050
When you complete your mission, report back here, move out.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.050
Sergeant Kelly is kinda mean, but he's pretty cool.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.950
I'm supposed to follow this robot, but that'll have to wait until next time. Later.
