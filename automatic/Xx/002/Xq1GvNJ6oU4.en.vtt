00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
the changes that they've made already

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.969 
the changes that they've made already
from<00:01:52.939> from<00:01:53.240> what<00:01:53.479> they've<00:01:54.020> now<00:01:54.350> learned<00:01:54.710> so

from from what they've now learned so

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.260 
from from what they've now learned so
i'm<00:01:55.009> thinking<00:01:55.130> about<00:01:55.430> releasing<00:01:55.790> maybe<00:01:56.180> a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
i'm thinking about releasing maybe a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.819 
i'm thinking about releasing maybe a
smaller<00:01:56.600> lighter<00:01:56.869> version<00:01:57.259> because<00:01:57.380> that's<00:01:57.590> a

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
smaller lighter version because that's a

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.560 
smaller lighter version because that's a
personal<00:01:58.399> class<00:01:58.610> it's<00:01:58.820> one-on-one<00:01:59.000> with<00:01:59.390> me

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
personal class it's one-on-one with me

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.380 
personal class it's one-on-one with me
it's<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.780> little<00:02:00.020> more<00:02:00.110> expensive<00:02:00.350> but<00:02:00.619> i<00:02:01.610> may

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
it's a little more expensive but i may

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.789 
it's a little more expensive but i may
have<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.899> do-it-yourself<00:02:03.470> kit<00:02:03.680> or

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
have it a do-it-yourself kit or

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.020 
have it a do-it-yourself kit or
something<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:04.130> help<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.430> with<00:02:04.579> nutrition
