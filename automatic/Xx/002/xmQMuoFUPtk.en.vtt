00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
were Gopi the there will be the base for

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.110 
were Gopi the there will be the base for
the<00:00:50.039> piano<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:51.480> I'm<00:00:51.780> currently<00:00:52.140> hand<00:00:52.530> wedging

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
the piano so I'm currently hand wedging

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.369 
the piano so I'm currently hand wedging
to<00:00:54.120> create<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.320> slabs<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> actual<00:00:57.379> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to create the slabs for the actual the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.080 
to create the slabs for the actual the
rest<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> sculpture<00:00:59.129> piano<00:00:59.730> piano

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
rest of the sculpture piano piano

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.759 
rest of the sculpture piano piano
sculpture<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> that's<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> plan<00:01:04.439> today

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
sculpture and so that's the plan today

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.370 
sculpture and so that's the plan today
is<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.700> create<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.270> hand-built<00:01:06.960> piano

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
is to create a hand-built piano

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.570 
is to create a hand-built piano
sculpture<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.430> I'll<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.939> again<00:01:09.270> throw<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
sculpture and I'll just again throw the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.100 
sculpture and I'll just again throw the
hen<00:01:10.880> wedge<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.480> then<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.750> thought

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
hen wedge and then the thought

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.810 
hen wedge and then the thought
throughout<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.100> slabs<00:01:13.400> for<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:15.700> center<00:01:16.700> of

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
throughout the slabs for the center of

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.720 
throughout the slabs for the center of
the<00:01:16.910> piano<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.660> I'll<00:01:18.440> build<00:01:18.650> up<00:01:19.040> basically

the<00:01:37.930> feet<00:01:38.200> will<00:01:38.500> be<00:01:38.530> coil<00:01:38.980> so<00:01:39.370> I'll<00:01:39.430> roll<00:01:39.700> out

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
the feet will be coil so I'll roll out

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.510 
the feet will be coil so I'll roll out
coils<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:41.170> measure<00:01:41.440> them<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.860> size<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.400> then

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520

I<00:02:21.760> am<00:02:22.480> hand<00:02:22.840> wedging<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.150> process<00:02:25.690> that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
I am hand wedging this is a process that

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.190 
I am hand wedging this is a process that
is<00:02:27.099> done<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.790> warm<00:02:28.090> up<00:02:28.269> any<00:02:28.540> any<00:02:28.989> clay<00:02:29.470> body<00:02:31.200> to

is done to warm up any any clay body to

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.320 
is done to warm up any any clay body to
compress<00:02:32.680> all<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.099> air<00:02:33.280> bubbles<00:02:33.819> out<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.060> the

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
clay so that once the piece goes into

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.559 
clay so that once the piece goes into
the<00:02:36.610> kiln<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:38.200> piece<00:02:38.349> doesn't<00:02:38.590> explode<00:02:40.260> yeah

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
the kiln the piece doesn't explode yeah

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.150 
the kiln the piece doesn't explode yeah
so<00:02:43.569> basically<00:02:43.900> what<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:44.680> found

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
so basically what I do is I just found

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.119 
so basically what I do is I just found
out<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:50.230> then<00:02:50.349> I'll<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:50.650> go<00:02:50.860> ahead<00:02:50.950> and

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
out the and then I'll just go ahead and

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.369 
out the and then I'll just go ahead and
roll<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.310> out<00:02:51.519> with<00:02:51.730> like<00:02:51.879> a<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:53.110> know<00:02:53.170> like<00:02:53.349> a

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
roll it out with like a you know like a

00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:18.000 
roll it out with like a you know like a
roller<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.870> basically<00:03:17.170> what<00:03:17.380> I'll<00:03:17.500> do<00:03:17.709> is<00:03:17.860> I'll

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
roller so basically what I'll do is I'll

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.830 
roller so basically what I'll do is I'll
just<00:03:18.900> throw<00:03:19.900> out<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.200> slab<00:03:20.470> just<00:03:20.920> kind<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.840> get

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
just throw out the slab just kind of get

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.809 
just throw out the slab just kind of get
it<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.170> shape<00:03:23.530> where<00:03:23.860> it's<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:26.829> know<00:03:26.859> sort

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
it to a shape where it's you know sort

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.759 
it to a shape where it's you know sort
of<00:03:27.910> an<00:03:28.030> even<00:03:28.329> thickness<00:03:28.600> now<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.019> slab<00:03:29.500> roller

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
of an even thickness now a slab roller

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.150 
of an even thickness now a slab roller
is<00:03:30.120> ten<00:03:31.120> times<00:03:31.450> faster<00:03:32.109> and<00:03:32.200> sometimes<00:03:32.470> easier

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
is ten times faster and sometimes easier

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.870 
is ten times faster and sometimes easier
but<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.700> don't<00:03:34.569> have<00:03:35.250> three<00:03:36.250> hundred<00:03:36.579> dollars

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
but I don't have three hundred dollars

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.550 
but I don't have three hundred dollars
to<00:03:37.090> spare<00:03:37.389> four<00:03:37.720> hundred<00:03:37.989> dollars<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.319> spare

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
to spare four hundred dollars to spare

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.979 
to spare four hundred dollars to spare
for<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.799> slab<00:03:39.069> roller<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.750> next

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
for a slab roller so this is the next

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.809 
for a slab roller so this is the next
best<00:03:41.109> thing<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.590> just<00:03:42.450> throw<00:03:43.450> out<00:03:43.600> your<00:03:44.819> slabs

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
best thing to just throw out your slabs

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.809 
best thing to just throw out your slabs
I<00:03:46.329> wanted<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.350> get<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.560> thickness<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:48.700> way

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
I wanted to get the thickness the way

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.120 
I wanted to get the thickness the way
just<00:03:49.209> when<00:03:49.329> I<00:03:49.389> wanted<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.139> then<00:03:50.290> then<00:03:51.010> I'll

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
just when I wanted it and then then I'll

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.270 
just when I wanted it and then then I'll
go<00:03:51.250> ahead<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.519> take<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:52.510> roller<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:54.100> I

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
go ahead and take the the roller and I

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.740 
go ahead and take the the roller and I
love<00:03:54.549> this<00:03:54.760> roller<00:03:55.060> because<00:03:55.299> it<00:03:55.420> gives<00:03:55.569> these

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
love this roller because it gives these

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.950 
love this roller because it gives these
really<00:03:56.709> cool<00:03:56.980> lines<00:03:57.370> like<00:03:57.989> really<00:03:58.989> cool

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
really cool lines like really cool

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.690 
really cool lines like really cool
texture<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.570> think<00:04:02.780> it's<00:04:02.930> fun<00:04:03.700> these

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
texture and I think it's fun these

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.540 
texture and I think it's fun these
different<00:04:05.150> textures<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.980> what<00:04:07.280> I'll<00:04:07.370> do<00:04:07.520> now

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
different textures so what I'll do now

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:17.800 
different textures so what I'll do now
is<00:04:07.760> I'll<00:04:08.300> go<00:04:08.450> ahead<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:09.620> cut<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:16.150> sides<00:04:17.150> of

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
is I'll go ahead and cut the sides of

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:36.030 
is I'll go ahead and cut the sides of
the<00:04:18.790> piano<00:04:20.080> and<00:04:26.140> we<00:04:27.140> good<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:27.530> go<00:04:27.560> hopefully

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.360 

this<00:04:37.040> is<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.970> get<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.360> pieces<00:04:41.720> on<00:04:42.140> the<00:04:42.370> way

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
this is to get the pieces on the way

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.010 
this is to get the pieces on the way
that<00:04:43.610> I<00:04:43.670> want<00:04:43.940> him

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
that I want him

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.480 
that I want him
in<00:04:46.020> order<00:04:46.260> in<00:04:46.680> other<00:04:46.890> words<00:04:47.100> when<00:04:47.370> I'm

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
in order in other words when I'm

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.480 
in order in other words when I'm
touching<00:04:48.000> these<00:04:48.210> pieces<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.110> bottom<00:04:49.500> I'll

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
touching these pieces to the bottom I'll

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.130 
touching these pieces to the bottom I'll
do<00:04:50.760> a<00:04:50.790> technique<00:04:51.240> called<00:04:51.270> scoring<00:04:51.840> and

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
do a technique called scoring and

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.730 
do a technique called scoring and
slipping<00:04:53.300> basically<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.540> just<00:04:54.840> get<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.680> a

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
slipping basically you just get it a

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.310 
slipping basically you just get it a
little<00:04:55.860> bit<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.160> water<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.810> get<00:04:57.810> it<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.140> edge

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
little bit of water and get it the edge

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.940 
little bit of water and get it the edge
right<00:04:58.560> here<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.130> then<00:04:59.310> you<00:04:59.430> take<00:04:59.460> a<00:05:00.950> needle

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
right here and then you take a needle

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.020 
right here and then you take a needle
tool<00:05:02.960> in<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.200> case<00:05:04.410> this<00:05:04.590> is<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.820> needle<00:05:05.820> tool

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
tool in this case this is a needle tool

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.600 
tool in this case this is a needle tool
slash<00:05:06.330> carving<00:05:06.780> tool<00:05:07.130> but<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.160> so<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.520> take

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
slash carving tool but you so you take

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.880 
slash carving tool but you so you take
your<00:05:09.150> needle<00:05:09.300> tool<00:05:09.660> and<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.840> make<00:05:10.020> little<00:05:10.050> X's

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
your needle tool and you make little X's

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.870 
your needle tool and you make little X's
all<00:05:11.880> along<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.600> sides<00:05:12.870> here<00:05:13.880> because

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
all along the sides here because

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.390 
all along the sides here because
otherwise<00:05:15.750> if<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.140> didn't<00:05:16.470> we<00:05:16.980> wouldn't<00:05:17.280> have

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
otherwise if you didn't we wouldn't have

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.760 
otherwise if you didn't we wouldn't have
anything<00:05:17.580> to<00:05:17.940> adhere<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.480> here<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.050> it

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
anything to adhere to here and it

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.880 
anything to adhere to here and it
wouldn't<00:05:20.040> be<00:05:20.160> very<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:22.050> wouldn't<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.590> need<00:05:22.800> a

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
wouldn't be very it wouldn't it need a

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.920 
wouldn't be very it wouldn't it need a
just<00:05:23.100> like<00:05:23.280> basically<00:05:23.700> have<00:05:24.000> its<00:05:24.240> suction<00:05:24.720> to

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
just like basically have its suction to

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.850 
just like basically have its suction to
the<00:05:25.170> bottom<00:05:25.560> edge<00:05:25.890> here<00:05:25.920> so<00:05:26.880> that<00:05:27.030> we<00:05:27.210> can

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
the bottom edge here so that we can

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.990 
the bottom edge here so that we can
start<00:05:28.860> attaching<00:05:29.190> pieces<00:05:31.640> okay<00:05:32.640> so<00:05:32.700> basically

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
start attaching pieces okay so basically

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.580 
start attaching pieces okay so basically
now<00:05:33.330> what<00:05:33.480> we're<00:05:33.630> doing<00:05:33.660> we're<00:05:34.080> just<00:05:34.110> gonna<00:05:34.380> go

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
now what we're doing we're just gonna go

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:42.070 
now what we're doing we're just gonna go
ahead<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:35.330> attach<00:05:36.330> our<00:05:36.780> piece<00:05:37.080> around<00:05:37.590> here

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.640 

you<00:05:42.830> might<00:05:43.069> a<00:05:43.099> little<00:05:43.280> bit<00:05:44.379> probably<00:05:45.379> a<00:05:45.409> little

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
you might a little bit probably a little

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.309 
you might a little bit probably a little
bit<00:05:45.949> yeah<00:05:46.389> so<00:05:47.389> I<00:05:47.419> basically<00:05:47.659> pick<00:05:48.080> up<00:05:48.229> the
