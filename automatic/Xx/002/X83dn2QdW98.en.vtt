00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
panicking now is trying to build up more

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.189 
panicking now is trying to build up more
orders<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.070> count<00:04:16.760> on<00:04:16.940> my<00:04:17.120> own<00:04:17.180> breaches<00:04:17.870> but

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
orders to count on my own breaches but

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.360 
orders to count on my own breaches but
that<00:04:18.320> doesn't<00:04:18.769> matter<00:04:18.829> is<00:04:19.070> good<00:04:19.220> all<00:04:19.340> over

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
that doesn't matter is good all over

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.370 
that doesn't matter is good all over
hydrolysis<00:04:20.180> coming<00:04:20.570> soon<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:20.959> budget<00:04:21.289> is

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
hydrolysis coming soon and budget is

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.040 
hydrolysis coming soon and budget is
very<00:04:22.039> fast<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:22.610> they<00:04:22.760> will<00:04:22.940> take<00:04:23.120> down<00:04:23.449> you

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
very fast and they will take down you

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.350 
very fast and they will take down you
this<00:04:24.289> very<00:04:24.620> quickly<00:04:24.919> just<00:04:25.159> implies<00:04:25.789> there

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
this very quickly just implies there

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.260 
this very quickly just implies there
so<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:26.990> didn't<00:04:27.259> know<00:04:27.379> that<00:04:27.409> I<00:04:27.969> think<00:04:28.969> he's<00:04:29.090> just

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
so I didn't know that I think he's just

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.999 
so I didn't know that I think he's just
about<00:04:29.569> research<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.319> so<00:04:30.590> that's<00:04:30.770> really

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
about research that so that's really

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.730 
about research that so that's really
cost<00:04:31.340> me<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.580> bit<00:04:31.819> well<00:04:32.719> I<00:04:32.750> don't<00:04:33.139> have<00:04:33.349> to<00:04:33.590> even

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
cost me a bit well I don't have to even

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.719 
cost me a bit well I don't have to even
run<00:04:34.129> away<00:04:34.550> here<00:04:34.819> very<00:04:35.150> much<00:04:35.270> I<00:04:35.919> mean<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:37.189> get<00:04:37.669> a

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.279 
run away here very much I mean I get a
run<00:04:37.939> away<00:04:38.150> but<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.419> don't<00:04:38.569> think<00:04:38.689> roaches<00:04:39.139> would

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
run away but I don't think roaches would

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.529 
run away but I don't think roaches would
be<00:04:39.379> able<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.590> outrun<00:04:39.889> that<00:04:39.949> I'm<00:04:40.370> not<00:04:40.550> sure<00:04:40.610> cuz

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
be able to outrun that I'm not sure cuz

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.179 
be able to outrun that I'm not sure cuz
stimpack<00:04:42.050> money<00:04:42.319> increases<00:04:42.830> your<00:04:43.069> attack

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:43.189 
stimpack money increases your attack

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.629 
stimpack money increases your attack
speed<00:04:43.639> increases<00:04:44.270> your<00:04:44.419> movement<00:04:44.659> speed

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
speed increases your movement speed

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.779 
speed increases your movement speed
nevertheless<00:04:46.639> I<00:04:47.180> like<00:04:47.569> a<00:04:48.039> few<00:04:49.039> roaches<00:04:49.250> and

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
nevertheless I like a few roaches and

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.279 
nevertheless I like a few roaches and

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
because I decided to start making units

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.790

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
they are stuck in units now he's gonna

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.029 
they are stuck in units now he's gonna
try<00:05:21.229> to<00:05:21.259> rush<00:05:21.560> you<00:05:21.979> know<00:05:22.039> I<00:05:22.129> mean<00:05:22.810> but<00:05:24.039> there

fields I'd say you know don't take that

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.959 
fields I'd say you know don't take that
as<00:05:38.690> gospel<00:05:38.990> word<00:05:39.440> but<00:05:40.250> that's<00:05:40.639> pretty<00:05:40.849> much

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
how it works now so you can get that

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.350 
how it works now so you can get that
many<00:05:43.039> than<00:05:43.279> your<00:05:43.430> kin<00:05:43.759> about<00:05:44.029> as<00:05:44.150> many
