of<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:12.950> will<00:02:13.100> blame<00:02:13.280> me<00:02:13.490> for<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.760> as<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.210> final

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
of you will blame me for that as a final

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.580 
of you will blame me for that as a final
but<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.810> something<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.230> I'm<00:02:15.410> not

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
but it is something that I'm not

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.750 
but it is something that I'm not
entirely<00:02:16.070> sure<00:02:16.900> what<00:02:17.900> my<00:02:18.080> opinion<00:02:18.350> is<00:02:18.620> on<00:02:19.400> it

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
entirely sure what my opinion is on it

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.640 
entirely sure what my opinion is on it
so<00:02:20.120> video<00:02:20.390> games<00:02:20.630> in<00:02:20.780> Japan<00:02:21.080> are<00:02:21.110> fairly

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
so video games in Japan are fairly

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.310 
so video games in Japan are fairly
expensive<00:02:22.130> we<00:02:22.610> could<00:02:22.820> say<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.420> tomb<00:02:24.050> raider

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
expensive we could say that tomb raider

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.990 
expensive we could say that tomb raider
for<00:02:25.040> example<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:26.120> about<00:02:27.110> 80<00:02:27.500> US<00:02:28.250> dollars<00:02:28.730> now

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
for example is about 80 US dollars now

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.430 
for example is about 80 US dollars now
before<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.360> localization<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.170> game<00:02:30.320> in

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
before the localization of the game in

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.290 
before the localization of the game in
japan<00:02:30.800> with<00:02:30.980> all<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.280> Japanese<00:02:31.700> voices<00:02:31.910> and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
japan with all the Japanese voices and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.970 
japan with all the Japanese voices and
whatnot<00:02:32.690> they<00:02:32.870> can<00:02:33.200> get<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.470> hold<00:02:33.710> of<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
whatnot they can get a hold of the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.470 
whatnot they can get a hold of the
English<00:02:34.280> version<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> game<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.210> so

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
English version of the game and so

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.470 
English version of the game and so
they've<00:02:35.750> decided<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:36.560> create<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.700> Japanese

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
they've decided to create a Japanese

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.570 
they've decided to create a Japanese
voice<00:02:38.840> pack<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.590> voice<00:02:39.830> pack<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.250> thirty

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
voice pack this voice pack is thirty

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.670 
voice pack this voice pack is thirty
dollars<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.180> idea<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.780> believe<00:02:42.140> being<00:02:42.500> that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
dollars the idea I believe being that

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.380 
dollars the idea I believe being that
they<00:02:42.800> could<00:02:43.010> get<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.700> English<00:02:44.000> version<00:02:44.030> of

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
they could get the English version of

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.060 
they could get the English version of
the<00:02:44.480> game<00:02:44.600> for<00:02:44.840> cheaper<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.500> then<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.770> thirty

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
the game for cheaper and then the thirty

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.670 
the game for cheaper and then the thirty
dollar<00:02:46.280> voice<00:02:46.640> pack<00:02:46.970> would<00:02:47.420> add<00:02:47.660> up<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
dollar voice pack would add up to the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.500 
dollar voice pack would add up to the
normal<00:02:49.010> eighty<00:02:49.280> dollar<00:02:49.670> price<00:02:50.060> now<00:02:50.450> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
normal eighty dollar price now the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.790 
normal eighty dollar price now the
reason<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.810> I'm<00:02:50.930> not<00:02:51.170> sure<00:02:51.470> how<00:02:51.650> i<00:02:51.680> feel

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
reason that I'm not sure how i feel

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.150 
reason that I'm not sure how i feel
about<00:02:52.070> this<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.760> because<00:02:53.590> yes<00:02:54.590> they<00:02:54.860> get<00:02:55.040> the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
about this is because yes they get the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.430 
about this is because yes they get the
game<00:02:55.370> earlier<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.240> way<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.930> they<00:02:57.080> can<00:02:57.230> play

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
game earlier this way and they can play

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.590 
game earlier this way and they can play
it<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.680> their<00:02:57.800> own<00:02:57.890> language<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:59.240> winds<00:02:59.450> up

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
it in their own language and it winds up

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.290 
it in their own language and it winds up
being<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.960> same<00:02:59.990> price<00:03:00.590> as<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.610> game<00:03:01.790> will<00:03:02.060> be

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
being the same price as the game will be

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.580 
being the same price as the game will be
once<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.960> is<00:03:02.990> localized<00:03:04.150> but<00:03:05.150> it's<00:03:05.660> still<00:03:06.380> not

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
once it is localized but it's still not

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.140 
once it is localized but it's still not
going<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.890> be<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.070> same<00:03:07.250> quality<00:03:08.000> as<00:03:08.030> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
going to be the same quality as the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.660 
going to be the same quality as the
localized<00:03:08.660> version<00:03:09.080> now<00:03:09.350> if<00:03:09.530> say<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:10.070> game<00:03:10.370> came

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
localized version now if say a game came

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.360 
localized version now if say a game came
out<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.150> they<00:03:11.600> had<00:03:11.840> voice<00:03:12.230> packs<00:03:12.590> ready<00:03:12.980> and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.160 
out and they had voice packs ready and
lots<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.970> different<00:03:14.330> languages<00:03:14.750> available

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
lots of different languages available

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.070 
lots of different languages available
the<00:03:15.620> same<00:03:15.890> day<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.180> people<00:03:17.450> could<00:03:17.750> play

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
the same day so that people could play

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.670 
the same day so that people could play
the<00:03:18.260> game<00:03:18.440> if<00:03:18.590> they<00:03:18.740> wanted<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:20.410> some<00:03:21.410> part

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
the game if they wanted to I some part

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.900 
the game if they wanted to I some part
of<00:03:21.770> me<00:03:21.830> feels<00:03:22.040> like<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.340> would<00:03:22.430> be<00:03:22.460> really

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
of me feels like that would be really

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.820 
of me feels like that would be really
cool<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:24.020> would<00:03:24.110> eliminate<00:03:24.320> this<00:03:24.620> whole

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
cool and it would eliminate this whole

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640

the<00:03:40.850> thirty<00:03:41.090> dollars<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.630> then<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.810> winds<00:03:41.960> up

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
the thirty dollars and then it winds up

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.200 
the thirty dollars and then it winds up
being<00:03:42.110> more<00:03:42.710> but<00:03:43.220> from<00:03:43.550> what<00:03:43.640> I<00:03:43.700> understand
