little bit of food coloring it would be

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.700

you'd<00:02:32.860> be<00:02:33.040> applying<00:02:33.460> here<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.480> one<00:02:34.660> was

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
you'd be applying here so this one was

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.140 
you'd be applying here so this one was
purple<00:02:35.320> created<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.220> by<00:02:36.340> just<00:02:36.550> using<00:02:36.760> some

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
purple created that by just using some

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.690 
purple created that by just using some
blue<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.630> red<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.860> just<00:02:39.190> takes<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.670> few

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
blue and red and it just takes a few

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.600 
blue and red and it just takes a few
drops<00:02:40.240> here<00:02:40.840> I'd<00:02:40.960> only<00:02:41.230> use<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> couple<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:45.430> just

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
drops here I'd only use a couple it just

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.640 
drops here I'd only use a couple it just
gives<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.970> pretty<00:02:46.240> color<00:02:46.540> look<00:02:47.350> at<00:02:47.470> that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
gives it a pretty color look at that

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.360 
gives it a pretty color look at that
completely<00:02:48.610> transforms<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:51.040> then<00:02:51.220> it's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
completely transforms it and then it's

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.790 
completely transforms it and then it's
just<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.580> matter<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.880> packing<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.170> jar<00:02:53.500> I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
just a matter of packing this in a jar I

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800 
just a matter of packing this in a jar I
would<00:02:54.280> double<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.730> recipe<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.480> can<00:02:55.690> make

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
would double the recipe so you can make

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.740 
would double the recipe so you can make
a<00:02:55.840> full<00:02:56.200> pint<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:57.970> there<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.480> go<00:02:58.660> it

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
a full pint of it and there you go it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.110 
a full pint of it and there you go it
makes<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.990> beautiful<00:02:59.170> view<00:02:59.790> all<00:03:00.790> right<00:03:00.970> now
