 Blood Sweat and Photo - Videocast 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.560
 Creating the High-Key Effect 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.160
 Hello guys! Welcome to another video of Blood Sweat and Photo. 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.580
 And today I'm going to talk to you about High-Key. 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.000
 What are those super hyper-illuminated images with few areas with shadows. Beauty? 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400
 The right way to do this is in loco. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.660
 You have to be very enlightened, and as I said, with few shadows. 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.600
 But there are ways to simulate this effect using Photoshop. 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.840
 Like this image I'm showing you up here now. 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.900
 Beauty? And that's what I'm going to teach. 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.780
 One of these ways to work in Photoshop simulating this High-Key. 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.500
 Beauty? Come on? 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.440
 Well, here we are with our image already opened in Photoshop ... 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.980
 and the first step we will change the mode of the image. 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.380
 For this we will go here in "Image", ... 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.060
 "Mode" and let's turn it into "CMYK". 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.520
 We give an "Ok". 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.020
 And all right, we have our image in CMYK. 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.780
 Now we're going to go here on "Channels". 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.580
 We'll select the "Black" channel. 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.340
 Just click here. 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.980
 We'll select the entire Layer then. Let's press "Ctrl + A". 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.440
 We can see that it is selected ... 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.460
 for these "ants" here. By these points walking around her. 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.740
 Now we'll press "Ctrl + C", ... 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.440
 which is to copy this image. 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.400
 That done, we came back here in "Layers". 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.720
 We created a new Layer by simply clicking here ... 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.180
 on this paper with the tip folded. 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.780
 And we'll press "Ctrl + V" ... 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.800
 to paste the image we copied. 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.560
 And we already have our High-Key image. 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.060
 Now we can still make some final touches. 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.240
 Just come here in "Adjustments" ... 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.240
 and "Levels". 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.860
 And we can increase the contrast a bit more ... 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.920
 or even make it even clearer. 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.160
 There goes of the taste of each one. 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.380
 The important thing is that we already have our image. 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.180
 OK? 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.360
 And that's it folks! We came to the end of another video of Blood Sweat and Photo.
