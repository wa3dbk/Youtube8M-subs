00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:14.420
 now we need him making suggestions 752 hot colon 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.190
 different ingredients that we have at home or that we buy for boxes 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.190
 special 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.399
 Now we need a principle that is done with 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.300
 fingerprints and almonds 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.300
 catch the date 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.370
 there was talk 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 and they put the almond catch 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.540
 with trophy the cut 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 and with the stick 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.860
 37 show the hot pan and put a splash of oil 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 and wait for it to be 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.740
 I think I think the escobón after concluding fifth sobrasada and one 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.860
 toast 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.860
 we take the toast i 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.720
 a bit of sobrasada 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.080
 and we have to take out the skin 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.080
 we raise 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.650
 until the sobrasada we put whatever he is 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.650
 the quail egg 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.670
 and if that time 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.350
 make start you can also use the mushroom 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.970
 the butifarra and green pepper 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.250
 he takes a mushroom and removes what is he 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.030
 if you stand in the pan to follow 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.860
 also colón 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.170
 a piece of ee buti farra country growth 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.079
 the method we take the mushroom 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.319
 although never the drawing of botifarra for what 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.319
 be like the fight foot anti-crime 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.999
 green pepper 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.049
 frustration in fact a certain that they were cool 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.369
 with fried mushrooms that we have removed the trunk 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.119
 he was hugging 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.619
 take more or without it the phyto mushroom 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.449
 so, we have 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.759
 a little bit too much knows 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.759
 so that they remain three years 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.489
 they oppose 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.949
 the last step will be to receive the sobrasada in the microwave in the pan 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.319
 we can also use the fried mushroom 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.439
 the goat cheese and some ham cut to a view 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:26.649
 we take or that the mushroom 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.839
 that is on track we put in that that mushroom surface 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:37.139
 in prevention 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.139
 ham chips 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.849
 finally we heat it a little so that it is 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.659
 in this suggestion the freemont pse-ee mushroom and the range of it 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:50.409
 skillet 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.409
 and we present it this way 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.059
 in your opinion 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.209
 and the hands 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.669
 and we do not think 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.339
 this one sends and we are all going to press the colonel sobrasada and goat cheese 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.869
 you take a piece of toast and there we are the works now 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.939
 I wanted Spain 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:33.069
 a slice of pissed off 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.619
 and to finish before serving it warms up a bit 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.120
 also fill the boulevard 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.590
 with a bit of grated cheese and fried prawns to finish decorating 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.410
 finally heated volován until the cheese melt 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:11.569
 that's what we've done with these ingredients I hope you like it and that 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.009
 be very successful 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:13.469
 Happy Holidays
