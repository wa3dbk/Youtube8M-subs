00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.039
 hello staff let's start here 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.809
 recording is another video lesson 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.509
 Let's talk today about the issue. 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.949
 of the agreement of cubes I will use 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.160
 path to draw only so that 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.040
 appear better video if you use it 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.419
 to say hello is very weak huh 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.390
 So what do we want to do to each other? 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.940
 want to make a curve 1 that competes 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.210
 with other habits first do the axis 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:41.699
 central we can do is find 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.220
 owners of the leaf that can not 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.230
 attack the center of the two acts right 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.730
 let's imagine that I have here a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.790
 initial circumference 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.470
 then I erased the lines of 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.210
 construction at the end is only for air 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.579
 When we will imagine then we have 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.950
 circumference that has a radius of 30 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.100
 I have another circumference that has 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.229
 then a radius of 25 and the distance between the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.049
 axis over and over between the center of them 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.640
 80 80 millimeters 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.920
 the measures we are going to use that 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.100
 always dreamed in millimeters or pick up 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:22.469
 here and I will score but not centralize 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:27.450
 on the good paper attack the zero and let's stay 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:29.630
 here is a center of a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.579
 circumference if you have a gold center 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.579
 I used the step and I'll open the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.969
 my step as parking is 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.889
 between this so-called dry - tip account and 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.709
 here where will be the leonel graffiti you 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:46.200
 to draw from lakes is to open the distance 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:49.680
 I'll get my ruler here and another 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.770
 there that distance from the club 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.460
 What has to be different is she going to have 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.720
 a radius of 30 and a diameter of 60 which the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.160
 globe of the river né 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.080
 I will put here to try to centralize the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.390
 maximum so that the construction is more 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.390
 perfect as possible, I'll do it here 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.030
 You lecture 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.940
 well then we have a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.680
 reference what the radius of 30 now we go 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.680
 make another one with a radius of 15 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.760
 without trying to put more centered 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.760
 possible, right? 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.030
 Okay, so we have both here. 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.680
 circumference 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.410
 now that important part comes 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.050
 Say I want to make u 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.880
 an arc he will agree to this 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.989
 circumference and agree with this 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.300
 circumference 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:06.550
 only that bow will avoid the radius of 40 more 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.050
 the most important thing is to know where it is 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.730
 the center of defense where I'm going to put 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.010
 points out in a way that this 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.769
 agreement really happens with the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.540
 precisely where you need to do this 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.760
 people will use a zygo formula 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.489
 a formula in a simple but 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.700
 important we have this way that 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.799
 ray we'll call him then it 's 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.750
 that never say the radius of the circumference 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:34.209
 the iran then this distance here what you are 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.160
 We called Dr. 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.160
 and this is another ray of here 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.030
 we'll call r 2 what we're going to 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.980
 build now we'll call them 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.590
 call it r 3 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:57.340
 When using Formula 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:59.260
 to use is rio but r 3 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.690
 that is to say the radius of the 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.120
 fast we 'll build the 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:09.370
 people use or 2 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.830
 but the anger r31 second difference more 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.660
 Let's build fast let's go there. 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.370
 this conference is 30 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.440
 the agreement that we will achieve average 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.620
 40 then we're gonna have to open 30 more 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:28.330
 40 and 70 ac ro 470 will understand 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.729
 exactly how this mechanic works 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.650
 here put the measure here in the 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.450
 center 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.740
 the same always a circumference and I will 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.740
 make an arc right here 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.479
 I can make bigger and not much measure 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.030
 century because I need to meet with the 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.319
 Other air we'll see now what I 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.580
 I is 2 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:58.550
 the r2 it is very 5 and 3 here it is the same 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:05.259
 r 31 and 41 25 plus 40 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.259
 You will have 65 will open here in 65 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:16.039
 put in the same center and let's do 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.509
 that where the two met is the 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.419
 center of the r31 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:23.889
 only remembering r 30 to 40, let's not go 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.889
 open today 13 than in 40 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.250
 and now we will centralize here 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.830
 always ticking and let's make the 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:42.720
 agreement of 430 agree with this 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.729
 and I agree with that 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.320
 if I wanted to do the same 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.210
 bend up 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.250
 it was enough to have scored the center 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.380
 for making us quickly when we 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.870
 understand a little bit then remember 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:02.610
 which is river but r3 business attentive 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:06.660
 I will put at least the center of this 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:10.370
 time elton by marking up on en2 more 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.370
 R 3 mil to 65 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.830
 always the same and your conference 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.830
 at e3 equal to 40 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.879
 I'll put everyone there to use it if 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:34.569
 found is the center right 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:37.009
 we was then that the agreement of the 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:39.199
 r31 this great big hug people 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.210
 has been helpful if you liked the video and 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.830
 enjoy sharing puts your 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.879
 comment also that the measure of 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.189
 possible flight 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:48.639
 responding to you a strong good hug 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:48.639
 studies 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.750
 hello everybody let's start another video 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.780
 technical drawing class 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.490
 Let's talk about the importance of Cuba now. 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.740
 shoulders and two arches in the two 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.139
 conferences and we will agree on a 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:19.110
 curve internally I'm going to draw a 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:19.110
 reference line for us né
