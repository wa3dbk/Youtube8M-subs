aspect of starcraft one if anything I'd
actually<00:00:04.170> probably<00:00:04.500> say<00:00:04.680> that<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:04.980> the

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
actually probably say that is the

actually probably say that is the

to choose you know you have to explain

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.700 
to choose you know you have to explain
that<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.719> bit<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.500> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that a little bit you have you know a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.690 
that a little bit you have you know a
thousand<00:00:35.070> different<00:00:35.160> things<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.550> could<00:00:35.640> be

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
thousand different things you could be

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.130 
thousand different things you could be
doing<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.030> any<00:00:36.149> given<00:00:36.329> second<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:36.989> only

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
doing in any given second and you only

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
doing in any given second and you only
have<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.590> mental<00:00:37.800> capacity<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.579> about<00:00:38.670> 500

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
have the mental capacity to do about 500

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.080 
have the mental capacity to do about 500
of<00:00:39.329> them<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:40.920> know<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.370> always<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
of them and you know to always have the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.369 
of them and you know to always have the
ability<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.360> choose<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.020> want<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> do

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
ability to choose of what you want to do

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.959 
ability to choose of what you want to do
so<00:00:43.770> we're<00:00:43.920> having<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.219> bit<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.489> hydrolysis

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
so we're having a bit of a hydrolysis

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.910 
so we're having a bit of a hydrolysis
balance<00:00:45.270> problem<00:00:45.600> today<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:46.469> don't<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.800> them

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
balance problem today we don't see them

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.639 
balance problem today we don't see them
being<00:00:47.190> made<00:00:47.489> too<00:00:47.820> often<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.600> our<00:00:48.719> matches<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
being made too often in our matches and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.029 
being made too often in our matches and
they're<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.610> very<00:00:51.329> good<00:00:51.690> when<00:00:51.989> use<00:00:52.440> them<00:00:52.680> yeah

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
they're not very good when use them yeah

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.250 
they're not very good when use them yeah
so<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.699> first<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.149> didn't<00:00:54.449> identify<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
so we we first I didn't identify the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.240 
so we we first I didn't identify the
problems<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:57.559> we<00:00:58.559> try<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.770> find<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> best

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
problems and we try to find the best

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
problems and we try to find the best
possible<00:00:59.640> solutions<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> them<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.660> once<00:01:01.170> we

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
possible solutions to them and once we

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
possible solutions to them and once we
have<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.100> would<00:01:02.250> play<00:01:02.430> play<00:01:02.789> some<00:01:02.969> games

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
have then we would play play some games

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.820 
have then we would play play some games
make<00:01:03.629> sure<00:01:03.780> they're<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> best<00:01:04.199> solution

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
make sure they're the best solution

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.429 
make sure they're the best solution
since<00:01:04.979> they're<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.909> would<00:01:06.439> restart

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
since they're not then we would restart

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.800 
since they're not then we would restart
that<00:01:07.530> process<00:01:08.130> all<00:01:08.280> over<00:01:08.310> again<00:01:08.570> we<00:01:09.570> try<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that process all over again we try to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.000 
that process all over again we try to
make<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.880> it's<00:01:12.200> realistic<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.530> situation

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
make like it's realistic the situation

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.609 
make like it's realistic the situation
as<00:01:14.100> possible<00:01:14.460> every<00:01:14.640> time<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:15.380> try<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> balance

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
as possible every time we try to balance

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.050 
as possible every time we try to balance
testing<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.820> new<00:01:18.509> units<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.170> changes<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.759> I'm

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
testing you new units or changes so I'm

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.570 
testing you new units or changes so I'm
just<00:01:21.270> doing<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.930> basic<00:01:22.170> build<00:01:23.040> order<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
just doing the basic build order that a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.990 
just doing the basic build order that a
Protoss<00:01:23.939> player<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.450> doing<00:01:26.000> basically

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
Protoss player will be doing basically

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
Protoss player will be doing basically
the<00:01:27.810> problem<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> Hydra<00:01:28.799> list<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.220> mainly

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the problem of the Hydra list was mainly

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.940 
the problem of the Hydra list was mainly
against<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> Protoss<00:01:30.689> race<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.320> we're<00:01:31.829> gonna

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
against the Protoss race so we're gonna

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.399 
against the Protoss race so we're gonna
see<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.640> we've<00:01:32.909> alleviated<00:01:33.630> some<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
see if we've alleviated some of the I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.679 
see if we've alleviated some of the I
guess<00:01:35.250> problem<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> hydrolysed<00:01:36.390> being

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
guess problem with the hydrolysed being

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.890 
guess problem with the hydrolysed being
not<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.049> useful<00:01:38.030> in<00:01:39.030> an<00:01:39.240> actual<00:01:39.570> game

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
not so useful in an actual game

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.020 
not so useful in an actual game
situation<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.159> first<00:01:41.369> test<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.790> seems

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
situation for the first test it seems

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.120 
situation for the first test it seems
pretty<00:01:42.180> good<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.720> we'll<00:01:43.649> probably<00:01:43.829> tweak

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
pretty good but we'll probably tweak

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.039 
pretty good but we'll probably tweak
some<00:01:44.460> more<00:01:44.610> things<00:01:44.850> play<00:01:45.509> some<00:01:45.689> more<00:01:45.780> times

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
some more things play some more times

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.250 
some more things play some more times
and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
and

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.860 
and
decide<00:01:47.530> what<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.920> do<00:01:48.070> we<00:01:48.820> also<00:01:48.970> usually<00:01:49.330> involve

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
decide what I do we also usually involve

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.660 
decide what I do we also usually involve
some<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.470> other<00:01:50.590> designers<00:01:51.160> and<00:01:51.430> get

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
some of the other designers and get

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.940 
some of the other designers and get
their<00:01:51.790> opinions<00:01:52.150> on<00:01:52.330> things<00:01:52.540> but<00:01:52.990> um<00:01:53.170> yeah

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
their opinions on things but um yeah

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.250 
their opinions on things but um yeah
it's<00:01:54.160> pretty<00:01:54.310> much<00:01:54.550> we<00:01:54.790> if<00:01:55.450> we<00:01:55.690> find<00:01:55.870> a<00:01:55.960> problem

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
it's pretty much we if we find a problem

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.250 
it's pretty much we if we find a problem
we'll<00:01:56.380> try<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.620> identify<00:01:57.010> it<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.610> then<00:01:58.260> figure

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
we'll try to identify it and then figure

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.690 
we'll try to identify it and then figure
out<00:01:59.320> some<00:01:59.500> fixes<00:01:59.800> and<00:01:59.980> play<00:02:00.130> for<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.520> see

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
out some fixes and play for it and see

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.960 
out some fixes and play for it and see
if<00:02:00.760> it<00:02:00.850> feels<00:02:00.970> any<00:02:01.210> better

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.760 

yeah<00:02:05.970> so<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> team<00:02:06.690> that<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.840> work<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
yeah so the team that I work with is the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.960 
yeah so the team that I work with is the
team<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.010> designers<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.760> like<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
team of designers you know like I

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.790 
team of designers you know like I
mentioned<00:02:09.180> we<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.869> balance<00:02:10.200> designers

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
mentioned we have the balance designers

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.710 
mentioned we have the balance designers
and<00:02:11.070> their<00:02:11.310> job<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.760> predominantly<00:02:12.360> just

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and their job is predominantly just

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.800 
and their job is predominantly just
making<00:02:12.930> sure<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.410> balanced<00:02:14.100> game

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
making sure that we have a balanced game

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.960 
making sure that we have a balanced game
well<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.900> guess<00:02:16.110> that's<00:02:16.430> pretty<00:02:17.430> obvious<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
well I guess that's pretty obvious the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.240 
well I guess that's pretty obvious the
balance<00:02:18.210> designers<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.930> balance<00:02:19.470> but

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
balance designers the balance but

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.620 
balance designers the balance but
they're<00:02:20.550> their<00:02:20.730> job<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.360> make<00:02:21.600> sure

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
they're their job is just to make sure

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.780 
they're their job is just to make sure
that<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.680> crunch<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.980> numbers<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.520> make<00:02:23.610> sure

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
that to crunch the numbers to make sure

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.100 
that to crunch the numbers to make sure
that<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.060> have<00:02:24.180> three<00:02:24.540> separate<00:02:24.870> factions

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
that we have three separate factions

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.130 
that we have three separate factions
that<00:02:25.470> are<00:02:25.590> very<00:02:25.860> distinctive<00:02:26.990> but<00:02:27.990> also

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
that are very distinctive but also

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.610 
that are very distinctive but also
balance<00:02:28.590> as<00:02:28.710> well<00:02:29.210> keeping<00:02:30.210> units

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
balance as well keeping units

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.250 
balance as well keeping units
interesting<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.800> unique<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:33.260> tricky

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
interesting and unique is tricky

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.930 
interesting and unique is tricky
especially<00:02:34.770> with<00:02:35.190> three<00:02:35.400> races<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.880> are

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
especially with three races that are

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.630 
especially with three races that are
completely<00:02:36.180> different<00:02:36.860> there<00:02:37.860> are<00:02:38.100> certain

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
completely different there are certain

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.670 
completely different there are certain
mechanics<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.330> actually<00:02:39.480> try<00:02:40.080> not<00:02:40.410> to

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
mechanics that we actually try not to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.460 
mechanics that we actually try not to
bleed<00:02:41.250> over<00:02:41.310> into<00:02:42.060> different<00:02:42.750> races<00:02:42.930> we<00:02:43.230> try

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
bleed over into different races we try

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.860 
bleed over into different races we try
and<00:02:43.650> focus<00:02:43.860> on<00:02:44.220> one<00:02:44.670> race<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.150> help<00:02:45.330> give<00:02:45.630> that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
and focus on one race to help give that

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.110 
and focus on one race to help give that
race<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> certain<00:02:46.620> identity<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.730> starcraft

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
race a certain identity so in starcraft

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.270 
race a certain identity so in starcraft
2<00:02:48.350> we<00:02:49.350> definitely<00:02:49.500> make<00:02:49.770> sure<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:50.010> we<00:02:50.100> have

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
2 we definitely make sure that we have

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.880 
2 we definitely make sure that we have
those<00:02:50.430> dynamics<00:02:51.260> but<00:02:52.260> beyond<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.800> know

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
those dynamics but beyond that you know

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.650 
those dynamics but beyond that you know
we're<00:02:53.010> bringing<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.370> new<00:02:53.550> units<00:02:53.940> we're

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
we're bringing you new units we're

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.030 
we're bringing you new units we're
taking<00:02:55.050> out<00:02:55.170> some<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.500> older<00:02:55.680> units<00:02:55.950> of

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
taking out some of the older units of

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.680 
taking out some of the older units of
char<00:02:56.190> craft<00:02:56.400> one<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.880> either<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.480> roles

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
char craft one that either the roles

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.030 
char craft one that either the roles
were<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> little<00:02:58.110> bit<00:02:58.230> soft<00:02:58.500> or<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.950> they

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
were a little bit soft or that they

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040 
were a little bit soft or that they
weren't<00:02:59.190> used<00:02:59.430> as<00:02:59.640> much<00:02:59.850> in<00:03:00.120> trying<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.960> bring

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
weren't used as much in trying to bring

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.510 
weren't used as much in trying to bring
some<00:03:01.410> really<00:03:01.710> interesting<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.370> cool

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
some really interesting and cool

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.550 
some really interesting and cool
dynamics<00:03:03.120> for<00:03:03.630> instance<00:03:03.930> like<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.170> stalker

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
dynamics for instance like a stalker

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.250 
dynamics for instance like a stalker
it's<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.490> basic<00:03:06.060> mechanical<00:03:06.780> unit<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.140> can

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
it's a basic mechanical unit that can

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.900 
it's a basic mechanical unit that can
shoot<00:03:07.380> ground<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.860> can<00:03:07.950> shoot<00:03:08.100> air<00:03:08.310> however<00:03:08.820> it

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
shoot ground it can shoot air however it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.000 
shoot ground it can shoot air however it
now<00:03:09.060> has<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.270> versatility<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.739> blink

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
now has the versatility of a blink

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.229 
now has the versatility of a blink
ability<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.550> gives<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.910> short-range

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
ability that gives it a short-range

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.970 
ability that gives it a short-range
teleport<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.260> can<00:03:13.500> use<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> kind<00:03:13.920> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
teleport so you can use a kind of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.740 
teleport so you can use a kind of
offensively<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.790> chasing<00:03:15.180> units<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.600> can

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
offensively and chasing units you can

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.900 
offensively and chasing units you can
use<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.870> defensively<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.800> jumping<00:03:17.700> across

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
use it defensively and jumping across

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.600 
use it defensively and jumping across
chasms<00:03:18.540> or<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.800> know<00:03:19.920> even<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.520> have

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
chasms or you know even if you have

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.100 
chasms or you know even if you have
vision<00:03:20.910> up<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.120> cliff<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.660> use<00:03:21.810> your<00:03:21.930> guys

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
vision up a cliff you can use your guys

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.920 
vision up a cliff you can use your guys
to<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.950> bypass<00:03:23.430> someone's<00:03:23.850> entire<00:03:24.150> choke<00:03:24.690> and

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
to the bypass someone's entire choke and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.840 
to the bypass someone's entire choke and
just<00:03:25.530> move<00:03:25.680> up<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:25.920> cliff<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.400> then<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:26.640> can

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
just move up a cliff and then you can

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.280
