00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.440
 hello love to play I want's me 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.840
 carrier metatron and I'm back with 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.599
 a new video about world of warcraft 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.670
 and this time it's about the trailer may 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.230
 So not this pc up here on 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.160
 the tree the small bird I now 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.310
 but have the trailer in the frost 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.670
 Fire degree and that means here you see 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:39.180
 he is a 90- thug one 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:42.129
 intention to deceive this loose 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.010
 and has the ability of the head and nut 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.589
 this pushed as I said there is in the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.809
 frost fire degree for that you have to go into the 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:54.309
 horde area the hordes get so 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.680
 easier than you all the alliance first 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.869
 Let's get there and here comes today 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.360
 of course a bit faster that is 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:05.770
 namely the starting area was as well 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.729
 Fly so much blood because mine 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.729
 there is also the first one nearby 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:19.090
 point where you find this day namely 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:22.900
 in making kites canyon German 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.010
 Gorge of course, and you see 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.440
 where I am standing 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.390
 So you can go here in the whole 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.670
 canyons everywhere cages are found there 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.590
 everywhere so beautiful and turrets there 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.500
 above, for example, at this big tower 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.360
 could also be a cage but where is 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.720
 This time we have the cage down here 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.590
 and there you can see it already lay it 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.659
 So locked up in cage if you 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.520
 she is allowed to talk to us 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.270
 Sweden see otherwise my camouflage is missing 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.420
 and then you open your cage and 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.020
 Days free do not know how many times me 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.000
 always get caught doing chuckles 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.060
 disarmed exactly so 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.370
 we say that's enough, but that's enough 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.070
 you do not have to do it twice 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.370
 liberate at two different 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.560
 places and if he now the place as 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.550
 first takes or the other first 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.570
 it does not matter so you can do it freely 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.480
 choose yourself 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.130
 So you do not have to start here so 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.670
 the german language gorge is a 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.780
 Place where he is and the second place 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.850
 He is here with the giant skeleton 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:40.810
 This reason was given in the relative 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.220
 noticeable in the frost fire degree is and 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.280
 there the steamer measures the club 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.880
 just ride in and also here after 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.430
 looking for a cage where he can be inside 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.070
 could there is a cage but is not 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.489
 in there nothing lights green and there 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:02.459
 you can already see that back there 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.459
 that's the way it is and when I'm here now 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:13.709
 kill the little bear here or how 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:20.250
 Whatever your name is, that's the title of Dietrich Spot 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.250
 okay and then we have the day here 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.209
 says you can not see us talking 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.750
 we already had the topic and then 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:33.040
 we open it again and there is free 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:38.709
 thanks say tactic is just that way 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:42.040
 the second time and was always good 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.140
 disguised the Schuke in the cage and now 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.000
 Let's see if he's in there now 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.720
 the garnison away that is then 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.910
 the place where he waits for you then one 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.980
 as soon as it you found it twice is 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.049
 he here in the garnison her so to her 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.510
 on the map outside the garnison is 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:03.220
 an exclamation point 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.890
 and there is again with a cage but 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.829
 somehow he has his own 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.290
 armor or something 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.510

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.660

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:21.039
