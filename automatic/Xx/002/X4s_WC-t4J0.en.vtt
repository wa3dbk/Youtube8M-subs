00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.849
 line that we have engaged in assembling 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.530
 the classic is divided into 6 posts 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.059
 going on algorithms about in 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.820
 the next order is first typed 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.859
 frame gave she goes to the post which 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.779
 sets the engine here point 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.670
 work on the heart of our hero for the cause 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.260
 one of the best masters Oleg is taken 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.510
 boiling in his hands is certainly not 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.880
 scalpel but torque wrenches 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.920
 a guarantee of reliability they drag over 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 40 percent of all nodes in parallel 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.230
 using a threaded retainer 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.140
 the need to use is that 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.510
 bolts over time from vibration can 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.790
 apply and here we fix them by 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.410
 power clamp and after 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.910
 set the rear wheel and chain 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.600
 tensioned accordingly becomes 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.239
 front fork in the front wheel 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.000
 parallel to this post occurs 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.710
 a selection of fuel tank packaging 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.710
 for shipping option 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.060
 after that go to the post electricians 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.450
 pave the electrical lived fixes 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.090
 her 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.400
 and connects the main electrical elements 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.430
 checks the functionality of the lighting 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.070
 devices and into that map which 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.550
 accompanies motorcycle assembly from the first 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.430
 on the last post is made final 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.720
 corrections and accompanying notes 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.760
 after the assembly line motorcycle 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.180
 sent to the department of those controls or a 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.470
 because 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.970
 where controls you yet also 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.950
 torque wrenches and other 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.450
 toolbox checks for latency major 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.280
 knots of units of the engine 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.750
 yuko front rear brake and much 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.910
 other and immediately after testing 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.350
 characteristics on a special stand about 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.350
 all the power on their characteristics 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.520
 after which the motorcycle passes on 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.190
 line checked wheel alignment 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.950
 Further 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.920
 brake performance after which 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.270
 hits the light test stand 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.110
 beam now line 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.670
 gets the printout checked already on 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.950
 this booth characteristics we 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.490
 Accordingly, conclusions are made about 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.440
 him 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.540
 final readiness if occurs 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.550
 the remark that the technique is given closers 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.440
 who are all over the country but they say that itâ€™s 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.480
 they almost never have one 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.380
 The new model has been significantly improved and 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.380
 so important little things
