00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
nothing like the original though it's

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.210 
nothing like the original though it's
done<00:03:33.659> in<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.079> much<00:03:34.290> more<00:03:34.439> acoustic<00:03:34.709> kind<00:03:35.099> of

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
done in a much more acoustic kind of

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.880 
done in a much more acoustic kind of
style<00:03:36.019> different<00:03:37.019> chords<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.530> whole<00:03:37.650> thing

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
style different chords the whole thing

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.679

so that's my little way of farm playing
this<00:06:19.430> not<00:06:20.360> really<00:06:20.660> an<00:06:20.720> acoustic<00:06:21.110> song<00:06:21.290> but<00:06:21.590> um

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
this not really an acoustic song but um

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.820 
this not really an acoustic song but um
I<00:06:22.040> think<00:06:22.700> it<00:06:22.940> sounds<00:06:23.090> alright<00:06:23.570> so<00:06:24.500> if<00:06:24.620> you<00:06:24.710> want

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
I think it sounds alright so if you want

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.900 
I think it sounds alright so if you want
to<00:06:24.890> play<00:06:25.010> that<00:06:25.160> one<00:06:25.310> that's<00:06:25.550> one<00:06:25.730> way<00:06:25.880> of

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
to play that one that's one way of

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.980 
to play that one that's one way of
playing<00:06:26.150> it<00:06:26.980> by
