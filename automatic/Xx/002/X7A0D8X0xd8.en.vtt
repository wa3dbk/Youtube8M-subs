00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.450
 Hello, this is NuSensei, and today we will clarify something. 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.829
 So, you are going to buy a bow. 

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:13.759
 Maybe you have that cool camouflage arch in mind that looks great, and you just want that 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.499
 hold in your hands. 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.000
 And then you might think: you know, I would like to shoot competitively. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.609
 You see those competition bows and you see these weird things sticking out and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.390
 and you wonder what they are. Are they important? Do I have to buy them? 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.050
 You know, I run into some people who want a bow to shoot in the backyard. 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.780
 And then they want to participate in competitions and they also want to hunt. 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.440
 It is quite important to understand that there are some differences between arches that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.789
 designed for target shooting and bows specially designed for hunting. 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.010
 To give this some context, let's say there are beginner arches, olympic style arches, 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.940
 and hunting bows. 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.910
 The beginner's arches are the cheap, wooden take-down arches ... 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.150
 such as the Fuse Focus, the Samick Polaris and the PSE Razorback. 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.220
 These arches are not really meant to be used for competitive shooting or hunting. 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.710
 They are somewhat small, have low tensile forces, up to around 34 pounds, 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.380
 and are meant for people who have just started and want a slight bow to practice with. 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.070
 The strength and performance do not necessarily make them suitable for competitive archery or 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.780
 to hunt. 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 There are some exceptions. The Samick Sage, for example, is also available in higher tensile forces, 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.750
 such as 45 or 60 pounds, 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.950
 and they can be used as beginner's hunting bows. 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.390
 If you go from beginner's equipment or you have chosen to skip that step and you want 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.930
 medium-level equipment will have to spend some money and you will have to decide 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.830
 what kind of archery you want to specialize in. 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.100
 Okay, let's take a look at the differences between target bow gear and hunting gear. 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.520
 Target bows are the type of bows you find in match shooting. 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.530
 For most people, you would see these types of arches at the Olympics. 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.200
 As you can imagine, there are local, national and international competitions. 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.490
 Target bows are optimized for good performance 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.710
 and the accessories that you put on the bow are designed to help the shooter achieve 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.800
 precision and consistency on a long distance. 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.820
 Target bows have some distinguishing features 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.730
 First, they are bright, metallic and they have large brand logos for those sporty 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.340
 look 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.580
 The size is also quite logical, the target bow being 68 inches long, so 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.240
 as long as the archer. 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.130
 The long stabilizers help to keep the bow well balanced. 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.830
 The visor is a simple, adjustable round viewfinder. 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.190
 Aluminum and carbon are good materials for these types of arches. 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.190
 The arches are typically quite heavy and balanced. 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.270
 If you want to buy a bow with the ability to hunt with it, target bows are not really 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.750
 a practical choice. 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.760
 Remember that when you hunt you are outside. 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.180
 The size of a target bow makes it quite annoying, I am talking about the length here. 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.010
 He is actually taller than you are. He's pretty big. 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.990
 You cannot use stabilizers that are too long, they will get in the way. 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.650
 The bright colors and brands do not really fit in the outside environment 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.730
 In general, he is very clumsy. 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.880
 Remember that target bows are designed to always hit targets at a distance of 70 to 90 meters. 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.660
 If you are hunting, you are not really going to shoot more than 30 meters. 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.440
 So what makes a hunting bow different? 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.450
 For beginners, the look is quite different. 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.270
 The bulkhead hunting bows are made of wood or else with camouflage patterns or simply completely black. 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.090
 Unlike target bows, wooden hunting bows take a large share of the market, although you do 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.780
 metal centerpieces. 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.410
 Hunting bows are shorter and the accessories are also more compact. 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.250
 When it comes to accessories, it will also differ. 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.600
 Many hunters prefer shooting with a glove instead of a finger tab. 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.370
 Whisker biscuits are often used. 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.730
 Tendon dampers are also normal. 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.090
 Bow arrow sleeves can be attached to many modern arches. 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.410
 Visors often have multiple pins for multiple distances because your goal is not always 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.200
 is at the same distance. 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.680
 And of course the choice for arrows and arrowheads will be different. 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.370
 We have found that target bows are not always practical for hunting. 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.220
 But can you use a hunting bow as a target bow? 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.250
 That would be possible from a practical perspective. 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.690
 However, he will not be able to compete against a real target bow 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.690
 I will now compare them. 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.510
 Simply put, a target bow, especially one of high quality, will deliver more performance. 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.389
 We are talking about more efficiency for a certain traction. 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.810
 So more speed and more control over vibrations. 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.710
 The low weight of a hunting bow is actually a disadvantage on the shooting range compared to 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.050
 a heavier target bow, because there is less stability. 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.080
 In addition, a variety of stabilizers and dampers can be mounted on target arches, just like 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.030
 other accessories, such as a plunger or clicker, while that is not possible for hunting bows. 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.710
 Color, form and sound make no difference on the shooting range. 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.810
 Considering all these things, a target bow should actually be possible to shoot close groups at longer ones 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.610
 distances. 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.010
 This underlines the unique requirements for bow hunters and target shooters, and how producers 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.419
 design arches that match those requirements. 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.810
 A hunter needs no long-distance precision, 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.940
 while a target shooter does not have to worry about the size of his bow. 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.960
 By the way, although this mainly applies to recurve bows, these differences also apply 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.210
 on some compound bows. 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:48.190
 This affects you because you cannot really buy a bow that is suitable for everything. 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.770
 Arches are designed with these purposes in mind, especially for high quality arches. 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.449
 If you're thinking about buying a bow, it's useful to keep these things in mind. 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.630
 Anyway, this is NUSensei. I hope this video was helpful. Thank you for looking and 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.539
 until next time!
