00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello friends welcome back to this 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.990
 magic space where today we are going to 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.460
 learn also a pretty trick 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 stunning visual view of the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.720
 agreement viewer is easy too 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.119
 of learning does not have any 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.760
 complication only some country is a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.460
 little quickie because you do not notice but 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.519
 basically it 's 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.039
 as you can see here we have a couple of 66 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.380
 and in the couple of 7 can be is for 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.150
 whatever you want according 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.650
 and on the other hand we have a race 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.030
 2 the 13 4 and the 5 of hearts with this 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.760
 what are we going to do the second with 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 very simple called the elevator of the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.420
 Devil in agreement 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.030
 as I told you on the one hand we have the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.710
 couple of 766 and on the other hand we have the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.750
 stairs 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.390
 ok so what are we going to do is going to be 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.340
 separate on one side 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.730
 we have the 766 couples is in agreement 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.220
 and on the other hand we have the ladder 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.610
 we said before it was the 2 of hearts 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.970
 the three of hearts the four hearts 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.850
 and 5 and we put it in order again 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.750
 and we turn around and we're going to leave in this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.210
 occasion the 5 of hearts in 4 of 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.270
 hearts and the 3 of hearts of agreement 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.329
 we are only with the 2 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.590
 we put it say in the elevator the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.780
 rest of the letters we can tell 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.299
 what is the elevator 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:45.619
 as it is the 2 of hearts we are going to put 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.619
 on the 2nd floor 1st and 2nd we closed 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.460
 it's amazingly 2 hearts 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.520
 has climbed to the top floor above 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.040
 lots of letters of agreement we take the 3 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.250
 of hearts 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.380
 how do we put the elevator 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.369
 we take the advice and we will put it 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.350
 on the floor number 3 1 2 and 3 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.350
 we really close 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.230
 Y 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.860
 in number 3 it has also gone up 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.720
 from the heap 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.970
 as you can see in these letters 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.580
 we still have our partners 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.580
 of seven and six according 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:41.450
 we take the 4 of hearts and we're going to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.989
 put it in its position 1 2 3 and 4 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.989
 we close 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.410
 and after this magical pass the 4th of 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.880
 hearts has risen up to the world 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.340
 here we continue having 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.610
 our four cards our couples 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.670
 17 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.100
 6 is egg 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.360
 with which we put them on top 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.360
 of 5 hearts 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.500
 How is normal 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.450
 the 5 also wants to climb up second 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.690
 well so far the trick we are going to 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.120
 see the explanation how it is carried out 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.910
 as we said before we have a 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.150
 couple of six of seven and a couple is 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.150
 that 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.350
 and on the other hand 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.620
 we have the ladder 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.240
 23 45 well you can do it with any 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.930
 directed stick this you can do it with 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.640
 diamond spades etc 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.660
 The first step to follow is to separate 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.510
 Couples of the ladder but 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.610
 if you look closely what we are going to do 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.160
 to be taking this 6 also to the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.160
 ladder that evidently in a way 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.189
 when we close, we do it like that 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.560
 and here we have already taken the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.760
 the 6 according to 6 knows it here as 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.269
 you see 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.430
 here we only have 3 1 2 and 3 but the 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.560
 spectator stays in the capital 4 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.070
 when we really have not arrived until 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.070
 here 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.670
 we take the letters like this 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:32.020
 because here and here we will avoid 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.180
 move and we will say we have 2 on 3 the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.630
 4 and 5 of hearts 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.639
 evidently under five hearts 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.319
 is the 6 diamond ok 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.360
 what we do is as if it were one 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.360
 letter we put them back in order 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.629
 and we say let's let's leave on 5 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:54.889
 hearts when we really are 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:58.009
 leaving the 6 diamond according 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:01.340
 5 of hearts 4 of hearts three of 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:04.430
 hearts and we are left with the 2 of 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.569
 hearts that really is 2 and 3 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.080
 okay 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:12.800
 we put it on the rest of the letters 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.260
 how is the 2 of hearts 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.880
 we are going to do it in position number 2 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.650
 but really this is the three of 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.920
 2 hearts of hearts and even 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.920
 above 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.400
 we close we make a magical pass that 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:30.670
 we want and we say that it has gone up 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.930
 we take the 3 that really is the 4 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:37.500
 and we count 3 1 2 and 3 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.389
 we close between them from above 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.919
 we make a magic trick a magic pass 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.160
 we made the 3 a rise from above 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.889
 now to put the 4 we have to do 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.650
 the next thing I have to say look if you do not 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:53.130
 you want me so that here are not the 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.030
 6 and 7 you will see we have 1 we have 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:06:01.669
 2 that here we really take the 4 and the 7 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:05.970
 agree 2 3 and 4 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:08.550
 saying this we take ours the one that would be 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.370
 the 4 of hearts that really is 5 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:14.580
 because the 4 we already have it here 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.300
 agreement 123 we put it in position 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.639
 number 4 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.099
 we make any magical passage that we 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.580
 like it and we say that number 4 has 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:25.889
 already left the package 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.129
 to put the 5 nation what we have 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:31.470
 what to do is count 4 1 2 3 and 4 and 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.789
 tell the viewer again to stop 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.960
 to see that it is true that they are only 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:40.129
 here the 7 and the 6 is according to 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.129
 we have again two letters 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:48.630
 we count to one 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.630
 two 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.270
 same 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.400
 in this way we managed to upload the 5 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.039
 up the viewer it is believed that the 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.599
 5 is here with which we 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:03.090
 we will put here in the letters and we will say 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.710
 that now with a magical pass the 5 goes to 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.700
 climb up the elevator 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.710
 and how do you see the 5 to be safe 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.570
 good friends, this has been all for 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:16.740
 today I hope you liked the trick 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:18.870
 and if they like these tricks, they do not 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.210
 it costs nothing to like it according to 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.940
 channel and so you will help us to follow 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.240
 doing more tricks very well many 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.050
 Thank you 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.050
 and until next time
