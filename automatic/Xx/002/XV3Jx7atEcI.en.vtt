back we'll just put flexes in or even

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
back we'll just put flexes in or even
fed<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.450> what

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
fed on I was just like you know what

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.050 
fed on I was just like you know what
this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.799> work<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.700> part<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.970> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
this is just work and a part of that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.640 
this is just work and a part of that
reason<00:01:15.119> was<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.200> told<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.619> my

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
reason was because as I told you my

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.740 
reason was because as I told you my
curls<00:01:17.070> didn't<00:01:17.369> last<00:01:17.549> long<00:01:17.880> anyway<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.600> this

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
curls didn't last long anyway with this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.050 
curls didn't last long anyway with this
hair<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.280> got<00:01:20.490> tired<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
hair so it's kind of like I got tired of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.370 
hair so it's kind of like I got tired of
going<00:01:21.390> through<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.600> process<00:01:21.780> every<00:01:22.229> night

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
going through the process every night

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
going through the process every night
for<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> curls<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.280> potentially<00:01:23.820> fall

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
for the curls just to potentially fall

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149 
for the curls just to potentially fall
and<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.009> like

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
and just be like this so I was just like

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.910 
and just be like this so I was just like
I'm<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.820> gonna<00:01:26.939> wear<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.450> um<00:01:28.020> but

here<00:01:41.880> at<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> same<00:01:42.240> time<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> came<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
here at the same time so when it came to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.069 
here at the same time so when it came to
putting<00:01:43.979> his<00:01:44.159> hair<00:01:44.340> home<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.820> our<00:01:45.000> Lord<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
putting his hair home just our Lord and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.219 
putting his hair home just our Lord and
that's<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:47.100> good<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.299> my<00:01:48.390> main<00:01:48.540> issues<00:01:48.990> is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that's not good one of my main issues is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.480 
that's not good one of my main issues is
that<00:01:49.700> there<00:01:50.700> gets<00:01:51.090> frizzy<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:53.009> don't

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that there gets frizzy and I don't

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.999 
that there gets frizzy and I don't
necessarily<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:54.270> frizzy<00:01:54.750> hair<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.860> it

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
necessarily like frizzy hair and then it

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.499 
necessarily like frizzy hair and then it
kind<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.369> tangles<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.090> me<00:01:57.240> sometimes

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
kind of tangles on me sometimes

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.200 
kind of tangles on me sometimes
especially<00:01:58.229> when<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.829> curly<00:01:59.430> or<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.939> curls

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
especially when it's curly or the curls

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.209 
especially when it's curly or the curls
are<00:02:00.360> starting<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.689> fall<00:02:00.930> kind<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.500> tangled<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
are starting to fall kind of tangled and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.020 
are starting to fall kind of tangled and
I<00:02:02.610> don't<00:02:03.450> necessarily<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.430> it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
I don't necessarily like that and it

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.309 
I don't necessarily like that and it
just<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.570> was<00:02:07.340> weird<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.700> know<00:02:08.789> so

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
just it just was weird you know so

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.459 
just it just was weird you know so
it's<00:02:11.980> not<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.999> best<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.689> it's<00:02:13.810> not<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.260> worst

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
it's not the best and it's not the worst

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.459 
it's not the best and it's not the worst
however<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.999> is<00:02:16.239> just<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:16.659> of<00:02:16.689> them<00:02:16.900> wigs<00:02:17.170> it's

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
however it is just one of them wigs it's

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.860 
however it is just one of them wigs it's
just<00:02:17.620> like<00:02:17.769> I<00:02:17.980> wear<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.459> if<00:02:18.969> I<00:02:19.150> want<00:02:19.359> to<00:02:19.420> be<00:02:19.510> cute

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
just like I wear it if I want to be cute

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.750 
just like I wear it if I want to be cute
but<00:02:20.200> I'm<00:02:20.379> gonna<00:02:20.590> wait<00:02:20.739> I'm<00:02:20.980> take<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> wig<00:02:21.549> off

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
but I'm gonna wait I'm take the wig off

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.509 
but I'm gonna wait I'm take the wig off
later<00:02:22.150> if<00:02:22.629> that<00:02:23.139> makes<00:02:23.349> any<00:02:23.530> sense<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:24.310> just

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
later if that makes any sense it's just

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.089 
later if that makes any sense it's just
like<00:02:24.609> like<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.569> said<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> curls<00:02:26.200> full<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:26.980> it

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
like like I said the curls full then it

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.949

gets<00:02:27.249> a<00:02:27.400> little<00:02:27.579> frizzy<00:02:28.150> then<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.569> gets<00:02:28.719> a

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
gets a little frizzy then it gets a

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.879 
gets a little frizzy then it gets a
little<00:02:29.409> tangley<00:02:30.129> and<00:02:30.519> just<00:02:31.510> those<00:02:31.840> traits<00:02:32.680> I

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889

just<00:02:33.159> do<00:02:33.370> not<00:02:33.400> like<00:02:33.579> then<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.239> kind<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.569> gets<00:02:34.689> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
just do not like then it kind of gets a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.020 
just do not like then it kind of gets a
little<00:02:35.019> stiff<00:02:35.379> for<00:02:35.620> me<00:02:35.799> right<00:02:36.459> now<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.670> feel

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
little stiff for me right now I feel

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.490 
little stiff for me right now I feel
like<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.359> hair<00:02:37.569> is<00:02:37.689> kind<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.079> little<00:02:38.290> heavy

like the hair is kind of a little heavy

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.550 
like the hair is kind of a little heavy
so<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.659> needs<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.900> be<00:02:41.079> washed<00:02:41.290> because

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
when it got where I was just kind of let

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.629 
when it got where I was just kind of let
it<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.510> know<00:02:43.599> just<00:02:43.840> as<00:02:44.049> right<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.680> left<00:02:45.459> it

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639

it you know just as right and I left it
at<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.239> then<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.810> know<00:02:46.959> call<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.159> a<00:02:48.250> day
