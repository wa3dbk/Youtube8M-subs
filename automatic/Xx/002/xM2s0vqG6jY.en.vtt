00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
then you start right at like the end of

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.819 
then you start right at like the end of
this<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.799> first<00:02:30.130> chord<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.690> that's<00:02:31.989> how<00:02:32.769> you

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
this the first chord so that's how you

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.640 
this the first chord so that's how you
do<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.100> then<00:02:33.340> there's<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:35.079> course<00:02:35.350> and

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
this long is extremely simple right the
