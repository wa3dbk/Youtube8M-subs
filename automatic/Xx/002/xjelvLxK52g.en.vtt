00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.799

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.839
How to change when changing is difficult

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.630
Since some time ago I was saying that this book, in my opinion,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.829
was among the 5 books most important on the topic of the change, I’ve read

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.880
lots of others books in this period and what I was saying some time ago

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.699
is right even today.
It’s a very interesting book as

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.820
makes you realize that if you go through a series of changes, even little ones, of your  attitude

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.339
you can achieve a very big changes in your life.

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.540
this matter for manager, enterprise managing directors, but also

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.590
for people with zero budget

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.210
that want to change their habits  in daily life.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.030
This is a book written by two brothers that have the gift of storytelling that

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.070
I read, the 250 pages of the book, straightaway,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.700
since the last page. It’s not

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.600
easy focusing on just three things that struck me during the reading. The first one I have in mind is

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.540
that changing is

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.530
possible even in an easy way, as long as you have both a method

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.960
and some strategies to use within this method.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.840
In this video I just explain the technique for minimizing

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.080
the change, one of my most watched video here in the Youtube channel.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.560
the second thing I like is a metaphor really, of a jockey in the saddle of an elephant

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.979
using this metaphor, the authors

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.429
try to explain

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.299
the inner fight of everyone to achieve and keep

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.810
a change: we all have a jockey that is the most rational part

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.940
is the one that makes a plan, asks questions and ponders,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.620
then, another part inside us, is similar to an elephant,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.750
so, listless, lazy, but with an unbelievable strength:

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.070
when big objectives are achieved,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.770
in life is because, in some way, the jockey and the elephant have succeeded in

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.800
reaching an agreement. The jockey managed to use the power of the elephant to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.709
fulfilled the objective, established in advanced. The change happened,

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.900
according to these authors, when the jockey gives a clear instructions

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.099
to planning with simplicity the path to follow

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.680
and the elephant manages in some way,to be pulled in our side

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.099
and therefore to obey the jockey

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.389
Third point, for a book that is about change is

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:40.299
very rear paying attention to the maintenance of change.

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.209
Indeed, in a part of the book is asked: well, after this first

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.019
step and after having achieved this objective,

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.819
what happen?Actually, here there is food for thought and

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.149
very important exercises.

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:56.529
this is one of the reason why I suggest the reading of this book: I recommend this

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:04.849
surely to managers, managing directors

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.849
but I really suggest it  also to the ordinary man even if is

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.299
just curious

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.540
on the topic of the change and wants to put into practice some of

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.650
these exercises and cues to see if he managed to modify in some way

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.319
his life

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.169
That’s all I have to say, see you next time, enjoy the reading. Bye bye - Subtitles By Elisabetta Torchio
