00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.149
 head when I had Saturday morning 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.260

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.260
 so the family moment in my 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 head 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.610

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.880
 playing rug in the living room and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.080
 barbarella putting to change 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.420
 looking at the car talking these are the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.490
 guys my father is also a musician 26 years old 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.549
 the hardest 26 years he pursued his career 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.810
 then that image hits her it stays 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.119
 live in my mind we are 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.250
 playing in the living room and my father 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.650
 looking at the bar album she not only one more 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.060

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.219
 We 'll be up there. 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.200
 giving sequence in this story that there are 20 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.780
 years ago in the living room I saw my father 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.610
 talk that they are the guys then dalla 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.040
 gives a certain anguish 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.170
 does not mean duckling continue this 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.250
 mission that the father started with the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.500
 bassist of the challenges the year with 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.180
 minimum he was alone, he needed 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.010
 all together with me it's a very thing 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.160
 big this right 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.340
 since childhood whenever anyone being 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.250
 listening yellow and it's my life like that 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.900
 I can now play by saying 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.680
 on stage, right? 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.680
 Playing with them is speechless. 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.730
 the strong is so sensible plus quotas is a 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.850
 I am washed darkness 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:00.170
 it's not a story that is well 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:04.489
 interesting even from a very young age 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.120
 listening and asking my parents me 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:11.330
 which led barbarella tava tapping the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.720
 inside or in the center and stopped at 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:19.989
 front of the stage and it was a very 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:23.599
 very strong even from there always trying 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.569
 improve with lessons and everything else until a 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.630
 day the proposal happened and I got 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.209
 enter the band right 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.200
 Thank you so much God for having 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.709
 been good at playing and practicing power 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.709
