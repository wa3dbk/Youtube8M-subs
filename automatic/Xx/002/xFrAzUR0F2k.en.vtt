00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.710
 the goal offering the focus 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.330
 It's a goal that the 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.730
 cristiano script vulgar headline of games 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.050
 bringing a video about the game already has a 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.810
 steam time 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.660
 but he is always a successful salesman and 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.680
 audience success is mainly the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:34.120
 super meat boy game was designed by 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.040
 two index developers who live 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.160
 opposite sides united states but 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.750
 have managed to make one of the most 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.019
 of recent times 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.870
 especially for them and a letter of 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:50.080
 practically love the old games of 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.750
 platform of the era donnÃ©s for example 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.799
 you develop into super mario bros 2 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.620
 japanese version of megaman they play of 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.690
 platform that conquered hearts but 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.239
 They gave a lot of headache also for 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.490
 level of difficulty and a super 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.340
 meat boy is no different he is 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.890
 extremely difficult, mainly because 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.560
 games that I do not have the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.050
 reflection plus youth tournament difficult 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.260
 for me but I confess I can not 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.720
 get angry at the game even dying 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.060
 several times because the sense of humor 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.580
 His presentation is very well done. 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.790
 The game is full of quotes and tributes. 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.740
 other games that have marked the 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.760
 games for example the opening of the first 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.480
 map is the opening copy of the 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.760
 street fighter 2 to similar music 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.670
 Talking about music, the super meat song 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.160
 Boy, it's very cool, it 's made by bi. 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.980
 danny baranovs who is a composer 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.110
 India is well known and has been 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.980
 known making up the super track 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.220
 meat boy 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.960
 a tip actually saw guys when 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.110
 You start the game they always give. 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.600
 that tip of you to use the control and 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.360
 It really is a lot easier for you to play. 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.500
 This game does not wear that does not control the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.400
 I play it in xbox 360 control on 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.200
 pc because playing on the keyboard is possible 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.930
 but the level of difficulty increases 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.380
 exponentially is much more difficult 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.800
 play on the keyboard game play 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:32.510
 until too much you have to go from point to point 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.540
 point b without being killed by the level but is 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.490
 easy to talk difficult to do a little 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.260
 it's a little simpler 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.300
 you see that even after you die 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.480
 if you leave it again boy it goes 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.370
 letting that blood trail is so much 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.490
 that his girlfriend the girl bandeide 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.820
 you start at the punctuated level you have to 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.340
 escape the traps and anything 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.420
 that touched you you die do not have 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.540
 story 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.570
 You do not have it like that or anything. 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.700
 type may make it bigger but 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.490
 as you make the levels 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.470
 Are you going to pick up bandages? 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.690
 scattered by the levels that these 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.770
 bandages that allow new 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.390
 characters 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.550
 so there are not only boys and there are 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.600
 characters there that can be 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.760
 used but basically the game is valid 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.850
 point a to point b in the case of 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.640
 level will handle saves the band and I 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.220
 when you finish the entire phase in the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.510
 end you have the boss battle of 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.380
 each world 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.860
 But I already notice this battle is very difficult. 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.940
 difficult same style difficulty dark 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.950
 souls I say dark souls because despite 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.500
 to have nothing graphically to have 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.720
 style of play is different than that 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.560
 feeling of when you after the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.140
 twentieth time try to conquer phase and 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.570
 You finally get the super meat. 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:05.330
 boy also has this feeling present 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:08.330
 in the souls series every level you go 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.810
 completing in the game some have this 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:15.650
 zinho portal where just playing pro 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.410
 ar pisoni and you're got another kind of 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.490
 gameplay paying homage games 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.880
 old ones scattered around the game have more 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.270
 of 300 levels in the basic game and beyond 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.460
 it has the version of the PC is still 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.560
 possible to play the levels made by 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.370
 own players with levels of 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.889
 difficulty even more absurd 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.199
 and also has a possibility of you 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.990
 play random levels based on 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.050
 community-created levels 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.949
 ie the gameplay region o 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.800
 potential to revoke the game is too high 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:57.190
 these levels can be accessed in the 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.169
 super mit word which is a game mode there 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.290
 as I said it myself 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.290
 community of players is the most 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:09.729
 to display first voted 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:12.639
 you have the possibility still Rams 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.400
 mizael is to randomly level one 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.830
 most difficult all levels they 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.940
 receive a score there from others 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.860
 players 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.350
 so it's quite easy for you to find 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.169
 new challenges when you can 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.789

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.520
 the gameplay even by the 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.860
 his difficulty but how I said no 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.080
 I get angry at the game is not the 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.349
 game that even I having reflex of 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.720
 I do not give up easy games 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.039

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.500

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.729
