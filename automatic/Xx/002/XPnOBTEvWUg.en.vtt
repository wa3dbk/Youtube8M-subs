00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
this is your basically related assembly

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.040 
this is your basically related assembly
and<00:02:00.020> slide<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.380> two<00:02:01.590> batteries<00:02:01.830> out<00:02:02.160> and

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
and slide the two batteries out and

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.680 
and slide the two batteries out and
we'll<00:02:04.050> slide<00:02:04.320> two<00:02:04.620> new<00:02:04.950> ones<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.690> the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
we'll slide two new ones in the

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.530 
we'll slide two new ones in the
replacement<00:02:07.200> batteries<00:02:07.560> are<00:02:07.770> 303<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:08.700> 357

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
replacement batteries are 303 or 357

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.290 
replacement batteries are 303 or 357
it's<00:02:10.260> kind<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.470> ironic<00:02:10.760> 357<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.540> anyway<00:02:14.300> take

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
it's kind of ironic 357 but anyway take

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.580 
it's kind of ironic 357 but anyway take
them<00:02:15.450> out<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:18.450> course<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:19.140> don't<00:02:19.320> sell

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
them out and of course they don't sell

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.410 
them out and of course they don't sell
these<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.070> 2-pack<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.850> can<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.180> 2<00:02:21.270> by

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
these in the 2-pack so you can get 2 by

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.570 
these in the 2-pack so you can get 2 by
3<00:02:21.750> or<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.740> can<00:02:22.860> buy<00:02:22.950> them<00:02:23.010> one<00:02:23.190> at<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> time<00:02:23.400> I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
3 or you can buy them one at a time I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:36.670 
3 or you can buy them one at a time I
guess<00:02:27.260> let's<00:02:28.260> see<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:31.790> positive

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.170 

just<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:40.490> you<00:02:41.490> can<00:02:41.640> test<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.030> before

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
just like that you can test it before

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.290 
just like that you can test it before
you<00:02:42.390> put<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.160> gun<00:02:44.160> soon<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.150> can

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you put it in the gun soon as you can

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.900 
you put it in the gun soon as you can

don't but I have shot it at the gun
range<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.830> few<00:03:16.980> times<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.390> this<00:03:19.110> screw<00:03:19.440> will

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
range a few times and this screw will

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.860 
range a few times and this screw will
work<00:03:19.770> loose<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.430> they<00:03:21.270> don't<00:03:21.450> recommend

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.650 
work loose and they don't recommend
putting<00:03:21.990> Loctite<00:03:22.560> on<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.860> because<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.660> goes

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
putting Loctite on it because it goes

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.470 
putting Loctite on it because it goes
down<00:03:24.930> into<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.230> polymer<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:27.030> lock

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
down into the polymer and that lock

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.320 
down into the polymer and that lock
tight<00:03:28.430> something<00:03:29.430> about<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.820> chemical

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
tight something about the chemical

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.230 
tight something about the chemical
reaction<00:03:30.750> will<00:03:30.900> cause<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.440> plastic<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:32.240> melt

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
reaction will cause the plastic to melt

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.840 
reaction will cause the plastic to melt
or<00:03:33.510> degrade<00:03:34.080> or<00:03:34.320> whatever<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.800> just<00:03:34.830> take<00:03:35.700> your

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
or degrade or whatever so just take your

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.410 
or degrade or whatever so just take your
gun<00:03:35.970> apart<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:37.820> tighten<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:38.910> screw<00:03:39.090> every

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
back and then push the pin in all the

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.320 
back and then push the pin in all the
way<00:04:46.100> turn<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.250> counterclockwise<00:04:47.550> until<00:04:48.120> it

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
way turn it counterclockwise until it

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.490 
way turn it counterclockwise until it
seats<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:49.650> it's<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:49.950> all<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.160> way<00:04:50.250> up<00:04:50.490> there

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
seats and it's in all the way up there

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.490 
seats and it's in all the way up there
and<00:04:52.500> check<00:04:53.400> your<00:04:53.550> operation<00:04:54.380> make<00:04:55.380> sure

and check your operation make sure

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.740 
and check your operation make sure
nothing<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:55.890> binding<00:04:56.280> up<00:04:56.450> so<00:04:57.450> everything

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
nothing is binding up so everything

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.880 
nothing is binding up so everything
works<00:04:57.960> good<00:04:58.169> but<00:05:00.260> if<00:05:01.260> you<00:05:01.350> have<00:05:01.440> any<00:05:01.560> questions
