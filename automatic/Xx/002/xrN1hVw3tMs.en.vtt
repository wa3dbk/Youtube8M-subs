00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.140 

we<00:00:04.920> introduced<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.880> new<00:00:06.680> unit<00:00:07.680> for<00:00:07.920> length

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
we introduced a new unit for length

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.270 
we introduced a new unit for length
which<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.180> nature<00:00:09.809> when<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.350> talk<00:00:10.620> about<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
which is nature when we talk about the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.540 
which is nature when we talk about the
distance<00:00:11.760> between<00:00:12.170> the<00:00:13.170> stars<00:00:13.560> in<00:00:14.370> our

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
distance between the stars in our

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.609 
distance between the stars in our
neighborhood<00:00:15.300> in<00:00:15.510> the<00:00:15.870> neighborhood<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.380> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
neighborhood in the neighborhood of the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.190 
neighborhood in the neighborhood of the
Sun<00:00:17.060> we<00:00:18.060> introduced<00:00:18.990> one<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:20.669> light<00:00:20.910> year

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
Sun we introduced one as one light year

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.630 
Sun we introduced one as one light year
which<00:00:22.200> is<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> distance<00:00:22.770> that<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.430> light

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
which is the distance that the light

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.280 
which is the distance that the light
travels<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.450> one<00:00:24.900> year<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.960> we<00:00:27.960> converted

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
travels in one year and we converted

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.889 
travels in one year and we converted
that<00:00:28.829> into<00:00:28.910> kilometers<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.149> a<00:00:30.329> large<00:00:30.509> power

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:30.899 
that into kilometers it's a large power

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.010 
that into kilometers it's a large power
of<00:00:31.140> 10<00:00:31.410> 10<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.829> the<00:00:31.860> 13<00:00:32.369> kilometers<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.270> it's

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
of 10 10 to the 13 kilometers and it's

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080 
of 10 10 to the 13 kilometers and it's
even<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.410> large<00:00:34.739> multiple<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.610> astronomical

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
even a large multiple of astronomical

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.580 
even a large multiple of astronomical
units<00:00:37.519> 63,000<00:00:38.519> astronomical<00:00:39.210> units<00:00:39.539> so<00:00:40.289> in

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
units 63,000 astronomical units so in

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.400 
units 63,000 astronomical units so in
terms<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.160> light<00:00:41.430> years<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.600> express<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
terms of light years I can express the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.939 
terms of light years I can express the
same<00:00:43.710> distance<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:45.500> 17<00:00:46.500> light-years<00:00:47.309> across

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
same distance as 17 light-years across

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.639 
same distance as 17 light-years across
so<00:00:49.949> when<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.609> go<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.390> scale<00:00:52.050> by<00:00:52.320> another

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
so when we go up in scale by another

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.739 
so when we go up in scale by another
factor<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.519> hundred<00:00:54.030> will<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.199> 17<00:00:56.100> hundred

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
factor of hundred will have 17 hundred

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.869 
factor of hundred will have 17 hundred
light-years<00:00:57.749> across<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.339> you<00:00:59.670> keep

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
light-years across just so that you keep

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.430 
light-years across just so that you keep
that<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.300> mind<00:01:01.789> ok<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.239> stars<00:01:03.629> closest<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
that in mind ok so the stars closest to

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.190 
that in mind ok so the stars closest to
the<00:01:04.620> Sun<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:06.409> Alpha<00:01:07.409> Centauri<00:01:08.840> which<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.050> in

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the Sun is Alpha Centauri which is in

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.450 
the Sun is Alpha Centauri which is in
fact<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.830> triple<00:01:11.730> star<00:01:12.030> system<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:16.040> 4.3<00:01:17.040> light

light-years<00:01:43.860> away<00:01:44.490> from<00:01:44.760> us<00:01:45.260> okay<00:01:46.760> next<00:01:49.010> we<00:01:50.010> go

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
light-years away from us okay next we go

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.000 
light-years away from us okay next we go
in<00:01:50.670> scale<00:01:51.740> by<00:01:52.740> another<00:01:53.070> factor<00:01:53.160> of<00:01:53.610> hundred<00:01:55.010> so

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
in scale by another factor of hundred so

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.580 
in scale by another factor of hundred so
i<00:01:56.040> multiply<00:01:56.900> 17<00:01:59.300> by<00:02:00.300> a<00:02:00.330> hundred<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.080> we'll

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
i multiply 17 by a hundred and we'll

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.540 
i multiply 17 by a hundred and we'll
have<00:02:04.160> hundred<00:02:06.650> one<00:02:07.650> thousand<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.310> seven

have hundred one thousand and seven

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.070 
have hundred one thousand and seven
hundred<00:02:09.119> light-years<00:02:09.360> across<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.640> this

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
hundred light-years across and on this

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.080 
hundred light-years across and on this
scale<00:02:13.880> seventeen<00:02:14.880> hundred<00:02:15.360> light-years

scale seventeen hundred light-years

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.750 
scale seventeen hundred light-years
you<00:02:18.090> see<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.320> Stars<00:02:19.770> occur<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.790> clusters

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
you see that the Stars occur in clusters

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.010 
you see that the Stars occur in clusters
there<00:02:23.760> are<00:02:23.850> clusters<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.450> stars<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:26.640> one

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
there are clusters of stars is one

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.300 
there are clusters of stars is one
cluster<00:02:28.020> here<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:29.360> cluster<00:02:30.360> here<00:02:31.190> maybe<00:02:32.190> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
cluster here a cluster here maybe a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.670 
cluster here a cluster here maybe a
cluster<00:02:32.850> here<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.910> even<00:02:36.870> larger

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.520 
cluster here and so on so on even larger
scale<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.580> know<00:02:39.590> thousand<00:02:41.750> light<00:02:42.750> users<00:02:43.200> so

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
scale you know thousand light users so

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.530 
scale you know thousand light users so
you<00:02:44.340> start<00:02:44.700> seeing<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.530> stars

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
you start seeing that that the stars

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.780 
you start seeing that that the stars
occur<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.660> clusters<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.920> fact<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.430> turns

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
occur in clusters it in fact it turns

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.990 
occur in clusters it in fact it turns
out<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.450> they<00:02:52.110> are<00:02:52.170> born<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.830> clusters

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
out that they are born in clusters

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.820 
out that they are born in clusters
that's<00:02:54.000> why<00:02:54.300> they<00:02:54.540> occur<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.020> clusters<00:02:55.530> and

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
that's why they occur in clusters and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.120 
that's why they occur in clusters and
there<00:02:56.700> are<00:02:57.050> different<00:02:58.050> types<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.530> star

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
there are different types of star

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.370 
there are different types of star
clusters<00:02:59.310> those<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.330> who<00:03:00.570> have<00:03:00.840> signed<00:03:01.110> up
