oops<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.730> yet<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:11.850> just<00:03:11.880> did<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.920> now<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
oops and yet we just did that now the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.720 
oops and yet we just did that now the
thing<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.700> found<00:03:15.240> against<00:03:16.160> clear<00:03:17.160> which<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.550> not

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
thing I found against clear which is not

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.240 
thing I found against clear which is not
really<00:03:17.760> something<00:03:18.300> bad<00:03:19.110> might<00:03:19.800> just<00:03:20.070> make<00:03:20.190> it

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
really something bad might just make it

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.540 
really something bad might just make it
a<00:03:20.400> little<00:03:20.550> bit<00:03:20.730> more<00:03:21.060> simple<00:03:21.360> is<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.980> once

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
a little bit more simple is that once

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.080 
a little bit more simple is that once
you<00:03:23.670> run<00:03:23.850> out<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:24.930> space<00:03:25.700> you're<00:03:26.700> out<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.820> space

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
you run out of space you're out of space

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.320 
you run out of space you're out of space
so<00:03:27.300> if<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.840> can<00:03:28.200> put<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:29.090> small<00:03:30.090> amount

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
so if you can put it in a small amount

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.120 
so if you can put it in a small amount
of<00:03:30.390> characters<00:03:30.690> then<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.710> should<00:03:31.890> be<00:03:31.950> good<00:03:31.980> to

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
of characters then you should be good to

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.520 
of characters then you should be good to
go<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:32.490> if<00:03:32.640> it's<00:03:32.820> something<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.210> long<00:03:33.360> list<00:03:33.660> or

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
go but if it's something a long list or

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.960 
go but if it's something a long list or
not<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.950> long<00:03:35.130> list<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:35.550> what<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.790> whole

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
not a long list that's what the whole

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.270 
not a long list that's what the whole
app<00:03:36.210> is<00:03:36.390> about<00:03:36.660> but<00:03:37.590> if<00:03:37.740> it's<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.040> long

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
app is about but if it's a long

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.570 
app is about but if it's a long
description<00:03:38.960> you<00:03:39.960> can't<00:03:40.170> put<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.590> there
