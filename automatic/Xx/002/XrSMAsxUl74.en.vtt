00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 to live with that shirt beyond the maquinÃ© 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.690
 You are seeing on television in the capital beyond that 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.030
 Way the face does not come over the shirt 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.740
 10 saw if you want to return the link here 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.360
 underneath you can go there and buy 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.130
 official face shirt you 'll be 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 helping us is an example that has 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.660
 a sound table here in front and behind 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.880
 yes, I know all the buttons do 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.779
 For boring people, everything that goes through 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.820
 a month of sound 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.310
 question for parents know what is done in 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.029
 is ready no longer answer only 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.029
 show the back 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.890
 people, I wanted to talk to you today about 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.020
 the business that I've seen a lot of people 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.110
 doing here that bothered me a little 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.379
 a certain point is the question of mixing with 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.329
 Headset and I'm not talking to 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 Who 's working in the right studio? 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.039
 I'm really talking there and here. 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.010
 What happens if you are going to make a sound 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.980
 of an event has already seen several reasons 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.420
 that justify this you sometimes go 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.939
 an ugly bug will make a sound of a 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.710
 marriage I've seen many times at the table 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.020
 sound is behind ppa 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.479
 so really the guy is not listening pl 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.100
 bottom wine solo headphones is equalize 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.210
 does everything by the phone to be the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.290
 better he can because he is 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.380
 behind p 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.820
 This justifies you actually doing this. 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.500
 but also the guys sometimes get so 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.439
 addicted that I already got to pick up 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.420
 example people who have the table in the place 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.270
 perfect in front of the piano he 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.060
 listen to everything and I've seen for example the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.680
 man is here with the person singing and 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.570
 the guy picks up and puts a phone away 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.840
 pressing papando handset to not hear the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.270
 pop p was disturbing and the person is 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.740
 here really mixing and updating 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.750
 by earphone 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.220
 so I wanted to leave a thought 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.350
 in relation to this 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.649
 the sound of the earphone is 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.490
 different from the sound of that piece box 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.680
 everyone who will be in that 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.860
 The atmosphere is listening to the waitress. 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.140
 No one will hear on the phone so why? 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.790
 because the guy is a coalition based on sound 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.549
 I have difficulty understanding the phone. 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.869
 This is not an explanation to you. 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.700
 can not see the worst case of the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.370
 positioning of the table and everything is not 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.700
 ideal but beauty is using phone to 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.069
 read 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.660
 if you sometimes have three vocals 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.099
 singing you want to see a little is what 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.260
 okay with slightly different equalization 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.269
 It can give a beautiful beauty but you are 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.720
 here at the table and having a person alone 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.970
 singing alone at the soundcheck and 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.150
 You're equating the phone one canada 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.920
 rethink it because you're there is 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.599
 listening to people still the pear is 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.190
 with the same front is the coalition 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.380
 total come what is everyone seeing 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.810
 everybody saw the same thing so then 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.910
 You're equalizing the phone. 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.470
 say that that is equalize the mix appeal 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.750
 buried because of circumstances 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.459
 that sometimes cause we have to 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.500
 to work in this way as an example 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.450
 I gave the guy is behind the perea not 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.549
 is ideal but each one works with what 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.500
 Try it out, if it's just the way it is 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.140
 but if you have a circumstance that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.630
 allows you to work better in the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.849
 Do not make the expensive phone forget the phone. 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.410
 little is 40 each for your 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.390
 heard even to listen to what is 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.760
 leaving the mixer all right by the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.709
 bea use phone only as an aid so it is 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.110
 thing that is cracking is voice 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.569
 which is distorting the sewer headphones 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.609
 a sun and discovered this beauty here but 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.430
 at the time of the message goes by the foot 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.109
 I hope I was going to give some help and a 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.639
 some light on the subject and check out the video 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.850
 of the ball that fell on the channel of the week 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.850
 next
