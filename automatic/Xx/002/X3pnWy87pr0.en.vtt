the<00:02:19.189> same<00:02:19.489> time<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.569> we're<00:02:20.780> going<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.959> start

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
the same time so we're going to start

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.360 
the same time so we're going to start

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
against the cuticle so it gets a

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.000 
against the cuticle so it gets a
flatline<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.950> then<00:02:28.519> straight<00:02:29.030> down<00:02:30.010> and
