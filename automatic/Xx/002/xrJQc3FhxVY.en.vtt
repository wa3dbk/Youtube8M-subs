00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.040
 hi with you phil and this is the second edition 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.299
 my rubric briefing lately 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.590
 a video shoots not only at 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.270
 specialized cable 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.400
 but after all on SLR cameras a 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.130
 more precisely from evil to begin with what is 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.260
 10a stands for digital single 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.699
 lens protect with pesto implies 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.230
 the presence in the camera mirror descent 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.029
 shutter unlike ordinary household 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.000
 cameras where to cook a lot of subtleties 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.020
 the settings that I now tell 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.340
 explained that the dakami strings camera 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.649
 imply subsequent processing 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.590
 videos from hanging backup programs such 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.329
 as well, for example, or a map file, 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:50.100
 what for getting good quality 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:52.110
 video you need a good light to start 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.789
 turn on the camera and put it into mode 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.399
 video then spin the wheel 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.399
 modes in the position of m that is manually 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.230
 then go to the construction site and change 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.440
 color space on the ji adapter 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.270
 bi 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.400
 it is good that the color rendition goes 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.380
 very good and subsequent processing will be 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.720
 very easy and type 0 disabling spotlights 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.490
 Auto-Brightness and color operation since 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.810
 they will spoil the quality of the video after 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.610
 of this we go to the construction site from the style 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.080
 image choose custom 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.360
 metal need to change two parameters 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.900
 this sharpness and contrast we remove them 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.900
 you at least 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.770
 further you need to configure for this we go 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.960
 in the sound settings change it to mode 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.850
 manual and put the indicators that us 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.530
 need by area make sure that 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.599
 it was not too quiet so how will you 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.489
 align the sound in the video editor and all 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:28.330
 noises and extra sounds will be good 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:29.709
 revealed further proceed to the setting 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.350
 video for this we need to select it 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.150
 1080p and 720p size 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.950
 if you want the highest quality 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.510
 video then choose and full hd 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.549
 if quality is for you 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.430
 secondary factor and you need a very 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.110
 kadyrov big cat clean just and g 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.090
 Next, select the video speed, that is 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.640
 his girlfriend most of the cameras are filmed in 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.100
 24 25 or 50 frames per second 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.600
 24 frames per second is a cinema format and 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.160
 it allows you to make very high quality 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.320
 grease but it is a holiday lowering 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.090
 25 frame quality a second is more 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.340
 best format but if you want to shoot 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.690
 for example the panorama of good smearing you 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.820
 not get and the video will be just 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.530
 jerky 50 frames a second is used 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.329
 very rarely since it is redundant 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.459
 frame count and it is used 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.540
 only for shooting fast moving 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.959
 objects also settings i advise 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.910
 turn on 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.680
 auto off so if you shoot in 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.900
 ok with room anton or even on 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.890
 the street is facing feathers at the matrix and 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.890
 excessive noise 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.360
 and that's when all the preparations are done 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.129
 it's time to get down to the main 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.870
 video settings ie its exposure 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.370
 open the aperture fully to begin with 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.480
 that is, stop the most minimal 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.090
 aperture number 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.989
 I have it for example 3.5 further need 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.519
 adjust shutter speed 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.079
 perfect exposure is units 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.879
 double the number of frames 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.950
 that is, if you shoot 25 frames in 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.230
 a second then the shutter speed should be one 50 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.209
 if 50 frames a second, then one hundredth 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.099
 after that, you must perform the setup and 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.569
 100 with this sensitivity she 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.400
 performed by eye as it is not 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.620
 ideal parameters of this value but 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.390
 I do not follow to raise and juice more than 800 so 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.040
 how can it happen next you need to choose 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.200
 white balance setting and here there is 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.639
 three options for selecting this value 1 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.139
 this is auto white balance 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.730
 but if for the street it can still fit 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.709
 then the supplement doesnâ€™t fit 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.019
 the second is the choice of patterns which 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.730
 are available in Komi and 3 is completely manual 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.109
 matching this value and here if 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.109
 use the white sheet method 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.990
 that's when this camera is done 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.610
 need level on focusing and here 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.260
 choose only hardcore manual only 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.610
 mode and after shooting video should 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.990
 color correction is desirable 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.270
 professional video editors 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.770
 and that's all I wanted to talk about 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.960
 setting up the action camera for 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.700
 video filming and subscribe to the channel 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.980
 put likes and dislikes like you 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.690
 liked the video comedy de it can 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.690
 expand on social networks for now 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.819
