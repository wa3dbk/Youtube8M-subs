00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.170
 Tell us guys starting our first 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.529
 game play here to syndicate driving sim 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.750
 now you have 27 as you can see and 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.220
 nothing better than to see someone doing the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.350
 car die right 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.289
 nothing better than seeing the careers 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.029
 there and I will do some with even because 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.730
 basically I'll make my friends 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.800
 play citycar drive and you will have 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.550
 Shit happens for more than they 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 drivers who are or have been 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.770
 they are taking habilitation also the people 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.100
 will see a lot of shit around here still right 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.270
 I left with my vehicle here. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.640
 likes to see what he has 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.770
 a sound of trucks abief every hour 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.770
 or driving and liking 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.940
 I put a lot of traffic here before 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.060
 to start mp had already hit the car 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.280
 a little bit but it was just a little bit alone 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.550
 normal thing, do not beat the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.930
 car strip does not hit the car is not only 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.409
 broke in and in the harbor 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.700
 Anyway, I'll make the fourth platter 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.970
 Then the horn and we'll see, right? 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.660
 start driving a normal car and 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.910
 I'll do it later and get busão porto. 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.910
 no belt was wrong sorry there 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.010
 was without a human belt and the wing 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.180
 then the person picks up a busion and 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.850
 last she gets a little truck and let's go 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.159
 see how she will do to change the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.500
 gearbox is because it truck 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.930
 You have to change the box so it will be 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.340
 that would bust 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.590
 initially put the name on the board 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.660
 when my friends play and noticed 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.500
 that two only got a little too big 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.989
 huh 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.840
 so I preferred to put a damn right not 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.510
 to use the blinking ascetic in game 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.069
 Shit, man. I'm going to make sure. 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.700
 Oh well then do you accept it? 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.700
 Piranha 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.569
 Then I'll put Patricia to drive. 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.489
 also because she will do the series the 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.069
 american stroke when it left america 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:43.230
 tour 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:45.450
 We are already preparing the format for 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.670
 This is when the game leaves, we'll go 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.810
 to be recording an American tour that 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.879
 I play the game or leave the people 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.769
 already thinking about doing a series of 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.470
 woman passes peace that is red to 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.410
 me now that time of truth is that 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.380
 that little sting marotta can not let 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.400
 the car dies on the rise marotta only 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.000
 wait for the guys out here 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.000
 died in 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.080
 the car is weak and also a taste of it 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.030
 because there's a little truck 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.750
 I think it's cool but that's it 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.430
 very weak 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.250
 hence you are in the mold of 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.080
 syndicate drive posted in comments for 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.960
 Me, I 'm going to play with the sauces. 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.180
 and will still make your name in the video instead 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.900
 It's an honor it's 20 kilometers above 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.430
 normal speed by who walks normal 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.470
 nowadays we all crazy a 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.070
 São Paulo's boring driver we are 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.070
 really crazy 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.590
 and it is if you have a map also on a journey 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.080
 In this game we buy things without 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.190
 to know how it works we do not read 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.250
 manual 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.580
 we do not do anything right, 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.580
 People just buy these days, like this. 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.140
 The signal from here is delayed too. 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:28.980
 like the bus game there that I do not 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:33.600
 I know how to speak the name mama the advance oms as 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:37.160
 if not at last understood 6 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.160

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:57.599

00:04:50.979 --> 00:05:01.000

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.250
 Let's look for parking here to 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:09.940

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.960

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.550

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.550

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:31.729

 take point so I did not do the missions 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:46.250
 No more in the auto school until the crowd goes 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.199
 to do the missions, I'm going to be recording 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.099
 It will be very funny, right? 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:55.009
 Funny to see people get hurt 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:56.990
 the temptation to park there is yours 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.979

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.669

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.550

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.520
 It's for you, it gives a little use too. 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.440
 It's good and a little bit of life, is not it, Felipe? 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.780
