when we ride with the hackmore the reins
come<00:00:58.270> out<00:00:58.450> at<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:59.020> bottom<00:00:59.320> of<00:00:59.410> our<00:00:59.500> hand<00:00:59.770> just

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
come out at the bottom of our hand just

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.810 
come out at the bottom of our hand just
like<00:01:01.150> we<00:01:01.360> ride<00:01:01.600> with<00:01:01.720> a<00:01:01.810> snaffle<00:01:02.110> bit<00:01:02.380> and<00:01:02.820> I

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
like we ride with a snaffle bit and I

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.660 
like we ride with a snaffle bit and I
like<00:01:03.910> my<00:01:04.299> reins<00:01:04.540> adjusted<00:01:05.199> fairly<00:01:06.189> long<00:01:06.430> in

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
like my reins adjusted fairly long in

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.830 
like my reins adjusted fairly long in
the<00:01:06.759> hackamore<00:01:07.210> so<00:01:07.689> that<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:07.899> can<00:01:08.200> take<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.439> loop

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the hackamore so that I can take a loop

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.710 
the hackamore so that I can take a loop
see<00:01:10.840> how<00:01:10.930> it<00:01:11.050> got<00:01:11.140> that<00:01:11.350> loop<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.710> my<00:01:11.830> hand<00:01:12.070> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
see how it got that loop in my hand and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.170 
see how it got that loop in my hand and
shorten<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.810> reins<00:01:14.020> up<00:01:14.320> or<00:01:15.190> if<00:01:15.400> I<00:01:15.490> need<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:16.030> go

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
shorten the reins up or if I need to go

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.390 
shorten the reins up or if I need to go
real<00:01:16.420> wide<00:01:16.659> I<00:01:16.690> can<00:01:16.990> drop<00:01:17.229> that<00:01:17.260> loop<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:17.979> go

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
real wide I can drop that loop and go

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.940 
real wide I can drop that loop and go
real<00:01:18.820> wide<00:01:19.120> if<00:01:19.390> I<00:01:19.510> need<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.960> if<00:01:20.620> I<00:01:20.710> want<00:01:20.890> my

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
real wide if I need to if I want my

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.030 
real wide if I need to if I want my
hands<00:01:21.159> in<00:01:21.340> close<00:01:21.580> make<00:01:22.390> that<00:01:22.600> loop<00:01:22.810> okay

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.870 

alright<00:01:27.040> so<00:01:28.350> before<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.380> ride<00:01:29.740> off<00:01:29.979> I<00:01:30.280> want<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:30.610> I

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
alright so before I ride off I want to I

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.950 
alright so before I ride off I want to I
want<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.320> discuss<00:01:32.320> some<00:01:32.650> of<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.799> principles

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
want to discuss some of the principles

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.289 
want to discuss some of the principles
we<00:01:34.960> never<00:01:35.170> use<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.890> steady<00:01:36.400> pull<00:01:36.820> with<00:01:37.210> the

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
we never use a steady pull with the

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.530 
we never use a steady pull with the
hackamore<00:01:38.340> everything<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:39.460> done<00:01:39.670> with<00:01:39.700> with<00:01:40.299> a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
hackamore everything is done with with a

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.140 
hackamore everything is done with with a
pull<00:01:40.840> release<00:01:41.170> pull<00:01:41.530> release<00:01:41.830> or<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.159> bump<00:01:42.970> and

listening<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.229> hackamore<00:01:50.710> isn't<00:01:51.070> paying

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
listening to the hackamore isn't paying

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.640 
listening to the hackamore isn't paying
attention<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.850> us<00:01:51.880> we<00:01:52.689> will<00:01:52.960> double<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.500> what's

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
attention to us we will double it what's

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.710 
attention to us we will double it what's
called<00:01:53.710> doubling<00:01:54.310> which<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.880> we<00:01:55.180> reach<00:01:55.390> down

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
called doubling which is we reach down

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.289 
called doubling which is we reach down
and<00:01:55.930> pull<00:01:56.409> his<00:01:56.680> head<00:01:56.890> around<00:01:57.189> with<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.729> big<00:01:57.970> pull

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
and pull his head around with a big pull

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.899 
and pull his head around with a big pull
and<00:01:58.479> release<00:01:58.630> or<00:01:59.320> maybe<00:01:59.530> several<00:01:59.979> pulls<00:02:00.580> and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
and release or maybe several pulls and

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.899 
and release or maybe several pulls and
releases<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:02.500> take<00:02:02.710> his<00:02:02.920> head<00:02:03.100> away<00:02:03.220> okay

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
releases to take his head away okay

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.020 
releases to take his head away okay
that's<00:02:04.150> our<00:02:04.330> main<00:02:04.600> control<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:06.280> also<00:02:06.460> want<00:02:06.909> to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
that's our main control we also want to

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.600 
that's our main control we also want to
establish<00:02:07.240> good<00:02:07.900> vertical<00:02:08.560> head<00:02:09.039> position

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
establish good vertical head position

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.429 
establish good vertical head position
with<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.750> hackamore<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.959> we'll<00:02:13.959> do<00:02:14.230> is

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
with the hackamore and so we'll do is

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.120 
with the hackamore and so we'll do is
called<00:02:16.499> tucking<00:02:17.499> or

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
called tucking or

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.910 
called tucking or
thing<00:02:19.680> will<00:02:20.680> taken<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.510> bump-bump-bump<00:02:22.920> left

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
thing will taken and bump-bump-bump left

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.050 
thing will taken and bump-bump-bump left
right<00:02:24.310> left<00:02:24.340> right<00:02:24.850> there<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:25.960> go<00:02:26.880> she<00:02:27.880> doesn't

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
right left right there we go she doesn't

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.820 
right left right there we go she doesn't
know<00:02:28.300> how<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.510> respond<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:29.410> hackamore

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
know how to respond to this hackamore

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.050 
know how to respond to this hackamore
this<00:02:30.160> is<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.310> first<00:02:30.550> time<00:02:30.700> she's<00:02:30.910> ever<00:02:30.940> been

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
this is the first time she's ever been

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.760 
this is the first time she's ever been
ridden<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:31.540> one<00:02:31.570> so<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:32.290> going<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.470> take<00:02:32.650> her

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
ridden in one so it's going to take her

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.830
