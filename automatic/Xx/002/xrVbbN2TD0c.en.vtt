00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.160
 I do not think I'm going to play central 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.010
 something like that 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.140
 came to shore with every sign of 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.140
 teatrero 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.760
 the images will give you away for sure 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.500
 in the 60th minute of the game the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.579
 protagonism wants it diego costa 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.579
 ripe with falcao 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:57.190
 and this is when it's good, we're going to 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.940
 look for the provocation of each 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.620
 It is very cheeky of Diego Costal 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.810
 because coast had a yellow first 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.590
 in the play of falcao with mature to see 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.590
 what the referee says 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.350
 how this one has gone to provoke ends up 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.450
 simulate effectively I was referring to 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.549
 a card 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.950
 for trying to cheat the referee is 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:30.810
 it would deserve a repeat card 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.060
 then intimidate the machine 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.860
 the big set that follows is amazing 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.270
 to see what JosÃ© Luis Gonzalez decides 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.270
 gonzalez of the party retro 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.260
 at the moment nothing 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.470
 luckily it has had diego coast that no 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.470
 I got another card 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.030
 we were commenting that coast has seen 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.220
 a yellow one before answering that 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.570
 therefore will not be able to play against 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.950
 madrid the derby of the next day 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.670
 another footballer who is ready 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.670
 choose
