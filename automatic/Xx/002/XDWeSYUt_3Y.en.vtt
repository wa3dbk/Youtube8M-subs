00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.380
 Seventh edition of my proudly in minecraft 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.750
 Well today's edition will be about 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.550
 new industrial zone where i will be they are plants 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.529
 and new residential building 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 well let's see the beginning of the new 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.170
 residential building is to find such from 5 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.480
 etazhka here I was generally surprised that I have 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.300
 so the five-story building was not where it is 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.260
 so we have four windows between 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.750
 front doors there is such a standard 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.550
 five-story building yes of course under the ofigel 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.559
 when you know me there was such a five-story building 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 I repeat, we know that in principle 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.390
 she is a lake here pretty 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.670
 good views of the lake to the lake in the courtyard 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.309
 You be cool there was only forest 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.469
 and now the construction of houses is well 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.149
 let's see also this layouts 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.300
 building 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.219
 here we go inside here we have 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.659
 so to say two apartments are as big 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.880
 ladder well here we have a bathroom 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.619
 passes before we have a toilet here 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.979
 passes even at the summit of someone that is 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.360
 over the locker here on the mix and the bed and the view 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.030
 on the glade and booklets infusion here here 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.820
 we pass tastes metsa carry tables where 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.509
 can eat fridge and stove 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.729
 Well, you can see the kind of joke Well come in as 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.950
 always go up to the 5th floor 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.719
 top floor and tradition already 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.329
 so here is our fifth floor 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:41.270
 there is such a large window and access to the 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.149
 the roof of the roof so turned out 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.479
 such a standard flat roof well here 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.920
 let me tell you the next update 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.860
 him from the press we are at the end 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.990
 cities near the radio tower and here in 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.600
 Basically then I start talking with skype 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.509
 there will be only one plant here 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.039
 screens are all so well, that's basically 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.460
 today built so small 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.710
 factory 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.080
 carry light bulbs that is with us 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.110
 makes little bulbs here 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.880
 Standard bulbs such tidy 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.610
 Well, in principle, that's the way 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.950
 Our factory looks like this is one of 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.280
 the first plants that do not think about 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.319
 head more accurately got an idea look here 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.959
 that's the way it looks and let's 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.269
 let's go well, so here we have an entrance for the car 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.540
 that is, let's say the car will go in this 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.819
 drive in there opens baggage on sections 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.250
 say and immerses there bulb boxes 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.980
 well here is the entrance 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.500
 by this my zabu every day here on 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.680
 that magic is able to pause well and here we are 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.640
 as you understand so to speak 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.880
 registration and those who are from here we can 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.989
 apply for a job application and so on 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.170
 Well, let's say we come here 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.269
 change clothes and go on well and here 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.489
 basically make our light bulbs and 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.220
 a slice set are here to look for 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.019
 pots but this is the type of light bulb and here we have 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.180
 such here even so machines where we 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.780
 make such big bulbs 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.000
 bets 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.769
 Well, let 's say they will go there and 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.470
 let's go somewhere up go to 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.700
 a light bulb not knowing where it is 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.519
 we are such chests where we already have 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.319
 Ready light bulbs are stored and now let's say 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.290
 when all is done 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.090
 we take these sweetheart let's say a truck 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.349
 drove dive and the truck leaves 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.510
 us different stores 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.519
 Well, in principle, such a plant got us 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.340
 Now I will tell you my plans for 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.260
