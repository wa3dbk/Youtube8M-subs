think it's kind of corny how they named
it<00:01:57.000> skyrise<00:01:57.540> instead<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.020> high-rise<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.619> really

it skyrise instead of high-rise I really

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.319 
it skyrise instead of high-rise I really
didn't<00:01:59.070> understand<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.579> one<00:01:59.759> they<00:02:00.149> should
