tracks and 31 minutes or so that's a
really<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.090> quick<00:02:06.270> album<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:07.110> something

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
really really quick album it's something

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.260 
really really quick album it's something
where<00:02:07.619> they<00:02:08.129> really<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.640> impress<00:02:08.940> very

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270

where they really have to impress very
quickly<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.289> not<00:02:10.500> something<00:02:10.920> where

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
quickly and it's not something where

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.150 
quickly and it's not something where
they<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.400> really<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.760> that

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
they can really have that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.550

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
little bit of material there that may

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.520 
little bit of material there that may
sound<00:02:19.240> as<00:02:19.480> though<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.020> little<00:02:20.110> bit<00:02:20.230> samey
