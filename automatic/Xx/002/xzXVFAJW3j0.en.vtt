00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
just sounds like it's a terrible

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.049 
just sounds like it's a terrible
combination<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.370> anyway<00:00:59.670> let's<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.000> started

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
combination but anyway let's get started

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.580 
combination but anyway let's get started
showing<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.570> how<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> container<00:01:01.350> that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
showing you how to make a container that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.429 
showing you how to make a container that
won't<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.219> holding<00:01:02.399> any<00:01:02.699> food<00:01:02.969> we've<00:01:03.449> got<00:01:03.690> an

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
won't be holding any food we've got an

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.800 
won't be holding any food we've got an
octagon<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.729> essentially<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> stop<00:01:06.540> sign

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
octagon here so essentially a stop sign

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.310 
octagon here so essentially a stop sign
and<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:08.220> am<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.880> poster<00:01:09.689> paper<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
and I am on poster paper so it's a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.170 
and I am on poster paper so it's a
little<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.650> thicker<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.880> may<00:01:12.000> or<00:01:12.090> may

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
little bit thicker and you may or may

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
little bit thicker and you may or may
not<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.420> able<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:12.900> grid<00:01:13.260> marks<00:01:13.560> but

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
not be able to see these grid marks but

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890 
not be able to see these grid marks but
I<00:01:13.950> got<00:01:14.189> gridded<00:01:14.490> poster<00:01:14.850> paper<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.750> my

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
I got gridded poster paper at in my

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.060 
I got gridded poster paper at in my
local<00:01:16.170> art<00:01:16.320> store<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:19.290> center<00:01:19.710> here

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
local art store so the center here

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.520 
local art store so the center here
you'll<00:01:21.060> notice<00:01:21.270> these<00:01:21.570> actually<00:01:22.049> come<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you'll notice these actually come in a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
you'll notice these actually come in a
little<00:01:22.680> bit<00:01:22.830> each<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> each<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> sides

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
little bit each of the each of the sides

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.260 
little bit each of the each of the sides
actually<00:01:24.840> come<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.229> not<00:01:25.409> an<00:01:25.590> exact

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
actually come in it's not an exact

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
actually come in it's not an exact
straight<00:01:27.270> line<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.200> that's<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
straight line and that's one of the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.760 
straight line and that's one of the
things<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.430> gives<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.600> its<00:01:30.869> its<00:01:31.259> shape<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
things that gives this its its shape so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.350 
things that gives this its its shape so
we're<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> start<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.670> by<00:01:32.970> cutting<00:01:33.150> out

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
we're going to start just by cutting out

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.490 
we're going to start just by cutting out
the<00:01:33.390> outside<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> you'll<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the outside and you'll see I have a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.190 
the outside and you'll see I have a
bunch<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.860> lines<00:01:35.100> here<00:01:35.299> but<00:01:36.299> we're<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:36.960> gonna

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
bunch of lines here but we're just gonna

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:47.600 
bunch of lines here but we're just gonna
cut<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> outside<00:01:38.040> lines<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.880> begin<00:01:39.119> with

way that we're gonna do this is we're
gonna<00:01:52.290> build<00:01:53.290> this<00:01:53.470> entire<00:01:53.770> thing<00:01:54.040> by<00:01:54.190> scoring

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
gonna build this entire thing by scoring

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.990 
gonna build this entire thing by scoring
it<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.300> I'm<00:01:56.050> gonna<00:01:56.260> use<00:01:56.500> my<00:01:56.530> cutting<00:01:57.250> tool<00:01:57.610> is<00:01:57.640> a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
it so I'm gonna use my cutting tool is a

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.430 
it so I'm gonna use my cutting tool is a
straight<00:01:58.390> edge<00:01:58.510> real<00:01:58.810> quick<00:01:58.990> cuz<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.200> want<00:01:59.350> to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
straight edge real quick cuz I want to

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.900 
straight edge real quick cuz I want to
score<00:01:59.619> these<00:01:59.830> relatively<00:02:00.340> straight

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
score these relatively straight

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.609 
score these relatively straight
now<00:02:01.119> remember<00:02:01.479> scoring<00:02:01.990> means<00:02:02.229> you're<00:02:02.470> not

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
now remember scoring means you're not

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.900 
now remember scoring means you're not
gonna<00:02:02.830> cut<00:02:03.040> all<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.340> way<00:02:03.430> through<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.729> paper

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
gonna cut all the way through the paper

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.510 
gonna cut all the way through the paper
so<00:02:04.150> we're<00:02:04.240> just<00:02:04.270> gonna<00:02:04.509> drag<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.740> knife<00:02:06.130> along

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
so we're just gonna drag the knife along

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.279 
so we're just gonna drag the knife along
the<00:02:07.030> edge<00:02:07.150> there<00:02:07.479> without<00:02:07.659> cutting<00:02:08.020> all<00:02:08.200> the

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
the edge there without cutting all the

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.199 
the edge there without cutting all the
way<00:02:08.320> through<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:09.100> I'm<00:02:09.670> gonna<00:02:09.820> do<00:02:09.940> all<00:02:09.970> these

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
way through and I'm gonna do all these

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.190 
way through and I'm gonna do all these
flaps<00:02:10.509> on<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.720> end<00:02:10.929> first<00:02:12.810> scoring<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.989> is

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
flaps on the end first scoring this is

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.780 
flaps on the end first scoring this is
just<00:02:14.380> gonna<00:02:14.560> make<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.950> lot<00:02:15.160> easier<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.580> fold

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
just gonna make it a lot easier to fold

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.160 
just gonna make it a lot easier to fold
because<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.330> thicker<00:02:16.569> poster<00:02:16.989> paper

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
because it is a thicker poster paper

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.740 
because it is a thicker poster paper

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.940 
until we go from the center here and you
can<00:03:58.640> see<00:03:58.849> just<00:03:59.060> by<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.299> shadow<00:03:59.599> there<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.530> we

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
can see just by the shadow there that we

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.619 
can see just by the shadow there that we
know<00:04:01.159> right<00:04:01.400> where<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.670> center<00:04:01.909> is<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.420> I'm

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
know right where the center is so I'm

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.979 
know right where the center is so I'm
going<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:02.989> score<00:04:03.709> this<00:04:04.099> from<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.120> outside<00:04:05.540> and

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
going to score this from the outside and

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.930 
going to score this from the outside and
I'm<00:04:06.349> going<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.560> score<00:04:06.799> it<00:04:06.980> right<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.849> the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
I'm going to score it right to the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.039 
I'm going to score it right to the
center<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:09.650> midline<00:04:10.489> itself<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.930> I'll

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
center of the midline itself so I'll

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.589 
center of the midline itself so I'll
pick<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.379> up<00:04:13.000> score<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.180> to<00:04:14.299> the<00:04:14.390> center

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
pick that up score that to the center

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.640 
pick that up score that to the center
line<00:04:16.359> again<00:04:17.359> you<00:04:17.389> should<00:04:17.989> definitely<00:04:18.500> be

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
line again you should definitely be

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.029 
line again you should definitely be
using<00:04:18.979> a<00:04:19.040> ruler<00:04:19.370> for<00:04:19.579> all<00:04:19.669> this<00:04:19.850> but<00:04:20.180> for<00:04:21.039> just

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
using a ruler for all this but for just

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.900 
using a ruler for all this but for just
in<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.669> consideration<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.810> time<00:04:24.880> make<00:04:25.880> sure

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
in the consideration of time make sure

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.460 
in the consideration of time make sure
that<00:04:26.680> each<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.740> these<00:04:28.039> goes<00:04:28.310> in<00:04:29.889> there<00:04:30.889> you<00:04:30.979> go

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
that each of these goes in there you go

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:45.000 
that each of these goes in there you go
there<00:04:33.470> we<00:04:33.620> go<00:04:36.310> now

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.060 

in<00:04:45.490> this<00:04:45.700> particular<00:04:46.270> version<00:04:46.800> it's<00:04:47.800> gonna<00:04:47.920> be

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
in this particular version it's gonna be

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.260 
in this particular version it's gonna be
a<00:04:48.100> little<00:04:48.340> different<00:04:48.760> than<00:04:48.850> your<00:04:48.970> Chinese

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
a little different than your Chinese

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.730 
a little different than your Chinese
food<00:04:49.480> container<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.080> reason<00:04:50.380> is<00:04:50.530> because

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
food container and the reason is because

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.850 
food container and the reason is because
I'm<00:04:51.010> gonna<00:04:51.160> push<00:04:51.370> everything<00:04:51.670> to<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.000> inside

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
I'm gonna push everything to the inside

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.140 
I'm gonna push everything to the inside
now<00:04:53.860> on<00:04:53.980> a<00:04:54.070> Chinese<00:04:54.250> food<00:04:54.550> container<00:04:54.880> you'll

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
now on a Chinese food container you'll

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.370 
now on a Chinese food container you'll
notice<00:04:55.420> everything's<00:04:55.750> on<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:55.900> outside<00:04:56.230> in

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
notice everything's on the outside in

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.300 
notice everything's on the outside in
which<00:04:56.500> case<00:04:56.680> you<00:04:56.830> would<00:04:56.950> have<00:04:57.040> scored

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
which case you would have scored

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.980 
which case you would have scored
everything<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:57.880> same<00:04:58.150> exact<00:04:58.570> way<00:04:58.750> that<00:04:58.780> we

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
everything the same exact way that we

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.140 
everything the same exact way that we
scored<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.350> original<00:04:59.830> one<00:05:00.360> but<00:05:02.880> because<00:05:03.880> this

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
scored the original one but because this

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.300 
scored the original one but because this
is<00:05:04.210> not<00:05:04.900> going<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.320> be<00:05:05.470> putting<00:05:05.740> Chinese<00:05:06.130> food

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
is not going to be putting Chinese food

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.010 
is not going to be putting Chinese food
in<00:05:06.430> here<00:05:06.550> like<00:05:06.730> I<00:05:06.790> told<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.180> I'm<00:05:07.780> just<00:05:07.840> gonna

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
in here like I told you I'm just gonna

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.120 
in here like I told you I'm just gonna
close<00:05:08.290> all<00:05:08.530> this<00:05:08.680> up<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.100> that<00:05:09.430> we<00:05:09.520> have<00:05:09.670> a<00:05:09.700> nice

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
close all this up so that we have a nice

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.220 
close all this up so that we have a nice
base<00:05:12.130> on<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.490> outside<00:05:12.910> you<00:05:13.690> can<00:05:13.840> see<00:05:13.870> that

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
base on the outside you can see that

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.780 
base on the outside you can see that
there's<00:05:14.470> there<00:05:14.950> are<00:05:14.980> no<00:05:15.220> flaps<00:05:15.550> on<00:05:15.730> the

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
there's there are no flaps on the

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.090 
there's there are no flaps on the
outside<00:05:16.180> and<00:05:16.990> now<00:05:17.170> we<00:05:17.230> fold<00:05:17.530> in<00:05:17.740> these<00:05:17.860> two

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
outside and now we fold in these two

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.310 
outside and now we fold in these two
flaps<00:05:18.570> and<00:05:19.570> we<00:05:20.080> attach<00:05:20.380> our<00:05:20.590> top<00:05:20.800> flaps<00:05:22.320> anyway

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
flaps and we attach our top flaps anyway

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.180 
flaps and we attach our top flaps anyway
and<00:05:23.590> there<00:05:23.800> you<00:05:23.890> go

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
and there you go

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.830 
and there you go
there<00:05:24.760> is<00:05:24.880> your<00:05:25.060> container<00:05:25.420> and<00:05:25.600> as<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:25.750> can

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
there is your container and as you can

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.080 
there is your container and as you can
see<00:05:25.900> our<00:05:26.350> outside<00:05:26.860> we<00:05:27.520> don't<00:05:27.670> have<00:05:27.790> any<00:05:27.970> of<00:05:28.030> the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
see our outside we don't have any of the

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.370 
see our outside we don't have any of the
flaps<00:05:28.330> on<00:05:28.480> the<00:05:28.540> outside<00:05:28.870> like<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.110> normal

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
flaps on the outside like a normal

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.020 
flaps on the outside like a normal
Chinese<00:05:29.680> food<00:05:29.860> container<00:05:30.160> would<00:05:30.370> be<00:05:30.490> if<00:05:30.880> you

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
Chinese food container would be if you

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.430 
Chinese food container would be if you
want<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.240> flaps<00:05:31.450> on<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.630> outside<00:05:31.960> just<00:05:32.170> score

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
want the flaps on the outside just score

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.870 
want the flaps on the outside just score
them<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.650> other<00:05:32.770> way<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.160> they'll<00:05:33.580> be<00:05:33.700> on<00:05:33.790> the

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
them the other way and they'll be on the

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.510 
them the other way and they'll be on the
outside<00:05:34.170> so<00:05:35.170> there<00:05:35.290> you<00:05:35.380> have<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.530> that's<00:05:35.770> step

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
outside so there you have it that's step

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.030 
outside so there you have it that's step
one<00:05:36.760> that's<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.510> basic<00:05:38.260> basic<00:05:38.710> container

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
one that's the the basic basic container

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.860 
one that's the the basic basic container
if<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:39.700> want<00:05:39.910> a<00:05:39.970> container<00:05:40.330> that<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:40.720> can

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
if you want a container that you can

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.540 
if you want a container that you can
hold<00:05:41.110> things<00:05:41.320> in<00:05:41.560> and<00:05:41.800> store<00:05:42.010> things<00:05:42.280> for<00:05:42.520> a

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
hold things in and store things for a

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.310 
hold things in and store things for a
long<00:05:42.700> period<00:05:43.090> of<00:05:43.120> time<00:05:43.330> that<00:05:43.960> aren't

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
long period of time that aren't

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.690 
long period of time that aren't
necessarily<00:05:44.800> going<00:05:44.950> to<00:05:45.040> be<00:05:45.100> originated<00:05:45.550> like

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
necessarily going to be originated like

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.550 
necessarily going to be originated like
pencils<00:05:46.180> or<00:05:46.420> erasers<00:05:47.020> or<00:05:47.200> something<00:05:47.440> like

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
pencils or erasers or something like

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.130 
pencils or erasers or something like
that<00:05:47.620> or<00:05:48.010> books<00:05:48.430> then<00:05:49.330> probably<00:05:49.810> use

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
that or books then probably use

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.450 
that or books then probably use
something<00:05:50.530> a<00:05:50.590> little<00:05:50.830> stiffer<00:05:51.160> a<00:05:51.190> little

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
something a little stiffer a little

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.460 
something a little stiffer a little
stronger<00:05:51.730> than<00:05:51.960> construction<00:05:52.960> paper<00:05:53.140> but<00:05:53.410> the

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
stronger than construction paper but the

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.780 
stronger than construction paper but the
technique<00:05:53.830> is<00:05:53.950> gonna<00:05:54.130> be<00:05:54.250> basically<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.760> same

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
technique is gonna be basically the same

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.390 
technique is gonna be basically the same
