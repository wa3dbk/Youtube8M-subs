all<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.989> styrofoam<00:02:57.500> pieces<00:02:57.739> off<00:02:58.070> there's

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
all the styrofoam pieces off there's

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.300 
all the styrofoam pieces off there's
still<00:02:58.610> some<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.090> there<00:02:59.739> which<00:03:00.739> like<00:03:00.980> this<00:03:01.160> is
