area sixty one they don't mention that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.830 
area sixty one they don't mention that
already<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.770> don't<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:20.360> anyway<00:01:21.360> before<00:01:21.540> we

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
already I don't know anyway before we

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.380 
already I don't know anyway before we
even<00:01:22.110> open<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.150> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
even open this thing up we can see that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.969 
even open this thing up we can see that
it<00:01:24.509> has<00:01:24.689> two<00:01:25.049> pairs<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.040> wires<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.740> one

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
it has two pairs of wires you know one

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.880 
it has two pairs of wires you know one
would<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.960> would<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
would think that this here would be a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.010 
would think that this here would be a
joiner

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
joiner

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.069 
joiner
between<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.549> coils<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.720> would<00:01:36.900> be

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
between the two coils and this would be

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.550 
between the two coils and this would be
the<00:01:37.259> output<00:01:37.710> from<00:01:37.950> each<00:01:38.130> coil<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:40.229> looking

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the output from each coil just looking

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.880 
the output from each coil just looking
at<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.329> so<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> makes<00:01:42.689> me<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.500> it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
at it so it makes me think that it it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.580 
at it so it makes me think that it it's
a<00:01:44.070> twin<00:01:44.310> coil<00:01:44.579> pickup<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> hamburger<00:01:45.590> in

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
a twin coil pickup like a hamburger in

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.830 
a twin coil pickup like a hamburger in
like<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.840> fender<00:01:48.840> SCN<00:01:49.770> pickup<00:01:50.659> but<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
like the the fender SCN pickup but I

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.990 
like the the fender SCN pickup but I
will<00:01:52.079> show<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.930> compare<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.229> few<00:01:55.530> minutes

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
will show just to compare a few minutes

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.469 
will show just to compare a few minutes
so<00:01:57.000> let's<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.360> look<00:01:57.540> inside<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.409> I

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.300 

can<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> cover<00:02:03.990> off<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.229> sticks<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:05.040> little

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
can get the cover off it sticks a little

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.870 
can get the cover off it sticks a little
bit

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
bit

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.859 
bit
there<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.750> go<00:02:08.060> nothing<00:02:09.060> funky<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.660> on

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
there we go nothing funky going on

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.160 
there we go nothing funky going on
inside<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.500> cover<00:02:11.239> that's<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.750> piece<00:02:13.140> of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
inside the cover that's just a piece of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.640 
inside the cover that's just a piece of
plastic<00:02:15.019> now<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.760> what<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.650> looks

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
plastic now this is what we have looks

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.140 
plastic now this is what we have looks
kind<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.190> interesting<00:02:21.140> you've<00:02:22.140> noticed<00:02:22.590> that

unlike the fender there's no magnet
between<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.360> coils<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> Fender<00:02:31.830> SCM

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400

two coils we have one on the top one on
the<00:02:48.870> bottom<00:02:48.959> I'd<00:02:49.440> imagine<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.040> they'd<00:02:50.340> be

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
the bottom I'd imagine that they'd be

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:58.120 
the bottom I'd imagine that they'd be
Reverse<00:02:50.880> round<00:02:53.299> to<00:02:54.299> cancel<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.349> common<00:02:56.120> mode

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
Reverse round to cancel out common mode

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.390 
Reverse round to cancel out common mode
currents<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.989> we<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.680> plate<00:03:02.069> this

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
currents and we have this plate this

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.520 
currents and we have this plate this
funky<00:03:02.880> steel<00:03:03.150> plate<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.720> runs<00:03:04.019> between<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
funky steel plate that runs between the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.770 
funky steel plate that runs between the
coils<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.340> then<00:03:05.489> folds<00:03:05.970> up<00:03:06.090> around<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.599> top

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
coils and then folds up around the top

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.819 
coils and then folds up around the top
coil<00:03:08.239> so<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.390> essence<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.959> what<00:03:10.170> we<00:03:10.350> have<00:03:10.560> it's

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
coil so in essence of what we have it's

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.870 
coil so in essence of what we have it's
a<00:03:11.630> humbucker<00:03:13.010> stacked<00:03:14.010> one<00:03:14.250> on<00:03:14.310> top<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
a humbucker stacked one on top of the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.059 
a humbucker stacked one on top of the
other<00:03:15.829> so<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:16.920> recap<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:19.260> pole<00:03:19.500> pieces<00:03:19.769> are

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
other so to recap the pole pieces are

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.580 
other so to recap the pole pieces are

the magnets in this instance these guys

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.110 
the magnets in this instance these guys
are<00:03:22.980> El<00:03:23.280> Nico<00:03:23.670> -<00:03:24.560> we<00:03:25.560> have<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.739> coil<00:03:26.069> on<00:03:26.310> top<00:03:26.430> coil

capacitively dal off the high end or

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.580 
capacitively dal off the high end or
whether<00:03:39.030> it's<00:03:39.299> there<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.720> do<00:03:39.870> something<00:03:40.319> funky

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
whether it's there to do something funky

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.720 
whether it's there to do something funky
with<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.880> flux<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:43.310> magnetic<00:03:44.310> field

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
with the the flux of the magnetic field

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.210 
with the the flux of the magnetic field
that<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.630> haven't<00:03:46.170> suss<00:03:46.530> there<00:03:46.769> yet<00:03:48.859> so<00:03:49.859> anyway

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
that I haven't suss there yet so anyway

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.970 
that I haven't suss there yet so anyway
I<00:03:50.400> hope<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.730> cue<00:03:51.269> is<00:03:51.450> your<00:03:51.660> curiosity<00:03:54.889> have<00:03:55.889> a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
I hope that cue is your curiosity have a

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.549 
I hope that cue is your curiosity have a
