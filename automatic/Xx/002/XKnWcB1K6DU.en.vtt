research regenerative medicine I believe
that<00:02:34.650> we<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:36.269> give<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.480> scientists<00:02:38.140> as

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
that we have to give the scientists as

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.650 
that we have to give the scientists as

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610

closer and closer every day some people
will<00:02:48.280> argue<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.879> private<00:02:49.299> donations<00:02:49.870> are<00:02:50.049> a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
will argue that private donations are a
