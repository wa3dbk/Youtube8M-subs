switch<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.480> tone<00:00:40.440> stack<00:00:40.829> shift<00:00:41.219> which

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
switch you got a tone stack shift which

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
switch you got a tone stack shift which
moves<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.969> center<00:00:42.570> point<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> mid-range

around per channel then for each channel

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.810 
around per channel then for each channel
you<00:00:47.280> got<00:00:47.460> low<00:00:47.760> mid<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.390> high<00:00:49.079> voicing<00:00:49.820> now

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
you got low mid and high voicing now

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.560 
you got low mid and high voicing now
what<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.750> does<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.079> there's<00:00:52.559> nine<00:00:53.090> 12ax7<00:00:54.090> s

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
what that does is there's nine 12ax7 s

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.959 
what that does is there's nine 12ax7 s
in<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.829> high<00:00:56.100> low<00:00:56.520> mid<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.760> high

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
in this and the high low mid and high

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.060 
in this and the high low mid and high
voicing<00:00:57.480> pulls<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.020> different<00:00:58.440> stages<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
voicing pulls in different stages of

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.459 
voicing pulls in different stages of
that<00:00:59.280> 12<00:00:59.579> take<00:00:59.789> 7<00:01:00.180> gain<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.260> each

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that 12 take 7 gain in and out of each

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.070 
that 12 take 7 gain in and out of each
channel<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.430> also<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.820> two<00:01:03.180> effects<00:01:03.780> loops

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
channel you also have two effects loops

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.050 
channel you also have two effects loops
that<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.350> series<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:04.920> parallel<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.939> are

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that are series or parallel that are

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240 
that are series or parallel that are
switchable<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.229> master<00:01:07.619> volumes<00:01:08.040> which

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
switchable and to master volumes which

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.880 
switchable and to master volumes which
is<00:01:08.430> which<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:09.000> switchable<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.689> addition<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
is which are switchable in addition to a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.000 
is which are switchable in addition to a
boost<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.420> every<00:01:12.659> channel<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.710> it's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
boost I can go on every channel so it's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.429 
boost I can go on every channel so it's
120<00:01:14.850> watts<00:01:15.060> all<00:01:15.689> tube<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.920> also<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
120 watts all tube it's also got a

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.630 
120 watts all tube it's also got a
preamp<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.619> where<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.189> adjust<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
preamp out where you can adjust the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.070 
preamp out where you can adjust the
level<00:01:20.939> if<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.119> want<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> slave<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> power
