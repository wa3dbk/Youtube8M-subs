guys<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.560> believe<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.490> break<00:01:41.759> through<00:01:42.030> here

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
guys I believe if I break through here

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.160 
guys I believe if I break through here
there's<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.720> little<00:01:42.930> path<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:45.630> should<00:01:45.899> lead

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
there's a little path that should lead

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.219 
there's a little path that should lead
out<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.490> don't<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.570> shovel<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:49.049> me

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
out I don't have a shovel on me

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.020 
out I don't have a shovel on me
nevermind<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.399> actually<00:01:50.729> goes<00:01:50.850> straight

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
nevermind this actually goes straight

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.120 
nevermind this actually goes straight
into<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> spawner<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.409> see<00:01:52.649> I'll<00:01:52.890> be

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
into the spawner so you can see I'll be

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.850 
into the spawner so you can see I'll be
careful<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:53.850> hit<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.860> expanded

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
careful not to get hit but I expanded

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.679 
careful not to get hit but I expanded
this<00:01:56.040> from<00:01:56.310> four<00:01:56.670> across<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.329> each<00:01:57.450> side

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
this from four across two on each side

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.440 
this from four across two on each side
to<00:01:57.810> eight<00:01:57.990> across<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.159> now<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.640> two<00:01:59.880> flows

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
to eight across so now we have two flows

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.740 
to eight across so now we have two flows
of<00:02:00.630> water<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.229> down<00:02:02.210> channeling<00:02:03.210> look<00:02:03.630> out

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
of water going down channeling look out

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.780 
of water going down channeling look out
for<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.990> skeleton<00:02:04.409> channeling<00:02:05.159> water<00:02:05.399> all

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
for that skeleton channeling water all

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.850 
for that skeleton channeling water all
the<00:02:06.060> way<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.509> center<00:02:06.960> which<00:02:07.259> actually<00:02:07.680> has

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the way to the center which actually has

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.720 
the way to the center which actually has
a<00:02:08.129> trench<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:10.619> trench<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.340> eight

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
a trench in it and that trench is eight

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.410 
a trench in it and that trench is eight
long<00:02:12.090> as<00:02:12.330> well<00:02:12.569> so

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
long as well so

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.089 
long as well so
basically<00:02:13.720> anything<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.319> spawns<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.830> here

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
basically anything that spawns in here

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.220 
basically anything that spawns in here
will<00:02:15.370> get<00:02:15.520> pushed<00:02:15.790> by<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.150> sideways<00:02:16.780> currents

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
will get pushed by the sideways currents

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.350 
will get pushed by the sideways currents
into<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.950> center<00:02:18.280> current<00:02:18.610> which<00:02:18.790> pushes<00:02:19.090> it

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
into the center current which pushes it

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.930 
into the center current which pushes it
down<00:02:19.390> into<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.650> pit<00:02:20.890> which<00:02:21.130> only<00:02:21.340> needs<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.790> be

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
down into the pit which only needs to be

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.360 
down into the pit which only needs to be
one<00:02:22.390> wide<00:02:22.870> now<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.260> get<00:02:23.530> them<00:02:23.709> down<00:02:23.920> there<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
one wide now to get them down there and

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.339 
one wide now to get them down there and
then<00:02:25.239> I<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:25.510> made<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> little<00:02:25.959> wider<00:02:26.170> on

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
then I just made it a little wider on

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.780 
then I just made it a little wider on
the<00:02:26.380> bottom<00:02:26.470> or<00:02:26.860> kept<00:02:27.069> it<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.220> way<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.550> that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the bottom or kept it that way so that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.339 
the bottom or kept it that way so that
we<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.390> know<00:02:28.480> we'd<00:02:28.720> have<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> lot<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.080> room<00:02:29.319> for

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
we you know we'd have a lot of room for

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.330 
we you know we'd have a lot of room for
these<00:02:29.620> guys<00:02:30.600> having<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.750> eight<00:02:31.959> wide<00:02:32.530> here

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
these guys having it eight wide here

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.510 
these guys having it eight wide here
actually<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.569> really<00:02:34.870> good<00:02:35.050> way<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.650> spawn<00:02:36.489> a

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
actually is a really good way to spawn a

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.280 
actually is a really good way to spawn a
lot<00:02:36.640> more<00:02:36.970> as<00:02:37.090> well<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.330> could<00:02:37.690> expand<00:02:38.080> it<00:02:38.170> in

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
lot more as well I could expand it in

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.559 
lot more as well I could expand it in
the<00:02:38.380> back<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.650> believe<00:02:38.920> but<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:40.180> way<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:40.510> I

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
the back I believe but the way that I

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.809 
the back I believe but the way that I
have<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:40.900> set<00:02:41.200> up<00:02:41.319> with<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.620> water<00:02:41.920> this

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
have this set up with the water this

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.190 
have this set up with the water this
seems<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.209> work<00:02:43.360> best<00:02:43.569> for<00:02:43.660> getting<00:02:44.019> them

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
seems to work best for getting them

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.960 
seems to work best for getting them
quickly<00:02:44.590> pushed<00:02:44.890> down<00:02:45.250> into<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.700> they<00:02:45.850> can

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
quickly pushed down into it they can

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.120 
quickly pushed down into it they can
kind<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.239> get<00:02:46.390> caught<00:02:46.569> on<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.810> spawner<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.920> one

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
kind of get caught on the spawner so one

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.680 
kind of get caught on the spawner so one
way<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.310> could<00:02:48.519> do<00:02:48.819> this<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.330> make<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.600> a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
way I could do this is to make it a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.479 
way I could do this is to make it a
little<00:02:49.900> deeper<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.590> did<00:02:53.590> actually<00:02:53.769> lower

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
little deeper but I did actually lower

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.840 
little deeper but I did actually lower
it<00:02:54.730> one<00:02:55.860> he's<00:02:56.860> not<00:02:57.010> gonna<00:02:57.100> let<00:02:57.250> me<00:02:57.400> look<00:02:57.549> but<00:02:57.819> I

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
it one he's not gonna let me look but I

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.789 
it one he's not gonna let me look but I
did<00:02:58.090> lower<00:02:58.299> this<00:02:58.510> one<00:02:58.810> if<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.140> noticed<00:02:59.440> before

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
did lower this one if you noticed before

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.990 
did lower this one if you noticed before
the<00:02:59.980> spawner<00:03:00.280> was<00:03:00.610> on<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:03.160> ground<00:03:03.700> level

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
the spawner was on the the ground level

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.430 
the spawner was on the the ground level
but<00:03:04.239> now<00:03:04.420> it's<00:03:04.720> floating

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
but now it's floating

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.770 
but now it's floating
so<00:03:05.769> that<00:03:06.040> stuff<00:03:06.700> could<00:03:06.819> spawn<00:03:07.120> because<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.660> had

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
so that stuff could spawn because I had

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.680 
so that stuff could spawn because I had
learned<00:03:08.019> thanks<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.799> viewer<00:03:09.040> as<00:03:09.250> well

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
learned thanks to the viewer as well

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.320 
learned thanks to the viewer as well
that<00:03:10.690> stuff<00:03:11.680> will<00:03:11.830> spawn<00:03:12.100> one<00:03:12.489> block<00:03:12.760> below<00:03:13.120> as

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
that stuff will spawn one block below as

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.410 
that stuff will spawn one block below as
well<00:03:13.540> as<00:03:14.140> along<00:03:14.530> with<00:03:14.920> above<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.910> on<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.239> same

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
well as along with above and on the same

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.300 
well as along with above and on the same
level<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:16.989> then<00:03:17.410> if<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.590> look<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.859> put<00:03:18.040> some

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
level and then if you look I put some

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.370 
level and then if you look I put some
cobble<00:03:18.880> on<00:03:18.970> top<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.630> skeleton

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
cobble on top of it so that skeleton

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.860 
cobble on top of it so that skeleton
can't<00:03:20.620> spawn<00:03:20.890> on<00:03:21.100> top<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.730> get<00:03:22.450> stuck<00:03:22.750> on

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
can't spawn on top and get stuck on

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.039 
can't spawn on top and get stuck on
there<00:03:23.079> you<00:03:23.200> know<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:23.440> never<00:03:23.650> go<00:03:23.859> down<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.820> yeah

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
there you know and never go down so yeah

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.300 
there you know and never go down so yeah
this<00:03:26.049> isn't<00:03:26.230> perfect<00:03:26.530> because<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.160> do<00:03:27.280> have

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
this isn't perfect because you do have

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.039 
this isn't perfect because you do have
to<00:03:27.459> stand<00:03:27.790> at<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:27.970> top<00:03:28.239> still<00:03:28.570> while<00:03:28.810> stuff

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
to stand at the top still while stuff

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.170 
to stand at the top still while stuff
spawns<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.739> then<00:03:30.430> go<00:03:30.640> down<00:03:30.820> there's

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
spawns and then go down there's

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.580 
spawns and then go down there's
definitely<00:03:31.540> ways<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.930> make<00:03:32.079> it<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:32.350> you<00:03:32.380> can

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
definitely ways to make it so you can

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.410 
definitely ways to make it so you can
stand<00:03:32.859> at<00:03:33.130> one<00:03:33.310> level<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.730> kill<00:03:34.030> them<00:03:34.180> at<00:03:34.299> one

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
stand at one level and kill them at one

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.270 
stand at one level and kill them at one
level<00:03:34.600> where<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.380> skeleton<00:03:35.829> or<00:03:35.859> zombies

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
level where the the skeleton or zombies

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.520 
level where the the skeleton or zombies
are<00:03:36.400> pushed<00:03:36.640> back<00:03:36.850> up<00:03:37.090> but<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:38.170> is<00:03:38.230> pretty

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
are pushed back up but this is pretty

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.640 
are pushed back up but this is pretty
sufficient<00:03:39.010> for<00:03:39.190> what<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.340> use<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.090> for<00:03:40.120> just

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
sufficient for what I use it for just

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.920 
sufficient for what I use it for just
having<00:03:41.650> skills<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.220> shoot<00:03:42.400> me<00:03:42.549> just<00:03:43.000> getting

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
having skills and shoot me just getting

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.420 
having skills and shoot me just getting
a<00:03:43.959> bunch<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.320> them<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:44.709> having<00:03:44.950> them<00:03:45.070> go<00:03:45.220> down

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
a bunch of them and having them go down

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.009 
a bunch of them and having them go down
like<00:03:45.730> as<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.120> saw<00:03:46.329> that<00:03:46.359> was<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.750> lot<00:03:46.989> of

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
like as you saw that was a lot of

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.479 
like as you saw that was a lot of
experience<00:03:47.560> for<00:03:47.739> such<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.950> short<00:03:48.190> amount<00:03:48.400> of

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
experience for such a short amount of

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.280 
experience for such a short amount of
time<00:03:48.579> if<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.030> left<00:03:49.239> this<00:03:49.420> overnight<00:03:50.019> there

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
time if you left this overnight there

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.880 
time if you left this overnight there
would<00:03:50.410> be<00:03:50.440> an<00:03:50.590> insane<00:03:51.040> amount<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:52.620> pretty<00:03:53.620> cool

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
would be an insane amount so pretty cool

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.110 
would be an insane amount so pretty cool

had a sword but if you do want to use

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160 
had a sword but if you do want to use
the<00:04:12.340> healing<00:04:12.730> splash<00:04:13.060> potions<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.600> do<00:04:13.660> I<00:04:13.780> can

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
the healing splash potions I do I can

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.229 
the healing splash potions I do I can
recommend<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:14.620> because<00:04:14.940> every<00:04:15.940> time<00:04:16.090> you

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
recommend that because every time you

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.909 
recommend that because every time you
hit<00:04:16.419> an<00:04:16.600> enemy<00:04:16.750> even<00:04:17.229> if<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:17.470> not<00:04:17.620> with<00:04:17.769> your

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
hit an enemy even if it's not with your

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.770 
hit an enemy even if it's not with your
sword<00:04:18.220> your<00:04:18.459> food<00:04:18.729> goes<00:04:18.970> down<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.239> bit<00:04:19.389> and<00:04:19.720> you

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
sword your food goes down a bit and you

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.500 
sword your food goes down a bit and you
can<00:04:19.989> really<00:04:20.260> burn<00:04:20.620> up<00:04:20.829> food<00:04:21.160> this<00:04:21.909> way<00:04:22.090> if<00:04:22.360> you

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
can really burn up food this way if you

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.650 
can really burn up food this way if you
have<00:04:22.539> the<00:04:22.720> food<00:04:22.990> then<00:04:23.229> it's<00:04:23.380> fine

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
have the food then it's fine

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.240 
have the food then it's fine
because<00:04:23.930> it<00:04:24.620> seems<00:04:24.800> like<00:04:24.950> there's<00:04:25.130> an

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
because it seems like there's an

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.920 
because it seems like there's an
abundance<00:04:25.460> of<00:04:25.760> food<00:04:25.970> in<00:04:26.150> this<00:04:26.300> game<00:04:26.570> once<00:04:26.810> you

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
abundance of food in this game once you

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.020 
abundance of food in this game once you
get<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.110> farm<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.560> stuff<00:04:27.740> going<00:04:27.920> but<00:04:28.820> yeah

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
get a farm and stuff going but yeah

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.060 
get a farm and stuff going but yeah
splash<00:04:29.450> potions<00:04:29.900> are<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.080> way<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.260> go<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:30.830> think

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
splash potions are the way to go I think

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.650 
splash potions are the way to go I think
to<00:04:31.280> hit<00:04:31.490> them<00:04:31.640> all<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:32.030> can<00:04:32.060> also<00:04:32.270> get<00:04:32.540> them

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
to hit them all you can also get them

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.140 
to hit them all you can also get them
all<00:04:32.780> trapped<00:04:33.050> into<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.350> single<00:04:33.740> block<00:04:34.010> but<00:04:34.970> that

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
all trapped into a single block but that

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.060 
all trapped into a single block but that
is<00:04:35.360> pretty<00:04:35.630> insane<00:04:35.960> for<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.380> deafening<00:04:36.800> sound

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
is pretty insane for the deafening sound

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.950 
is pretty insane for the deafening sound
that<00:04:37.340> they<00:04:37.460> make<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:37.880> had<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.660> turn<00:04:38.840> the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
that they make you had to turn the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.470 
that they make you had to turn the
volume<00:04:39.080> down<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:39.790> but<00:04:40.790> I<00:04:40.820> makes<00:04:41.090> them<00:04:41.210> easier

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
volume down and but I makes them easier

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.030 
volume down and but I makes them easier
to<00:04:41.510> hit<00:04:41.690> with<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.840> potion<00:04:42.020> so<00:04:42.710> yeah<00:04:42.830> splash

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
to hit with the potion so yeah splash

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.400 
to hit with the potion so yeah splash
potions<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:43.940> hopefully<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.630> guys<00:04:44.780> like<00:04:45.140> the

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.440 
the spawner who gave me tips on how to
make<00:04:51.950> it<00:04:52.070> better<00:04:52.190> and<00:04:52.670> I'll<00:04:53.060> probably<00:04:53.270> keep

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
make it better and I'll probably keep

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.580 
make it better and I'll probably keep
improving<00:04:53.900> it<00:04:53.990> but<00:04:54.140> right<00:04:54.260> now<00:04:54.320> this<00:04:54.530> is

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
improving it but right now this is

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.000 
improving it but right now this is
pretty<00:04:54.830> good<00:04:55.040> for<00:04:55.220> me<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.520> this<00:04:56.270> has<00:04:56.450> been

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
pretty good for me so this has been

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
one spot here it kind of sounds like a

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.060 
one spot here it kind of sounds like a
bunch<00:05:11.600> of<00:05:11.780> xylophones<00:05:12.170> falling<00:05:12.890> down<00:05:13.040> a

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
bunch of xylophones falling down a

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.940 
bunch of xylophones falling down a
flight<00:05:13.160> of<00:05:13.400> stairs<00:05:13.960> but<00:05:14.960> I'm<00:05:15.350> gonna<00:05:15.560> use<00:05:15.770> the

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
flight of stairs but I'm gonna use the

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.350 
flight of stairs but I'm gonna use the
potion<00:05:16.160> here<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:16.670> we'll<00:05:16.790> see<00:05:16.940> how<00:05:17.000> many<00:05:17.180> we

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
potion here and we'll see how many we

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.640 
potion here and we'll see how many we
killed<00:05:17.630> well<00:05:17.870> if<00:05:18.080> I<00:05:18.170> get<00:05:18.290> too<00:05:18.410> close<00:05:18.620> that

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
killed well if I get too close that

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.280 
killed well if I get too close that

pushed me away look before but let's try

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.890 
pushed me away look before but let's try
it<00:05:21.380> see<00:05:21.800> how<00:05:21.890> many<00:05:22.040> we<00:05:22.160> can<00:05:22.280> kill<00:05:22.670> my<00:05:23.240> little<00:05:23.390> 7

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900

Oh<00:05:25.240> all<00:05:26.240> dead<00:05:27.040> it's<00:05:28.040> gonna<00:05:28.160> take<00:05:28.400> a<00:05:28.430> minute<00:05:28.580> for

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
Oh all dead it's gonna take a minute for

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.970 
Oh all dead it's gonna take a minute for
the<00:05:28.940> experience<00:05:29.450> here<00:05:29.660> that<00:05:29.810> all<00:05:30.320> hit<00:05:30.620> me<00:05:30.770> but

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
the experience here that all hit me but

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.790 
the experience here that all hit me but
look<00:05:31.160> at<00:05:31.310> those<00:05:31.460> levels<00:05:31.940> go<00:05:32.120> up<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:32.800> they're

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
look at those levels go up and they're

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.210 
look at those levels go up and they're
all<00:05:33.920> quiet<00:05:34.750> say<00:05:35.750> I<00:05:35.780> think<00:05:36.110> condensing<00:05:37.100> them

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
all quiet say I think condensing them

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.220 
all quiet say I think condensing them
into<00:05:37.490> one<00:05:37.700> spot<00:05:38.090> is<00:05:38.300> probably<00:05:38.450> a<00:05:38.780> smarter<00:05:39.200> way

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
into one spot is probably a smarter way

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.890 
into one spot is probably a smarter way
to<00:05:39.380> go<00:05:40.000> they're<00:05:41.000> not<00:05:41.120> going<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.300> burst<00:05:41.480> out<00:05:41.750> or

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
to go they're not going to burst out or

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.440 
to go they're not going to burst out or
anything<00:05:42.080> obviously<00:05:42.800> so<00:05:43.030> some<00:05:44.030> of<00:05:44.060> that<00:05:44.150> drops

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
anything obviously so some of that drops

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.800 
anything obviously so some of that drops
