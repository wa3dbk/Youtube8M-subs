00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:14.219
 welcome like these we were seeing 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.670
 the program of mexico where to study 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.529
 perfect and very happy to go 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.910
 costumes' finish beautiful they will see 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.370
 in pictures 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.350
 so that they come when they want the plant 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.450
 less dignified local and the new can is not 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.039
 very novel for me at least I hope 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.390
 that they like good what good and useful not 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.219
 are you going to teach us to do today we're going to try 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.780
 sunflowers also with basic brushstroke 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.660
 Well, you already showed us butterflies 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.160
 daisies everything so easy you explain it 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.200
 so well I have already sold pretty 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.270
 these truths thanks these thanks that 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.860
 just as it came down good as I said 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.410
 let's make sunflowers also with 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.780
 basic brushstroke this time we're not going to 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.320
 use where you charge but the colors 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.100
 are going to be polished 11 working it out 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:02.200
 way a wet on a new we are going to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.809
 load a color first eye dry charge 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.969
 well loaded the brush on one side and the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.680
 another one and I'll show you the brushstroke 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:12.950
 which is the most important part of sunflower 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:18.289
 supported in little 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.149
 and he raised he supported he pushed and I raise 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.119
 these are the ones I recommend that if they are not 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.520
 very canchera until the beginning go it 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.439
 doing apart because it 's important 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.409
 that we work as I said at the beginning 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.900
 in numbers about 126 I'm taking a lot 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.940
 the paint dries up 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.190
 and the colors the colors are not going to 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.430
 integrate support pushed and I raise support 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.170
 in its funny elements out there the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.930
 way I repeat but that way of 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.690
 Always remember where the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.200
 inkwell if I do not leave for any 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.360
 side I will be is to graze and no more 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.369
 because I'm more interested in seeing 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.619
 how is the theme of the colors then I go 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.960
 to load the other color I remind you what 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.159
 I'm using a flat brush always with 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.580
 good edge and good guard 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.450
 I will go interspersing support came in and 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.610
 he raised well 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.370
 and what has yellow is also 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.660
 transparency allows me to leave 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.060
 watching the orange of the support background 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.080
 then he raised by his little raised 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.450
 charge when necessary 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.280
 I raise and here I am going to trust I will go 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.530
 darker color to lighter color 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.420
 now let's go with another sea made even more 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.730
 clarito can use another yellow sun 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.319
 extra that is very clear so that it 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.580
 distinguish could also have been a 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.890
 lemon yellow 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.319
 I will continue interspersing room cole 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.080
 banks see that as the colors that 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.450
 they are wet they melt and 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.930
 each color is having a little bit of 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.120
 previous color this would be the way to 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.799
 not whole extraction just so that 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.300
 see how it would look in the model 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.840
 finished 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.390
 the circle I did it by tapping ciphers 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.280
 yellow has natural and a little 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.590
 black so you have good volume 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.450
 I hope you like it practiced and 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.500
 the 5 with lines says it has 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.500
 guests thanks
