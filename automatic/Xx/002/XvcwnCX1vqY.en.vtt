00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
it again in the next direction let it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.160 
it again in the next direction let it
dry<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.600> long<00:01:09.750> does<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> drying

end result here once the paper is

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.469 
end result here once the paper is
removed<00:01:25.200> from<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.500> back<00:01:25.790> then<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.030> more

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.719 
to get the the correct size and I'll
just<00:02:06.570> line<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.990> over<00:02:07.259> over<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.520> charm

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.729 
just line it up over over the the charm
I've<00:02:08.879> selected<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.539> find<00:02:09.810> approximately<00:02:10.619> the

right<00:02:10.770> size

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
right size

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.530 
right size
and<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:12.100> Center<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.030> use<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.270> as<00:02:13.480> a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and then Center it and use it as a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.750 
and then Center it and use it as a
little<00:02:13.810> window<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.470> trace<00:02:14.680> around<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.610> image

edge mom instead of a straight edge it
blends<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.370> little<00:03:03.610> bit<00:03:03.730> more<00:03:03.850> easily<00:03:04.150> than
