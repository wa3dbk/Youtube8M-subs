00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
really have to set up once and it seems

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.090 
really have to set up once and it seems
to<00:00:37.090> apply<00:00:37.420> to<00:00:37.540> every<00:00:38.080> single<00:00:38.260> neo<00:00:38.560> geo<00:00:38.830> game

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
to apply to every single neo geo game

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.430 
to apply to every single neo geo game
you<00:00:39.580> can<00:00:39.700> also<00:00:39.880> choose<00:00:40.390> network<00:00:40.900> mode<00:00:41.200> which

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
you can also choose network mode which

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.960 
you can also choose network mode which
is<00:00:41.650> the<00:00:41.890> ability<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.280> play<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.550> games<00:00:42.760> online

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
is the ability to play the games online

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.570 
is the ability to play the games online
or<00:00:43.420> normal<00:00:44.230> mode<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.680> it<00:00:44.890> kicks<00:00:45.100> you<00:00:45.220> straight

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
or normal mode and it kicks you straight

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.390 
or normal mode and it kicks you straight
into<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.820> original<00:00:46.300> so<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:47.980> appears<00:00:48.370> that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
into the original so it appears that

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.760 
into the original so it appears that
these<00:00:48.940> versions<00:00:49.330> are<00:00:49.720> actually<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.170> 60<00:00:50.530> Hertz

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
these versions are actually the 60 Hertz

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.920 
these versions are actually the 60 Hertz

awful because of it where is this I'm

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.350 
awful because of it where is this I'm
noticing<00:01:16.630> such<00:01:17.230> a<00:01:17.260> speed<00:01:17.620> difference

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
noticing such a speed difference

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.060 
noticing such a speed difference
graphically<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.600> game<00:01:19.900> looks<00:01:20.350> fantastic<00:01:20.770> I

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
graphically the game looks fantastic I

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.530 
graphically the game looks fantastic I
might<00:01:21.100> as<00:01:21.250> well<00:01:21.400> start<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.090> right<00:01:22.300> away

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
might as well start that right away

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.570 
might as well start that right away
because<00:01:22.750> portunity<00:01:23.650> gimmick<00:01:24.070> really<00:01:24.400> does

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
because portunity gimmick really does

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.149 
because portunity gimmick really does
look<00:01:24.730> excellent<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.570> sound<00:01:26.320> wise<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.830> sounds

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
look excellent and sound wise it sounds

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.470 
look excellent and sound wise it sounds
weird<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.120> will<00:01:28.720> off<00:01:28.840> of<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.170> let<00:01:29.320> me

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
weird so I will off of it let me

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.840 
weird so I will off of it let me
but<00:01:29.900> first<00:01:30.170> I<00:01:30.380> might<00:01:30.590> go<00:01:30.830> mention<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:31.430> is<00:01:31.640> as<00:01:31.820> I

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
but first I might go mention it is as I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.150 
but first I might go mention it is as I
see<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.120> as<00:01:32.390> straightforward<00:01:32.750> fighter<00:01:33.500> beat

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
see it as straightforward fighter beat

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.470 
see it as straightforward fighter beat
them<00:01:34.340> or<00:01:34.460> whatever<00:01:34.760> you<00:01:35.000> want<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.210> call<00:01:35.420> them

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
them or whatever you want to call them

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.870 
them or whatever you want to call them
and<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.260> whole<00:01:36.380> point<00:01:36.530> is<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.770> kick<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.430> crap

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
and the whole point is to kick the crap

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.910 
and the whole point is to kick the crap
out<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.150> your<00:01:38.330> opponent<00:01:38.870> do<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.710> for<00:01:39.890> a

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
out of your opponent do that for a
