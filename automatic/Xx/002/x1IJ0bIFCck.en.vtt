bulbs on clearance but so I'll pick up

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.759 
bulbs on clearance but so I'll pick up
the<00:00:21.449> cheap<00:00:21.689> ones<00:00:21.960> but<00:00:22.230> some<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.470> them<00:00:22.650> are

the cheap ones but some of them are
still<00:00:23.070> quite<00:00:23.519> expensive<00:00:24.080> anyway<00:00:25.080> here's<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
still quite expensive anyway here's the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.450 
still quite expensive anyway here's the
front<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> package<00:00:26.720> information<00:00:28.460> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
front of the package information the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.100 
front of the package information the
back<00:00:29.699> all<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.689> other<00:00:30.900> baloney

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
back all this other baloney

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.000 
back all this other baloney
so<00:00:34.399> already<00:00:35.399> cut<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> open<00:00:35.899> not<00:00:36.899> very<00:00:37.110> fancy

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
so already cut it open not very fancy

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.990 
so already cut it open not very fancy
hopefully<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.090> will<00:00:39.270> open<00:00:39.600> there<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.290> go

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
hopefully it will open there you go

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.670 
hopefully it will open there you go
don't<00:00:42.000> leave<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.210> package<00:00:42.629> anymore<00:00:43.879> so

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
don't leave this package anymore so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.380 
don't leave this package anymore so
seems<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.190> plastic<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.149> that's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
seems like it's plastic and that's

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.340 
seems like it's plastic and that's
plastic<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:49.110> course<00:00:49.789> we<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:51.000> three<00:00:51.420> LEDs<00:00:51.989> on

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
plastic of course we have three LEDs on

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.600 
plastic of course we have three LEDs on
each<00:00:52.710> side<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:55.070> triangle<00:00:56.070> pyramid

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
each side of this triangle pyramid

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.509 
each side of this triangle pyramid
whatever<00:00:58.850> two<00:00:59.850> watts<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.920> that's<00:01:05.129> all<00:01:05.400> that's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
whatever two watts and that's all that's

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
whatever two watts and that's all that's
on<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> information<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.229> least

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
on it for the information at least

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.289 
on it for the information at least
obviously<00:01:08.400> there's<00:01:08.549> more<00:01:08.729> than<00:01:08.880> two<00:01:09.090> watts

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
obviously there's more than two watts

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.570 
obviously there's more than two watts
but<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.900> don't<00:01:10.830> feel<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.040> reading<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.430> that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
but I don't feel like reading all that

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.730 
but I don't feel like reading all that
other<00:01:11.729> baloney<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.659> there's<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> bulb<00:01:13.380> itself

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
other baloney so there's a bulb itself

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310 
other baloney so there's a bulb itself
they<00:01:14.280> did<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> frosted<00:01:15.540> version<00:01:16.020> or

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
they did not have a frosted version or

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.420 
they did not have a frosted version or
else<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.590> would<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.770> picked<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.280> those<00:01:17.369> up

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
else I would have picked one of those up

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.780 
else I would have picked one of those up
because<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.060> wanted<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
because I really wanted one in the

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.899 
because I really wanted one in the
candelabra<00:01:20.790> base<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:22.759> but<00:01:25.640> put<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.729> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
candelabra base like this but put it in

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.929 
candelabra base like this but put it in
here<00:01:27.320> let's<00:01:28.320> turn<00:01:28.619> off<00:01:28.829> these<00:01:29.159> lights<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.260 

turn<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:34.400> this<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> socket<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.240> has

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
turn it on this is a socket that has

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.109 
turn it on this is a socket that has
problem<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:38.250> probably<00:01:38.579> will<00:01:39.060> have

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
problem so we probably will have

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.670 
problem so we probably will have
problems<00:01:39.810> turning<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:42.320> come<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.439> work

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
problems turning it on come on work

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:52.719 
problems turning it on come on work
today<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.640> go<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:50.630> LEDs<00:01:51.630> on

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
today there we go so you can see LEDs on

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.530 
today there we go so you can see LEDs on
each<00:01:53.729> side

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.280 

I<00:01:57.280> would<00:01:58.280> say<00:01:58.580> because<00:01:59.030> there's<00:01:59.390> no<00:01:59.600> frosting

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
I would say because there's no frosting

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.060 
I would say because there's no frosting
on<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:01.010> bulb<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.630> does<00:02:02.810> equal<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.320> 25<00:02:03.800> watt

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
on the bulb that it does equal a 25 watt

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.740 
on the bulb that it does equal a 25 watt
bulb<00:02:04.340> like<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:04.820> believe<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.330> said<00:02:05.510> on<00:02:05.630> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
bulb like I believe it said on the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.170 
bulb like I believe it said on the
package<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:06.890> let's<00:02:07.520> see<00:02:07.640> I'll<00:02:07.730> hold<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:07.940> up<00:02:08.060> by

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
package but let's see I'll hold it up by

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.000 
package but let's see I'll hold it up by
the<00:02:08.240> camera<00:02:08.630> here<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:08.930> you<00:02:09.020> can<00:02:09.140> see<00:02:09.680> how<00:02:09.830> well

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
the camera here so you can see how well

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.370 
the camera here so you can see how well
it<00:02:10.130> lights<00:02:10.310> up<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.640> surface<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.200> does

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
it lights up the surface but it does

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.940 
it lights up the surface but it does
equal<00:02:12.590> 25<00:02:13.580> watts<00:02:13.880> I<00:02:14.090> would<00:02:14.270> say<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.950> frosted

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
equal 25 watts I would say a frosted

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.160 
equal 25 watts I would say a frosted
version<00:02:16.340> probably<00:02:17.240> still<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.570> same<00:02:17.780> but<00:02:17.960> more

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
version probably still the same but more

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.940 
version probably still the same but more
toward<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.790> 15<00:02:19.790> watt<00:02:20.120> range<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.760> anyway

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
toward the 15 watt range so anyway

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.070 
toward the 15 watt range so anyway
there's<00:02:24.950> my<00:02:25.250> Fiat<00:02:25.670> electric<00:02:26.150> flame<00:02:26.630> shaped

there's my Fiat electric flame shaped

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.050 
there's my Fiat electric flame shaped
