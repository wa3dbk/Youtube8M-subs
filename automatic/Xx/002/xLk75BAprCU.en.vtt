saber-tooth<00:01:54.329> arrogance<00:01:54.780> with<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> little<00:01:55.110> bit

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
saber-tooth arrogance with a little bit

saber-tooth arrogance with a little bit
of<00:01:55.490> foreshadowing<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:57.060> Rufus<00:01:57.750> claims<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> have

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
of foreshadowing as Rufus claims to have

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.170 
of foreshadowing as Rufus claims to have
memorized<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> entire<00:01:59.729> battle

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
memorized at that in the entire battle

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.819 
memorized at that in the entire battle
and<00:02:00.270> therefore<00:02:00.689> technically<00:02:01.530> he'd<00:02:01.740> be

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and therefore technically he'd be

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.830 
and therefore technically he'd be
impossible<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> defeat<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:03.509> he<00:02:03.719> knows

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
impossible to defeat because he knows

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.859 
impossible to defeat because he knows
everything<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.259> nice<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:05.869> but

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
everything that nice you can do but

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.869 
everything that nice you can do but
maybe<00:02:07.229> good<00:02:07.439> G<00:02:07.590> will<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> key<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.310> too

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879

a<00:02:59.550> graveyard<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.480> dragons<00:03:00.959> which<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.830> really

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
a graveyard of dragons which is really

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.050 
a graveyard of dragons which is really
interesting<00:03:02.550> because<00:03:02.580> if<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:02.940> is

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
interesting because if this is

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.730 
interesting because if this is
underneath<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.480> Colosseum<00:03:04.140> then<00:03:04.560> perhaps

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
underneath the Colosseum then perhaps

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.380 
underneath the Colosseum then perhaps
what<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.220> means<00:03:05.400> my<00:03:05.550> dragons<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.090> know<00:03:06.180> coming

what it means my dragons you know coming
together<00:03:06.570> for<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.959> fights<00:03:07.140> maybe<00:03:07.470> they<00:03:07.620> come

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
together for the fights maybe they come

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.949 
together for the fights maybe they come
back<00:03:07.920> back<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.490> life<00:03:08.670> I'm<00:03:09.480> not<00:03:09.630> really<00:03:09.870> sure
