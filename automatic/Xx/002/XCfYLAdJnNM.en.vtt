00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.460
 the government of the province of Chaco 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.360
 assumes the commitment to preserve the goods for future generations 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.139
 natural resources that the territory has 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.529
 for the full development of its inhabitants 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.720
 for this, after goals, it is medium and long term that determine the actions 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.479
 and work plans for all the areas involved 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.609
 the ministry of production through the resources undersecretary 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.960
 natural and environment is proposed 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.520
 take rational advantage of existing natural resources 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.670
 delimit in places for intensive reservations and 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.540
 protect provincial natural monuments conserve species of 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.170
 regional fauna and flora 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.340
 develop non-traditional productive alternatives 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.470
 compatible with existing resources 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.750
 and create conditions for the permanence of local populations and producers 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.170
 in that stage of study where the subject of the commercialization of the products 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.219
 forestry 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:18.650
 they emerged 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.260
 a series of needs among those just nobody 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.910
 able to achieve the traceability of the products, a system of 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.600
 communications through the internet service 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 in this way all offices are in communication 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.149
 So here we concentrate on all the information of 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.170
 the province 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.080
 the cadet made a transfer to some product also travels the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 information that the center refers to 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.410
 i the inventory is not useful for the management of good practices 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.080
 handled the good pro te serves as for ap through the top control 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.379
 these products the objective of this manual is 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.049
 make a change 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.799
 of abusive forestry still integral forest use 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.609
 having specific viable and practical bases, very important issues were addressed 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.119
 important as for example the system plus 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:26.169
 and the tree plus the traditional system only the applicable 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:28.339
 species 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:32.449
 mature or with diameters of short however the system plus 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.729
 encompasses not only the management of mature individuals, but also the 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.669
 regeneration management 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.949
 and those individuals of intermediate classes and the silvopastoral system in 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.869
 a dual-purpose system is the forestry productive point of view and 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.329
 nobody can not do pasture 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.349
 and have meat production 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.190
 they have some regulation and as for example to leave curtains with modules of 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.219
 50 hectares each 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:07.489
 the fundamental objective is to leave within this silvopastoral system 120 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.919
 trees per hectare is specifically betting trees 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.449
 of biometric classes internet 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.489
 Annual rainfall in the Chaco territory 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.499
 they vary from 600 millimeters to one thousand 300 millimeters from west to east 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:29.219
 producing diversity of landscapes and modifying the characteristics of 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.219
 our soils and their production capacities 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.939
 this office is in charge of the inventory study of the soils of the province 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.149
 about the relief if they are flooded with 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:44.840
 if they are good saline 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.189
 we have all the information 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:52.489
 necessary that gives us the pitu of this soil for different forest tastes 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.229
 agricultural the ship eroski also the restrictions that this soil has 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.629
 for agricultural production 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.799
 and we do it with a technical assistance program the management and 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.979
 soil conservation with technicians and producers 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:11.689
 This knowledge of the soil is carried out in an agreement with inta from 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.950
 The production ministry has carried out the study of all the soils 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.060
 we arrive at the most important agricultural area of â€‹â€‹the province 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.550
 more than 5 million hectares and a soil study is also produced 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.990
 by department 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.939
 cadastral of the province 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:31.610
 the most novel achievement that we have in assets remodeled r my stepfather 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.120
 fire laboratory 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.749
 in a new building we have incorporated professionals 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.990
 new on the subject 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.930
 the state 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.820
 we remove 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.500
 standardizing all soil analysis techniques to be in 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.340
 consonant with the rest of the country everything we do is immersed in the 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.099
 environmental policy of the provincial government 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.569
 the creation of natural resource reserves 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.690
 It is the first step in decision making 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.770
 one million hectares protected in the impenetrable Chaco 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.919
 make up a reserve of fauna and flora, native animals in danger of 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:09.839
 extinction 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.259
 native forest under control and optimization of the use 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.339
 with the support of specialists 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:17.330
 they insure 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.099
 the rational handling 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.099
 of our 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.099
 natural wealths 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.070
 the inhabitants of Chaco
