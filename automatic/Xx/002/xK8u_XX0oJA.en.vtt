00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.630
 a wonderful morning at noon 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.460
 or 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.420
 Pittsburgh is so early at 6am 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.400
 were 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.840
 I thought I'll show you 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.570
 how a white gives the account srecko 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.750
 works and is built that comes 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.070
 to me with scripts this would be here 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.680
 she was very nice 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.180
 maybe it is not complicated 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.490
 then let's start 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.390
 so if you want to get a picture 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.379
 first you always have the command and 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.120
 type and this says so to speak that 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.010
 program or in the game 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.170
 I want something on a taste 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.330
 prove afterwards comes the keys 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.390
 assignment and after that comes already 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.280
 the general command key assignment 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.830
 For me I have a beet selected 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.820
 the internet would be that shows up here 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.159
 quite well, I have in the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.940
 Descriptions which we take 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:06.020
 Let's take space space and enter 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.549
 then we come to the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.799
 instruction in the general first comes the 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.830
 command that means we want one 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.909
 buy weapon and then the weapons 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.009
 designation let's take the ak 47 and 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.530
 already we can on the space button resp 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.750
 on the space bar we can then the ak 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.100
 Is buying 70 if you can jump around 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.990
 another thing 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.109
 how do I do that now that I am on the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.210
 same button also the m4 for example 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.570
 It could also be quite easy to buy one 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.170
 semicolon then you skin again the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.420
 example a lot out and then m41 year 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.280
 Same as the weapons designation I have 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.829
 Of course I have chosen you too 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.960
 even in the description and the 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.869
 It was actually a script 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.460
 simply set up you have to be simple 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.700
 stop to see how it is you 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.390
 best fits that was mine I am the one 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.390
 wind in
