00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.250
 him and it's of course to wolter 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.380
 dsl use of withdrawn types

 Twenty-fifth negative picture of a 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.539
 great photographers and walter meetings 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.399
 actually responsible for it 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.500
 but not at the same time is also one 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.480
 new charity employee extreme 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.160
 Great finds the yes like to appeal 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.320
 if he does not always this 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.010
 daydreams would have looked like the whole thing 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.010
 you can see that here 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:24.930
 where are they even though I wrote in 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.420
 I am out of one yesterday 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.210
 helicopter jumped into the sea and me 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.810
 have now in the healing I've fought 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.869
 ever tell people dream a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.860
 material I've really done 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.659
 the trailer had me already extreme 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.520
 packed and I was very much on the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.320
 Film pleased and disappointed me too 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.570
 not ben stiller is often like that 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.950
 ulknudel on the way here he meets one 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.750
 completely different tone 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.090
 the movie is very melancholic 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.189
 a lot of feeling and it is such a 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.049
 Just heat when you see the movie 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.880
 He also plays really good 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.350
 takes a great evolution the figure 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.540
 So he has changed 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.710
 itself is staged really well already 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.840
 crazy that you yourself 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.399
 but staging must be service to order 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.750
 the best acting performance 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.550
 to deliver his career 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.050
 but at the same time kristen wiig the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.910
 is just as kind as you would like 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.680
 take in the arm and all day 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.630
 dream things are so cool 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.760
 clean cut you do not always 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.650
 real that is now a daydream it will be 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.690
 cut incredibly cool 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.460
 I really have to say hat off that is 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.080
 a really great movie became the 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.030
 But film has become so great too 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.590
 because he has a really strong soundtrack 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.540
 So the music worked but 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.310
 just the chart hits you 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.680
 be interspersed so of monsters in 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.780
 meckenhausen trailer is also in the movie 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.400
 but also the camera work 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.350
 So not only the interfaces, too 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.390
 The camera works just looks 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.310
 great cinema he is at some 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.850
 put excessive exaggerated but has one 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.830
 great message and brings the same way 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.270
 lovingly stupid on the canvas 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.500
 these are just his moments where you 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.140
 says clearly that it is now very much 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.600
 Realistic what fits easily and that 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.490
 I like is very much of the movie at the end 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.700
 a bit too sweet sweet I would have 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.960
 like to see a cooler end this is 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.010
 so have a bit so here 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.140
 Nonetheless, it is a very 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.060
 emotional film great performance of ben 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.430
 quieter and you could not do that 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.720
 Start better than that will be amazing 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.610
 your life of the world summit 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.040
 who live the amazing life the word 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.440
 Today, watch the creative cinema 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.060
 like it will find great my camera 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.190
 you are not riding like that 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.320
 always knows great cuts but also 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.060
 just have a lot of heart in a movie 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.220
 want to be there then the amazing 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.750
 joie de vivre with you just right who 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.489
 should not look at the movie 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.560
 are the people who say if i have already 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.690
 that's how things are going in the direction of things 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.209
 But I would like to do it 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.830
 Some do not have to be sweet-sweet 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.209
 I do not like that and ben can quieter 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.040
 I do not like it then stays out of that 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.780
 Just film my personal outside 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.630
 rating for the amazing life of 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.650
 walter with those are strong in clearing of 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.690
 10 points 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.090
 ben stiller plays as well as long 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.500
 not anymore he is very emotional 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.180
 So the movie has become so 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.459
 emotionally won and great camera and 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.489
 Cut work is easy saustark 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.019
 eat all the way to become sweet 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.489
 Now what we could say negative 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.070
 but it's a great movie and that's why 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.650
 I get 9 out of 10 points 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.120
 that was my revolt midway from you 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.100
 I want to know what you are so yours 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.590

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.260
 also stick something for the 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.490
 advent calendar and at the same time 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.690
 I also have another prize game 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.210

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.590
 adventskalender I pack longboard 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.540

 not here but looks great looks 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.950
 but once a trailer purely so sees it 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.690

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.400

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.390

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.200
