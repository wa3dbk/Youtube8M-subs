00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.340
 hello to all and all these teams 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.930
 that we find ourselves in a new 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.500
 video 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.230
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.330
 to make a flag that finally move 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.039
 I will show you the commands I 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.920
 I do not want to do with you that it's 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.419
 that's long enough I wanted to make a 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.660
 filter up said himself with sir bresse 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.600
 but will have to use possible under sinus 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.140
 for the facts of vay him the stuffs 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.839
 have to rent on the server and umc if you 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.430
 go to the lobby there are flags 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.210
 which are well done I like the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.100
 fault movement 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.729
 sellal of idc flag girls price 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.680
 just show you how it works 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:59.000
 so I'm just going to stop this for 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.019
 avoid sailing so here we are 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.920
 since he plays counter strike 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:09.710
 there is a blister of huy tic since I have 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.900
 eight golden loops those who are 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.780
 put and who gets off thanks to that so 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.260
 I see the current down I put 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.220
 the air at the coordinates of blocks there and 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.810
 in bone game but restore it yesterday so 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.930
 the redstone powder for it works 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.340
 and then every time I do move 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.710
 in this recent yellow because I have 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.440
 needs to explain each time I 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.080
 for example here no earlier backup 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.150
 I put a powder there I am in friendship and 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.950
 it's for example there I can when 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.750
 I put a red stone there 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.370
 against the man 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.360
 it's pretty simple then there is need 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.680
 two clock 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.290
 I need two clubs since 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.909
 to go to the end otherwise it's not 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.560
 enough 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.720
 should be reviewed will be sent for 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.090
 finally had great ways very simple 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.420
 to have a single clock because 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.030
 two it's not well it's more of the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.380
 war inevitably by cons do not 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.970
 put to rite because otherwise the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.410
 cunt us 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.600
 more the goal is to have some 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.200
 fast so that it does not fall 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.530
 you see that it is not necessary that it turns 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.760
 here already that she has sometimes that we have 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.180
 the impression that it starts at all but 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.640
 so here and then it's very simple 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.800
 it's enough with cops so seems 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.610
 I would just like to open an ipad since 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.080
 to show you the order 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.610
 I will give I hope you will see 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.810
 well lecturer just a falling 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.360
 sand with coordinates so basic 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.650
 rather we have to actually put it going to be 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.170
 large nevertheless 0 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.480
 the height we do not care but otherwise you 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.610
 put spam rooms you have to put 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.410
 coordinates with spikes some 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.780
 thing so that are much more 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.740
 simple for example the middle of the block 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.740
 that's if you put for example 439 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.530
 without anything it will be equal to 439 points 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.160
 the 5 is what makes sure that 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.209
 you see it's in the middle actually this 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.190
 is not a good example 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:18.630
 I stop this slap there it's not at 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.800
 middle it should go 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.080
 here it is in the middle 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.730
 by cons there I have a fail you see 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.050
 that there is not in the rap after it 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.410
 could not be super nice 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.920
 flag I made sure on the 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.640
 others for example if you see one has 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.190
 moan dots here I put six years 43 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.730
 points 0 so that actually if I put 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.660
 earlier son here you see that the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.030
 blocks in fact often at the half of the mast 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.150
 like dying like blue everywhere she 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.370
 have not train and he learns so if 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.490
 if not that shifts from 0 to 2 years by 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.020
 here I hope you will not understand 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.990
 show you all the years and 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.550
 it's all the same just just show 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.780
 this one is an ash cop and in 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.070
 date ajmi a data 4 for the color 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.500
 tittley of gmi 35 riders of the allaine 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.080
 and in size but I'm 0 or not that 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.350
 did if I put an ox to see what 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:24.800
 I 'm going to see what it's like 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:27.210
 this gives a totally good Salleboeuf 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.000
 there in fact he did not like that I change 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.390
 it simply 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.730
 what the fuck u minecraft binds to death yes 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.890
 ok ok he actually they read all cross 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.500
 to spa but actually like that to this pony 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.900
 in this block he did not like here the wavy 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.730
 pop we get down but otherwise it's ok 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.740
 do you do you crazy ex ante who falls 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.910
 act as if you were taking sand 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.350
 as if you were taking ca you 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.840
 give up and in fact he'll stay 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.750
 downstairs and know how to stack up it takes 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.320
 especially not put his magnifying glass or m 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.310
 time 2 01 m in fact basic season the 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.260
 favorite game put it 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.570
 so here I hope you'll have 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.760
 I hope you like it and 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.760
 I say the same next
