00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.090
 you spend your life trying to 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.219
 respond to structures first we went 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.920
 to school after I hope to study 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.050
 race then work and finally it will be 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.869
 someone's dream almost never one's 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.640
 and when you did remember is the 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.410
 balance of your life you get to the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.900
 conclusion that the only thing he wanted 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.060
 will be happy and the night of the past 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.300
 Wednesday you had the possibility of 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.739
 do it but even so it's always going to 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.050
 appear that tells you that you are 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.629
 wrong that your plan is not the right one 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.760
 and perhaps for them those of the lives 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.430
 structured can be a good 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.350
 advice but not for us if you 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.330
 serves the recommendation here in 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.670
 go ahead when you have doubts if you are 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.470
 doing right or wrong just remember the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.239
 smile from the people around you the 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.790
 Last Wednesday night in Brazil 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.159
 just listen to people who love you 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.799
 people who speak to you from the heart and 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:04.809
 put a lot of madness what comes because 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:06.790
 the madness is just that it cures him like that 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.770
 who enjoys this moment and does not 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.469
 never forget those smiles the eyes 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.960
 Brilliant hugs with your friends and 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.509
 always remember that you could believe in 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.520
 the perfect day this will be the cause of 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.890
 all of those who said no 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.320
 they wanted to know nothing more about this team is 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.969
 time to forgive that many times not 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.759
 the shirt or the history will be respected 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.429
 neither the fans nor the present those who 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.109
 they had always today they must continue because 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.240
 it is better that everyone speak of union than 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.969
 be the theme on the street in the bars in 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.149
 the newspapers although many of them hurt this 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.759
 joy think how would this be if not 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.329
 outside so you imagine you had nothing 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.179
 and this empty sure this better though 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.079
 it hurts definitely it's better to walk 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.869
 as we walk 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.880
 there's some inner desire and there's a lot of 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.030
 proud to say when we were in the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.130
 worst I encourage you as the best for that 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.689
 Now the people on the street walk like 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.119
 crazy with the shirt proudly 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.249
 stamped on the skin and during these 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.200
 days there will be thousands of meetings where 

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:09.670
 steps will be filled a thousand times and it will be that 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.020
 anesthesia in the soul that is made 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.330
 necessary in these days 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.430
 wait to see you again and maybe it's 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.110
 true maybe they are right in what 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.530
 You said yourselves at the end of the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.960
 We have not won anything yet 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.790
 But on Wednesday when we saw them 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.310
 celebrating in a maracana in silence 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.620
 there a few meters from us 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.630
 We feel safe because we realized 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.060
 that they are capable of whatever and in 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.740
 those moments of celebration I think 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.900
 you also knew how to understand what 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.850
 it happened to us every time 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.630
 we leave life just to see them again 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.000
 and if it's true, they're not right 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.600
 we still do not win anything and it will be hard I know 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.450
 but so everything is worth it even so 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.340
 it's worth it to die one day and 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.010
 I will continue with this blind faith in all this 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.870
 team and in his coach by which 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.000
 I would give my skin to see them again 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.100
 play in these moments today the 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.560
 formality of your seat maybe hurts 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.170
 but it comforts to know that you are and that 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.000
 it hurts the desire I do not ask for results neither 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.100
 drinks today we will look at the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.620
 face to walk together for a dream 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.780
 giant we will return to the best of our 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.740
 history will come the greatest as 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.530
 we 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.840
 that we grew up admiring you and a child 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.880
 ask your father who is here the 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.910
 sir who directs that people want him 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.210
 There are so many surgeries seen, my son responds 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.610
 the father I did not even know your mother happened 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.100
 several years ago you did not even 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.320
 I was in the plans of my heart and I 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.780
 I came with your grandfather to see him and they broke me 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.180
 hands applauding him and there were many 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.520
 goals and loves and that night in coquimbo 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.620
 in that corner where I could not even 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.410
 see the arch I screamed the criminal 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.210
 championship I did not see it but I felt it and 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.800
 we turned around and I need a 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.890
 photograph to remind me of the 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.990
 details and so it will be in about 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.790
 years more when you remember the night of 2 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.280
 April at the maracana 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.950
 we danced without a shirt we were so happy 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.660
 embraced with everyone doing that 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.020
 the glory will lower me for once in my 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.720
 life and that man that ips in the bank my 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.880
 life is called just like you sold to your 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.620
 mother who does not know anything about soccer that 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.900
 Jose Luis went for an uncle that I from 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.940
 boy I loved a lot and that's why I put you 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.070
 that name because if I told you it was 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.639
 for a player I was going to get away with that from 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.669
 what 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.800
 always union always union and I did not want 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.990
 discuss at that moment when I had you 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.810
 in my arms feeling heat for that 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.180
 you are jose luis for him 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.430
 after the night of the new Wednesday 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.040
 last I have nothing left to say 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.020
 thanks thanks players thanks body 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.600
 technical and thanks to everyone who 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.040
 made this magical day possible it was because 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.630
 you who filled the heart of 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.190
 fan was for you that I grabbed a 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.290
 pencil and I started writing these 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.419
 Atrocities were you who 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.660
 they gave the glory in my head and that 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:02.260
 Now it's not going to stop I thank God 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.330
 for the triumph and for his existences is 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.240
 Copa Libertadores de America play a 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.120
 it was Spanish independent of the valley 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.639
 maybe today's is one of the last 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.500
 but maybe if this story is even better 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.500
 just this one just starting
