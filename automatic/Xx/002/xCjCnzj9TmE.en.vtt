knuckle for a regular rice - you would
stir<00:02:42.900> fry<00:02:44.120> I'll<00:02:45.120> measure<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.450> again

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.839 

perfect<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.980> let<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.280> two<00:02:50.430> inches<00:02:50.700> above

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
perfect so let the two inches above

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.839 
perfect so let the two inches above
where<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.569> rice<00:02:51.780> line<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.349> okay<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.640> water

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
where the rice line is okay so the water

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.170 
where the rice line is okay so the water
line<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.299> two<00:02:54.540> inches<00:02:54.780> above<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.079> rice<00:02:55.470> line

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
line is two inches above the rice line

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:06.110 
line is two inches above the rice line
so<00:02:57.180> we're<00:02:57.629> going<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> put<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.230> high<00:03:05.120> okay

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
so we're going to put it on high okay

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.750 
so we're going to put it on high okay
here<00:03:06.360> we<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:10.129> I'm<00:03:11.129> going<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.370> let<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.519> boil

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
for 30 minutes well you need the water

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.330 
for 30 minutes well you need the water
to<00:03:36.870> boil<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.079> little<00:03:37.170> bit<00:03:37.470> first<00:03:37.650> okay<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.069> it's

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
to boil a little bit first okay so it's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.509 
to boil a little bit first okay so it's
on<00:03:38.430> high<00:03:38.870> temperature<00:03:39.870> right<00:03:39.989> now<00:03:40.280> don't<00:03:41.280> put

on high temperature right now don't put

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.710 
on high temperature right now don't put
on<00:03:41.639> low<00:03:41.819> because<00:03:42.060> it'll<00:03:42.419> take<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.690> like
