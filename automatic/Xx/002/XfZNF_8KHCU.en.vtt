 involvement of the Ukrainian military 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.020
 since they say the plane flew out of the zone 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.140
 missile action 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.340

 comment on Russian data 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.000
 objective control or maybe 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.290
 there is simply nothing to say 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.049
 American Representative Link 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.290

 allegedly indicating movements 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.890
 missile weapons through Ukraine 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.930

 Red Army has long been controlled 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.299
 Ukrainian army only this photo 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.990
 book number three hundred and twelve 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.520

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.610
 following in the column of the Ukrainian army 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.610
 gentlemen, you mean to say that they shot 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.180
 well, then you will need an explanation 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.610
 from Kiev something was by the way said 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.130
 about the concentration of Russian troops on 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.070
 Russian-Ukrainian border 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.650
 c listen you generally know who 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.750
 who shoots at the Russian border 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.330
 side fixed 9 shelling 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.850
 Russian territory for June-July 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.750
 this year on our land broke 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.800
 Ukrainian tens shells and was conducted min 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.010
 aimed fire on border 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.610
 killed our citizens in Andrew Shulyat'ev 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.730
 he left three 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.830
 minor daughters a question if 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.930
 territory of the united states of america 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.870
 was fired upon adjacent territory 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.500
 and God forbid killed American 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.240
 citizen 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.790
 then to make connected to the account 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.480
 America think the answer is obvious 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.550
 we are responsible and 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.900
 restraint so it is completely understandable 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.640
 who provokes anyone at the border better 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.090
 pay attention to the constant shelling 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.120
 Donetsk and Lugansk missiles 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.640
 death of civilians and respond to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.050
 asked questions because it appeared 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.050
 already many new
