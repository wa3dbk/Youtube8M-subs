is<00:05:55.139> we're<00:05:55.229> gonna<00:05:55.289> bounce<00:05:55.650> between<00:05:56.099> those

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
is we're gonna bounce between those

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.249 
is we're gonna bounce between those
strings<00:05:56.550> as<00:05:56.729> we<00:05:56.879> walk<00:05:57.150> it<00:05:57.330> down<00:05:57.539> so<00:05:58.139> we're

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
strings as we walk it down so we're

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.710 
strings as we walk it down so we're
gonna<00:05:58.349> take<00:05:58.560> our<00:05:58.860> ring<00:05:59.580> finger<00:05:59.610> to<00:06:00.419> our<00:06:00.509> middle

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
gonna take our ring finger to our middle

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.689 
gonna take our ring finger to our middle
finger<00:06:01.110> move<00:06:01.650> that<00:06:01.889> down<00:06:02.190> so<00:06:02.400> we're<00:06:02.550> walking

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
finger move that down so we're walking

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.749 
finger move that down so we're walking
that<00:06:03.030> that<00:06:03.599> string<00:06:03.930> down<00:06:04.129> and<00:06:05.129> then<00:06:05.310> finally

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
that that string down and then finally

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.350 
that that string down and then finally
come<00:06:05.970> into<00:06:06.270> essentially<00:06:07.020> a<00:06:07.169> G<00:06:07.560> chord<00:06:08.360> relative

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
come into essentially a G chord relative

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.809 
come into essentially a G chord relative
to<00:06:09.479> the<00:06:09.569> capo<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.400> then<00:06:11.400> we're<00:06:11.490> gonna<00:06:11.580> play<00:06:11.789> a

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
to the capo and then we're gonna play a

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.270 
to the capo and then we're gonna play a
minor<00:06:12.180> of<00:06:12.449> that<00:06:12.599> so<00:06:12.840> here<00:06:13.770> let's<00:06:13.949> break<00:06:14.159> that

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
minor of that so here let's break that

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:29.240 
minor of that so here let's break that
down<00:06:14.340> with<00:06:14.610> strum<00:06:14.880> it<00:06:14.970> real<00:06:15.090> fast

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.150 

so<00:06:29.520> you<00:06:29.670> got<00:06:29.790> that<00:06:29.910> G<00:06:30.240> there<00:06:30.830> and<00:06:31.830> all<00:06:31.950> I'm

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
so you got that G there and all I'm

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.550 
so you got that G there and all I'm
doing<00:06:32.490> on<00:06:32.610> that<00:06:32.730> G's<00:06:33.060> I'm<00:06:33.330> taking<00:06:33.660> my<00:06:33.810> ring

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
doing on that G's I'm taking my ring

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.980 
doing on that G's I'm taking my ring
finger<00:06:34.980> in<00:06:35.130> my<00:06:35.280> pinky<00:06:35.700> and<00:06:35.910> I'm<00:06:36.600> keeping<00:06:36.780> on

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:11.110 

now<00:07:09.650> what<00:07:09.919> Shane<00:07:10.249> does<00:07:10.490> on<00:07:10.669> that<00:07:10.699> part<00:07:11.030> of<00:07:11.060> the

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 
song when we get to that minor if you'll

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.999 
song when we get to that minor if you'll
take<00:07:13.939> your<00:07:13.999> pointer<00:07:14.479> finger<00:07:14.840> and<00:07:15.020> press<00:07:15.800> it

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:19.999 
down on the on the third fret so instead

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:23.879 
down on the on the third fret so instead
of<00:07:20.060> leaving<00:07:20.240> it<00:07:20.419> open<00:07:20.930> you'll<00:07:21.560> do<00:07:21.830> that<00:07:22.039> first

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:23.889 
of leaving it open you'll do that first

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:41.840 
of leaving it open you'll do that first
so<00:07:24.889> it's<00:07:25.009> gonna<00:07:25.099> sound<00:07:25.340> like<00:07:25.460> this

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:41.850 

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.520 

and<00:07:42.090> that's<00:07:42.690> the<00:07:42.840> verse<00:07:42.990> that<00:07:43.020> goes<00:07:43.350> right

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:43.530 
and that's the verse that goes right

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.690 
and that's the verse that goes right
back

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:46.700 

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.580 

keeps<00:07:47.270> going<00:07:47.390> from<00:07:47.600> there<00:07:47.720> so<00:07:47.900> now<00:07:48.020> next<00:07:48.440> we're

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:48.590 
keeps going from there so now next we're

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.240 
keeps going from there so now next we're
going<00:07:48.710> to<00:07:48.770> talk<00:07:48.890> about<00:07:48.920> the<00:07:49.910> chorus
