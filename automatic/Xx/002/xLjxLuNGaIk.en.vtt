00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
right spin and I'm going to explain to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.370 
right spin and I'm going to explain to
you<00:01:24.280> why<00:01:24.490> by<00:01:25.149> hitting<00:01:25.390> this<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.899> one<00:01:26.049> ball<00:01:26.259> is

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
you why by hitting this the one ball is

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.870 
you why by hitting this the one ball is
obviously<00:01:26.680> going<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:26.950> go<00:01:27.070> straight<00:01:27.369> into<00:01:27.609> the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
obviously going to go straight into the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.779 
obviously going to go straight into the
side<00:01:28.090> pocket<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:29.140> two<00:01:29.380> ball<00:01:29.619> actually<00:01:30.490> comes

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
side pocket the two ball actually comes

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.630 
side pocket the two ball actually comes
off<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.560> it<00:01:32.799> goes<00:01:32.950> straight<00:01:33.130> into

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
off the one and it goes straight into

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.969 
off the one and it goes straight into
that<00:01:33.759> corner<00:01:34.149> pocket<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:35.229> four<00:01:35.560> shoots

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
that corner pocket the four shoots

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.039 
that corner pocket the four shoots
straight<00:01:36.219> across<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.969> the<00:01:37.090> side<00:01:37.329> the

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
straight across and to the side the

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.810 
straight across and to the side the
three<00:01:38.380> ball<00:01:38.619> is<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:38.950> trick<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.280> want<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.640> make

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
three ball is the trick you want to make

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.389 
three ball is the trick you want to make
because<00:01:40.359> by<00:01:40.899> hitting<00:01:41.079> the<00:01:41.259> three<00:01:41.500> ball<00:01:41.740> this

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
because by hitting the three ball this

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.639 
because by hitting the three ball this
direction<00:01:42.939> it<00:01:43.090> goes<00:01:43.210> glances<00:01:43.990> off<00:01:44.170> this<00:01:44.409> four

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
direction it goes glances off this four

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.889 
direction it goes glances off this four
ball<00:01:44.920> into<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.429> rail<00:01:45.609> and<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:46.420> will<00:01:46.539> just<00:01:46.719> keep

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
ball into the rail and it will just keep

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.440 
ball into the rail and it will just keep
going<00:01:47.140> straight<00:01:47.679> up<00:01:47.859> and<00:01:48.070> down<00:01:48.219> this<00:01:48.490> way<00:01:48.549> the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
going straight up and down this way the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.359 
going straight up and down this way the
only<00:01:49.869> way<00:01:50.020> you're<00:01:50.200> going<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.380> make<00:01:50.439> it<00:01:50.829> is<00:01:50.979> to

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
only way you're going to make it is to

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.609 
only way you're going to make it is to
hit<00:01:51.520> it<00:01:51.549> down<00:01:51.729> in<00:01:51.939> that<00:01:52.090> rail<00:01:52.329> and<00:01:52.689> have<00:01:53.380> some

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
hit it down in that rail and have some

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.370 
hit it down in that rail and have some
spin<00:01:54.039> left<00:01:54.880> spin<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.420> bring<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.719> over<00:01:55.960> here<00:01:55.990> and

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
spin left spin to bring it over here and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.560 
spin left spin to bring it over here and
because<00:01:56.829> the<00:01:57.100> way<00:01:57.219> billiards<00:01:57.670> works<00:01:57.939> the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
because the way billiards works the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.209 
because the way billiards works the
physics<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.289> is<00:01:59.469> it<00:01:59.710> really<00:01:59.920> works<00:02:00.100> like

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
physics of it is it really works like

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.520 
physics of it is it really works like
the<00:02:00.399> gear<00:02:00.579> effect<00:02:00.939> I<00:02:01.179> put<00:02:01.749> right<00:02:01.960> spin<00:02:02.289> on<00:02:02.409> the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
the gear effect I put right spin on the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.980 
the gear effect I put right spin on the
cue<00:02:02.740> ball<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:03.579> puts<00:02:03.850> left<00:02:04.149> spin<00:02:04.299> on<00:02:04.719> this

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
cue ball that puts left spin on this

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.749 
cue ball that puts left spin on this
three<00:02:05.289> so<00:02:05.649> when<00:02:05.829> that<00:02:05.950> three<00:02:06.249> ball<00:02:06.399> hits<00:02:06.579> that

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
three so when that three ball hits that

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.719 
three so when that three ball hits that
rail<00:02:06.999> it<00:02:07.270> shoots<00:02:07.659> across<00:02:08.080> left<00:02:08.460> over<00:02:09.460> into

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
rail it shoots across left over into

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.010 
rail it shoots across left over into
this<00:02:09.850> pocket<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.200> little<00:02:11.560> bit<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:11.860> low<00:02:12.040> right

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
this pocket so a little bit of low right

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.270 
this pocket so a little bit of low right
I'm<00:02:14.020> going<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.319> hit<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> third<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> three

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
I'm going to hit a third of the three

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.130 
I'm going to hit a third of the three
ball<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:17.110> watch<00:02:17.770> what<00:02:18.010> happens

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:45.890 

just<00:02:23.140> like<00:02:23.380> Willy<00:02:23.620> did<00:02:23.860> it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.959
