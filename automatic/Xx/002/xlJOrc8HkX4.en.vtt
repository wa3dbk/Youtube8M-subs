00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.640
 the few ballooning take place at the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.200

 tomorrow night will be the envy 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.530
 followed by the evening 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.700
 fireworks find us very much on their deck 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.159
 is the montgolfiade 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.630
 although today is not yet on the opening day 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.650
 I will be so busy now 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.939
 to vote in favor 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.770
 that's special to me 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.210
 start balloons and if after the start 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.950
 the balloons all back to the field 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.229
 come and dennis takes place without envy 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.179
 what are you waiting for now? 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.520
 next days so super balloon launches 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.469
 often good in the mornings and evenings 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.119
 fireworks and of course a lot 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.009
 fun and excitement for the people that that 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.219
 have not seen so often so what 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.479
 makes the monarchy nobility room 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.609
 so i just think if we have this 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.799
 whole situation so great that you look 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.030
 here, for example, sometimes the most 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.710
 meet somehow and then 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.729
 I think that has so 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.220
 this balance is special now in the 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.320
 next days the good weather is over 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.920
 to start that can be like already 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.050
 said are people from all over the world 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.950
 Among other things, we have a man out 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.209
 hit holland 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:20.630
 what they expect from it Montgolfiade 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.849
 Tomorrow may come young yes 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.620
 wonderful and what does it do for them 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.209
 Montgolfiade fell victim to 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:34.819
 yes, but not together and my show 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:38.420
 Pilots are just the highlight 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.700
 We come from Münster into the valley 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.700
 had last weekend more exactly yourself 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.060
 wears what you in the election campaign 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.010
 she rain tried everything and was only 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.099
 a little balloon glow from there 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.890
 towers and exactly the same fate has 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.940
 it's here waiting for me and you 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.810
 jürgen lutter the voice of 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.910
 Montgolfiade 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.160
 what they mean what else awaits us in 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.510
 the next day if we are behind now 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.799
 and then it looks natural today 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.109
 with the entry with the weather not so 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.109
 great but I promise all 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.790

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.980

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.709

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.900
 international montgolfiade experience something 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.459
 that's exactly what the montgolfiade does 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.870
 room years 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.940
 I think they've never been here and 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.850
 if you have never been here then you have to 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.319
 simply experience when the 200 balloons at 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.750
 a mass start up here 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.859
 is just a dreamlike atmosphere 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.030
 you have to experience that you can too 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.680
 which can not be described at all 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.870
 you might see in many pictures 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.940
 but you have to experience it live 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.560
 then everything is great atmosphere first 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.829

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.470

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.400
 if you like this festival mood 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.380
 Maybe someone else knows about rock 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.730

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.260
 festival mood are of course nothing 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.209
 Doing music gives a lot of live music 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.130
 Of course there is also nice cool 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.680

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.569

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.189
 that's just one character festival 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.569

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.629

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.130
