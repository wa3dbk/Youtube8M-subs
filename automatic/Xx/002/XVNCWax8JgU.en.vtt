time available in all variations hold

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
time available in all variations hold
down<00:00:52.469> when<00:00:52.739> triggering<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> final<00:00:53.640> hit<00:00:53.789> final

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
down when triggering the final hit final

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.299 
down when triggering the final hit final
hit<00:00:54.570> must<00:00:54.750> come<00:00:54.930> from<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> hell<00:00:55.620> which

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
hit must come from what the hell which

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.099 
hit must come from what the hell which
is<00:00:56.640> his<00:00:57.030> x-ray<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> like<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> Jason<00:01:00.539> Voorhees

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
is his x-ray so like the Jason Voorhees

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
is his x-ray so like the Jason Voorhees
one<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.559> guessing<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> final<00:01:02.730> actual

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
one I'm guessing that the final actual

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.660 
one I'm guessing that the final actual
hit<00:01:03.359> must<00:01:03.930> come<00:01:04.199> from<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.129> they'll<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.580> when

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
hit must come from what they'll do when

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:36.440 
hit must come from what they'll do when
the<00:01:05.760> lowers<00:01:06.119> health<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:07.170> low<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.619> positive
