00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.620
 hello we are in column microenterprises 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.390
 and for us it is very important that 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.119
 let's know how we should proceed in a 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.369
 emergency case 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:15.159
 first let's know what is the glasses is the 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:17.080
 implementing agency and 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:21.430
 support in everything concerning the 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.110
 occupational health program hand 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.540
 by the occupational health coordinator 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.490
 and the emergency brigade the members 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.410
 of the group are responsible for carrying 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.300
 out all scheduled activities 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.539
 Finally, the development of the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.289
 occupational health 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:42.699
 the brigades are the sic and emergencies of 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:45.489
 fires and first aid that I have 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.499
 I fear the emergency committee that is 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.089
 a group of people who make up the 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.489
 strategic support plan 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.229
 emergency should be conformed by 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.399
 people whose position guarantees in 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.399
 decision capacity 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.500
 in our bank plan and being the 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.360
 level that we must perform before a 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.820
 emergency is taken into account 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.440
 threats and spectra expected as well 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.330
 as the responsibilities that the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.110
 various components of the organization 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.869
 they must assume in each specific case that 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.070
 we must immediately suspend those who 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.380
 they are one hundred 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.899
 obey us the voice demand of who 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.149
 directs the evacuation given the alarm of 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.820
 evacuation set up in the 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.530
 less time possible without running avoiding 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.690
 the cries and the exclamations of 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.509
 lead to the exercise planning where 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.940
 you find we want to read only your 600 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.490
 most useful personal 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.530
 legs colombia follow the routes of 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.530
 evacuation and a world of taxes comes 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.310
 and we have two types of signals 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.310
 when I hear the next sound 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.540
 just once is a warning signal 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.100
 when you hear the same sound twice 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.100
 it's an evacuation signal 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.280
 and it's a fire power to the console 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.640
 that can be extremely dangerous 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.830
 for living beings 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.930
 replacement or license may produce 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.390
 death usually by inhalation of 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.050
 smoke or due to fading 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.520
 with her 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.430
 subsequently burn in degrees that 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.850
 we must do keep calm 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.450
 I screamed for a thousand points can cause a 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.330
 generalized panic look for fire extinguisher more 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.310
 close and try to combat the if 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.280
 does not know how to handle the fire extinguisher 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.319
 someone who can do it for you 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.150
 if force is the only way out 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.520
 allowing the flame is not hot 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.530
 before enabling so is the most 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.010
 It is probable that there may be another 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.260
 side of the lot in case the game 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.720
 destroy the realities do not despair 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.470
 and get in place more seconds and 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.720
 wait to be displaced and there is only one 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.690
 that is as close as possible to the floor 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.209
 while so is the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.290
 nose and mouth with a rag to be 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.170
 possible if your clothes catch fire do not run 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.090
 and from the pine to 1,009 slowly from 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.940
 possible you cover with a blanket for 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.710
 turn off the neck do not waste time 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.450
 looking for objects 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.090
 after immediately what is the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.860
 sky 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.860
 the evacuation staff 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.599
 first aid are techniques that are 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.159
 apply first to save the life of 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.980
 a person who has suffered an accident 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.650
 and then to prevent complications or 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.950
 give you the most 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.019
 what should we do to keep calm 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.569
 quickly see the place to detect 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.260
 if there is any danger evaluating the 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.299
 situation 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.519
 this means to see that merida is 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.980
 find in a safe place and not to be 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.250
 so ask for help to put it in a 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.250
 place 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.070
 ask for help immediately at the number 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.900
 emergencies asterisk 1 2 3 in case of 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.360
 that there are several injured is due 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.709
 attend first to the most serious injured is 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.870
 the one who does not breathe 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.600
 he has hemorrhage or has lost with 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.920
 they develop the wounded's clothes with 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.260
 In order to improve their conditions 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.150
 breathe all well injured is 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.920
 consciously ask what happened to him 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.470
 because it hurts and there are those who should warn 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.780
 of your relative in case of fractures not 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.910
 move injured especially if you have 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.580
 suspected skull fracture column 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.010
 vertebral or neck should not be given anything 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.110
 to eat or life of injured 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.820
 next we will find the numbers 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.720
 that we should always keep in mind 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.720
 an emergency situation
