Chinese knockoff but I definitely want

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.189 
Chinese knockoff but I definitely want
to<00:00:55.800> check<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.460> how<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.640> works<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:58.079> going

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
to check out how it works so just going

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.220 
to check out how it works so just going
to<00:00:58.260> compare<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> two

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
to compare the two

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:08.899 
to compare the two
just<00:01:01.230> grab<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.469> led<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:05.479> here<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.909> LED

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
just grab the led so here is the LED

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.450 
just grab the led so here is the LED
itself<00:01:09.260> okay

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
itself okay

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.750 
itself okay
nicely<00:01:12.180> made<00:01:12.710> looks<00:01:13.710> very<00:01:14.100> very<00:01:14.310> similar<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
nicely made looks very very similar to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.940 
nicely made looks very very similar to
the<00:01:15.030> Marineland<00:01:16.189> single<00:01:17.189> bright<00:01:18.770> pretty<00:01:19.770> much

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the Marineland single bright pretty much

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
the Marineland single bright pretty much
made<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> same<00:01:20.520> exact<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:21.350> have<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
made the same exact way have a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.929 
made the same exact way have a
Marineland<00:01:22.680> obvious<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.430> could<00:01:23.580> compare<00:01:23.790> it's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
Marineland obvious we could compare it's

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.640 
Marineland obvious we could compare it's
a<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.119> bit<00:01:24.210> smaller<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.720> could<00:01:25.229> kind<00:01:25.619> of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
a little bit smaller but could kind of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.020 
a little bit smaller but could kind of
get<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> idea<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:28.590> same<00:01:28.829> thing<00:01:29.100> there's<00:01:29.790> no

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
get the idea the same thing there's no

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.060 
get the idea the same thing there's no
difference<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> sort<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.869> besides<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.439> wiring

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
difference to sort of besides the wiring

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.780 
difference to sort of besides the wiring
as<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.490> here<00:01:35.490> believe<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.729> or

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
as you see here and here believe it or

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.340 
as you see here and here believe it or
not<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.720> way<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> set<00:01:37.290> up

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
not I like I like the way this is set up

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.719 
not I like I like the way this is set up
more<00:01:38.130> than<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> actual<00:01:38.610> Marineland<00:01:40.610> say<00:01:41.610> it's

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
more than the actual Marineland say it's

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.789 
more than the actual Marineland say it's
got<00:01:42.509> pretty<00:01:42.720> much<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.930> same<00:01:43.140> buttons<00:01:43.530> got<00:01:43.710> an

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
got pretty much the same buttons got an

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.460 
got pretty much the same buttons got an
on/off<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.490> same<00:01:45.390> side<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:45.899> same<00:01:46.200> legs

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
on/off here same side as here same legs

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.929 
on/off here same side as here same legs
the<00:01:46.890> only<00:01:47.070> thing<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.399> these<00:01:47.729> legs<00:01:48.119> are<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.720> lot

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
the only thing is these legs are a lot

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.020 
the only thing is these legs are a lot
flimsier<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.720> tell<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:53.579> pull<00:01:53.909> out

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
flimsier as you tell this can pull out

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
flimsier as you tell this can pull out
it's<00:01:54.710> better<00:01:55.710> built<00:01:56.270> but<00:01:57.270> performance<00:01:58.170> wise<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's better built but performance wise I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.690 
it's better built but performance wise I
don't<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.829> exactly<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> difference

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
don't know exactly what the difference

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.480 
don't know exactly what the difference
