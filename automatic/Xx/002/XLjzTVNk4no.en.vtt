00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 in which there is an intolerance with the score 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.240
 in the game they are worrying 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.010
 above all not to make points to the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.870
 opponents that two things are here 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:17.940
 I get the first ones or you get to the other one 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:20.400
 according to the taste looked 100,000 I do not know 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.109
 if it was open like this, then from this 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.420
 they came when he opened the demo a 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.880
 getting lost are phone calls you can 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.619
 he already thinks we are already ed 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.730
 here indeed it has been opened 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.420
 we immediately decided to take the hello line 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:44.340
 they are talking about why he still takes it 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.899
 to ancona and companions that teacher who 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.059
 lighting techniques 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.059
 the index for the soccer jersey 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.780
 captain 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.000
 well if you quantify it particular but then 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.949
 collapses are not six room intends 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.370
 bricolla of effect because they are there 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.689
 barrels of affection is good technique 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.939
 no, first of all we need to know 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.380
 when and how much effect 1 ha 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.820
 potentially in the annoyance 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.460
 because you can play with maximum 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.770
 of the effect that the best and you can 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.630
 have fixed points of beats that one 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.900
 you try according to the effect some a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.880
 a test is made, neither more nor less 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.830
 how no it was probably down there 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.580
 call while he gives some 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.930
 indication 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.869
 hello hello this is meanwhile for 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.329
 let's say that beginners would be good 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.150
 a certain smattering, let's not say that in 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.130
 this angle starting from the corner 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.780
 with maximum effect then it depends 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.990
 from player to player the maximum 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.689
 of the effect you beat on the stamp there 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.939
 arrives but wholeness 10 let's say we do it 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.939
 10 10 and go for red 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.909
 then it obviously depends on the Italians 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.560
 if the name bread obviously knowing 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.950
 which makes this trajectory this effect 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.259
 here we obviously rule and clear that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.830
 if we are a little further in, we will 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.270
 It keeps 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.880
 send us the same parallels in 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.930
 practice never change the effect 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.990
 the other system would be to 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.670
 beat without effect that we say that a 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.250
 more complicated, however, it allows for many 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.810
 positions to go to defense one 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:29.940
 beautiful defenses which is much more 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:33.060
 convenient games if you play this 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.160
 beautiful of the effects if you go to happen 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.780
 already comes after the vigil in this one 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.640
 direction of the brig then doing i 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.320
 shine if you don't do it you measure yourself but leave 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.300
 a kick responds to the opponent 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.360
 vice versa if you play easy batting 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.090
 you can always do so by not playing 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.040
 joke I can get the skittles and the 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.530
 mine I go in extreme defense bringing it in 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.459
 this position looks and is very much 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.150
 more productive therefore it is worth without 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.400
 the effect if there are function positions 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.800
 that it would be better to play it without a joke 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.950
 effect or in other positions when it is 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.050
 on the other side it is preferable to play it 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.330
 of effect maybe bring to our in 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.310
 center there are many many techniques 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.890
 let's face it theories are many then 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.500
 at the end of a theory or another 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.850
 important that you try to defend yourself 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.769
 in the best possible way possibly 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.600
 to realize also water anyway for 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.480
 to be able to fulfill the demand of the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.100
 our friend at home if we do one 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.810
 trajectory of an found effect 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.269
 at corner 1 or a beginner, try 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.060
 the maximum effect it has and if 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.190
 so can classes after the jokes as well 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.110
 many numbers have numbers 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.500
 sui answers on the short and on the long 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:52.019
 yet I shelter it, deserving the arrival like 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:54.720
 you know but the juice is the one from the corner e 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.250
 yes pass answer can also be that a 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.570
 beginner have not have that 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.370
 quantity to effect that we have 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.410
 maybe it stays in more inside 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.570
 say talking more to 9 numbers and 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.680
 instead of ten or eleven maybe red 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.630
 but always finds 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.790
 so he looked at the marble that is 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.470
 finds in that trajectory enough 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.750
 then with the an important thing la 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.180
 strength of a thing to friends at home today 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.330
 and I was lucky and it was 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.750
 there are those who taught me a system 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:23.160
 unbelievable this clearly not yes 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.100
 can explain why it would take only 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.500
 very frame however really frames 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.050
 practically say you'll be able to shut down right 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.990
 such a theory seems easy 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.880
 vice de sando was difficult to think of 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.310
 it makes sense the night he didn't sleep in a 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.200
 hotel in rimini success giu 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.450
 I went outside and this came to me 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.090
 same practically in a but we can 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.550
 mention of it home but I split 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.039
 billiards in many face but we are a 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.160
 example I am very practical to divide 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:56.760
 let's say this could be 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.099
 very well understand this position 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.130
 this position we could use 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.300
 this piece here like a billiard table 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.740
 celebrate this is a billion then 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.760
 this is another track when 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.099
 biliardino 4 case the ten one are two 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.599
 then there are three 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.090
 here is a true that we go into 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.010
 consider this billiard table here if 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.680
 someone from home knows the system of 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.760
 diamonds from this corner of billiards 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.530
 who come 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.270
 I find this contrary to the 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.740
 center of the shore at the site of the 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:33.280
 right of course that would be the 40 I do not 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.780
 I do nothing but do 50 40 10 I should 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:41.230
 make the ball of 4 and possibly 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.820
 some beryl if I only did the 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.440
 pallino da cose but I go with one 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.210
 certain tranquility on which that is 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.070
 otherwise I could have some t of 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.610
 call risk of extremes 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.960
 because he spoke at this point me 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.220
 show as you did 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.320
 I want to see all that he finds in 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.169
 difficulty for all no I try a 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.430
 dinho that I like I had the pleasure 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:05.290
 to think of times but the thing 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.850
 engaged for very very difficult 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.770
 actually these were enough 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.010
 difficult this ungrateful that I should 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.680
 do with the two marbles 5 sides with 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.960
 conquers in practice making 5 cues 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.460
 bilile business with my business in 35 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.970
 check the other side and make the ball 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.169
 from four, that is, to time almost answers 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.120
 cross 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.120
 let's see in practice granted 10
