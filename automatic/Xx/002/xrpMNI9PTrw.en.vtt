00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello to all and we all 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.750
 found today on good beach the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.210
 new game launched by supercell so we 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
 can see that praises the houlala 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.219
 yes it's been long enough that I do not 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.219
 come to my village have only hope 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:26.220
 that's what it was waiting for I improve the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.670
 Stern mortar up mortar level 3 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 parties so I played a little bit on 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.100
 rebound beach 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.090
 it seems very good after I'm not 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.320
 sure ben we can not improve that 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.600
 is useless I pass on that all 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.700
 features are very important 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.649
 and serve for something not so 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.160
 you see what I mean by 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.340
 example you say no it's great 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.980
 important that's all that's the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.309
 same principle of the game but for example 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.770
 when we cut a mangrove it does not 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:10.799
 give no embarrassment finally not too much who 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.510
 gives us kind of humor so the wood 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.130
 Well, it's going to be super important in 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.509
 the game but could like give 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.270
 something else what I find 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.950
 that it's a good idea to therefore in the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.409
 boiler room to have done that because that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.580
 brought some renewal a few 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:31.530
 not to be able to have a little more 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.000
 nathan louis theory who are the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.790
 village that is first since the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.500
 first day so we can see here is a 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.950
 maxi village almost it looks like that 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.530
 so it does not look so good if I 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.090
 then say that on the spot to the clan I'm going 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.750
 not tell you is what you think 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.229
 in the comments but I'm not 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.689
 born there is a trick that tilt on this game 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.090
 after the attacked system excellent and 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.280
 where I think of myself I expect a lot of 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.590
 this game at the level of the updates of the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.879
 features for added it's by 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.410
 example that the clan gauge I came there 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.730
 a year after its release, it is certain that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.900
 early it had to look a little like that 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.720
 but 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.159
 I'm waiting for it's still 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.260
 mount a minimum in village so that 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:25.140
 when these new updates happen 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.430
 down I'm not level 10 what's there I 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.150
 am level nine so normally I 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.379
 do not be level 10 so we'll see 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:43.519
 a little forbid not wait 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:43.519
 excuse me up central basin defended the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:03:01.920
 blond angel can get crystals 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:05.420
 free my brief and the rebroadcast is 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.840
 unfortunately not available 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.609
 so that too is a big flaw in these 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.879
 games that I really find that the aero 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.220
 spread by the slow down not leave to the 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.389
 after a while 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.220
 frankly I would like a lot of great 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.889
 dirty corrects know that it never been 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.989
 corrected to this pc it's not much 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.379
 but me it bothers me personally 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.829
 after 0.2 chieur and everything is not great 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.840
 important but me it annoys me so I 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.090
 think I'm going to do a little 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.739
 attack after seven video on ben beach 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.780
 and I will mail it directly 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.269
 after this video to show you a 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.190
 little style of attacked the tax will 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.599
 commented I will think she will be 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.159
 commentary 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.260
 so we meet again for the next 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.099
 video commented secular and subscribes 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.430

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.430
