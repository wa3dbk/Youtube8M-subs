 the average time 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.530
 I worked 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.820
 let's get better 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.860
 the main bet for the night

 I do not believe this closed the store have denied four rounds in the ball 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.319
 what can not be interpreted 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.319
 was left behind by the virus 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:15.039
 the state case 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.989
 from time to time but had high

 according to the reports of cases also with seven 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.989
 the name indicates that it was right the psychological shougang also 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.199
 to these the secretary if I win I only have two factories our annoying 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.199
 to produce preserves for cafu france 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.629
 with a ford in the united states 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.299
 structured 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.399
 That's what we do, my job and that job. 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:57.149
 if they do so in this way with this race of life of this quality these 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:01.169
 and certifications the product and you go from 20 to 30 camacho that the coconut tree 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.259
 in every area 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.419
 Juliana Pereira 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.219
 unlikely 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:33.219
 is the pioneer 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.150
 sustainable forest management plan 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.279
 the myth as it is observed in the 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.709
 the operation was in relation to this genre of production 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.860
 I thought 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.899
 has a great advantage in the hand 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:56.319
 the palm heart 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.519
 Basque for 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.890
 because it has a biological advantage faults 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:04.509
 which he preferred 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.559
 but he is not a raffle drawn in the contest 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.409
 and how our people have 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.159
 those of several 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.339
 is well pulled several puppies right 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:16.749
 so you know you cut 1 1 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.799
 in fact now has three four adds that the monolugar 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.729
 so much more was possible because it was much more 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:28.979
 What the teacher? 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.480
 over the years 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.539
 and with the diffusion duke 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.189
 of açaí pulp 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:38.219
 Brazil in the rest of Brazil brasília 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.899
 in rio de janeiro-são paulo the student who does not have a drinking bar 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:43.919
 acai juice 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.490
 are present in the application is this 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.349
 they would have even more recent 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.279
 this increase 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:52.639
 considerable 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.819
 production and consumption of açaí pulp 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.530
 caused that today the main work of the hut in the foot interior 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.210
 to produce fruit and palm heart became the consul products 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.159
 it is a consequence 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.740
 of the management necessary to meditate the production 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.780
 moniz of the fruit yesterday a list the palm heart is something that in some communities 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.159
 riverside 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:22.289
 to three four five generations therefore develop a specific ways forms 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.509
 traditional areas of manaus and what we perceive today 30 to 50 years after 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.209
 an extraction of the use of these resources the landscape is extra conserved is the 

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:35.830
 areas with protected forest therefore demonstrating over the latter 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.739
 natural Austrians in a sustainable way 

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:43.819
 is to improve the loss of life that protects natural ecosystems, so 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.009
 leaving is a productive chain that has developed in Para and has helped 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.059
 local communities and improve their living conditions at the same time 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.330
 time there is forest 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.180
 I do not know if there are many other examples in Brazil and abroad. 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.539
 where the caboclo riverside is a local inhabitant who discovered the way 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.800
 to make sustainable management, that is, the company 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.800
 I will delegate to a third party 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.050
 in the process that the cable pm
