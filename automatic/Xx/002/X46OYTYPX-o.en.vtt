now<00:03:28.850> what<00:03:29.000> do<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.120> think<00:03:29.330> of<00:03:29.450> good<00:03:29.600> trolling

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
now what do you think of good trolling

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.600 
now what do you think of good trolling
speed<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.440> day<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.920> day<00:03:30.980> out<00:03:31.100> what<00:03:31.489> do<00:03:31.550> you

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
speed is day in and day out what do you

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.100 
speed is day in and day out what do you
what<00:03:31.760> do<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:31.880> think<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.239> range<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.720> for<00:03:32.930> good

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
what do you think the range is for good

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.550 
what do you think the range is for good
cold

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
cold

well<00:03:33.680> good<00:03:33.980> coho<00:03:34.400> fishing<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:34.880> certainly<00:03:35.239> is

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
well good coho fishing is certainly is

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.410 
well good coho fishing is certainly is
faster<00:03:36.019> than<00:03:36.260> chinook<00:03:37.100> fishing<00:03:37.459> so<00:03:37.850> I<00:03:37.880> like<00:03:38.390> to

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
faster than chinook fishing so I like to

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.410 
faster than chinook fishing so I like to
go<00:03:38.690> about<00:03:39.019> three<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.519> three<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:40.910> half<00:03:41.090> miles

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
go about three to three and a half miles

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.690 
go about three to three and a half miles
an<00:03:41.660> hour<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:42.200> think<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.890> they<00:03:43.040> like<00:03:43.310> speed<00:03:43.640> and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
an hour I think that they like speed and

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.270 
an hour I think that they like speed and
a<00:03:44.060> little<00:03:44.269> bit<00:03:44.390> more<00:03:44.570> speed<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.260> important<00:03:46.010> if

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
a little bit more speed is important if

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.490 
a little bit more speed is important if
you're<00:03:46.430> not<00:03:46.580> catching<00:03:46.910> typically<00:03:47.900> feeding<00:03:48.350> up

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
you're not catching typically feeding up

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.100 
you're not catching typically feeding up
will<00:03:49.010> do<00:03:49.160> more<00:03:49.370> good<00:03:49.430> than<00:03:49.940> slowing<00:03:50.600> down<00:03:50.750> with

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
will do more good than slowing down with

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.600 
will do more good than slowing down with
now<00:03:51.560> earlier<00:03:52.010> in<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.160> day<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.400> were<00:03:52.580> talking

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
now earlier in the day you were talking

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.610 
now earlier in the day you were talking
about<00:03:52.970> doing<00:03:53.299> turns<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.989> speeding<00:03:54.350> up<00:03:54.440> and

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
about doing turns and speeding up and

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.520 
about doing turns and speeding up and
slowing<00:03:54.769> down<00:03:55.160> what's<00:03:55.459> behind<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.850> well

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
slowing down what's behind that well

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.220 
slowing down what's behind that well
coho<00:03:57.530> are<00:03:57.890> very<00:03:58.370> reactive<00:03:58.790> fish<00:03:59.209> reacting<00:04:00.080> off

and of course that's the function of
this<00:04:04.090> flasher<00:04:05.090> is<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.600> make<00:04:05.750> them<00:04:05.959> think<00:04:05.989> that

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
this flasher is to make them think that

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.110 
this flasher is to make them think that
there's<00:04:06.590> another<00:04:06.860> brother<00:04:07.730> of<00:04:07.940> theirs

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.850 
getting a meal and so a change of pace
speeding<00:04:12.139> up<00:04:12.290> slowing

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
down making turns all of that makes them

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.849 
down making turns all of that makes them
