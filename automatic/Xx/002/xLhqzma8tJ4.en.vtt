bit of a bubble pop it okay and it's
going<00:02:47.859> to<00:02:47.950> go<00:02:48.099> down<00:02:48.370> about<00:02:48.849> there<00:02:49.530> take<00:02:50.530> your

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799

to<00:02:54.819> draw<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.239> little<00:02:55.389> end<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.319> this<00:02:56.500> okay<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.459> the

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
to draw a little end to this okay in the

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.119 
to draw a little end to this okay in the
propeller<00:02:58.090> is<00:02:58.689> going<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.079> be<00:02:59.200> very<00:02:59.500> simple<00:03:00.099> for

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
propeller is going to be very simple for

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.610 
propeller is going to be very simple for
this<00:03:00.459> we're<00:03:01.299> going<00:03:01.419> to<00:03:01.510> draw<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.959> tiny<00:03:02.230> little

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
this we're going to draw a tiny little

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.500 
this we're going to draw a tiny little
bit<00:03:02.919> there<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.840> then<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:04.870> nice<00:03:05.200> long<00:03:08.849> okay<00:03:09.849> then

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
bit there and then a nice long okay then

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.089 
bit there and then a nice long okay then
about<00:03:10.840> here<00:03:11.879> we're<00:03:12.879> going<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.239> draw<00:03:13.480> a

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
about here we're going to draw a

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.800 
about here we're going to draw a
rectangle<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:17.680> that

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
rectangle like that

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.729 
rectangle like that
one<00:03:19.810> two<00:03:20.729> three<00:03:21.729> four<00:03:22.060> okay<00:03:22.409> and<00:03:23.409> then<00:03:23.560> you're

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
one two three four okay and then you're

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.729 
one two three four okay and then you're
going<00:03:23.889> to<00:03:23.949> make<00:03:24.129> it<00:03:24.459> like<00:03:24.659> so<00:03:25.659> it's<00:03:25.959> done<00:03:26.290> they

going to make it like so it's done they

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.770 
going to make it like so it's done they
all<00:03:26.769> start<00:03:27.310> at<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.459> same<00:03:27.549> bit<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.479> then

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
all start at the same bit and then

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.009 
all start at the same bit and then
extend<00:03:29.379> slightly<00:03:29.799> no<00:03:30.669> rubbing<00:03:31.090> out<00:03:31.269> need<00:03:31.750> for

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
extend slightly no rubbing out need for

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.439 
extend slightly no rubbing out need for
this<00:03:32.169> one<00:03:32.440> okay<00:03:32.889> it's<00:03:33.519> easy<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:34.090> do<00:03:34.209> without

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
this one okay it's easy to do without

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:39.860 
this one okay it's easy to do without
guidelines<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:37.409> it's<00:03:38.409> quite<00:03:38.620> fun<00:03:38.919> one<00:03:39.099> to<00:03:39.280> draw

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
guidelines so it's quite fun one to draw

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.420 
guidelines so it's quite fun one to draw
okay<00:03:40.870> then<00:03:41.229> for<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.620> one<00:03:41.889> you're<00:03:42.190> going<00:03:42.340> to

like a bit bit like that and this is

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.099 
like a bit bit like that and this is
going<00:04:09.189> to<00:04:09.400> be<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.669> wheel<00:04:09.879> this<00:04:10.569> ain't<00:04:10.959> gonna

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
going to be the wheel this ain't gonna

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.860 
going to be the wheel this ain't gonna
come<00:04:11.439> down<00:04:11.799> and<00:04:12.069> bit<00:04:12.639> halfway<00:04:12.939> between<00:04:13.419> them

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
come down and bit halfway between them

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.460 
come down and bit halfway between them
two<00:04:14.139> you're<00:04:14.859> going<00:04:15.009> to<00:04:15.069> draw<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.310> little<00:04:15.579> bubble

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
two you're going to draw a little bubble

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.979 
two you're going to draw a little bubble
okay<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.919> then<00:04:18.159> it's<00:04:19.060> gonna<00:04:19.269> join<00:04:19.599> it<00:04:19.810> there

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
okay and then it's gonna join it there

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.519 
okay and then it's gonna join it there
then<00:04:20.799> about<00:04:21.099> a<00:04:21.459> bit<00:04:21.849> between<00:04:22.029> so<00:04:22.630> you're<00:04:23.320> going

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:23.529 
then about a bit between so you're going

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.190 
then about a bit between so you're going
to<00:04:23.590> draw

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
to draw

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.730 
to draw
without<00:04:26.200> their<00:04:26.500> okay<00:04:27.930> also<00:04:28.930> if<00:04:29.170> you<00:04:29.350> want<00:04:29.590> to

do this you can draw like a little box
under<00:04:34.420> there<00:04:35.100> okay<00:04:36.100> which<00:04:36.370> might<00:04:36.640> just<00:04:36.910> make

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
under there okay which might just make

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.480 
under there okay which might just make
it<00:04:37.150> look<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.510> bit<00:04:37.780> more<00:04:37.960> realistic<00:04:38.440> okay<00:04:41.490> we're

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490

it look a bit more realistic okay we're
going<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:42.820> go<00:04:42.970> over<00:04:43.000> it's<00:04:43.600> nice<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.350> hard<00:04:44.590> at

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
going to go over it's nice and hard at

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.140 
going to go over it's nice and hard at
the<00:04:45.040> end<00:04:45.810> okay<00:04:46.810> right<00:04:47.260> don't<00:04:48.040> in<00:04:48.310> all<00:04:48.820> of<00:04:49.000> my

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
the end okay right don't in all of my

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.480 
the end okay right don't in all of my
drawings<00:04:49.630> I'm<00:04:49.900> going<00:04:50.140> to<00:04:50.230> do<00:04:50.350> it<00:04:50.530> lighter<00:04:51.040> at
