of<00:00:54.000> dark<00:00:54.210> mist<00:00:54.570> by<00:00:55.230> using<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.980> Baku<00:00:56.820> Dan<00:00:57.149> which

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
of dark mist by using a Baku Dan which

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.110 
of dark mist by using a Baku Dan which
which<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> little<00:00:59.489> elephant<00:00:59.640> thing

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
which is a like a little elephant thing

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.029 
which is a like a little elephant thing
and<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> attaches<00:01:00.930> itself<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.649> soft<00:01:01.829> like

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and if it attaches itself it's soft like

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.539 
and if it attaches itself it's soft like
a<00:01:02.070> blast<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:04.019> when<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.979> monster

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
a blast there but it just when a monster

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
a blast there but it just when a monster
has<00:01:05.700> over<00:01:06.060> no<00:01:06.360> overlay<00:01:06.840> unit<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.350> basically

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
has over no overlay unit it basically

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.289 
has over no overlay unit it basically
just<00:01:07.799> blows<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.610> destroys<00:01:08.880> itself<00:01:09.119> so

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
just blows up and destroys itself so

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.750 
just blows up and destroys itself so
it's<00:01:09.479> pretty<00:01:09.659> much<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> worst<00:01:10.260> version<00:01:10.710> or<00:01:10.890> like

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
it's pretty much a worst version or like

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.679 
it's pretty much a worst version or like
blast<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.790> but<00:01:14.790> he<00:01:14.939> negated<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.420> using

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
blast there and but he negated it using

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.740 
blast there and but he negated it using
the<00:01:15.720> thingies<00:01:16.409> effect<00:01:16.710> again<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.390> I<00:01:18.390> believe

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the thingies effect again and I believe

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.380 
the thingies effect again and I believe
he<00:01:18.900> uses<00:01:19.229> its<00:01:19.380> effects<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.340> release<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
he uses its effects to like release it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.050 
he uses its effects to like release it
and<00:01:21.540> which<00:01:22.259> sacrifice<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.159> brother

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and which sacrifice it I brother

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.609 
and which sacrifice it I brother
swordman<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.930> seeing<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.170> sauce<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.470> should

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
swordman was seeing the sauce we should

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.310 
swordman was seeing the sauce we should
I<00:01:25.710> see<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> very<00:01:26.310> card<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.659> think

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
I see a very card as it's like I think

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.749 
I see a very card as it's like I think
it's<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.920> cannot<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.280> destroyed<00:01:29.549> by

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it's like you cannot be destroyed by

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.140 
it's like you cannot be destroyed by
battle<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:31.250> think<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.340> was<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.939> this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
battle I think it was like one of this

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.789 
battle I think it was like one of this
one<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.630> negate<00:01:33.750> an<00:01:34.110> attack<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:36.799> so

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
one it can negate an attack and so

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
one it can negate an attack and so
basically<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> attack<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.150> thing

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
basically you have to attack this thing

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.230 
basically you have to attack this thing
three<00:01:40.020> times<00:01:40.430> which<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.549> thought<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.090> this

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
three times which I thought I'm so this

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.580 
three times which I thought I'm so this
is<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> very<00:01:42.689> good<00:01:43.020> card<00:01:43.380> if

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
is going to be a very good card if

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.990 
is going to be a very good card if
you're<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> sensitive

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you're going to be in to the sensitive

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.660 
you're going to be in to the sensitive
it<00:01:45.180> reminds<00:01:45.450> me<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.009> shield<00:01:47.009> bird<00:01:47.310> nothing

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it reminds me of the shield bird nothing

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.950 
it reminds me of the shield bird nothing
has<00:01:47.790> been<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.240> good<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> shield<00:01:48.780> bird

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
has been like that good the shield bird

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.620 
has been like that good the shield bird
but<00:01:49.500> he<00:01:49.740> used<00:01:49.950> um<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.460> believe<00:01:50.820> after<00:01:51.000> dark

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
but he used um I believe after dark

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.310 
but he used um I believe after dark

decreases attack or defense by a

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.540 
decreases attack or defense by a
