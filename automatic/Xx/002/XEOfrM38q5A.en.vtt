reared masteries and as you can see the
reason<00:03:23.049> I<00:03:23.079> got<00:03:23.260> spawn<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.769> time<00:03:24.010> arsenic

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
reason I got spawn in time arsenic

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.920 
reason I got spawn in time arsenic
whatever<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.609> see<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.880> but<00:03:28.000> i<00:03:28.180> will<00:03:28.450> say<00:03:28.660> throw

whatever you see it but i will say throw

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.690 
whatever you see it but i will say throw
about<00:03:28.989> three<00:03:29.350> minutes<00:03:29.530> 20<00:03:29.859> seconds<00:03:30.340> if<00:03:30.519> the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
about three minutes 20 seconds if the

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.490 
about three minutes 20 seconds if the
rates<00:03:30.940> wouldn't<00:03:31.329> you<00:03:31.420> know<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:31.720> spawn<00:03:31.989> now

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
rates wouldn't you know just spawn now

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.170 
rates wouldn't you know just spawn now
imagine<00:03:32.709> him<00:03:33.010> with<00:03:33.100> leash<00:03:33.340> they're<00:03:33.940> gonna

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
imagine him with leash they're gonna

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.640 
imagine him with leash they're gonna
leash<00:03:34.450> probably<00:03:35.019> gonna<00:03:35.109> have<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.290> wait<00:03:35.470> for

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
leash probably gonna have to wait for

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.440 
leash probably gonna have to wait for
the<00:03:35.680> day

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
the day

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.080 
the day
again<00:03:36.750> under<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.430> might<00:03:38.580> end<00:03:38.610> up<00:03:38.819> having

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
again under and you might end up having

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.300 
again under and you might end up having
to<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:40.140> know<00:03:40.230> just<00:03:40.470> double<00:03:40.950> back<00:03:41.129> to

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
to you you know just double back to

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.949 
to you you know just double back to
wolves<00:03:41.790> yeah<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.360> know<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.569> would<00:03:42.660> end<00:03:42.690> up

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
wolves yeah you know it would end up

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.770 
wolves yeah you know it would end up
being<00:03:43.140> faster<00:03:43.500> though<00:03:44.129> yeah<00:03:44.700> hola<00:03:45.540> got

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
being faster though yeah hola got

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.020 
being faster though yeah hola got
 fast<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.920> mean<00:03:47.310> he<00:03:47.400> was<00:03:47.519> always<00:03:47.670> fast

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
 fast I mean he was always fast

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.930 
 fast I mean he was always fast
but<00:03:48.269> he<00:03:48.330> got<00:03:48.510> like<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.440> much<00:03:49.709> faster<00:03:50.340> cuz<00:03:50.849> the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
but he got like the much faster cuz the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.009 
but he got like the much faster cuz the
machine<00:03:52.370> slightly<00:03:53.370> but<00:03:54.090> right<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.660> know<00:03:54.780> Bono

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
machine slightly but right you know Bono

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.300 
machine slightly but right you know Bono
you're<00:03:55.260> already<00:03:55.410> one<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.769> fastest<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.250> the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
you're already one of the fastest in the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.850 
you're already one of the fastest in the
damn<00:03:56.489> game<00:03:56.819> any<00:03:57.120> slight<00:03:57.780> increased<00:03:58.260> speed<00:03:58.650> is

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
damn game any slight increased speed is

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.880 
damn game any slight increased speed is
kind<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.190> already<00:03:59.340> crazy<00:04:00.410> of<00:04:01.410> course<00:04:01.680> right

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
kind of already crazy of course right

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.770 
kind of already crazy of course right
this<00:04:02.160> way<00:04:02.610> does<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.849> stream<00:04:02.880> did<00:04:03.330> well<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.569> a

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
this way does the stream did well for a

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.020 
this way does the stream did well for a
lot<00:04:04.049> well<00:04:04.680> for<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.250> fact<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.580> he<00:04:05.670> could<00:04:05.849> just

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
lot well for the fact that he could just

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.520 
lot well for the fact that he could just
form<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.360> damn<00:04:06.540> jungle<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.170> then<00:04:07.290> eventually

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
form a damn jungle and then eventually

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.500 
form a damn jungle and then eventually
make<00:04:07.950> use<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.549> that<00:04:08.610> increase<00:04:09.000> gold<00:04:09.269> which

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510
