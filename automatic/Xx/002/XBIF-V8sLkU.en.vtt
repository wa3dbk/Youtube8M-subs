 Welcome to a new video of mine 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.369
 today there is a little earliest 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.410
 make up for you and I have 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.360
 this make up what you already done here 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.700
 look pretty often lately 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.890
 also on an instagram picture and 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.960
 had on it and you asked me but 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.550
 how do you think about that for a long time because of it ? 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.010
 It is very easy but wanted to see 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.050
 when he comes, I'm there first 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.390
 unvarnished and the first thing I did 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.820
 make is my garnier bibi cream in 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.800
 matt I have to apply the color holds 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.250
 and blinded the whole with mine 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.370
 beauty blender under my eyes I kicked 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.860
 once the concealer also from 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.860
 garnier on the has such a really 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.540
 cooling ball around it and that is 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.310
 really such a nice cooling effect 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.770
 and I leave that a little bit 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.080
 dry and then brick it 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.009
 also used with my life 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.009
 youtube countries 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.770
 now the eyebrows for this 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:22.270
 I use patrice in the color 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.070
 date ashton a eyebrow pencil and 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.649
 I like the color very much as they beautifully 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.000
 is good and the whole thing still 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.909
 to look a little brighter 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.420
 I use the natural yours once 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.549
 range of zebra and the matching one 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.530

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.369
 I just wear under my brown 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.009
 bow on also I pack the color 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.720
 in my inner corner of my eye so that 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.179
 eye still a little wider open 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.950
 and looks more alert and on my whole 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.130
 I use the same song 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.619

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.000
 Apply again on the whole lid 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.659

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.920
 shimmer really awake and with 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.840
 I really like that green eyes 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.550
