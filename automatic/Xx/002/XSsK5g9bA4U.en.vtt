my berry trees blown up i think in the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.980 
my berry trees blown up i think in the
last<00:04:22.600> round<00:04:22.870> some<00:04:23.169> sappers<00:04:23.530> coming<00:04:23.890> global

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
last round some sappers coming global

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.980 
last round some sappers coming global
at<00:04:25.590> that<00:04:25.740> point<00:04:25.979> what's<00:04:26.250> up<00:04:26.370> everything

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.190 

just<00:04:30.650> another<00:04:31.040> thing<00:04:31.250> follow<00:04:31.520> through<00:04:33.310> yeah

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
just another thing follow through yeah

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.590 
just another thing follow through yeah
spring-trap<00:04:36.200> doing<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.740> job<00:04:37.450> putting<00:04:38.450> our

arrow wall up and I'm probably gonna put

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.060 
arrow wall up and I'm probably gonna put
another<00:04:41.090> one<00:04:41.300> opposite<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.840> that<00:04:41.890> let's<00:04:42.890> have

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
another one opposite of that let's have

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.290 
another one opposite of that let's have
some<00:04:43.220> extra<00:04:43.430> cash<00:04:43.610> got<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:45.460> jagged<00:04:46.460> steel<00:04:46.700> to

to kind of spill out a little bit like I

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.670 
to kind of spill out a little bit like I
said<00:05:49.569> before<00:05:49.659> I<00:05:49.899> don't<00:05:49.930> want<00:05:50.259> them<00:05:50.379> super

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
said before I don't want them super

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:58.519 
said before I don't want them super
close<00:05:52.349> I<00:05:53.349> want<00:05:53.830> the<00:05:53.919> melee<00:05:54.219> shooting<00:05:54.749> when

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:58.529 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:01.700 

part<00:05:58.829> of<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:58.949> whole<00:05:59.159> box<00:05:59.309> here

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.969 

yes

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.350 

scorcher<00:06:07.979> down

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.749 

sometimes<00:06:12.360> I<00:06:12.449> wonder<00:06:12.599> if<00:06:12.810> that's<00:06:13.050> that<00:06:13.759> that's

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
sometimes I wonder if that's that that's

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.570 
sometimes I wonder if that's that that's
detrimental<00:06:15.180> because<00:06:15.900> sometimes<00:06:16.349> that<00:06:16.580> it

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
detrimental because sometimes that it

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.850 
detrimental because sometimes that it
just<00:06:17.819> destroys<00:06:18.659> like<00:06:18.990> just<00:06:19.229> regular<00:06:19.500> work<00:06:19.650> so

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
just destroys like just regular work so

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.170 
just destroys like just regular work so
just<00:06:19.889> a<00:06:20.129> fully<00:06:20.340> functional<00:06:20.819> and<00:06:20.939> they<00:06:21.000> won't

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
just a fully functional and they won't

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.790 
just a fully functional and they won't
actually<00:06:21.360> get<00:06:21.599> over<00:06:21.840> here<00:06:22.020> and<00:06:22.139> pull<00:06:22.560> up<00:06:22.710> two

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
actually get over here and pull up two

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.980 
actually get over here and pull up two
more<00:06:22.919> combos<00:06:23.340> but<00:06:23.400> I<00:06:23.849> ended<00:06:24.599> up<00:06:24.659> getting<00:06:24.930> a

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
more combos but I ended up getting a

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.920 
more combos but I ended up getting a
good<00:06:25.169> score<00:06:25.409> on<00:06:25.469> this<00:06:25.740> run<00:06:25.979> so<00:06:26.219> I<00:06:26.810> guess<00:06:27.810> it

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
good score on this run so I guess it

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.760 
good score on this run so I guess it
works<00:06:29.360> all<00:06:30.360> right<00:06:30.479> so<00:06:30.840> and<00:06:31.199> as<00:06:31.409> always<00:06:31.590> you

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
works all right so and as always you

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.230 
works all right so and as always you
know<00:06:32.009> get<00:06:32.219> your<00:06:32.370> make<00:06:32.789> sure<00:06:32.909> your<00:06:33.030> lightning

ring is being used every time you have a

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:40.390 
ring is being used every time you have a

it's probably one of your biggest

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.220 
it's probably one of your biggest
make<00:06:44.030> as<00:06:44.180> easy<00:06:44.479> as<00:06:44.629> cobbler<00:06:44.960> generators

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.840 

10<00:06:48.800> BC<00:06:48.950> when<00:06:49.100> those<00:06:49.190> little<00:06:49.370> lightning<00:06:49.610> bolts

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
10 BC when those little lightning bolts

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.760 
10 BC when those little lightning bolts
assess<00:06:50.240> your<00:06:50.420> lightning<00:06:50.750> cloud<00:06:51.080> anymore

that's power point being

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.179 
that's power point being
yes<00:06:58.139> and<00:06:59.139> I<00:06:59.319> think<00:06:59.530> we're<00:06:59.620> in<00:06:59.650> the<00:06:59.740> last<00:06:59.860> round

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:00.189 
yes and I think we're in the last round

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:04.439 
yes and I think we're in the last round
here<00:07:00.699> and<00:07:01.680> I'll<00:07:02.680> get<00:07:02.830> max<00:07:03.099> out<00:07:03.280> the<00:07:03.430> archers<00:07:03.789> so

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
here and I'll get max out the archers so

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:08.279 
here and I'll get max out the archers so
I<00:07:04.539> can't<00:07:04.750> put<00:07:04.900> anymore<00:07:05.110> is<00:07:05.669> maxed<00:07:06.669> out<00:07:06.900> it<00:07:07.900> over

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:08.289 
I can't put anymore is maxed out it over

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:09.899 
I can't put anymore is maxed out it over
and<00:07:08.560> we're<00:07:08.949> going<00:07:09.069> to<00:07:09.099> have<00:07:09.280> some<00:07:09.460> sappers

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:09.909 
and we're going to have some sappers

and we're going to have some sappers
come<00:07:10.180> I<00:07:10.509> think<00:07:11.009> towards<00:07:12.009> the<00:07:12.159> end<00:07:12.340> of<00:07:12.430> the

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
come I think towards the end of the

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.330 
come I think towards the end of the
round<00:07:12.930> and<00:07:13.930> like<00:07:14.530> i<00:07:14.650> said<00:07:14.710> like<00:07:15.009> i<00:07:15.129> said

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340 
round and like i said like i said

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.719 
round and like i said like i said
already<00:07:15.550> on

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729 
already on

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:18.590 
already on
I<00:07:16.789> see<00:07:17.389> things<00:07:17.659> right

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 
I see things right
