00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
features that really add up so let's

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.720 
features that really add up so let's
check<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.539> out<00:00:25.039> here<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.340> standard

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
check it out here you have your standard

home screen but if you notice on the
right<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.840> little<00:00:31.050> holographic<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.099> why

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
right the little holographic you why

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.799 
right the little holographic you why
it's<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.579> lot<00:00:32.759> smoother<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:34.280> 3.1<00:00:35.450> it's<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.570> subtle

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it's a lot smoother on 3.1 it's a subtle

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.440 
it's a lot smoother on 3.1 it's a subtle
little<00:00:37.020> difference<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> does<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:39.180> does

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
little difference but it does it does

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
multitasking improvement so I have a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.630 
multitasking improvement so I have a
couple<00:01:15.330> apps<00:01:15.659> up<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.100> I've<00:01:17.189> run<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> lot

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
couple apps up here but I've run a lot

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.490

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so if you want to switch you can go

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.580 
so if you want to switch you can go
through<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.150> go<00:01:21.210> through<00:01:21.390> multiple<00:01:21.869> but

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
through you can go through multiple but

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.370 
through you can go through multiple but
over<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:23.970> see<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.170> just

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
over here you can see that it's just

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080 
over here you can see that it's just
stuck<00:01:25.680> there<00:01:25.979> even<00:01:26.520> though<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.850> multiple

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
stuck there even though I have multiple

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.510 
stuck there even though I have multiple
apps<00:01:27.450> running<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.920> let's<00:01:29.100> open<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
contacts again and then if you want to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.819 
contacts again and then if you want to
switch<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:39.689> want<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> switch<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.320> bumps<00:01:40.680> off

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
switch you want to switch it bumps off

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.730 
switch you want to switch it bumps off
one<00:01:41.220> whereas<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.479> honeycomb<00:01:43.049> 3.1<00:01:43.710> version

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
one whereas on the honeycomb 3.1 version

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.460 
one whereas on the honeycomb 3.1 version
you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.490> keep<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.880> scrolling<00:01:45.259> pretty<00:01:46.259> neat

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
