cover what most people don't recognize

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
cover what most people don't recognize
is<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> cut<00:00:53.850> off

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
is that this is this is a cut off

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.010 
is that this is this is a cut off

and then the cam the rotor goes on

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.139 
and then the cam the rotor goes on
what's<00:01:01.770> important<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.340> when<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> all

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
what's important is when this is all

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.660 
what's important is when this is all
bolted<00:01:03.539> together<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> Allen<00:01:04.500> bolt<00:01:04.680> this

freely<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.240> does<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.600> if<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> binds<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.500> all

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
freely if it does not if it binds it all

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
freely if it does not if it binds it all
it<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.310> cause<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.820> BCS<00:01:12.210> codes

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
it can cause a BCS codes

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
it can cause a BCS codes
how<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> bind<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> are

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
how can a bind is that when you are

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.390 
how can a bind is that when you are
ready<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.869> tighten<00:01:16.290> down<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.590> last<00:01:16.799> six<00:01:17.100> bolts

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
gear the camshaft should very simply

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.850 
gear the camshaft should very simply
fall<00:01:30.659> into<00:01:32.869> just<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.259> there<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.560> no

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.130 
pressure whatsoever I can actually just
drop<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.619> right<00:01:37.650> down<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:39.140> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
drop it right down all the way in the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.289 
drop it right down all the way in the
reason<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.860> drops<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.670> easily<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.060> this

reason this drops in so easily on this
is<00:01:42.570> these<00:01:42.899> six<00:01:43.200> bolts<00:01:43.470> were<00:01:43.649> tightened<00:01:44.070> down

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
is these six bolts were tightened down

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.940 
is these six bolts were tightened down

we<00:02:05.250> tighten<00:02:05.610> down<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.880> bolts<00:02:06.240> what<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.229> is

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
we tighten down the bolts what we do is

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.809 
we tighten down the bolts what we do is
we<00:02:07.500> use<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> special<00:02:08.129> jig<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.580> we've

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
we use a special jig that we've

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.660 
we use a special jig that we've
developed<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:10.259> hold<00:02:10.470> our<00:02:10.560> ABC<00:02:11.069> s<00:02:11.190> gear

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.280 

just<00:02:14.670> drops<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.690> we're<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:16.020> hurting

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
just drops in so that we're not hurting

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.440 
just drops in so that we're not hurting
the<00:02:16.560> actual<00:02:16.980> teeth<00:02:17.250> or<00:02:17.730> holding<00:02:18.150> them<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
the actual teeth or holding them in a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.910 
the actual teeth or holding them in a
clamp<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.110> then<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:19.320> can<00:02:19.500> tighten<00:02:19.710> them<00:02:19.890> down

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
clamp and then we can tighten them down

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.160 
clamp and then we can tighten them down
with<00:02:20.070> our<00:02:20.520> with<00:02:21.120> our<00:02:21.300> special<00:02:21.750> tool<00:02:21.960> we've

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
with our with our special tool we've

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.700 
with our with our special tool we've
made<00:02:22.380> once<00:02:23.070> we<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.460> that<00:02:24.080> we've<00:02:25.080> developed<00:02:25.620> a

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
made once we do that we've developed a

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.890 
made once we do that we've developed a
little<00:02:25.950> testing<00:02:26.430> tool<00:02:26.760> we've<00:02:27.510> welded<00:02:27.720> a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
little testing tool we've welded a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.720 
little testing tool we've welded a
couple<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> ports<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.160> side<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
couple of the ports on the side of this

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.010 
couple of the ports on the side of this
and<00:02:30.000> we've<00:02:30.090> drilled<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.510> couple<00:02:30.540> holes

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
and we've drilled a couple holes

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.630 
and we've drilled a couple holes
straight<00:02:31.230> through<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.740> we<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:31.980> actually<00:02:32.190> see

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
straight through so we can actually see

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.930 
straight through so we can actually see
the<00:02:33.180> action<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.140> cambiar<00:02:34.770> again<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.730> just

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
the action of the cambiar again it just

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.640 
the action of the cambiar again it just
falls<00:02:36.180> down<00:02:36.300> if<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.750> know<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.110> can<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.410> fall

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
falls down if you know it can just fall

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.160 
falls down if you know it can just fall
down<00:02:37.680> there's<00:02:38.190> no<00:02:38.460> binding<00:02:39.000> whatsoever<00:02:39.570> in

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
down there's no binding whatsoever in

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.000 
down there's no binding whatsoever in
this<00:02:40.440> position<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.100> use<00:02:41.280> some<00:02:41.520> air<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:45.830> we<00:02:46.830> can

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
this position we use some air and we can

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.300 
this position we use some air and we can
see<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> movement<00:02:48.800> you'll<00:02:49.800> know<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.010> one

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.580 
see the movement you'll know that one
position<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.690> will<00:02:51.780> move<00:02:51.959> freely<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.410> then

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
position it will move freely and then

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.350 
position it will move freely and then
lock<00:02:52.860> up<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.080> move<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.380> back<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:56.360> simply
