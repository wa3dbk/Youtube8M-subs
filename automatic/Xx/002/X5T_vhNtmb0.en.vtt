00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.920
 I will explain how to wash the garments 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.020
 knitted baby since many do not 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.289
 you asked and in this way the 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.440
 will always keep impeccable first 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.349
 we'll take the sink plug and what 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:25.429
 we put and open the tap we fill it 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.900
 of water up to half more or less I 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.630
 I recommend that you do it with cold water 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.440
 since in this way the tissues do not 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.630
 shrink we add a little bit of soap the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.129
 that you like hypoallergenic 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.920
 I always recommend that it be neutral but 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.260
 then already decide you hypoallergenic 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.199
 better for our baby's skin what 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.290
 dissolve well in the water and once 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.820
 dissolved we take the garment 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.610
 and we introduce it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.090
 you have to introduce it gently giving it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.370
 delicate taps to penetrate 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.370
 well the soap but without damaging the tissues 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.180
 in the case that there is some spot 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.640
 bit harder to remove 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.040
 we can rub it so that it goes well 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.950
 but in a delicate way as you see 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.710
 here so as not to damage the garment in any 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.659
 moment 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.040
 in this case as we are teaching 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.400
 a garment that needs a lot 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.140
 washed then we keep tapping 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.140
 so that the soap penetrates well 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.270
 then we will remove the plug so that it comes out 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.090
 the water with soap and rinse with water 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.520
 abundant is very important that there is not 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.350
 No soap residue mainly 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.270
 because the soap in the garment is 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.670
 hardens and can hurt the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.229
 delicate skins of our babies and in 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.520
 second plane because the soap in the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.190
 garment would deteriorate it much earlier like this 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.990
 that we clarify it very well 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:01.130
 once rinsed very carefully 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.259
 We will remove the maximum possible water 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.170
 no moment to twist we have the pledge 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.030
 so as not to damage the tissues, we will do it very 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.920
 slowly 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.990
 we will put the garment in shape 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.540
 horizontal on a white towel for 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.209
 that does not fade and we will go rolling little 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.209
 to little to eliminate the excess water 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.070
 We unwind the garment and to 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.800
 finish the process we would place it 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.960
 on a dry towel never do this 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.450
 procedure to the sun as it would harm 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.400
 the colors and you do not need ironing 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.099
 I would be perfectly ready to use 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.620
 in this way will always keep the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.980
 Knitwear for your babies like 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.980
