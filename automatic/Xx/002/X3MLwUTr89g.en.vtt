00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
earlier ones which are actually pretty

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.220 
earlier ones which are actually pretty
damn<00:00:19.770> good<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.189> newer<00:00:20.310> ones<00:00:20.580> not<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:20.910> much<00:00:21.230> but

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.170 
damn good the newer ones not so much but
around<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> time<00:00:23.279> these<00:00:23.519> were<00:00:23.699> very<00:00:23.939> popular

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
around the time these were very popular

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.000 
around the time these were very popular
I<00:00:24.480> remember<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.960> Disney<00:00:25.380> game<00:00:25.560> coming<00:00:25.890> out

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
I remember this Disney game coming out

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.089 
I remember this Disney game coming out
disney<00:00:27.000> extreme<00:00:27.150> skate<00:00:27.510> adventure<00:00:28.010> for<00:00:29.010> the

disney extreme skate adventure for the
Gamecube<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> ps2<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
Gamecube in the ps2 and what not and I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.229 
Gamecube in the ps2 and what not and I
remember<00:00:31.980> thinking<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.489> time<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.090> was

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
remember thinking at the time like I was

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.940 
remember thinking at the time like I was
just<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.840> know<00:00:33.870> kids<00:00:34.320> version<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.770> Tony

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
just a you know kids version of Tony

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.340 
just a you know kids version of Tony
Hawk<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.210> never<00:00:36.510> played<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> until<00:00:37.320> very

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
Hawk but I never played it until very

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.069 
Hawk but I never played it until very
recently<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.420> there's<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> lot<00:00:39.570> more<00:00:39.629> merit

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
recently and there's a lot more merit

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.660 
recently and there's a lot more merit
behind<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.559> assumption<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.340> game<00:00:41.520> is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
behind that assumption that the game is

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.889 
behind that assumption that the game is
just<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.940> kid's<00:00:42.120> version<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.510> Tony<00:00:42.690> Hawk

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
just a kid's version of Tony Hawk

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.720 
just a kid's version of Tony Hawk
because<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.530> game<00:00:43.739> engine<00:00:44.160> actually<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
because the game engine actually is the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000 
because the game engine actually is the
tony<00:00:45.149> hawk<00:00:45.360> game<00:00:45.600> engine<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.200> characters

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
tony hawk game engine and the characters

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.619 
tony hawk game engine and the characters
are<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.280> Disney<00:00:47.579> characters<00:00:48.000> replacing<00:00:48.510> all

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
are just Disney characters replacing all

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.990 
are just Disney characters replacing all
the<00:00:48.660> actual<00:00:49.200> stars<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.160> Tony<00:00:50.370> Hawk<00:00:50.550> series

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the actual stars of the Tony Hawk series

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.420 
the actual stars of the Tony Hawk series
so<00:00:51.660> instead<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.960> bucky<00:00:52.440> lasek<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.010> tony<00:00:53.219> hawk

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
so instead of bucky lasek and tony hawk

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.479 
so instead of bucky lasek and tony hawk
doing<00:00:53.760> 900s<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> lip<00:00:55.020> grinds<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.800> Buzz

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
doing 900s and lip grinds you have Buzz

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.720 
doing 900s and lip grinds you have Buzz
Lightyear<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.420> Rafi<00:00:58.140> he<00:00:58.379> doing<00:00:59.250> their<00:00:59.699> own

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
Lightyear and Rafi he doing their own

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
Lightyear and Rafi he doing their own
versions<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.270> tricks<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.750> something<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
versions of tricks and something I

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.869 
versions of tricks and something I
actually<00:01:01.530> liked<00:01:01.859> about<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.280> game<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.670> that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
actually liked about the game is that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.060 
actually liked about the game is that
that<00:01:03.329> they<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:04.290> encompass<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> entire

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
that they really encompass the entire

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030 
that they really encompass the entire
atmosphere<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.330> Disney<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.650> characters

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
atmosphere of Disney and the characters

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.830 
atmosphere of Disney and the characters
into<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> gameplay<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.970> you're<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.479> doing

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
into the gameplay so you're not doing

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.719 
into the gameplay so you're not doing
you<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.740> kickflips<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.520> Buzz

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

Lightyear<00:01:11.970> you're<00:01:12.450> doing<00:01:12.780> cosmic<00:01:13.710> space

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
Lightyear you're doing cosmic space

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.130 
Lightyear you're doing cosmic space
jumps<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.509> infinity<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
jumps and you know to infinity and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
jumps and you know to infinity and
beyond<00:01:16.650> or<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.070> name<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.400> some<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.700> gaps

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
beyond or the name of some of the gaps

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910 
beyond or the name of some of the gaps
you<00:01:18.119> jump<00:01:18.330> over<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.320> wouldn't<00:01:19.590> regular

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you jump over as you wouldn't regular

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.830 
you jump over as you wouldn't regular
games<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> liked<00:01:20.939> how<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.390> immersed

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
games so I liked how it really immersed

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.530 
games so I liked how it really immersed
you<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.560> sort<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.860> game<00:01:23.040> play<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:24.390> I

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
you in that sort of game play and like I

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
you in that sort of game play and like I
said<00:01:24.600> before<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.500> shocked<00:01:25.890> with

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
said before I was really shocked with

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.690 
said before I was really shocked with
how<00:01:26.280> well<00:01:26.720> good<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.020> game<00:01:28.170> actually<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.799> now

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
how well good the game actually was now

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.950 
how well good the game actually was now
I'm<00:01:29.850> that's<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> say<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.420> better<00:01:30.720> than

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
I'm that's not to say it's better than

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.530 
I'm that's not to say it's better than
say<00:01:31.290> Tony<00:01:31.530> Hawk's<00:01:31.770> Pro<00:01:31.920> Skater<00:01:32.070> 3<00:01:32.670> which<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.240> my

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
say Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 which in my

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.630 
say Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 which in my
mind<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> best<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:34.500> made<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.400> just

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
mind is the best one they made it's just

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700 
mind is the best one they made it's just
this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.970> very<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:36.420> approachable<00:01:37.049> version

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
this is a very very approachable version

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.679 
this is a very very approachable version
of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> game<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.180> surprised<00:01:39.540> at

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
of the game and and I was surprised at

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.749 
of the game and and I was surprised at
how<00:01:39.810> good<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.310> something<00:01:41.310> else<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.520> didn't

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
how good it was something else I didn't

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.660 
how good it was something else I didn't
know<00:01:41.820> about<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.840> play<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.310> human<00:01:44.310> kids

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
know about you can play as human kids

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.850 
know about you can play as human kids
from<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.210> game<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:45.659> activision<00:01:46.439> actually

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
from the game but activision actually

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.789 
from the game but activision actually
held<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.250> contest<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.299> which<00:01:48.570> actual<00:01:49.500> kids

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
held a contest to see which actual kids

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.350

would<00:01:50.009> star<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.549> game<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:50.970> selected

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
would star in the game and they selected

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
would star in the game and they selected
i<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.840> i<00:01:52.049> think<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.470> about<00:01:52.530> 10<00:01:52.920> characters

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
i think i think it's about 10 characters

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.609 
i think i think it's about 10 characters
to<00:01:53.759> star<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.329> game<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.780> that's<00:01:55.380> pretty

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
to star in the game and that's pretty

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.069 
to star in the game and that's pretty
cool<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.369> play<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.149> know<00:01:57.270> woody<00:01:57.689> and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
cool you can play as you know woody and

and it's neat the attention to detail is

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.870 
and it's neat the attention to detail is
actually<00:03:08.560> really<00:03:08.710> cool<00:03:08.950> for<00:03:09.370> example<00:03:09.700> when<00:03:09.850> I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
actually really cool for example when I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
levels I was also kind of surprised by

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.550 
levels I was also kind of surprised by
the<00:03:36.820> inclusion<00:03:37.060> of<00:03:37.330> McDonald's<00:03:38.050> as<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> sponsor

the inclusion of McDonald's as a sponsor

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.070

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
so if you're playing in the alley would

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.110 
so if you're playing in the alley would
level<00:03:41.410> which<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:41.890> almost<00:03:42.489> kind<00:03:42.820> of<00:03:42.850> reserved

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
level which is almost kind of reserved

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.060 
level which is almost kind of reserved
for<00:03:43.300> just<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.600> actual<00:03:43.930> human<00:03:44.230> kids<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:44.830> get

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
for just the actual human kids you get

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.130 
for just the actual human kids you get
these<00:03:45.190> quests<00:03:45.519> where<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:45.850> have<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.209> hand<00:03:46.989> out

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
these quests where you have to hand out

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.630 
these quests where you have to hand out
food<00:03:47.350> from<00:03:47.590> mcdonalds<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.310> actually<00:03:48.430> is

food from mcdonalds and it actually is

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.340 
food from mcdonalds and it actually is

have<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.959> go<00:03:53.080> do<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:53.560> that<00:03:53.590> was<00:03:53.860> kind<00:03:54.010> of

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
have to go do it so that was kind of

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.440 
have to go do it so that was kind of
surprising<00:03:54.340> i<00:03:54.519> didn't<00:03:54.730> know<00:03:54.820> that<00:03:54.850> product

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
surprising i didn't know that product

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.270 
surprising i didn't know that product
placement<00:03:55.750> was<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:55.959> there<00:03:56.140> but<00:03:56.440> again<00:03:57.070> it's

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
placement was in there but again it's

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.009 
placement was in there but again it's
just<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.519> same<00:03:57.700> sort<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.090> goal<00:03:58.480> minded

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
just the same sort of goal minded

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.199 
just the same sort of goal minded
formula<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.769> the<00:03:59.860> rest<00:04:00.010> levels<00:04:00.370> follow<00:04:00.550> in

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
formula that the rest levels follow in

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.850 
formula that the rest levels follow in
terms<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.570> gameplay<00:04:01.870> it's<00:04:02.290> actually<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.620> lot

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
terms of gameplay it's actually a lot

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.590 
terms of gameplay it's actually a lot
easier<00:04:03.070> to<00:04:03.430> play<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:03.850> one<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.120> think<00:04:04.450> they

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
easier to play this one I think they

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.530 
easier to play this one I think they
compensated<00:04:05.530> for<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.360> demographic<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.420> the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
compensated for the demographic of the

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.110 
compensated for the demographic of the
game<00:04:07.690> being<00:04:07.930> younger<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.310> gameplay<00:04:09.910> isn't

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
game being younger so the gameplay isn't

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.940 
game being younger so the gameplay isn't
as<00:04:10.420> challenging<00:04:10.930> as<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.080> original<00:04:11.500> Tony<00:04:11.739> Hawk

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
as challenging as the original Tony Hawk

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.699 
as challenging as the original Tony Hawk
series<00:04:12.340> so<00:04:12.910> for<00:04:13.150> example<00:04:13.180> most<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.140> your<00:04:14.320> moves

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
series so for example most of your moves

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.340 
series so for example most of your moves
are<00:04:15.010> just<00:04:15.250> one<00:04:16.180> direction<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.959> button<00:04:17.260> and

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
are just one direction and a button and

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.630 
are just one direction and a button and
you<00:04:17.470> perform<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.890> move<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.370> bit<00:04:18.519> easier

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
you perform the move it's a bit easier

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.670 
you perform the move it's a bit easier
to<00:04:18.880> land<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.660> know<00:04:19.750> kick<00:04:20.049> flips<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.590> stuff

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
to land you know kick flips and stuff

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.710 
to land you know kick flips and stuff
and<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.340> feel<00:04:21.669> like<00:04:21.700> you<00:04:21.910> jump<00:04:22.150> higher<00:04:22.390> and<00:04:22.419> get

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
and I feel like you jump higher and get

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.330 
and I feel like you jump higher and get
speed<00:04:23.020> faster<00:04:23.560> than<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:23.950> wouldn't

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
speed faster than you wouldn't

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.670 
speed faster than you wouldn't
tony<00:04:24.610> hawk<00:04:24.820> games<00:04:25.090> not<00:04:25.900> only<00:04:26.020> that<00:04:26.110> but<00:04:26.260> if<00:04:26.560> you

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
tony hawk games not only that but if you

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.800 
tony hawk games not only that but if you
just<00:04:27.190> hold<00:04:27.340> buttons<00:04:27.730> down<00:04:27.940> as<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.600> are

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
just hold buttons down as you are

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.450 
just hold buttons down as you are
jumping<00:04:29.230> in<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.410> air<00:04:29.440> you'll<00:04:29.830> automatically

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
jumping in the air you'll automatically

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.070 
jumping in the air you'll automatically
grind<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.210> stuff<00:04:31.419> you<00:04:31.570> don't<00:04:31.660> have<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.900> hit<00:04:32.050> a

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
grind and stuff you don't have to hit a

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.890 
grind and stuff you don't have to hit a
grind<00:04:32.470> button<00:04:32.880> necessarily<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.120> that's<00:04:34.360> a<00:04:34.750> bit

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
grind button necessarily so that's a bit

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.469 
grind button necessarily so that's a bit
easier<00:04:35.430> balancing<00:04:36.430> is<00:04:36.580> easier<00:04:36.940> so<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.330> can

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
easier balancing is easier so you can

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.320 
easier balancing is easier so you can
rack<00:04:37.630> up<00:04:37.660> points<00:04:37.810> really<00:04:38.320> really<00:04:38.590> fast<00:04:38.860> and

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
rack up points really really fast and

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.730 
rack up points really really fast and
overall<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.449> game<00:04:40.600> just<00:04:40.810> felt<00:04:41.050> much<00:04:41.229> simpler

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
overall the game just felt much simpler

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.620 
overall the game just felt much simpler
to<00:04:41.889> do<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.639> could<00:04:42.790> pull<00:04:42.910> off<00:04:42.940> these<00:04:43.210> crazy

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
to do and you could pull off these crazy

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.840
