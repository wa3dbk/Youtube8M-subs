00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:26.250
 exactly and if they were to stop 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:29.110
 but one ranks as a talkmaster breaks 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.079
 what I would like is left to turn 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.309
 and front calls so nice guessing 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.309
 cyclists until the 10th 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.140
 and yet can informally read mesas in the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.880
 Fashion is a life brings brakes 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.290
 same turn speaks flat press 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.210
 trot and then dresden again 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.680
 leave closed 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.130
 nice and small pylons was this 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.130
 far distance from keeping it off 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.070
 the principle here, yes, but only know closer 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.830
 Stay tuned is one complete or two 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:54.670
 and rock numbers because they are not by themselves 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.670
 the idea comes from japan 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.610
 it arose in deep sleep what he thinks 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:10.979
 it will never come alive again and say 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:10.979
 okay is like you north 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:31.690
 up here at the pylone normal case 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:38.049
 flowers must be close to it 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:40.090
 melone the more customers are better 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.230
 not further away you are always with it 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.230
 closer and sounded 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.930
 behind it sits exactly 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.360
 Yes 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.390
 2 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.069
 outside
