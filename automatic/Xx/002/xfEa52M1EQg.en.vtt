00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.760 
the belt it always connects to a hip or
something<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:45.899> there's<00:00:46.020> always<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> hole<00:00:46.530> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
something but there's always a hole you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.830 
something but there's always a hole you
got<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.760> regular<00:00:48.090> frag<00:00:48.270> grenade<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.539> does<00:00:48.690> not

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
got the regular frag grenade it does not

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.380 
got the regular frag grenade it does not
come<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.289> black<00:00:49.590> peg<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:51.120> has<00:00:51.270> been

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
come with the black peg but it has been

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.760 
come with the black peg but it has been
repainted<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.379> bit<00:00:52.500> lighter

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
repainted so it's a little bit lighter

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.799 
repainted so it's a little bit lighter
of<00:00:52.980> agreeance<00:00:53.430> more<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.670> an<00:00:53.730> olive<00:00:53.910> colored

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
of agreeance more of an olive colored

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
of agreeance more of an olive colored
green<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.199> actually<00:00:55.410> looks<00:00:55.710> more<00:00:56.000> military

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
green so it actually looks more military

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.229 
green so it actually looks more military
I<00:00:57.149> guess<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.370> pin<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.789> top<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
I guess and the pin on the top is

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.760 
I guess and the pin on the top is
actually<00:01:00.510> silver<00:01:00.809> now<00:01:00.899> instead<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.170> black<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
actually silver now instead of black and

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.100 
actually silver now instead of black and
it<00:01:02.280> connects<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> his<00:01:03.149> belt<00:01:03.420> they<00:01:03.600> both<00:01:03.809> do

with<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.470> flop<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> little<00:01:37.979> bit<00:01:38.100> though

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
with the the flop a little bit though

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.770 
with the the flop a little bit though
because<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> hinge<00:01:39.450> or<00:01:39.540> anything

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
because it's not on a hinge or anything

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.300 
because it's not on a hinge or anything
it's<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:39.930> plastic<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.740> hanging<00:01:41.009> there<00:01:41.040> so

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
it's just plastic just hanging there so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.310 
it's just plastic just hanging there so
don't<00:01:41.880> stretch<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:42.899> end<00:01:43.079> up

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
don't stretch it because it will end up

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.620 
don't stretch it because it will end up

articulation oh my gosh he has so much
articulation<00:03:23.410> let's<00:03:24.160> start<00:03:24.340> with<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.549> head

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
articulation let's start with the head

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.479 
articulation let's start with the head
head<00:03:25.599> neck<00:03:25.930> obviously<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.739> ball<00:03:27.129> joint<00:03:27.370> so

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
head neck obviously is a ball joint so

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.500 
head neck obviously is a ball joint so
he<00:03:27.579> can<00:03:27.669> twist<00:03:27.910> around<00:03:28.750> 360<00:03:29.440> he<00:03:30.220> has<00:03:30.510> improved

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
he can twist around 360 he has improved

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.930 
he can twist around 360 he has improved
arms<00:03:32.079> from<00:03:32.319> previous<00:03:32.739> human<00:03:32.919> characters<00:03:33.760> it

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
arms from previous human characters it

arms from previous human characters it
you<00:03:34.299> know<00:03:34.419> rotates<00:03:34.870> 360<00:03:35.560> but<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.159> can<00:03:36.280> also<00:03:36.370> go

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
you know rotates 360 but it can also go

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.699 
you know rotates 360 but it can also go
up<00:03:36.699> and<00:03:36.909> down<00:03:37.060> because<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.349> way<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:38.590> they

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
up and down because of the way that they

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.559

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.580 
and I know it's kind of hard to see in
the<00:05:06.370> camera<00:05:06.730> but<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.390> is<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.870> legendary

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
the camera but it is the legendary

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.990 
the camera but it is the legendary
symbol<00:05:09.010> where<00:05:09.100> it<00:05:09.190> has<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.400> elite<00:05:09.610> head<00:05:09.850> in

background he has that each one of those

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.210 
background he has that each one of those
is<00:05:13.780> like<00:05:14.050> that<00:05:15.720> he<00:05:16.720> is<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.020> amazing<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:17.830> his

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
is like that he is so amazing and his

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.630 
is like that he is so amazing and his
scale<00:05:18.580> actually<00:05:18.910> fits<00:05:19.630> with<00:05:20.470> other<00:05:20.890> ODST

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
scale actually fits with other ODST

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.370 
scale actually fits with other ODST
figures<00:05:22.060> i<00:05:22.500> can<00:05:23.500> get<00:05:24.460> molnar<00:05:24.790> and<00:05:24.970> then<00:05:25.690> with

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
figures i can get molnar and then with

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.370 
figures i can get molnar and then with
Master<00:05:26.830> Chief<00:05:27.330> Master<00:05:28.330> Chief<00:05:28.660> is<00:05:28.840> obviously

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
Master Chief Master Chief is obviously

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.560 
Master Chief Master Chief is obviously
taller<00:05:29.710> which<00:05:30.400> fits<00:05:30.730> because<00:05:31.000> he's<00:05:31.270> supposed

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
taller which fits because he's supposed

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.150 
taller which fits because he's supposed
to<00:05:31.600> be<00:05:31.690> taller<00:05:31.900> Spartans<00:05:32.320> or<00:05:32.410> taller<00:05:32.590> now<00:05:33.130> I

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
to be taller Spartans or taller now I

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.890 
to be taller Spartans or taller now I
would<00:05:33.490> think<00:05:33.670> that<00:05:33.820> Forge<00:05:34.180> was<00:05:34.360> a<00:05:34.390> little<00:05:34.780> bit

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
would think that Forge was a little bit

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.870 
would think that Forge was a little bit
taller<00:05:34.930> than<00:05:35.530> normal<00:05:36.010> human<00:05:36.040> you<00:05:36.460> know<00:05:36.580> think

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
taller than normal human you know think

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.430 
taller than normal human you know think
he's<00:05:37.060> probably<00:05:37.270> around<00:05:38.310> 64<00:05:39.310> or<00:05:39.820> something<00:05:40.440> but

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
he's probably around 64 or something but

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.740 
he's probably around 64 or something but
that's<00:05:42.100> not<00:05:42.310> something<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.000> gripe<00:05:43.180> about<00:05:43.330> he

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
that's not something to gripe about he

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.410 
that's not something to gripe about he
fits<00:05:44.290> the<00:05:44.410> exact<00:05:44.770> same<00:05:45.040> scale<00:05:45.700> as<00:05:45.730> the<00:05:46.030> humans

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
fits the exact same scale as the humans

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.640 
fits the exact same scale as the humans
the<00:05:46.480> only<00:05:46.600> reason<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.900> ODST<00:05:47.320> is<00:05:47.410> even

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
the only reason the ODST is even

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.260 
the only reason the ODST is even
slightly<00:05:47.920> tolerance<00:05:48.490> because<00:05:48.580> he<00:05:48.760> has<00:05:48.880> helmet

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
slightly tolerance because he has helmet

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.240 
slightly tolerance because he has helmet
so<00:05:49.870> I<00:05:49.900> mean<00:05:50.050> if<00:05:50.110> he<00:05:50.230> had<00:05:50.350> a<00:05:50.380> helmet<00:05:50.560> on<00:05:50.830> you<00:05:51.160> know

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
so I mean if he had a helmet on you know

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.370 
so I mean if he had a helmet on you know
they'd<00:05:51.430> be<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.700> same<00:05:54.060> sergeant<00:05:55.060> forged<00:05:55.390> does

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
they'd be the same sergeant forged does

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.440 
they'd be the same sergeant forged does
not<00:05:56.560> have<00:05:56.710> halo<00:05:57.010> points<00:05:57.430> none<00:05:57.760> of<00:05:57.790> the<00:05:58.060> series

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
not have halo points none of the series

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.940 
not have halo points none of the series
seven<00:05:58.600> figures<00:05:58.990> have<00:05:59.170> halo<00:05:59.380> points<00:05:59.740> so<00:05:59.800> if<00:05:59.890> you

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
seven figures have halo points so if you

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.460 
seven figures have halo points so if you
have<00:06:00.130> them<00:06:00.280> it<00:06:00.730> probably<00:06:01.090> oh<00:06:01.120> it's<00:06:01.510> over<00:06:01.960> now<00:06:02.170> I

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
have them it probably oh it's over now I

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.600 
have them it probably oh it's over now I
don't<00:06:02.950> know<00:06:03.010> if<00:06:03.070> they're<00:06:03.190> going<00:06:03.280> to<00:06:03.370> open<00:06:03.580> a

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
don't know if they're going to open a

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.180 
don't know if they're going to open a
new<00:06:03.640> program<00:06:04.150> or<00:06:04.300> not<00:06:04.420> for<00:06:04.870> us<00:06:05.080> halo<00:06:05.920> points

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
new program or not for us halo points

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.660 
new program or not for us halo points
but<00:06:06.340> I<00:06:06.370> wouldn't<00:06:06.640> count<00:06:06.670> on<00:06:06.940> it<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:09.280> only

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
but I wouldn't count on it the only

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.550 
but I wouldn't count on it the only
thing<00:06:09.940> that<00:06:10.120> I<00:06:10.180> do<00:06:10.240> have<00:06:10.630> a<00:06:10.660> problem<00:06:10.990> with<00:06:11.350> is

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
thing that I do have a problem with is

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.790 
thing that I do have a problem with is
his<00:06:11.920> eyes<00:06:12.190> his<00:06:13.180> eyes<00:06:13.480> are<00:06:13.840> like<00:06:14.020> looking<00:06:14.710> over

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
his eyes his eyes are like looking over

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.770 
his eyes his eyes are like looking over
to<00:06:15.250> his<00:06:15.370> right<00:06:15.400> and<00:06:15.760> I<00:06:15.970> would<00:06:16.120> like<00:06:16.240> it<00:06:16.390> if<00:06:16.540> they

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
to his right and I would like it if they

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.740 
to his right and I would like it if they
were<00:06:16.840> looking<00:06:16.990> straight<00:06:17.380> ahead<00:06:18.570> that's<00:06:19.570> not<00:06:19.720> a

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
were looking straight ahead that's not a

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.560 
were looking straight ahead that's not a
real<00:06:19.930> big<00:06:20.110> deal<00:06:20.350> and<00:06:20.590> most<00:06:21.490> people<00:06:21.640> most

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
real big deal and most people most

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.090 
real big deal and most people most
people<00:06:22.720> won't<00:06:22.960> do<00:06:23.170> stop<00:06:23.380> motions<00:06:23.710> or<00:06:23.770> anything

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
people won't do stop motions or anything

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.620 
people won't do stop motions or anything
so<00:06:24.520> they<00:06:24.640> won't<00:06:24.790> even<00:06:24.880> notice<00:06:25.090> you<00:06:25.360> won't<00:06:25.540> even

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
so they won't even notice you won't even

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.880 
so they won't even notice you won't even
care<00:06:25.900> because<00:06:26.110> you<00:06:26.260> know<00:06:26.440> what<00:06:26.590> is<00:06:26.710> matter

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
care because you know what is matter

care because you know what is matter
which<00:06:27.160> way<00:06:27.310> is<00:06:27.430> looking<00:06:27.730> so<00:06:28.480> overall<00:06:29.320> this

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
which way is looking so overall this

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.550 
which way is looking so overall this
figure<00:06:30.160> is<00:06:30.570> incredible<00:06:31.570> he<00:06:31.720> gets<00:06:31.930> a<00:06:32.050> 5<00:06:32.320> out<00:06:32.530> of
