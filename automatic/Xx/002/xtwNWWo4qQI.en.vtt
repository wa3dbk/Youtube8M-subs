00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
they change brackets on this because

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.429 
they change brackets on this because
originally<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.479> reflex<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> take

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
originally on reflex is going to take

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.719 
originally on reflex is going to take
like<00:01:13.909> see<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.770> we're<00:01:17.610> gonna

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
like see one but and then we're gonna

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.609 
like see one but and then we're gonna
play<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.150> over<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:18.990> decide<00:01:19.290> reflex

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
play it on over then they decide reflex

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.980 
play it on over then they decide reflex
wasn't<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:21.000> instead<00:01:21.720> they<00:01:21.810> were<00:01:21.840> just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
wasn't like like instead they were just

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.380 
wasn't like like instead they were just
pop<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> scenery<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:22.950> me<00:01:23.189> last<00:01:23.369> year<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
pop up the scenery for me last year and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.480 
pop up the scenery for me last year and
so<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.049> would<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.229> playing<00:01:25.560> TSM<00:01:26.040> first<00:01:26.280> round

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
so we would be playing TSM first round

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.179 
so we would be playing TSM first round
and<00:01:26.729> eat<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.509> reflection<00:01:28.409> play<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.070> then

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and eat you and reflection play but then

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.670 
and eat you and reflection play but then
they<00:01:29.280> changed<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.729> again<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:31.170> reflex

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
they changed it again and now reflex

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.590 
they changed it again and now reflex
gets<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.070> little<00:01:32.280> bit<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> points<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.240> CL

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
started one last question um voice and

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.070 
started one last question um voice and
playing<00:07:04.370> a<00:07:04.490> ridiculous<00:07:05.000> tryndamere<00:07:05.510> you

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
playing a ridiculous tryndamere you

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.839 
playing a ridiculous tryndamere you
think<00:07:06.289> the<00:07:06.680> teams<00:07:07.099> are<00:07:07.130> going<00:07:07.250> to<00:07:07.340> be<00:07:07.460> enemy

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:07.849 
think the teams are going to be enemy

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.029 
think the teams are going to be enemy
reversed<00:07:08.090> yes<00:07:08.449> maybe<00:07:09.169> I<00:07:09.349> think<00:07:09.680> there<00:07:10.010> are

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
reversed yes maybe I think there are

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:10.930 
reversed yes maybe I think there are
counters<00:07:10.370> to<00:07:10.490> trade

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
counters to trade

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.840 
counters to trade
and<00:07:11.120> like<00:07:11.270> a<00:07:11.680> lie<00:07:12.680> can<00:07:12.740> we<00:07:12.950> pick<00:07:13.310> trend<00:07:13.580> early

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850 
and like a lie can we pick trend early

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.610 
and like a lie can we pick trend early
in<00:07:13.940> rampage<00:07:14.300> all<00:07:14.900> right<00:07:15.140> man<00:07:15.290> went<00:07:15.500> emo

that<00:07:17.510> match<00:07:17.660> up<00:07:17.690> a<00:07:17.900> little<00:07:18.080> bit<00:07:18.170> depending<00:07:18.950> on

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040 
that match up a little bit depending on

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.500 
that match up a little bit depending on
how<00:07:19.190> you<00:07:19.250> play<00:07:19.610> it<00:07:19.730> I<00:07:19.880> just<00:07:20.060> play<00:07:20.210> the<00:07:20.330> poorly

juggler<00:07:30.050> easily<00:07:30.320> grab<00:07:30.500> is<00:07:30.740> it<00:07:30.890> like<00:07:31.070> there

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:31.760 
juggler easily grab is it like there

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.160 
juggler easily grab is it like there
because<00:07:32.060> we<00:07:32.150> pick<00:07:32.300> leads<00:07:32.510> to<00:07:32.630> juggle<00:07:32.930> to<00:07:33.020> be

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.170 
because we pick leads to juggle to be

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.350 
because we pick leads to juggle to be
aggressive<00:07:33.530> early<00:07:33.770> I<00:07:34.160> just<00:07:34.610> end<00:07:34.850> up<00:07:35.030> in<00:07:35.180> work

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 
aggressive early I just end up in work

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.750 
aggressive early I just end up in work
out<00:07:35.540> because<00:07:35.690> jap<00:07:36.350> via<00:07:36.830> play<00:07:36.980> Lee<00:07:37.130> so<00:07:37.190> much<00:07:37.430> and

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:37.760 
out because jap via play Lee so much and

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.800 
out because jap via play Lee so much and
it<00:07:38.060> just<00:07:38.210> wasn't<00:07:38.660> like<00:07:38.750> a<00:07:38.870> game<00:07:40.600> so<00:07:41.600> I<00:07:41.630> think

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.810 
it just wasn't like a game so I think

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.930 
it just wasn't like a game so I think
you<00:07:42.200> can<00:07:42.350> be<00:07:42.410> countered<00:07:42.680> big<00:07:42.830> but<00:07:43.070> if<00:07:43.520> they

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:43.940 
you can be countered big but if they

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.760 
you can be countered big but if they
pick<00:07:44.210> pas<00:07:44.630> play<00:07:44.870> first<00:07:45.170> and<00:07:45.410> we<00:07:45.530> can<00:07:45.650> pick

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:45.770 
pick pas play first and we can pick

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.780 
pick pas play first and we can pick
