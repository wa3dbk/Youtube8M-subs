of<00:02:09.000> shows<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.569> how<00:02:09.780> much<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.500> mean<00:02:11.130> bars

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
of shows you like how much I mean bars

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.910 
of shows you like how much I mean bars
you<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.610> let's<00:02:11.849> see<00:02:11.970> how<00:02:12.030> far<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> can<00:02:12.420> get<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
you have let's see how far I can get it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.830 
you have let's see how far I can get it
so<00:02:13.920> see<00:02:14.160> right<00:02:14.430> there<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.849> she<00:02:15.120> says<00:02:15.360> Wi-Fi

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so see right there and she says Wi-Fi

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.229 
so see right there and she says Wi-Fi
and<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.860> shows<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.220> how<00:02:17.340> strong<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.849> signal

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
and it shows you how strong the signal

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.539 
and it shows you how strong the signal
is<00:02:18.390> okay<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:21.830> that's<00:02:22.830> essentially<00:02:23.250> how<00:02:23.489> you

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
is okay so that's essentially how you

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.220 
is okay so that's essentially how you
connect<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.940> Wi-Fi<00:02:24.120> if<00:02:24.480> you're<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.780> hotspot

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
connect to Wi-Fi if you're in a hotspot

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.630 
connect to Wi-Fi if you're in a hotspot
you're<00:02:25.440> going<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> do<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.830> exact<00:02:26.160> same<00:02:26.190> thing

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
you're going to do the exact same thing

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.850 
you're going to do the exact same thing
make<00:02:26.880> sure<00:02:26.910> Wireless<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.690> on<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.170> then<00:02:28.680> go

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
make sure Wireless is on and then go

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.440 
make sure Wireless is on and then go
ahead<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.040> go<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.340> menu<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.880> settings<00:02:30.269> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
ahead and go to menu the settings and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.300 
ahead and go to menu the settings and
you're<00:02:30.540> going<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.750> look<00:02:30.900> for<00:02:31.310> wireless

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
you're going to look for wireless

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.699 
you're going to look for wireless
network<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.910> put<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.959> code<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.349> connect

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
network and put in the code to connect

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.440 
network and put in the code to connect
okay<00:02:35.549> now<00:02:36.329> if<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.170> have<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.349> 3G<00:02:37.920> Kindle<00:02:38.450> Touch

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
okay now if you have a 3G Kindle Touch

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.600 
okay now if you have a 3G Kindle Touch
the<00:02:39.959> way<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.170> connect<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.769> 3G<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.340> pretty

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
the way you connect to 3G is pretty

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.059 
the way you connect to 3G is pretty
simple<00:02:43.459> what<00:02:44.459> it'll<00:02:44.640> do<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.989> you're<00:02:46.410> not<00:02:46.650> in

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
simple what it'll do is if you're not in

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.729 
simple what it'll do is if you're not in
an<00:02:47.640> area<00:02:48.030> where<00:02:48.299> there's<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.630> Wi-Fi<00:02:49.019> hotspot

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
an area where there's a Wi-Fi hotspot

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.470 
an area where there's a Wi-Fi hotspot
and<00:02:49.950> your<00:02:50.250> wireless<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.730> turned<00:02:51.090> on

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
and your wireless is turned on

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.140 
and your wireless is turned on
it'll<00:02:51.690> automatically<00:02:52.290> switch<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.709> 3G<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.060> let

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
it'll automatically switch to 3G so let

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.759 
it'll automatically switch to 3G so let
me<00:02:54.209> show<00:02:54.359> you<00:02:54.420> an<00:02:54.510> example<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.049> right<00:02:55.230> now<00:02:55.470> I

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
me show you an example so right now I

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.970 
me show you an example so right now I
want<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.370> go<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.549> Wi-Fi<00:02:56.790> networks<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.980> right

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
want to go to Wi-Fi networks and right

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.259 
want to go to Wi-Fi networks and right
now<00:02:59.130> I'm<00:02:59.250> connected<00:02:59.609> with<00:02:59.639> my<00:02:59.850> home<00:03:00.090> network

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
now I'm connected with my home network

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.690 
now I'm connected with my home network
which<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.810> Miss<00:03:01.019> Rudolph<00:03:01.350> but<00:03:02.190> if<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.400> want<00:03:02.609> to

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
which is Miss Rudolph but if I want to

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.020 
which is Miss Rudolph but if I want to
switch<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.359> a<00:03:03.389> 3G<00:03:04.290> now<00:03:04.950> let<00:03:05.639> me<00:03:05.760> make<00:03:06.000> a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
switch to a 3G now let me make a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.849 
switch to a 3G now let me make a
disclaimer<00:03:06.359> first<00:03:06.720> if<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.959> was<00:03:06.989> in<00:03:07.350> an<00:03:07.560> area

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
disclaimer first if I was in an area

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.289 
disclaimer first if I was in an area
where<00:03:07.980> there's<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.220> hotspot<00:03:08.639> I<00:03:08.819> wouldn't<00:03:09.120> want

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
where there's a hotspot I wouldn't want

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.870 
where there's a hotspot I wouldn't want
to<00:03:09.359> have<00:03:09.510> 3G<00:03:09.780> on<00:03:10.049> because<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.440> want<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.829> say<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
to have 3G on because I want to say the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.120 
to have 3G on because I want to say the
battery<00:03:12.209> 3G<00:03:12.660> actually<00:03:13.049> will<00:03:13.230> drain<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.680> faster

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
battery 3G actually will drain it faster

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.050 
battery 3G actually will drain it faster
so<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:15.239> normal<00:03:16.109> cases<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.650> wouldn't<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.850> this

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
so in normal cases you wouldn't do this

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.680 
so in normal cases you wouldn't do this
but<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.109> be<00:03:19.380> able<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.560> demonstrate<00:03:20.100> it

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
but just to be able to demonstrate it

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.330 
but just to be able to demonstrate it
I'm<00:03:21.690> going<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.930> go<00:03:22.049> ahead<00:03:22.109> and<00:03:22.410> hit<00:03:23.160> this

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
I'm going to go ahead and hit this

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.490 
I'm going to go ahead and hit this
network<00:03:23.760> which<00:03:24.600> is<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.750> one<00:03:24.930> I'm<00:03:25.019> connected

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
network which is the one I'm connected

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.590 
network which is the one I'm connected
to<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.889> it<00:03:26.579> asked<00:03:26.880> me<00:03:27.000> do<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.180> want<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.450> forget

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
to and it asked me do you want to forget

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.420 
to and it asked me do you want to forget
this<00:03:27.900> network<00:03:28.290> we're<00:03:28.530> going<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.739> hit<00:03:28.950> forget

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
this network we're going to hit forget

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.000 
this network we're going to hit forget
and<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:31.560> now<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.459> it's<00:03:32.819> forgotten<00:03:33.590> all<00:03:34.590> the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
and so now that it's forgotten all the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.800 
and so now that it's forgotten all the
wireless<00:03:35.340> networks<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:36.000> I'm<00:03:36.269> surrounded<00:03:36.450> by

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
wireless networks that I'm surrounded by

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.250 
wireless networks that I'm surrounded by
it<00:03:36.959> require<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.440> password<00:03:38.069> so<00:03:38.730> what<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.870> Kindle

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
it require a password so what the Kindle

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.780 
it require a password so what the Kindle
will<00:03:40.349> do<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.829> will<00:03:40.889> automatically<00:03:41.459> switch

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
will do is it will automatically switch

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.210 
will do is it will automatically switch
to<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.239> 3G<00:03:42.630> mode<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.620> if<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.829> look<00:03:43.980> right<00:03:44.160> here

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
to the 3G mode so if you look right here

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.499 
to the 3G mode so if you look right here
in<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.639> corner<00:03:46.099> it<00:03:47.099> actually<00:03:47.579> now<00:03:47.730> says<00:03:48.030> 3G

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
in the corner it actually now says 3G

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:52.099 
in the corner it actually now says 3G
okay<00:03:49.530> because<00:03:50.280> Wireless<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:50.940> turned<00:03:51.180> on<00:03:51.419> but

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
okay because Wireless is turned on but

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.960 
okay because Wireless is turned on but
I'm<00:03:52.229> not<00:03:52.410> connected<00:03:52.979> with<00:03:53.009> a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
I'm not connected with a

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.660 
I'm not connected with a
wireless<00:03:54.690> network<00:03:55.080> so<00:03:55.770> that's<00:03:56.130> all<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.550> have

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
wireless network so that's all you have

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.710 
wireless network so that's all you have
to<00:03:56.850> do<00:03:57.030> in<00:03:57.420> order<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.140> connect<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.040> 3G<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.720> now

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
to do in order to connect to 3G and now

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.530

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
but that's if Wireless is not kept on

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.030 
but that's if Wireless is not kept on
continuously<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:15.000> this<00:04:15.150> case<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.780> would<00:04:16.739> go

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
continuously so in this case I would go

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.720 
continuously so in this case I would go
to<00:04:17.130> menu<00:04:18.290> and<00:04:19.290> now<00:04:19.620> I'm<00:04:19.709> going<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:19.950> go<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.160> turn

and<00:04:24.150> now<00:04:24.420> that<00:04:24.630> I've<00:04:24.720> done<00:04:24.870> that<00:04:25.140> if<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.440> look

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
and now that I've done that if you look

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.500 
and now that I've done that if you look
at<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.860> top<00:04:26.100> right<00:04:26.400> here<00:04:26.670> there's<00:04:27.240> nothing

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
at the top right here there's nothing

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.140 
at the top right here there's nothing
right<00:04:27.900> here<00:04:28.290> doesn't<00:04:29.130> say<00:04:29.250> Wi-Fi<00:04:29.730> doesn't<00:04:29.970> say

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
right here doesn't say Wi-Fi doesn't say

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.570 
right here doesn't say Wi-Fi doesn't say
3G<00:04:30.630> nothing<00:04:31.500> is<00:04:31.590> connected<00:04:31.920> so<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.370> means

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
3G nothing is connected so that means

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.340 
3G nothing is connected so that means
that<00:04:32.820> now<00:04:33.030> I'm<00:04:33.210> going<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.480> preserve<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.900> lot<00:04:34.200> of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
that now I'm going to preserve a lot of

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.210 
that now I'm going to preserve a lot of
battery<00:04:34.710> just<00:04:35.580> by<00:04:36.230> not<00:04:37.230> being<00:04:37.500> connected<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.190> a

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
battery just by not being connected to a

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.880 
battery just by not being connected to a
network<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:39.420> that's<00:04:40.200> how<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.440> connect<00:04:40.800> to

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
network so that's how you connect to

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.340 
network so that's how you connect to
Wi-Fi<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.340> that's<00:04:41.610> also<00:04:41.910> how<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.090> connect<00:04:42.600> 3G

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
Wi-Fi and that's also how you connect 3G

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.950 
Wi-Fi and that's also how you connect 3G
for<00:04:44.160> your<00:04:44.370> Kindle<00:04:44.640> Touch<00:04:44.970> hope<00:04:45.600> that<00:04:45.810> was

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
for your Kindle Touch hope that was
