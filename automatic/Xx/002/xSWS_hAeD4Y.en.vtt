00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
game the early game where the top lane

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.900 
game the early game where the top lane

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.830 
a little bit early game top I flashed in
thinking<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.789> could<00:00:20.880> like<00:00:21.119> kill<00:00:21.390> Siobhan<00:00:21.660> with

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.120 
thinking I could like kill Siobhan with
my<00:00:21.960> cube<00:00:22.260> I'm<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.529> he<00:00:22.650> was<00:00:22.769> actually<00:00:22.920> on

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
my cube I'm like he was actually on

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.980 
my cube I'm like he was actually on
cooldown<00:00:23.369> when<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> flashed<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.840> was

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.359 
of course you're gonna play vs SKT the
reigning<00:01:25.110> world<00:01:25.350> champion<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.100> how<00:01:26.220> are

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
reigning world champion so how are

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.819 
reigning world champion so how are
looking<00:01:26.640> forward<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:26.970> match<00:01:27.240> oh<00:01:27.560> well<00:01:28.560> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
looking forward to that match oh well I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.679 
looking forward to that match oh well I
think<00:01:28.890> SKT<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.700> million<00:01:30.150> times<00:01:30.270> better<00:01:30.479> than

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
think SKT is a million times better than

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
think SKT is a million times better than
us<00:01:30.900> we've<00:01:31.259> scrim<00:01:31.740> them<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> past<00:01:32.159> two<00:01:32.310> days

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
us we've scrim them the past two days

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.980 
us we've scrim them the past two days
which<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.790> actually<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.329> huge<00:01:33.810> pleasure

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
which is actually a huge pleasure

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.080 
which is actually a huge pleasure
because<00:01:34.320> they're<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.189> extremely<00:01:35.520> good

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
because they're just extremely good

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.490 
because they're just extremely good
everything<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.900> feels<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.200> they<00:01:37.320> just

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
everything we do it feels like they just

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.340 
everything we do it feels like they just
have<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.770> better<00:01:38.009> answer<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.869> learn

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
have a better answer for and so we learn

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.649 
have a better answer for and so we learn
a<00:01:40.380> lot<00:01:40.619> from<00:01:40.680> playing<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> maybe<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.540> we

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
a lot from playing them and maybe if we

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.719 
a lot from playing them and maybe if we
play<00:01:42.810> extremely<00:01:43.020> well<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.770> they<00:01:44.130> slip<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.579> we

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
play extremely well and they slip up we

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.670 
play extremely well and they slip up we
were<00:01:44.820> able<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.060> take<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.329> off<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:46.380> sort

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
