00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
that if we had it like how much we could

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.949 
that if we had it like how much we could
just<00:04:03.730> get<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.090> right<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:06.370> was<00:04:06.519> able<00:04:06.609> to<00:04:06.959> to

i recorded cam on and it had that

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.930 
i recorded cam on and it had that
feeling<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.379> you<00:04:14.379> know<00:04:14.410> rockefeller<00:04:15.340> era<00:04:15.579> just

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
blaze so I just brought it to just

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.949 
blaze so I just brought it to just
afterwards<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.269> know<00:04:19.329> they<00:04:19.570> hadn't<00:04:19.840> worked

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
afterwards and I know they hadn't worked

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.170 
afterwards and I know they hadn't worked
together<00:04:20.169> in<00:04:20.410> over<00:04:20.680> 10<00:04:20.889> years<00:04:20.919> but<00:04:21.849> you<00:04:22.060> know

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
together in over 10 years but you know

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.969 
together in over 10 years but you know
sometimes<00:04:22.419> it's<00:04:22.780> just<00:04:22.840> like<00:04:23.169> when<00:04:23.950> you

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
sometimes it's just like when you

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.040 
sometimes it's just like when you
approach<00:04:24.400> something<00:04:25.030> or<00:04:25.180> someone<00:04:25.599> just<00:04:25.870> the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
approach something or someone just the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
approach something or someone just the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
right way

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.670 
right way
you<00:04:27.430> know<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.640> can<00:04:27.910> sort<00:04:28.180> of<00:04:28.350> reopen<00:04:29.350> some<00:04:29.530> of

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
you know you can sort of reopen some of

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.660 
you know you can sort of reopen some of
those<00:04:29.770> doors<00:04:30.870> so<00:04:31.870> Justin<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.530> rework<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.460> beads

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
those doors so Justin I rework the beads

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.990 
those doors so Justin I rework the beads
together<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:36.340> world's<00:04:36.640> going<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:36.820> hear

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
together and the world's going to hear

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.570 
together and the world's going to hear
it<00:04:37.090> very<00:04:37.240> soon<00:04:37.600> any<00:04:38.350> other<00:04:38.650> guest<00:04:39.160> appearances

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
it very soon any other guest appearances

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.300 
it very soon any other guest appearances
LEP<00:04:40.300> for<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.140> most<00:04:41.320> part<00:04:41.440> we're<00:04:41.890> sticking

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
LEP for the most part we're sticking

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.880 
LEP for the most part we're sticking
pretty<00:04:42.640> tightly<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.450> dipset<00:04:43.870> because<00:04:44.350> I<00:04:44.560> think

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
pretty tightly to dipset because I think

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.040 
pretty tightly to dipset because I think
even<00:04:45.580> that<00:04:45.610> hasn't<00:04:46.210> happened<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:46.630> so<00:04:46.810> long

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
even that hasn't happened and so long

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.340 
even that hasn't happened and so long
but<00:04:47.920> there's<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.580> little<00:04:49.120> bit<00:04:49.300> more<00:04:49.510> but<00:04:49.840> for<00:04:50.230> me

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
but there's a little bit more but for me

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.510 
but there's a little bit more but for me
it's<00:04:50.500> really<00:04:50.530> important<00:04:51.010> that<00:04:51.040> just<00:04:51.340> like

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
it's really important that just like

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.750 
it's really important that just like
keep<00:04:52.210> cam<00:04:52.750> in<00:04:53.050> his<00:04:53.200> sweet<00:04:53.440> spot<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:54.040> you<00:04:54.610> know

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
have have them have the dipset energy

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.220 
have have them have the dipset energy
that<00:04:57.910> people<00:04:58.150> have<00:04:58.240> been<00:04:58.330> missing<00:04:58.690> why<00:04:59.170> the

Navy Federal Reserve and the name just
kind<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:02.770> like<00:05:03.010> popped<00:05:03.280> into<00:05:04.830> into<00:05:05.830> our<00:05:05.980> heads

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
kind of like popped into into our heads

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.730 
kind of like popped into into our heads
in<00:05:06.340> a<00:05:06.460> brainstorm<00:05:07.000> kind<00:05:07.420> of<00:05:07.510> moment<00:05:07.990> like<00:05:08.200> no

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
in a brainstorm kind of moment like no

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.140 
in a brainstorm kind of moment like no
real<00:05:08.920> reason<00:05:09.070> it<00:05:09.250> just<00:05:09.310> sounded<00:05:09.730> it<00:05:09.940> sounded

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
real reason it just sounded it sounded

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.670 
real reason it just sounded it sounded
like<00:05:10.510> that<00:05:10.750> feeling<00:05:10.990> that<00:05:11.260> we're<00:05:11.380> trying<00:05:11.620> to

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
like that feeling that we're trying to

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.860 
like that feeling that we're trying to
capture
