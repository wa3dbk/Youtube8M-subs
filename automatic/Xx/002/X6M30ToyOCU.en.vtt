00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
going to find a few low profile

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.850 
going to find a few low profile
expansion<00:01:45.270> ports<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.380> which<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.710> being

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
expansion ports one of which is being

machine<00:02:16.050> is<00:02:16.379> quite<00:02:16.950> simple<00:02:17.400> all<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:18.900> to

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
machine is quite simple all you have to

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.380 
machine is quite simple all you have to
do<00:02:19.170> literally<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.860> pull<00:02:20.129> this<00:02:20.340> latch<00:02:21.060> right

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
do literally is pull this latch right

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.339 
do literally is pull this latch right
here<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:23.370> top<00:02:23.580> lifts<00:02:24.180> off<00:02:24.330> exposing<00:02:24.810> the

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
here and the top lifts off exposing the

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.860 
here and the top lifts off exposing the
innards<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.159> this<00:02:26.370> thing<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.760> it's<00:02:27.390> actually

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
innards of this thing and it's actually

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.589 
innards of this thing and it's actually
really<00:02:28.260> easy<00:02:28.409> to<00:02:29.190> do<00:02:29.340> your<00:02:29.519> upgrades<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.180> all

really easy to do your upgrades and all
of<00:02:31.049> your<00:02:31.470> maintenance<00:02:31.769> on<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:32.489> system<00:02:33.000> you

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
of your maintenance on this system you

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.780 
of your maintenance on this system you
simply<00:02:33.720> lift<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.049> tab<00:02:34.260> right<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.739> gives<00:02:35.700> you

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
simply lift a tab right here gives you

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.970 
simply lift a tab right here gives you
full<00:02:36.000> access<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.810> inside<00:02:37.170> as<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.739> can<00:02:37.860> see

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
full access to the inside as you can see

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.970 
full access to the inside as you can see
there<00:02:38.129> are<00:02:38.310> four<00:02:38.790> memory<00:02:39.180> slots<00:02:39.629> only<00:02:40.530> one<00:02:40.829> of

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
there are four memory slots only one of

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.130 
there are four memory slots only one of
which<00:02:41.129> is<00:02:41.340> being<00:02:41.640> used<00:02:42.239> by<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> two<00:02:42.900> gigabyte

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
which is being used by a two gigabyte

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.440 
which is being used by a two gigabyte
sim<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.010> will<00:02:44.370> be<00:02:44.489> able<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.849> upgrade<00:02:45.030> your

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
sim so you will be able to upgrade your

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.050 
sim so you will be able to upgrade your
memory<00:02:45.629> quite<00:02:46.530> easily<00:02:46.860> when<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.579> comes<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
memory quite easily when it comes to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.599 
memory quite easily when it comes to
expansion<00:02:48.750> ports<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.079> do<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.560> PCI<00:02:50.010> x16

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
expansion ports you do have a PCI x16

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.509 
expansion ports you do have a PCI x16
and<00:02:51.000> two<00:02:51.120> PCI<00:02:51.540> x1<00:02:52.170> slots<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.069> you're<00:02:53.190> going<00:02:53.430> to

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
and two PCI x1 slots so you're going to

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.250 
and two PCI x1 slots so you're going to
be<00:02:53.640> able<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.910> use<00:02:54.209> oh<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.629> also<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> standard

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
be able to use oh and also a standard

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.900 
be able to use oh and also a standard
PCI<00:02:55.590> slot<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.310> you're<00:02:56.400> going<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.609> be<00:02:56.700> able<00:02:56.760> to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
PCI slot so you're going to be able to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.119 
PCI slot so you're going to be able to
use<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:58.170> any<00:02:58.349> of<00:02:58.440> your<00:02:58.620> expansion

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
use this with any of your expansion

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.490 
use this with any of your expansion
cards<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.489> well<00:02:59.670> as<00:02:59.910> long<00:03:00.510> as<00:03:00.540> those<00:03:00.840> expansion

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
cards as well as long as those expansion

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.339 
cards as well as long as those expansion
cards<00:03:01.890> are<00:03:02.510> low-profile<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.690> as<00:03:04.049> you<00:03:04.230> can<00:03:04.290> see

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
cards are low-profile so as you can see

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.960
