00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
goat friend woody the go so here's the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.679 
goat friend woody the go so here's the
cool<00:00:26.670> thing<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:27.090> lot<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.269> people<00:00:27.480> don't<00:00:27.599> know

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
cool thing a lot of people don't know

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.710 
cool thing a lot of people don't know
this<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.109> goats<00:00:28.470> milk<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.010> very<00:00:29.220> easily

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
this but goats milk is very easily

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.510 
this but goats milk is very easily
digested<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.740> actually<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.130> lower<00:00:32.340> in

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
digested and it actually is lower in

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.889 
digested and it actually is lower in
lactose<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.420> people<00:00:33.630> who<00:00:33.690> are<00:00:33.780> lactose

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
lactose so for people who are lactose

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
lactose so for people who are lactose
intolerant<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.980> possible<00:00:35.610> alternative

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
intolerant it's a possible alternative

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.950 
intolerant it's a possible alternative
but<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:37.530> your<00:00:37.649> skin<00:00:38.250> PJ<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.360> who<00:00:39.840> would

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
but for your skin PJ I know who would

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.590 
but for your skin PJ I know who would
have<00:00:39.989> thought<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.620> had<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.309> dairy<00:00:41.550> goats<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.180> I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
have thought I had the dairy goats and I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.510 
have thought I had the dairy goats and I
wanted<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.050> make<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> healthy<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.430> our

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
wanted to make a healthy so for our

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.130 
wanted to make a healthy so for our
family<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> decided<00:00:45.480> instead<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.989> using

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
family so I decided instead of using

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.080 
family so I decided instead of using
water<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> soap<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.760> gonna<00:00:47.879> put

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
water in the soap that I was gonna put

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
water in the soap that I was gonna put
the<00:00:48.180> milk<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.840> when<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> put<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the milk in and when I put it in the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.590 
the milk in and when I put it in the
shower<00:00:50.340> my<00:00:50.640> husband's<00:00:51.000> fingers<00:00:51.210> stopped

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
shower my husband's fingers stopped

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.720 
shower my husband's fingers stopped
cracking<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.140> splitting<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.219> that's<00:00:53.489> when<00:00:53.699> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
cracking and splitting so that's when I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700 
cracking and splitting so that's when I
