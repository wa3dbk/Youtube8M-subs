00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.290
 why gray hair turns gray more often 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.179
 associated with old age 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.790
 however lose natural hair color 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.679
 powerful in his youth seems incredible 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.870
 but white hide and seek are found in 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.770
 some cases and in children so why 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.779
 gray hair 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.060
 so consider the main reasons 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.850
 appearance of gray hair 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.080
 age is the most obvious reason 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.420
 due to graying hair given 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.550
 case of cell melanocytes 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.660
 melanin synthesizing over the years begin 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.820
 work worse 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.489
 they receive less blood through the vessels 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.930
 respectively coloring pigment 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.420
 called melanin inside the hair 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.670
 does less and his place is occupied 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.460
 air bubbles curl loses its 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.690
 familiar color and become white you can 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.149
 does it somehow prevent 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.579
 at this level of medicine and science there is no 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.680
 because explain for sure why u 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.079
 some of these same melanocytes stop 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.090
 work at 20 and others and 80 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.840
 the shag remains unchanged until 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.670
 it turns out 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.940
 often plays a significant role 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.019
 hereditary stress factor 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.630
 continuous load measurement 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.960
 deep emotional distress lack 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.180
 sleep 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.640
 constant fatigue it all 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.830
 detrimental to health factor early 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.990
 gray is characteristic of people occupying 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.479
 responsible posts or survivors 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.280
 big emotional shock here 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 why do they say that they turn white from fear 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.750
 hair and although in fact instant 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.939
 the curls do not change color over time 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.979
 happen can still prevent 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.079
 the appearance of gray strands in this case 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.670
 you can act on the reverse to exclude 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.299
 negative stress opportunities 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.579
 situations 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.350
 gray hairs should become peculiar 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.329
 signal that you need to reconsider 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.820
 attitude to everything happening in order 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.100
 preserve your health disease 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.689
 another contributing factor 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.390
 appearance of gray hair even at an early age 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.759
 is having one or more 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.829
 systemic diseases in this case 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.210
 loss of hair coloring can also be 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.369
 a signal to go 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.320
 full diagnosis of the cause 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.630
 graying hair can be for example 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.909
 detected sleep tea anemia or same 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.490
 diseases of the cardiovascular system 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.320
 endocrine digestive nerve in 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.700
 In this case, the elimination of the main 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.470
 diseases sometimes we 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.330
 even return the old hair color on 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.670
 This is due to the normalization of exchange 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.470
 processes blood vessels begins 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.599
 re -supply melanocytes 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.640
 essential substances of the cell 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.599
 take up their functions and 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.519
 wolf she is saturated with melanin nutrition 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.530
 strict non-protein diet direct path to 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.330
 premature cell aging in that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.840
 including those who are responsible for coloring 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.060
 hair 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.250
 such consequences are often found in 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.049
 young girls are constantly experiencing 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.090
 various ways to lose weight and 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.340
 using for this are not approved and 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.500
 nutritionist methods are also a disadvantage 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.989
 vitamins and trace elements in general can 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.130
 provoke early graying 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.700
 those who are most at risk 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.660
 eating little vegetables and fruits 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.980
 varied and balanced menu 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.110
 reduces exposure 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.810
 adverse factors associated with 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.730
 nutrition ecology and other factors 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.230
 why do people get their hair gray 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.420
 subjected to a high dose 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.970
 radiation exposure seems understandable 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.829
 but much surprise is also sunny 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.810
 radiation or rather ultraviolet 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.329
 radiation in excessive quantities not 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.519
 rejuvenates cells bad habits a 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.319
 smoking features may cause tpa 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.480
 seats in ahead of time some 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.100
 researchers suggest that and bounce 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.410
 headgear in the cold season 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.090
 leads to deterioration of the blood supply to the skin 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.780
 heads 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.510
 healthy lifestyle and proper
