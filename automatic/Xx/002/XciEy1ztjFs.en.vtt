acne or I don't even know what it is but

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.479 
acne or I don't even know what it is but
I<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:51.030> some<00:00:51.600> pimples<00:00:51.989> right<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.039> I

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
I do have some pimples right here and I

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.840 
I do have some pimples right here and I
think<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:53.910> two<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.489> they're<00:00:56.489> slowly

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
think one or two here and they're slowly

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.270 
think one or two here and they're slowly
going<00:00:57.270> away<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.469> blemishes<00:00:58.890> are<00:00:59.039> going

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
going away and the blemishes are going

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
going away and the blemishes are going
away<00:00:59.399> too<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> reasons

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
away too and I think one of the reasons

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.900 
away too and I think one of the reasons
why<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.680> happening<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.730> this

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
why that is happening is because of this

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.719 
why that is happening is because of this
little<00:01:03.239> product<00:01:03.480> right<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:04.250> ever<00:01:05.250> since<00:01:05.549> I
