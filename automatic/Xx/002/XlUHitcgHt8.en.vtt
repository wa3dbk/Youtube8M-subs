00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.569
 to make this point a few points 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.150
 I will show you with scale points 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:24.960
 how to use a cinetto with thread then 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:38.700
 put on 21 chains 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:44.789
 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 and 21 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.030
 ok i go back inside and load the points like this 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:53.789
 enter the chains and load all the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.890
 my points as if they were on the iron in 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.850
 this case with the crochet hook 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.680
 so the thread can make me stand on everyone 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.989
 the points I want 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.070
 these in this case are only 21 but ne 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:13.340
 I can upload what 50 wineries I want 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.340
 I run the thread a little and continue 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.320
 so 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.020
 now I go back and close all the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.170
 my points 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.880
 the first I close it alone resting the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:50.020
 thread and the others close to 2 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:55.320
 this is the point tunis so it is 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.990
 very fast I don't make any effort 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.840
 I pull my thread backwards 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.680
 I insert the crochet hook like this and do the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.250
 second part so always closing it 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.250
 two at a time 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.110
 here now I make the return round a 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.480
 another lap, however, no longer within 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:35.940
 chains entered the vertical links 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:37.520
 for which the first one is not there 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:44.030
 I never do 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.030
 the first vertical point I skip this way 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.280
 now crochet enough load 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.070
 so I push the thread I push you 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.500
 they push it puts the thread out e 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.500
 I go ahead in the second part 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.080
 so 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:31.690
 up to the last vertical point ok go 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.940
 always worked all now object on 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.460
 thread and close the first one alone as 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.450
 first and do all my work again 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.450
 return two by two 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.280
 then so 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:07.340
 so here now I pull my little cousin 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:10.360
 back like this and go ahead I already have 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.360
 made another line 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.060
 without making any effort 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.460
 ok
