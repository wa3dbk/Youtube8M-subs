00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.880
I want you off this fucking set, you prick!

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.720
Sorry.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.240
No, don't just me sorry. Think for one fucking second!

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.360
I dropped a peanut M&amp;M and it rolled over here.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.788
Am I gonna walk around and rip your fucking lights down in the middle of a scene?

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.714
Those are Christmas lights. I put them up to make everyone happy.

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:22.949
Then why the fuck are you walking right through

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.575
Ah, da da da da da, like this in the background

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:26.843
What the fuck is it with you?

00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:29.443
Boy you are going to owe a fortune for the swear jar

00:00:29.443 --> 00:00:31.780
You got any fucking idea about

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.000
"Hey, it's fucking distracting

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.743
Having something walking up behind Bryce

00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:39.180
In the middle of the fucking scene."

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.300
GIVE ME A FUCKING ANSWER!!

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.340
I don't get it.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.760
What don't you get about it?

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.194
I just, I don't get why we need another Terminator. I just, I don't... I don't get it.

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:52.413
Oh, and I'm sorry, I ate that last piece of pie that you were saving for yourself.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.860
Oh, good for you! And how was it?!

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.980
Uh, it was good.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.940
I hope it was fucking good because it's useless now, isn't it?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.360
Well, it's nourishing me, so that's... that's useful.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.018
Fuck's sakes, man, you amateur!

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:05.158
I don't know that word.

00:01:05.158 --> 00:01:06.875
Stay off the fucking set, man.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.225
Right, let's go again.

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:09.062
Can we just take a minute?

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:11.877
Let's not take a fucking minute, let's GO AGAIN!

00:01:11.877 --> 00:01:15.392
I gotta go pee, and I wanna walk around some more, but I want do it while the scene's going.

00:01:15.392 --> 00:01:16.817
You're unbelievable, man.

00:01:16.817 --> 00:01:17.937
Uh, I just don't understand--

00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:22.506
Ah, you don't fucking understand what it's like working with actors. That's what that is.

00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:23.864
I don't... I don't that's what that--

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:25.882
THAT'S WHAT THAT IS MAN, I'M TELLING YOU!

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:29.106
Hey, my family's coming to town. Do you might pretending I'm the director?

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:31.840
I'm gonna fucking kick your fucking ass!

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.320
If you don't shut up for a second.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.506
Please don't hurt me, Mr. Bale.

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:36.452
You want me to go and fucking trash your lights?

00:01:36.452 --> 00:01:36.952
No.

00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:38.352
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO FUCKING TRASH THEM??!!

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.680
No, I don't want you to trash them!

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.291
You do it one more fucking time

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:43.729
And I ain't walking on this set if you're still hired

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.246
Sorry, it's my first day.

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:46.458
I'm fucking serious

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.980
You're a nice guy. You're a nice guy.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.223
I don't feel like a nice guy.

00:01:50.223 --> 00:01:54.240
But I don't fucking cut it when you're bullshitting and fucking around like this on set.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.971
Jeez, you punch your mother with that mouth?

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:58.639
Seriously man, you and me we're fucking done, professionally.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:59.969
Wait, just professionally?

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.388
[GASP] Are you asking me out on a date?

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.560
Fucking asss.
