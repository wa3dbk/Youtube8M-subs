00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.830
 Everything there, people talking here more 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.960
 We're getting to you one more video. 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.780
 of creating our complete game in the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.849
 program sell good staff now 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.850
 was then creating a table 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.590
 character creation initiative is 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.930
 Okay, I know the ball did not get very good. 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.609
 physics only with some tips to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.490
 our colleagues who have been receiving 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.859
 Surely after having created here clear 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.439
 character and some details of the game to 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.239
 us back to the physics of the ball is to 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.550
 when we really let the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 Player- type impulse to throw her 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.870
 really forward to the goal 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.219
 then we have to work with the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 physical because we're going to do it 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.510
 now because there's too much to model 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.850
 for example the character that plagues a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.129
 kind of stuff here if you guys 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.600
 want to leave well is of standard of 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.670
 initiative in the bathroom 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.910
 I wanted to say that our characters 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.250
 to everything created so it is by the unforeseen 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.500
 it is what we do not have much 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.989
 So many people have a notion of how they will stay 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.299
 but we do not know exactly the result 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.500
 Do not worry about that again. 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.600
 mere coincidences will be disposable 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.689
 It's ok because it 's the game. 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.850
 in fact everything on the improvisation is this the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.770
 people will be weighing against rb you 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.830
 cut out the items as you can see 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.930
 against r you cut when again 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.430
 rolling mode you boot several times 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.140
 I'll do that now it 's just 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.390
 The more you talked about the mouse, the more 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.909
 It's going to be cut fish, I remind you. 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.460
 The more edition you want, the more 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.259
 lost your game will be just a tip 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.930
 because this is important to be 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.549
 passing on to you is that the performance 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.130
 of the game will make it fundamental 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.890
 importance also in the amendments which 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.049
 you phase or these two bases here 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.350
 on that key there for you of the instruction 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.360
 beauty and the extrusion case increases 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.290
 the vertical is one of the pieces was 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.850
 again 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.070
 now the selection of those parts that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.869
 notice that we stopped once to 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.870
 Personal and again because we did 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.820
 this to cut the faces 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.820
 cut these gets easier on you 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.580
 was in this case creating the part of the feet 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.260
 of the character if you already understood well and 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.790
 You'll understand that I'm just talking about one 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.820
 side we will continue to press the key 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.560
 It 's exclusion for you, it's one of the 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.480
 We're going to talk a lot for you. 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.010
 you or the tutorials are here 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.250
 both bath and other 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.530
 programs also shown in cinemas is the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.350
 programs think this also has 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.140
 option for this key and now that the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.240
 it's the next head part 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.810
 This part of you from the institution there. 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.700
 again you take to right and up 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.770
 ready you do not need to do anything else 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.170
 make changes to the 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.110
 from this series probably 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.900
 best of the year for sure the character 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.550
 of the next game thought enough 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.320
 I think it would be nice, we are. 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.670
 saying of course is in the case some 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.010
 some grass images in the game 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.320
 consider kw edit mode and option 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.160
 shading smoothed by sharp more 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.120
 smooth every case object you are creating 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.340
 beauty 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.020
 only one hint smoothed hint goes 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.430
 be quite important 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.440
 despite your help going forward 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.540
 when we were in command of the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.830
 team is moving the character 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.670
 because I'm with long feather in 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.709
 add bonnies and gsl mode already 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.810
 had happened this i do not remember 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.330
 how I solved why I ask the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.280
 your opinion its helpful because you can 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.770
 remember you can have a solution yet 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.380
 consequent kit tries to keep sus with 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.560
 parent moves some parts of the scenario 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.290
 but other parts stand still and buga 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.840
 every character in the game 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.130
 if you know how to solve it will be 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.130
 extremely important 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.290
 let's really want your help to 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.239
 people will be making this space more 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.790
 forwards obviously asking the opinion 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.780
 if someone still does not know how I solved it 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.660
 To follow this part here is of the boots, right? 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.580
 I thought I had the same name will be 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.530
 cautioned serve will be again said 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.620
 now it rises down a little bit 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.420
 only this will give an opinion is the most 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.570
 in this people is creating the bottom 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.310
 also where it will give appearance only one 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.320
 day you know right if you 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.520
 football time is probably 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.800
 understand everything that I'm doing 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.410
 here people leave it there and here 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.389
 helping to spread this is very 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.580
 important, I 've always been saying this 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.040
 for you because it helped too kind 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.870
 our channel is more recognized with 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.650
 this simple action you can do 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.970
 to give us benefits there beauty 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.620
 when you know how to control the 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.750
 one-star boot preference 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.789
 better in this character a little more is 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.919
 make it more realistic not 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.000
 I know it's not so good until the 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.580
 time 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.289
 It will be a character, a man, it's ok after all. 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.990
 of accounts is a football game is more 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.449
 obviously known a man playing 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.250
 now also has female football only 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.460
 delete you ok 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.220
 and we're too fucking out of here I even can 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.530
 say I liked it 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.460
 this is the following control key 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.800
 Are you going out cutting out somebody's items? 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.720
 in that case you cut and check if 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.120
 It's good, you do not stay now, we can. 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.490
 be here in this part of the face of the 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.050
 character is good we are starting to 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.300
 improve a little, right? 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.310
 I continue on the next video, thanks for the 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.520
 your visit is worth it for you are following 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.000
 we even now still there in our 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.130
 channel on youtube and you get much more 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.770
 informed about the world of creating 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.160
 That's it, people, beauty, and 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.160
 went
