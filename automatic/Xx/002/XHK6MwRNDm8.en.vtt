00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.260

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.540

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.190

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.450
 In any case, the court first 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.930
 without laurel leaves is not for everyone 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.609

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.019
 purely their place can also holder would 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.430
