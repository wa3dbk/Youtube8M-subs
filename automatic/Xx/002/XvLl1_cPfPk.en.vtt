00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.839
 what's up friends, well, I 'm going to 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:13.759
 teach how to root on your phone 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:16.640
 in this case it is an experiment no longer 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.520
 valid warranty on your cell phone 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.770
 where they bought it 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.300
 but I do not think space is anything 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.460
 Well, it's a pretty procedure 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.840
 simple and we only need about 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.880
 files that I'm going to leave in the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.980
 description of the video 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.130
 before that we connect our cell phone 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.960
 let's do some small steps with 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.040
 so our cell phone and we must 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.500
 install this program that is called pc 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.230
 company it is important that you install 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.390
 so that the program that we are going to use 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.560
 recognize your good cell phone already 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.660
 disconnect it install it and disconnect it 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.870
 once they have installed it too 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.350
 we have to configure the phone we are going 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.230
 to configuration development options and 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.500
 we have to have activated where it says 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.900
 debug usb with a popcorn 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.020
 Well, this process I remember them is 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.030
 very simple and they bring us several advantages 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.250
 among them being able to erase 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.950
 trash apps that in Mexico brings 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.690
 telcel how could it be all of these 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.650
 gps pixel blogger ni ideas tv 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.320
 among many more and good for not 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.840
 make them longer this then we're going to 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.470
 the files that we download that are 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.110
 three we're just going to use one 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.050
 let's use the one that says rooney is a 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.740
 binary file with a we press the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.360
 button 1 and we give you enter 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.270
 then there he tells us that we connect 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.270
 our phone and I will connect it 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.910
 you already read it is important that you install in 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.610
 the program that I told them because if not 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.480
 will you recognize this and take 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.200
 account and good then the 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.899
 phone in this saying restoration 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.040
 complete is not that she has not 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.800
 recognized in the program 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.450
 We will give you a computer to restore 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.700
 my data that appears below 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.740
 we wait a little bit it's going to turn off the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.840
 device 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.010
 i 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.470
 it's a pretty simple process 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.950
 but they must do it with the steps 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.950
 suitable 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.510
 Y 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.400
 is going to turn off the phone is going to 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.910
 restart so you can install the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.590
 superuser application 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.019
 it is important that I tell you that with this 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.030
 with this application that we are going to do 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.310
 nothing is deleted from your phone is not 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.250
 delete data is not deleted applications 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.230
 but you with another application if 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.620
 can delete the junk files that are already 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.349
 I had commented 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.860
 then it is already restarting the 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:13.930
 phone we do not wait a bit I'm going to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.790
 put here remember it is important 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.480
 download rather install the program 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.000
 ps companion so you can recognize 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.910
 this program 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.710
 your phone 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.920
 remember that you can subscribe 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.020
 Share the video with all your friends 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.400
 so they can do it and not see them 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.409
 the face 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.970
 wanting to charge them too much to do 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:42.580
 this is quite simple 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.220
 subscribe 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.710
 I'm going to upload the files 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.220
 I'm going to leave the mouse in the 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:54.250
 video inscription only weigh almost 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.120
 two megabytes very well because I think that already 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.560
 it's finished loading this thing 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.000
 if we go to super user 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.000
 let's go to settings 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.000
 and we can see what it says active and activate 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.420
 superuser and says superuser is 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.120
 activated and well with this we are going 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.280
 to be able to erase the applications that 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.900
 they occupy space and are truly 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.030
 useless on our cell phone 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.699
