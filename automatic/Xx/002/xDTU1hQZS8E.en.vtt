eight so I found this on the cube robe
forms<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:33.870> apparently<00:00:34.230> they<00:00:34.320> found<00:00:34.770> it

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
forms and then apparently they found it

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.110 
forms and then apparently they found it
off<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.130> read<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.399> sorting<00:00:35.700> these<00:00:35.790> guys

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
off and read it sorting these guys

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.549 
off and read it sorting these guys
I'll<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.570> even<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> description

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
I'll have this even to the description

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.110 
I'll have this even to the description
so<00:00:38.010> once<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.280> create<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> world<00:00:38.850> you're

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so once you create the world you're

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.910 
so once you create the world you're
going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.510> want<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> head<00:00:39.930> north<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.379> until<00:00:40.829> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
going to want to head north up until you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.530 
going to want to head north up until you
find<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.730> lavvo<00:00:41.940> biome

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
find the lavvo biome

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.420 
find the lavvo biome
so<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.960> only<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.350> buy<00:00:43.530> over<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> end<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so it's only one buy over the end it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.680 
so it's only one buy over the end it
shouldn't<00:00:44.760> take<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.969> too<00:00:45.000> long<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.300> get<00:00:45.510> there

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
shouldn't take you too long to get there

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.850 
shouldn't take you too long to get there
so<00:00:46.140> here's<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.379> guys<00:00:46.469> I'm<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.770> gonna

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
hopefully speed up the clip real soon

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.510 
hopefully speed up the clip real soon
and<00:00:49.110> yeah<00:00:49.289> we'll<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.370> basically

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
and yeah we'll get to it so basically

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520 
and yeah we'll get to it so basically
some<00:00:51.059> people<00:00:51.300> may<00:00:51.390> even<00:00:51.449> confuse<00:00:51.690> us<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.350> read

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
some people may even confuse us to read

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.080 
some people may even confuse us to read
how<00:00:52.739> red<00:00:52.949> items<00:00:53.250> were<00:00:53.370> thank<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.789> world<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
how red items were thank you world and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.189 
how red items were thank you world and
I'll<00:00:54.149> slowly<00:00:54.360> explain<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> throughout<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
I'll slowly explain it throughout the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.959 
I'll slowly explain it throughout the
video<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.890> basically<00:00:56.129> red<00:00:56.370> items<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:56.940> items

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
video so basically red items are items

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.270 
video so basically red items are items
that<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:57.750> supposed<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> match<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.219> that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that are supposed to match up with that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
that are supposed to match up with that
ever<00:00:59.579> increasing<00:00:59.879> power<00:01:00.300> levels<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.960> cube

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
ever increasing power levels in cube

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.630 
ever increasing power levels in cube
world<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> think<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.489> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
world but and then I think it's just a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.250 
world but and then I think it's just a
flaw<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> system<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.449> something<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:04.049> are

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
flaw of the system or something they are

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.500 
flaw of the system or something they are
possible<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.860> find<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.460> far<00:01:05.700> I've<00:01:06.119> only

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
possible to find but so far I've only

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.090 
possible to find but so far I've only
seen<00:01:06.810> them<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:06.990> recipes<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> they<00:01:07.770> need<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> be

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
seen them in recipes and they need to be

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
seen them in recipes and they need to be
crafted<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:09.150> they're<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.810> good<00:01:09.930> as

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
crafted and then they're just as good as

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.530 
crafted and then they're just as good as
most<00:01:10.290> legendary<00:01:10.860> items<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:12.240> yeah

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
most legendary items and well yeah

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.969 
most legendary items and well yeah
that's<00:01:12.720> basically<00:01:12.930> all<00:01:13.200> there<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.710> say<00:01:13.860> about

that's basically all there to say about

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
that's basically all there to say about
red<00:01:14.159> items<00:01:14.400> their<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> apricot<00:01:15.360> I'll<00:01:15.570> not

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
red items their way to apricot I'll not

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.940 
red items their way to apricot I'll not
wait<00:01:15.869> till<00:01:16.049> her<00:01:16.170> hard<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:16.680> stronger

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
biome called Lanza's thurber now once

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.569 
biome called Lanza's thurber now once
you<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:34.770> you're<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> want<00:01:35.520> to

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
farming items as almost all the mobs are

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.170 
farming items as almost all the mobs are
possible<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.710> then<00:03:54.160> they<00:03:54.610> drop<00:03:54.850> lots<00:03:55.060> of

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
possible and then they drop lots of

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.780

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
so usually when I farm this I usually

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.730 
so usually when I farm this I usually
get<00:03:59.950> at<00:04:00.070> least<00:04:00.190> 4<00:04:00.640> or<00:04:00.730> 5<00:04:00.910> legendaries<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:02.170> I
