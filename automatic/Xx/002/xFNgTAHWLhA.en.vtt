00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.150
 as for the camera we have moved to 16 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.090
 megapixels as you can see the interface is very 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 simple and it should be noted apart from the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.759
 16 megapixels that will give us more 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.529
 information when we do the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.689
 photographs and higher quality 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.419
 these two accesses we have here one 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.820
 is the rich tone hdr and another is that of 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.520
 Selective focus with functionality 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.410
 from hdr or rich tone what we are going to do 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.059
 also in real time that is the novelty 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.890
 is in situations like the one 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:34.020
 we find here where we have a lot 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 brightness in the back and little 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.850
 brightness in the front we're going 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.960
 to be able to apply the hdr in real time and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.280
 let's see the result of the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.540
 photography that we would do right now 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 we see that the people we have in 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.200
 we could not distinguish 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.200
 the faces however if we activate it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.129
 we see how in real time it has not 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.270
 applied the hdr and we would have this would be 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.030
 the result of the photograph that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.809
 we would take it back to deactivate 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.809
 It seems 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.630
 that would be the result of photography 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.190
 can be applied in photography 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.409
 as in video and in both cases it would be in 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.990
 Real- time time with the focus 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.970
 selective what we are going to be able to do is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.970
 give depth to objects 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.679
 that are found 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.840
 objects that are in different 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.160
 planes in this case we do approach 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.690
 close with which the object that 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.790
 we have in the foreground is the one that goes to 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.200
 have relevance and greater depth and 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.760
 if we want to give relevance and 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.090
 depth to the object that we have behind 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.770
 we will press far focus and as you see 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.120
 this is the one that has been out of focus and 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.590
 that has given more relevance is the object 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.690
 that we have behind that is an effect that 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.550
 until now it was reserved for 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.960
 professional photography photography is 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.850
 denominates bokeh effect and that now we have 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.820
 incorporated for lovers of 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.980
 photography in galaxy ds5 more things to 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.800
 stand out from the camera is the autofocus 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.450
 as you see if I select an object is 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.000
 very fast that focus time is from 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.520
 0.3 seconds the example to allow then 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.140
 as moving objects images to 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.820
 athletes fijaros one object , and that 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.590
 approach not then with the little circle in 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.380
 green be player of the area very fast 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.570
 and then we would have ways that 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.310
 some of us already inherited from galaxy s 4 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.510
 like beauty face shot and more and maybe 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.459
 some more novel would already be the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.320
 virtual tour that what is going to 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.030
 allow is to go taking pictures and 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.470
 simulate a virtual tour makes a 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.819
 first picture and now it's going to 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.189
 indicate that we can move 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.950
 forward as to the left or to the 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:42.580
 I'm going to go to the left 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.370
 is going to do another photograph some more 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.640
 and we already see the result if what we're going 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.020
 to see is how it is moving you see the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.430
 virtual tour that we have done and 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.620
 also on the map it is indicating us 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.720
 where we were moving 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.100
 we could also do it in three now 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.920
 we could take a picture in 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.920
 360-degree 360-degree panorama
