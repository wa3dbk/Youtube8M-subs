00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
from both sides now I suppose that the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.950 
from both sides now I suppose that the
plastic<00:02:30.520> bag<00:02:30.670> will<00:02:30.850> work<00:02:31.000> well<00:02:31.270> as<00:02:31.450> an<00:02:31.569> inside

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
plastic bag will work well as an inside

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.230 
plastic bag will work well as an inside
lining<00:02:32.260> all<00:02:32.560> by<00:02:32.710> itself<00:02:33.100> but<00:02:33.550> mine<00:02:34.000> has<00:02:34.210> a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
lining all by itself but mine has a

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.479 
lining all by itself but mine has a
store<00:02:34.630> logo<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.290> marker<00:02:35.830> measurings<00:02:36.280> all

to construct your duct tape
honestly<00:04:43.390> that<00:04:43.540> was<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.660> hardest<00:04:43.960> part<00:04:44.080> so

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
honestly that was the hardest part so
