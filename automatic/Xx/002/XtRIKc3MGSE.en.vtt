 let's go structural tatoo here is sisal 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.959
 and that therefore will allow us to go and choose 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.499
 that is, there 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:42.309
 the settings the idea the fifth we have in the txt file 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.519
 so what' 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.040
 in fact we can not from the multiplex maximum frequented and the least 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.269

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.339
 in this case being set up laugh cpu government 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.950
 like superformance 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.360
 maximum frequency remains always something that does not happen if you can on 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.759
 demand 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:07.380
 and therefore having a long-lasting business there is more going 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.860
 calculate the frequency

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:29.269
 in my opinion setting an overclock 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.489
 so above normal 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.599
