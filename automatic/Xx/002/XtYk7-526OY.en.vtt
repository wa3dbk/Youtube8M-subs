00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
top to label it as 14 and on the side

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.289 
top to label it as 14 and on the side
from<00:01:17.220> air<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.670> air<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.330> labeled<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.049> 13<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:21.060> full

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
from air to air I labeled it 13 the full

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.550 
from air to air I labeled it 13 the full
circumference<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.259> head<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:23.210> 23<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:25.350> save

a<00:01:25.590> lot<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.920> time<00:01:26.310> by<00:01:27.000> using<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.630> napkin<00:01:28.049> method

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
a lot of time by using the napkin method

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.770 
a lot of time by using the napkin method
instead<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.400> having<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:30.420> use<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
instead of you having to just use the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.950 
instead of you having to just use the
tape<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.490> build<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.060> shape<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.930> your

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
tape to build up to that shape of your

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.410 
tape to build up to that shape of your
head<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.619> also<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> actually<00:01:35.880> start
