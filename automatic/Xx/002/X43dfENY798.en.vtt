00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.120
 just like the animatronic toys 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.190
 world xi phantom 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.160
 the new animatronics will be called 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.950
 night but we're still not sure 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.430
 but when the game comes out you will know how 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.420
 for example fredy nasser pongÃ¡is emr 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 among others 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.280
 scott count on he likes to put secrets 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.350
 in your images things that can be 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.650
 discover by making the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.630
 image by changing the colors and so on 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.540
 point is that in a bonnie image 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.590
 says the phrase was it me that would mean 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.260
 it was me or did I theories that says the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.510
 people claim that sprint track though 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.030
 we are not very sure since it is blue 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.190
 like bonnie and it was weird that the creator 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.190
 will not get bonnie in another of his games 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.870
 its release date is 31 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.650
 October 2015 this is friends will come out in 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.930
 Halloween 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.220
 that means we will live a good 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.220
 horror experience 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.600
 Well yes friends as they listen to it 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.210
 has leaked a trailer of five light 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.700
 that fredys 4 and here I put them in 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.920
 I notice that I do not know if it's the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.140
 original since it is not in the channel d 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.759
 official but good escoto without nothing more 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.759
 what to say let's see 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.310
 good 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.670
 five nine fredys 4 will be the last game 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.920
 of the whole saga only that this is not 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.050
 will have nothing to do with the story or 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.240
 that's what some of those who say 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.100
 you already know a lot about what will come out in 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.160
 this game and that I personally 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.350
 I hope it's a good game and how it will be 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.170
 the last one I hope it's the best 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.300
