have that about that much room that
about<00:01:31.200> half<00:01:31.409> an<00:01:31.530> inch<00:01:31.650> left<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:32.880> not

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
about half an inch left so it's not

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
about half an inch left so it's not
poking<00:01:33.509> into<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.020> while<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> wear<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> shirt

this<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.670> very<00:01:36.000> important<00:01:36.479> because<00:01:36.570> some

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
this is very important because some

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.899 
this is very important because some
color<00:01:37.110> stays<00:01:37.350> will<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.590> longer<00:01:37.860> or<00:01:38.400> colors

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
color stays will be longer or colors

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.730 
color stays will be longer or colors
will<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.150> shorter<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> color<00:01:40.409> stay<00:01:40.619> will

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
will be shorter but the color stay will

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.380 
will be shorter but the color stay will
be<00:01:40.829> longer<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.549> it'll<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.790> poking<00:01:42.210> into

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
be longer and then it'll be poking into

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.109 
be longer and then it'll be poking into
you<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> simple<00:01:43.680> way<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:44.579> find<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> color

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
you so the simple way just find a color

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.260 
you so the simple way just find a color
stay<00:01:45.360> goes<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.500> nicely<00:01:46.759> sticks<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
stay goes in nicely sticks out just a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940 
stay goes in nicely sticks out just a
bit<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.689> see<00:01:48.899> about<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.079> half<00:01:49.140> an<00:01:49.409> inch<00:01:49.500> there<00:01:49.829> at

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
bit we see about a half an inch there at

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.679 
bit we see about a half an inch there at
