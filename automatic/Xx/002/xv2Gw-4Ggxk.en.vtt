very small discipline to be honest I
think<00:06:58.590> this<00:06:58.770> multi<00:06:59.190> windows<00:07:00.140> idea<00:07:01.140> is<00:07:01.350> more<00:07:01.650> of

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
think this multi windows idea is more of

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.280 
think this multi windows idea is more of
a<00:07:01.980> tech<00:07:02.220> demo<00:07:02.600> well<00:07:03.600> this<00:07:03.810> looks<00:07:03.990> pretty

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
a tech demo well this looks pretty

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.900 
a tech demo well this looks pretty
smooth<00:07:04.740> but<00:07:05.070> as<00:07:05.190> soon<00:07:05.310> as<00:07:05.370> I'm<00:07:05.550> switching<00:07:05.700> over

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
smooth but as soon as I'm switching over

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.400 
smooth but as soon as I'm switching over
to<00:07:06.060> the<00:07:06.270> budgets<00:07:07.220> they<00:07:08.220> are<00:07:08.370> supposed<00:07:08.700> to<00:07:09.410> well

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
to the budgets they are supposed to well

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.870 
to the budgets they are supposed to well
that's<00:07:10.590> the<00:07:10.710> demonstration<00:07:11.400> is<00:07:11.520> like<00:07:11.700> right

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
that's the demonstration is like right

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.350 
that's the demonstration is like right
now<00:07:12.120> anyways<00:07:13.050> this<00:07:13.620> was<00:07:13.920> an<00:07:14.640> opt-in<00:07:15.060> I've<00:07:15.210> been

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
now anyways this was an opt-in I've been

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.840 
now anyways this was an opt-in I've been
really<00:07:15.540> waiting<00:07:15.990> for<00:07:16.290> and<00:07:16.530> I've<00:07:17.520> been<00:07:17.670> really

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850 
really waiting for and I've been really

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.670 
really waiting for and I've been really
looked<00:07:18.060> there<00:07:18.660> you<00:07:18.810> saw<00:07:19.050> this<00:07:19.110> little<00:07:19.380> leg

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.290 
again I've been really waiting for it is

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.190 
again I've been really waiting for it is
way<00:07:22.890> faster<00:07:23.490> compared<00:07:24.330> to<00:07:24.420> the<00:07:24.540> version<00:07:24.900> with

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
way faster compared to the version with

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 
four point oh point for if i'm not

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.000

mistaken now with jellybean you're
getting<00:07:32.250> a<00:07:32.310> lot<00:07:32.520> of<00:07:32.550> extra<00:07:33.000> features<00:07:33.210> you're

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 
getting a lot of extra features you're

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.950 
getting a lot of extra features you're
definitely<00:07:34.550> getting<00:07:35.550> more<00:07:35.940> performance<00:07:36.840> out

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 
definitely getting more performance out

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.270 
definitely getting more performance out
of<00:07:37.050> your<00:07:37.290> Galaxy<00:07:37.800> Note<00:07:37.890> it's<00:07:38.010> kind<00:07:38.190> of

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 
of your Galaxy Note it's kind of

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.760 
of your Galaxy Note it's kind of
reanimating<00:07:39.000> the<00:07:39.150> original<00:07:39.900> samsung<00:07:40.350> galaxy

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:40.770

guess<00:07:42.540> it<00:07:42.990> would<00:07:43.140> even<00:07:43.530> get<00:07:43.710> a<00:07:43.890> little<00:07:44.370> bit

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460 
guess it would even get a little bit

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.790 
guess it would even get a little bit
more<00:07:44.640> of<00:07:44.880> battery<00:07:45.510> life<00:07:45.750> out<00:07:46.020> of<00:07:46.050> this<00:07:46.290> that's

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 
more of battery life out of this that's
