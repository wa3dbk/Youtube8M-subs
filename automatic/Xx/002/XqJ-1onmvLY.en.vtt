so<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.420> substitution<00:02:40.750> right<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:41.860> where

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
so the substitution right this is where

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.009 
so the substitution right this is where
I<00:02:42.370> draw<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:43.030> idea<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.420> substitution<00:02:43.900> method

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
I draw this idea the substitution method

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.190 
I draw this idea the substitution method
is<00:02:44.319> you<00:02:45.310> create<00:02:45.790> similar<00:02:46.209> meals<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.930> follow

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
is you create similar meals that follow

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.650 
is you create similar meals that follow
the<00:02:47.380> culture<00:02:47.830> but<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:48.700> still<00:02:48.910> good<00:02:49.510> inside

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
the culture but it's still good inside

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.390 
the culture but it's still good inside
your<00:02:49.930> body<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.560> case<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.860> Putin<00:02:51.220> I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
your body so in the case of Putin I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.449 
your body so in the case of Putin I
would<00:02:51.910> add<00:02:52.060> sweet<00:02:52.480> potato<00:02:52.840> fries<00:02:53.200> low<00:02:54.130> fat

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
would add sweet potato fries low fat

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.180 
would add sweet potato fries low fat
cheese<00:02:54.819> olive<00:02:55.780> oil<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.410> that's<00:02:56.709> about<00:02:56.829> it<00:02:56.980> and

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
cheese olive oil and that's about it and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.000 
cheese olive oil and that's about it and
maybe<00:02:57.430> some<00:02:57.670> salt<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:59.170> they're<00:02:59.319> right

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
maybe some salt and that they're right

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.559 
maybe some salt and that they're right
there<00:03:00.280> you'd<00:03:00.489> have<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.670> good<00:03:00.910> replacement<00:03:01.209> for

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
there you'd have a good replacement for

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.390 
there you'd have a good replacement for
Putin<00:03:02.079> you<00:03:02.620> wouldn't<00:03:02.920> come<00:03:03.010> with<00:03:03.190> all<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
Putin you wouldn't come with all the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.550 
Putin you wouldn't come with all the
health<00:03:03.549> problems<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.720> case<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.079> pasta<00:03:05.470> you
