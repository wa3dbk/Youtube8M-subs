I<00:03:02.790> think<00:03:03.790> Jason<00:03:04.000> muttered<00:03:04.540> something<00:03:04.840> but<00:03:05.170> I

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
I think Jason muttered something but I

chose to ignore that who would have just
escalated<00:03:07.599> I<00:03:07.840> felt<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.650> could<00:03:08.860> probably

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
escalated I felt that I could probably

did sort out Peters hold because I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.240 
did sort out Peters hold because I
thought<00:03:14.079> he<00:03:14.140> wouldn't<00:03:14.500> react<00:03:14.769> like<00:03:14.920> some<00:03:15.159> of
