pretty well except for the controls
which<00:00:25.080> are<00:00:25.350> kind<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.430> tough<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:27.029> used<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
which are kind of tough to get used to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.320 
which are kind of tough to get used to
after<00:00:29.220> I've<00:00:29.340> played<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.939> while<00:00:30.090> I've

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
after I've played it for a while I've

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.090 
after I've played it for a while I've
started<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.679> bit<00:00:31.890> more<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.630> I

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
started to like it a bit more but I

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
started to like it a bit more but I
still<00:00:35.100> run<00:00:35.309> across<00:00:35.670> times<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.480> tough

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
still run across times when it's tough

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.160 
still run across times when it's tough
to<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.680> precise<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> controls<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.239> how

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
to be precise with the controls here how

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.380 
to be precise with the controls here how
they<00:00:40.350> work<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.820> touch<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
they work is you have to touch in the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
they work is you have to touch in the
center<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> groups<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
center of one of the groups here and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.560 
center of one of the groups here and
then<00:00:45.000> spin<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:46.100> but<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.910> really<00:00:48.180> tough<00:00:48.510> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
then spin it but it's really tough to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.889 
then spin it but it's really tough to
pick<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.649> correct<00:00:49.829> center<00:00:50.840> like<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:53.870> time<00:00:54.870> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
pick the correct center like that time I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.689 
pick the correct center like that time I
picked<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.440> correctly<00:00:55.920> about<00:00:56.100> other<00:00:56.340> times

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
picked it correctly about other times

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.240 
picked it correctly about other times
you<00:00:57.690> might<00:00:57.870> accidentally<00:00:58.440> pick<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:58.980> next

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you might accidentally pick the one next

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
you might accidentally pick the one next
to<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.850> they're<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.989> close<00:01:01.260> together

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
to it and they're all so close together

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.429 
to it and they're all so close together
on<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.000> little<00:01:03.000> mobile<00:01:03.270> phone<00:01:03.629> screen<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.290> it

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
on a little mobile phone screen that it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.820 
on a little mobile phone screen that it
does<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.830> tricky<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.489> play<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.560> then<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
does get tricky to play and then if you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.469 
does get tricky to play and then if you
made<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.220> wrong<00:01:08.430> selection<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.299> then<00:01:09.390> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
made the wrong selection and then you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.230 
made the wrong selection and then you
want<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> let<00:01:09.900> go<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.970> kind

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
want to let go this one you have to kind

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.140 
want to let go this one you have to kind
of<00:01:12.390> figure<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.350> where<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.070> used<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.820> in

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
of figure out where it used to be in

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.850 
of figure out where it used to be in
order<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.630> let<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> go<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> make<00:01:16.320> sure<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
order to let it go to make sure that you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.370 
order to let it go to make sure that you
don't<00:01:17.009> accidentally<00:01:17.729> spin<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.930> somewhere<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
don't accidentally spin it somewhere and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.780 
don't accidentally spin it somewhere and
you<00:01:19.920> didn't<00:01:20.220> mean<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.549> spin<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you didn't mean to spin it so the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.999 
you didn't mean to spin it so the
controls<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> game<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:25.049> slightly<00:01:25.740> an

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
controls on the game are slightly an

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.760 
controls on the game are slightly an
issue<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.290> it's<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.530> disappointing

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
issue here and it's really disappointing

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.920 
issue here and it's really disappointing
because<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.939> Zune<00:01:30.750> HD<00:01:30.990> version<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.979> hectic

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
because the Zune HD version of hectic

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.440 
because the Zune HD version of hectic
actually<00:01:33.930> has<00:01:34.110> better<00:01:34.530> controls<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
actually has better controls here of

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.510 
actually has better controls here of
course<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> games<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.320> lot<00:01:37.680> smaller<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
course the games a lot smaller on the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.510 
course the games a lot smaller on the
zoom<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:40.170> what<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.220> drag

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
zoom here but what you do is you drag

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240 
zoom here but what you do is you drag
here<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.259> actually<00:01:43.649> visually

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
here and then you can actually visually

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.219 
here and then you can actually visually
see<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.759> your<00:01:44.909> selection<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
see what your selection is there and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.440 
see what your selection is there and
then<00:01:46.530> spin<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:50.430> makes<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.820> game<00:01:50.970> much

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
then spin it that makes the game much

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.670 
then spin it that makes the game much
easier<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.320> way<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:53.040> accurate<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.729> play

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
easier and way more accurate to play

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.340 
easier and way more accurate to play
besides<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.979> normal<00:01:56.670> gameplay<00:01:57.600> mode<00:01:58.110> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
can and try to make those clusters or

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.779 
can and try to make those clusters or
the<00:02:06.570> honeycombs<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.409> call<00:02:07.680> them<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.039> one

the honeycombs they call them of one
color<00:02:09.090> which<00:02:09.390> then<00:02:09.599> gets<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> flower

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
color which then gets you a flower

and then if you make
Honeycomb<00:02:11.939> of<00:02:12.150> those<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:13.170> get<00:02:13.439> a<00:02:13.579> little
