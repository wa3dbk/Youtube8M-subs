00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
play that wouldn't be blatantly

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.460 
play that wouldn't be blatantly
technically<00:02:46.280> at<00:02:46.400> or<00:02:46.579> even<00:02:47.510> one<00:02:47.630> degree<00:02:47.959> okay

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
technically at or even one degree okay

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.550 
technically at or even one degree okay
hey<00:02:48.709> but<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:50.389> interesting<00:02:50.750> thing<00:02:50.959> about<00:02:51.170> it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
hey but the interesting thing about it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.550 
hey but the interesting thing about it
is<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.709> it's<00:02:52.100> some<00:02:52.870> from<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.959> bowling<00:02:54.319> point

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
is that it's some from a bowling point

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.809 
is that it's some from a bowling point
of<00:02:54.650> view<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.870> if<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:58.130> both<00:02:58.370> smart

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
of view is that you if you both smart

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.960 
of view is that you if you both smart
okay<00:02:59.510> then<00:03:00.350> used<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.310> shebar<00:03:01.670> well<00:03:01.819> you

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
okay then used to shebar well you

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.879 
okay then used to shebar well you
probably<00:03:02.180> use<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:02.930> lot<00:03:03.079> more<00:03:03.109> variety<00:03:03.680> than<00:03:03.709> you

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
probably use a lot more variety than you

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.440 
probably use a lot more variety than you
would<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.430> your<00:03:04.549> money<00:03:04.639> go<00:03:04.790> for<00:03:04.970> us<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.209> do<00:03:05.329> it

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
would and your money go for us to do it

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.000 
would and your money go for us to do it
but<00:03:05.569> surely<00:03:06.350> a<00:03:06.380> length<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:06.739> going<00:03:06.889> to<00:03:06.950> be

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
but surely a length it's going to be

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.960 
but surely a length it's going to be
good<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.220> direction<00:03:07.459> can<00:03:07.670> be<00:03:07.730> good<00:03:07.910> but

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
good the direction can be good but

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.020 
good the direction can be good but
mainly<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:08.959> variety<00:03:09.380> side<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.829> will<00:03:10.100> be

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
mainly the variety side of it will be

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.430 
mainly the variety side of it will be
not<00:03:11.150> have<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.109> be<00:03:12.230> spot-on<00:03:12.950> okay<00:03:13.579> i<00:03:14.329> think<00:03:15.019> one

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
not have to be spot-on okay i think one

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.330 
not have to be spot-on okay i think one
of<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.590> keys<00:03:15.799> is<00:03:15.829> fielding

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
of the keys is fielding

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.390 
of the keys is fielding
game<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.819> think<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.420> know<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.599> say<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:20.310> know

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
game I think you know you say you know

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.100 
game I think you know you say you know
10<00:03:20.670> runs<00:03:20.879> of<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.060> field<00:03:21.269> that's<00:03:21.450> that's

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
10 runs of the field that's that's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.190 
10 runs of the field that's that's
almost<00:03:22.530> enough<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.790> win<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.330> game<00:03:24.629> yet<00:03:24.989> you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
almost enough to win the game yet you

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.410 
almost enough to win the game yet you
say<00:03:25.650> 10<00:03:25.890> more<00:03:26.040> than<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.250> other<00:03:26.370> okay<00:03:27.000> so

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
say 10 more than the other okay so

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.960 
say 10 more than the other okay so
that's<00:03:27.720> where<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:27.989> backup<00:03:28.200> your<00:03:28.349> bowlers<00:03:28.800> and

that's where you backup your bowlers and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.339 
that's where you backup your bowlers and
boldly<00:03:29.970> need<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.330> lot<00:03:30.569> more<00:03:30.599> support<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.230> this

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
boldly need a lot more support in this

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.020
