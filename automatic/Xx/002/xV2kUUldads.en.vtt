 a museum for your family still growing 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.539
 may be worth thinking about compact less 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.640
 powerful machines for those who have little space 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.800
 The best choice is the compact one, therefore 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.629
 get ready to choose size rule

 her world and think immediately about 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.409
 combination of design and power 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.980
 surely there is a native version let's start with 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.350
 top-loaded models 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.520
 what method of loading the top dill for 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.890
 new frontal girl 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.230
 opening up the door helps Rat 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.850
 they use space high 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.800
 reliability and quiet operation make it 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.170
 faithful and compact assistant for 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.210
 washing on tau book but at the same time 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.190
 assortment number of programs and price 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.050
 such cars sometimes act their 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.000
 front loading brethren 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.310
 and you need to collect all the things from the cover 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.320
 with each wash can add a question 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.540
 Russian cars are traditional 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.100
 count on you there such machines also 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.360
 have a small load and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.670
 fit even the smallest 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.930
 room but if space is enough 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.390
 think and 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.860
 maybe it's worth taking a bigger model 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.350
 size really matters 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.149
 large drum capacity means over 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.560
 you can do more laundry once 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.560
 what savings 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.230
 and finally pay attention to 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.330
 ultramodern smart models 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.400
 they cost a little more but I feel 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.560
 it is justified by emotionality 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.240
 thanks to innovative design 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.690
 features such machines for only 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.700
 the wall 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.340
 impose a wash program on any 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.170
 taste for every kind of fabric and all that 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.190
 with economical water consumption and 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.140
 detergents 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.440
 quick wash or delay function 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.440
 start 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.530
 functions varies depending on 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.060
 model many have display allows 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.590
 set and washed individual 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.160
 wash options so you can 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.280
 make sure your machine erases 2 too 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.930
 as it is highly wildly logical and we will not 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.030
 forget about the environment 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.130
 remember that the machine with the icon 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.470
 save water or this energy 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.870
 which means less used for quality 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.370
