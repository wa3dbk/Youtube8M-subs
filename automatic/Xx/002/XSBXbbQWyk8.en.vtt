00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
of a throwback team they're a little bit

more of a smashmouth team but that's

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.280 
more of a smashmouth team but that's
that's<00:03:23.639> really<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.090> good<00:03:24.269> thing<00:03:24.510> but<00:03:24.720> when

yards per game below their normal

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.990 
yards per game below their normal
average<00:03:39.870> think<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:40.949> game<00:03:41.189> should<00:03:41.370> stay<00:03:41.669> in

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
average think this game should stay in

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.030 
average think this game should stay in
the<00:03:42.120> lower<00:03:42.629> 40s<00:03:43.169> and<00:03:43.349> again<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.680> woman's

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
the lower 40s and again the woman's

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.349 
the lower 40s and again the woman's
they're<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> team<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.729> was<00:03:44.759> supposed<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.209> have

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
they're a team that was supposed to have

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.629 
they're a team that was supposed to have
an<00:03:45.479> improved<00:03:45.810> defense<00:03:46.290> at<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.189> beginning<00:03:47.579> of

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
an improved defense at the beginning of

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.249 
an improved defense at the beginning of
the<00:03:47.759> year<00:03:47.970> they're<00:03:48.150> finally<00:03:48.629> showing<00:03:49.049> some

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
the year they're finally showing some

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.140 
the year they're finally showing some
signs<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:49.949> that<00:03:50.009> in<00:03:50.250> recent<00:03:50.430> weeks<00:03:50.699> and<00:03:51.030> i

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
signs of that in recent weeks and i

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.170 
signs of that in recent weeks and i
think<00:03:51.419> that<00:03:51.569> new<00:03:51.930> orleans<00:03:52.400> their<00:03:53.400> talent<00:03:54.000> is

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
think that new orleans their talent is

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.270 
think that new orleans their talent is
on<00:03:54.930> defense<00:03:55.379> is<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.590> little<00:03:55.799> bit<00:03:55.889> better<00:03:56.009> than

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
on defense is a little bit better than

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.439 
on defense is a little bit better than
their<00:03:56.430> production<00:03:56.909> so<00:03:57.060> i<00:03:57.090> think<00:03:57.180> their

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
their production so i think their

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.270 
their production so i think their
defense<00:03:57.810> has<00:03:57.900> an<00:03:58.139> upside<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:59.009> point

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
defense has an upside so the point

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.249 
defense has an upside so the point
that's<00:03:59.430> why<00:03:59.639> i<00:03:59.669> have<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.090> premium<00:04:00.720> play<00:04:00.930> on<00:04:01.169> the

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:01.259 
that's why i have a premium play on the
