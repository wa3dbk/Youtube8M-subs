 In short, what is this very simple 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.239
 every Wednesday at the end of the afternoon 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.730
 early evening bah I post down a 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.350

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.799
 foodies forgiveness in comment so 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.180
 here is the gap before plunging me 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.650
 in the in the subject and you while that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.880
 you have not bad who makes the subject of which 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.460
 you saw it in the title of the video 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.950
 but bah I propose a small gameplay 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.720
 rather original and friendly 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.610

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.960
 cheap good go guys we're huge 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.600
 what no one who even if I come from 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.979
 pick up a msr obviously in 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.950
 equipment I think you start to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.130
 to know me 6.4 at their assets down to 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.380
 all looters assassins and pro tracker 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.520
 biensir course not new, of course 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.170
 the specialist assets that are 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.490
 determining trick tower and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 recognition for those who like it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.360
 because these recognitions pro soon 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.829
 that I put a little ball on 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.930
 the enemy is visible on the map 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.850
 for a few seconds before I the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.560
 kill so that's for those who did not know 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.360
 not and who wondered why a 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.320

 today what will it be 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.450
 in short if you would have won the lotto legacy 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.590
 you would have won the knockout what you 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.390

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.950
 gain is simply 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.110
 but of course with the best 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.030

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.659
 respect then frankly 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.729
 so here are the gas pipelines maemo bea btp 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:27.479
 is in the company of two subscribers m6 jean 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.460
 zoé m6 neither too well the same team I 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.320
 think you have noticed and a 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.750
 little surprise that will arrive soon 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.370
