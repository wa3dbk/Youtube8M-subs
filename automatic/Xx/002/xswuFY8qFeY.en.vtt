00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Hmm 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:21.300
 Please tell me the tweet to the battery Yes this time there are three kinds of power supply 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.310
 Beneath me was available solutions 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:31.260
 At first, the place where it was an artist and the same thing as the one bundled with the body 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.619
 Use the original type at home or use the type at the office 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.059
 In that way 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.329
 I will prepare as a single building separately in the form that you can use it 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.329
 Was 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.579
 Subsequently, though here I'm a car adapter to so that it can be charged also in the car 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.579
 This allowed solutions Mogo locked we have 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:57.059
 It will be another one, but 4 double charger after 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.200
 If this can be thought of as an external power of an 8 piece beater this is strange 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.280
 I think it's ok 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.980
 All of the solutions uh carpet you are here used to what the wind 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.150
 I use it with usb cable though 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.020
 usb cable 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.020
 That is gotten by 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:20.540
 Carry in the state where Oh it opposite plants have already been charged in 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:24.920
 It will be in the form of gymnastic that can be charged on the outside wearing in ps vita This is convenient though 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.060
 It doesn't seem so bulky, does it sound like it does not matter 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.350
 Do you have much 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:37.070
 So the longer time it will be in allo-switch time of about two times the roughly 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.070
 Might is likely to burn that you think you have and I think we'll place 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:47.870
 In psd and how do you think it will be used and how it is put in 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.870
 East This time, we were allowed to provide such a cradle 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.370
 Yes 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.450
 It also has a design that is very easy to store with the ps vita body. 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.350
 not to mention 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.820
 Have you put it on your desk in this way and it's the last train 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.270
 I think that you can use it to exchange data with ps 3 pc 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.490
 I will 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:16.320
 A little bit to remove it it is this're Moni Hey design 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:21.090
 I just Aru have put it but'm that really inconspicuous not get in the way design 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:26.460
 It's always beautiful or fashionable and when you wear that ps vita on it 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.840
 Softening Do Well Masu'm I here design to those nice little parentheses in the room 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.480
 Orimashi stuck to the very 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.019
 The same designer as the main body design a building 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.260
 As we do home design of cradle, it is seal, but such kind of feelings of feelings 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.980
 That's right but that's very simple and yet 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.629
 I think it was finished in the form of something very good in terms of design 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.769
 Angle What might I but it is exquisite Well etc. ideal for when you'll see this screen 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.330
 In the form of an angle 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:56.520
 Than we are allowed to change the angle of the square 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.240
 I think you also like a how to use try waking Panamax line is also So things like view Oite 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.530
 I agree 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.370
 Do not put a thing such a Toka is a video content that is contained within the Once was here. 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.950
 You can enjoy it and it may be big but it and it 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.319
 That is Well new use as Eater also as yet another Hey window 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.350
 person 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:20.730
 I think that you may use it when you see your head in the space of 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.720
 I think that truly Do I want to de Sony though that I've heard many you speak 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.770
 Whole was also this psd Customers can also choose to show the crisis of the peripheral and is doing this it is the place 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.220
 I do say that the spirit of the 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:34.410
 It means that the mold will be coming to you, but as it goes back to Watanabe, ps vita 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.340
 I say this being based on the charm 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.090
 Let's make things 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.870
 Will be 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:46.049
 That's right 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:47.519
 After all, it is in the form that various people are involved and made up in making things. 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.659
 Even though it has 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:56.970
 A firm grasp of the things that everyone piece beater the spirit of the Tanihara 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:58.260
 In in mind that if we enliven this how and especially with regard to peripheral 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.860
 Than we have done at 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.020
 face beater himself 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.890
 Distribute this as it is attractive 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:11.390
 I We are doing become a focus and Temecula-chan to be like that how we go liven up 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:17.360
 Happiness is as if everyone is sharing ideas centered on gold 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:23.120
 It is very happy and it was able to be reflected in sweet form also in the pretty good valley product 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:26.750
 I think so I think this time of the proceeds not it was accompanied by quite good 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.680
 Or I that I Fuwa that what I mean everyone is altogether good things fall apart 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.910
 Even if I try to make something to write , I still do it in combination and say such a sense of unity 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.540
 I can not come out 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:42.620
 After all what happens there when everyone goes together and makes it extremely easy to use and enjoy 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.139
 Result You can see the nail design is also beautiful just look a bit like this 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.080
 so 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:54.930
 Well, there was a lot of controversy before this really made that quite final product 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:05:00.120
 Of course I don't go to a certain point, but quite heated arguments 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.639
 That is the fact that everyone, even on a stack go plunge in the final product to convince 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.979
 Because I did not compromise only the work 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:12.539
 The same is true for designers and for myself, and while thinking about various things, it is various 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.750
 I keep doing under the idea that let's create something final round good while the discussion 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.920
 The 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:20.500
 Everyone's movies match the vibration 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:26.140
 In Te feeling work together is like a being leaves after the various Kamine conflict 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:31.690
 Well, yes, it's really exactly what you said and it's really completely number one and enjoyable disease 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:34.910
 It's hard to know, but it's fun It's fun I think it's fun 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:39.620
 The process of getting things done 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.030
 Especially for this new one, ps vita 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.200
 Follow 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.820
 Tteyuu Well one is going to build up a totally new from the perspective of the peripherals 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.770
 All from one 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.550
 It was a very good experience because I was able to be tapped have finished the thing is racketeer 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.060
 The 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.160
 Oh say you are also Zu' camera that can also be a Do that to and was able to very good experience 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.490
