00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello everyone is like it was with a new one 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:14.519
 video 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:17.220
 yes they are but they imply so much 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.070
 he chose me the punishment I have no evening 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.480
 woke up I did several things and therefore 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.090
 I'm still alive, I'm not yet 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.000
 therefore change should result is eye after 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.559
 here in it mine is a little bit 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.690
 make up and clear then i hope you 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.690
 don't be tired of it 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.920
 I will try saw combos and new 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.170
 other tip mainly understood in 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:57.470
 appears andrea actually i should start 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.780
 always in the same place where I worked 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.850
 so if you're wondering where they are 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.730
 for three months 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:13.830
 I must turnover abroad made by kiko 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:17.520
 that you think the mystery is revealed and I have 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.070
 washed foundation precisely for three months e 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.110
 I must say that it was a beautiful one 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.479
 experience with very very heavy 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.810
 because I didn't do 40 hours anyway 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.030
 in short, then enough 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:37.670
 challenging though for an experience 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.070
 liked it is a very serious company then 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.550
 not seen with a mega from 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:50.520
 from the outside that is when I was there customers 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:52.590
 I didn't think that under up ie the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.539
 orders now, however, see how 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:03.420
 obviously to follow and then do with it 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:05.750
 part is very intense we say that 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.750
 anyway 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.020
 he asks, that is, there are memories he writes 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.100
 comment it is not possible to say who I am 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:22.480
 things about the company and so here is yes 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:28.480
 really slow very serious and therefore vi 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.160
 like from the company probably 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.410
 in my opinion also changed a little 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.460
 politics in recent years because 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.950
 there are also heaven for the 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.070
 training to reconvert then 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.900
 now in the running if we are formed by 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.030
 to remove an alternative state power 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.810
 however, I am not a nation even for 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:55.960
 they now practically ought to 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.910
 theory started they did a 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.820
 contact that I just have to sign is missing 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.360
 only the signing of the contract for others 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.640
 three months 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.209
 and well maybe you could be there 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.310
 word for other trains every six months 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.520
 so we'll see this thing here I have to 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:18.450
 sign the contract so I meanwhile 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.450
 falasco foundation here the medit cast of 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.129
 and therefore this I must say however not 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.989
 the ball is good from cairo because every 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:34.840
 every month to these things 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.940
 then I will put in this brick which I say 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:48.599
 that in the old collection to give you 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:48.599
 game that night over on May 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.410
 apart from the kiko team 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.620
 I have to say that working with people 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.300
 you too as customers and two why 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:20.060
 sometimes the arrival of typical customers e 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:23.360
 the tenancy careful and it seems at all 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.360
 the sum 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:35.229
 here is this pencil those in the anchor 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.960
 in the eye I simplify most 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:41.289
 we will find genetic things but if 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:46.150
 on the 15th I thought of course now 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:51.759
 even more so by working there too 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:58.180
 test the products I like to buy them but 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:05:01.650
 it is definitely no sales or kind of van 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.650
 basten products 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.770
 ok 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.530
 a single time 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.530
 on the sea 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:41.900
 and then switched to the ford that this one though 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:41.900
 here on the map this is the desert rose 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:54.750
 it seems to me just because I don't write maybe it is 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:59.310
 only the impression then had the mascara 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:06.090
 the old then but really my new one 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:10.080
 marco lipstick because he saw that 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:14.100
 frank two times and I think taken precisely 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:19.190
 I took a respective macca 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:26.100
 finally, dal Ã¨ vero is not a lipstick 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:30.750
 mortgage but I wanted and just nearby 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.940
 so the socket is genuinely not 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.900
 through much the behavior of 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:39.710
 macca guys because it came in not me 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.710
 they hurt 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.479
 I did all alone 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.830
 the only one who could not say look 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:55.880
 fed my trampoline to the bear 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:07:07.950
 for illustrated they would have said no enough 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:10.560
 but collect a trivial one and then have them 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.720
 there is not late here without leaving me 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.550
 as a minimum of samples it is true that 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:19.910
 I'm 19 here is the less than 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.910
 sympathy here 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:37.059
 that not extending a euro 90 when 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:41.129
 19 in short, put here is the finished trick 

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:41.129
 we commit hello
