for you my test piece is a lamination of

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.859 
for you my test piece is a lamination of
beech<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.469> ash<00:01:18.819> this<00:01:19.819> is<00:01:20.030> interesting<00:01:20.630> for

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
beech and ash this is interesting for

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.250 
beech and ash this is interesting for
the<00:01:21.020> test<00:01:21.289> process

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.860 

I<00:01:29.710> apply<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.740> liberal<00:01:31.010> amount<00:01:31.310> of<00:01:31.790> oil<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:32.720> let

I apply a liberal amount of oil and let

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.200 
I apply a liberal amount of oil and let
it<00:01:32.990> soak<00:01:33.200> for<00:01:33.260> about<00:01:33.530> ten<00:01:33.920> minutes<00:01:34.180> then<00:01:35.180> I

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
it soak for about ten minutes then I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:44.680 
it soak for about ten minutes then I
wipe<00:01:35.480> off<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:36.110> excess<00:01:43.270> after<00:01:44.270> three<00:01:44.480> days

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
wipe off the excess after three days

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.480 
wipe off the excess after three days
it's<00:01:45.170> fully<00:01:45.500> cured<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.700> looks<00:01:46.910> nice

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
I add a bit more polyurethane to the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.300 
I add a bit more polyurethane to the
blend<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.520> speed<00:01:51.790> up<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.150> puring<00:01:52.510> process<00:01:52.960> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
blend to speed up the puring process and
