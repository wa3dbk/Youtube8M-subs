00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.210 

normal<00:03:19.900> about<00:03:20.110> this<00:03:20.170> look<00:03:20.560> at<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.830> finding<00:03:21.160> a

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
normal about this look at it finding a

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.040 
normal about this look at it finding a
way<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.370> face<00:03:21.700> up<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.940> get<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.240> shot<00:03:22.510> off<00:03:22.540> takes

way to face up to get a shot off takes

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.240 
way to face up to get a shot off takes
it<00:03:23.170> all<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.349> us<00:03:23.410> from<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.620> end<00:03:23.830> line<00:03:23.980> comes

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
it all of us from the end line comes

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.490 
it all of us from the end line comes
back<00:03:24.489> again<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.120> think<00:03:25.180> she's<00:03:25.540> crossing<00:03:26.200> the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
back again I think she's crossing the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.320 
back again I think she's crossing the
ball<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.040> turns<00:03:27.250> into<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.550> beautiful<00:03:28.030> shot

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
ball but it turns into a beautiful shot

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.080 
ball but it turns into a beautiful shot
and<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:29.470> also<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:30.130> thinkin<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:30.760> maybe<00:03:30.910> the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
and I also the thinkin that maybe the

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.710 
and I also the thinkin that maybe the
goalkeeper<00:03:31.540> thought<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.810> was<00:03:31.930> going<00:03:32.140> wide<00:03:32.470> I

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
goalkeeper thought it was going wide I

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.100 
goalkeeper thought it was going wide I
think<00:03:34.720> so<00:03:35.020> boom<00:03:36.120> penalty<00:03:37.120> kicks<00:03:37.420> would<00:03:37.840> follow

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
think so boom penalty kicks would follow

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.229 
think so boom penalty kicks would follow
