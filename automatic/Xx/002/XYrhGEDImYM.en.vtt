00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.299
 onomi 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.850
 I want to congratulate the metalworker with a victory 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.980
 I think so that I do not believe 30 why 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.930
 that in the end we already risked there cheese 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.960
 bun 10 and 3 can be said that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.689
 last whether it bears not 30 why 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.600
 got the last they were scored at 91 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.920
 93 in my opinion 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.170
 a couple lost trading him anyway 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.480
 was 21 or 31 missed went for 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.730
 risked missing a goal and when we already 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.760
 so risked guys prr 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.370
 That is, I do not think the bill is 30 and yes 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.050
 Of course a lot. Well, what can we do? 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.470
 risked us go nowhere was that 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.840
 104 but then we certainly did not have enough 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.130
 follow why 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.409
 my role prefabricated and clear her foot 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.360
 well, and the mud itself we did not have enough freshness 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.189
 it was already clear that after 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.259
 the ending of the game was probably not enough 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.799
 freshness why because many crayfish 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:19.719
 were teams played for 90 minutes flights 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:22.210
 were we practically got only 13 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.399
 numbers therefore freshness is clearly not enough 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.619
 Kamanin that's sharing hard riga will not 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.329
 adore show and screaming football won 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.280
 football 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.979
 although getting my coaching job though 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.130
 everything else is what you saw in detail 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.410
 writes 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.210
 No questions, write what you want more 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.210
 ruined 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.280
 Well what do you do since we do not 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.250
 bought almost all the national team who 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.440
 the horns of the national teams do nothing but 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.110
 In general, I think that the second secret I 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.790
 fully satisfied 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.440
 Basically, in principle, I remove take 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.460
 I am but generally I am the second half of the match 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.090
 audience width to 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.659
 the team failed I would like to apologize 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.600
 before the first turn or viewers 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.580
 30,000 come a fancy i think that 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.980
 the team is moving forward and will 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.180
 look decent 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.569
 mayhem just mayhem and do not know how 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:27.959
 can trade one foul take a drive st 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:31.230
 so guys trying to fight but so 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:36.320
 don't mind guys why did they come to 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:44.400
 dressing room before my like was 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:46.110
 Why not train it is impossible to have to need 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.560
 understand why the team is roomy 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.560
 doesn't run
