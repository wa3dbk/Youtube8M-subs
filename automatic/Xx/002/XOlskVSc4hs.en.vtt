of the leaves are off and the reason for

of the leaves are off and the reason for
that<00:00:36.739> is<00:00:37.010> is<00:00:37.250> because<00:00:37.399> frankly<00:00:38.149> you<00:00:38.300> can<00:00:38.390> see

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
that is is because frankly you can see

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.229 
that is is because frankly you can see
what<00:00:38.719> you're<00:00:38.899> doing<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:39.800> you<00:00:40.579> can<00:00:40.789> prune<00:00:41.030> off

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
what you're doing and you can prune off

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.779 
what you're doing and you can prune off
the<00:00:41.449> little<00:00:41.660> twigs<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:42.500> they<00:00:42.980> don't<00:00:43.219> reform

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
the little twigs and they don't reform

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.330 
the little twigs and they don't reform
before<00:00:44.180> bloom<00:00:44.719> because<00:00:45.350> you<00:00:45.710> see<00:00:45.920> you<00:00:46.100> want

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
before bloom because you see you want

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.819 
before bloom because you see you want
your<00:00:46.579> bloom<00:00:46.850> on<00:00:47.180> peaches<00:00:48.079> plums<00:00:48.530> and

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
your bloom on peaches plums and

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.670 
your bloom on peaches plums and
nectarines<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.760> happen<00:00:50.180> on<00:00:50.329> bigger<00:00:51.019> limbs<00:00:51.350> not

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
nectarines to happen on bigger limbs not

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.650 
nectarines to happen on bigger limbs not
a<00:00:51.739> little<00:00:51.980> bitty<00:00:52.129> twigs<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.149> when<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:53.420> prune

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
a little bitty twigs so when you prune

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.779 
a little bitty twigs so when you prune
those<00:00:53.899> off<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.469> prune<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:54.949> tips<00:00:55.219> off<00:00:55.460> of<00:00:55.670> your

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
those off and prune the tips off of your

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.240 
those off and prune the tips off of your
end<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.269> a<00:00:56.719> good<00:00:56.929> rule<00:00:57.109> of<00:00:57.140> thumb<00:00:57.320> there<00:00:57.769> is<00:00:58.010> to

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
end and a good rule of thumb there is to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.569 
end and a good rule of thumb there is to
keep<00:00:58.429> everything<00:00:59.559> say<00:01:00.559> pencil-sized<00:01:01.219> are

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
keep everything say pencil-sized are

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.090 
keep everything say pencil-sized are
larger<00:01:02.149> as<00:01:02.839> far<00:01:03.109> as<00:01:03.199> your<00:01:03.320> limbs<00:01:03.890> are

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
larger as far as your limbs are

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.120 
larger as far as your limbs are
concerned<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:05.030> also<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:06.260> do<00:01:06.440> not<00:01:06.470> want<00:01:06.920> your

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
concerned and also you do not want your

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.340 
concerned and also you do not want your
peach<00:01:07.400> tree<00:01:07.760> plum<00:01:08.090> tree<00:01:08.360> or<00:01:08.510> nectarine<00:01:09.050> tree

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
peach tree plum tree or nectarine tree

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.260 
peach tree plum tree or nectarine tree
to<00:01:09.470> be<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:09.890> tall<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:10.610> can't<00:01:10.850> reach<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
to be so tall that you can't reach the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.080 
to be so tall that you can't reach the
fruit<00:01:11.540> my<00:01:12.200> rule<00:01:12.440> of<00:01:12.470> thumb<00:01:12.590> is<00:01:12.980> if<00:01:13.250> your<00:01:13.760> fruit

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
fruit my rule of thumb is if your fruit

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.170 
fruit my rule of thumb is if your fruit
tree<00:01:14.360> is<00:01:14.600> too<00:01:15.320> tall<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.890> pick<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.280> fruit<00:01:16.550> then

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
tree is too tall to pick the fruit then

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.960 
tree is too tall to pick the fruit then
it's<00:01:17.450> too<00:01:17.690> tall<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.320> that's<00:01:19.160> a<00:01:19.490> good<00:01:19.670> time<00:01:19.940> to

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
it's too tall so that's a good time to

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.960 
it's too tall so that's a good time to
prune<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:20.690> off<00:01:20.930> now<00:01:21.290> that's<00:01:21.590> not<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:22.250> say<00:01:22.460> that

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
prune it off now that's not to say that

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.820 
prune it off now that's not to say that
you<00:01:23.180> can't<00:01:23.450> do<00:01:23.660> some<00:01:23.870> shaping<00:01:24.140> during<00:01:24.710> the

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
you can't do some shaping during the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.930 
you can't do some shaping during the
rest<00:01:25.040> of<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.280> year<00:01:25.490> because<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:25.820> can

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
rest of the year because you can

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.610 
rest of the year because you can
virtually<00:01:26.420> prune<00:01:26.720> here<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.080> Central<00:01:27.470> Florida

anyway<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.650> leave<00:03:26.100> them<00:03:26.340> go<00:03:26.960> unless<00:03:27.960> one<00:03:28.830> limb

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
anyway so leave them go unless one limb

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.890 
anyway so leave them go unless one limb
is<00:03:29.220> too<00:03:29.400> tall<00:03:29.700> or<00:03:29.970> one<00:03:30.180> limb<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.510> going<00:03:30.690> in<00:03:30.810> the
