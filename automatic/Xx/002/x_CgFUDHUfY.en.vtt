can be but be where it's you feel it's

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.119 
can be but be where it's you feel it's
good<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.430> be<00:01:02.350> so<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.440> want<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.680> feel<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:03.950> stretch

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
good to be so you want to feel a stretch

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.770 
good to be so you want to feel a stretch
but<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:04.729> don't<00:01:04.909> want<00:01:05.059> to<00:01:05.119> end<00:01:05.239> up<00:01:05.360> with<00:01:05.540> more

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
but you don't want to end up with more

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.620 
but you don't want to end up with more
pain<00:01:06.049> than<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.350> started<00:01:06.799> this<00:01:06.890> with<00:01:07.119> breathe

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.969 

so<00:01:14.630> that's<00:01:14.780> one<00:01:14.990> strategy<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.500> can<00:01:15.680> really

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
so that's one strategy you can really

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.100 
so that's one strategy you can really
stay<00:01:16.280> here<00:01:16.610> for<00:01:16.820> about<00:01:17.000> 2<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.270> 3<00:01:17.659> minutes<00:01:17.960> I

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
stay here for about 2 to 3 minutes I

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.990 
stay here for about 2 to 3 minutes I
would<00:01:18.229> recommend<00:01:18.650> at<00:01:19.040> least<00:01:19.100> building<00:01:19.700> up<00:01:19.850> to

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
would recommend at least building up to

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.670 
would recommend at least building up to
that<00:01:20.030> maybe<00:01:20.299> start<00:01:20.659> with<00:01:20.720> 1<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:21.080> then<00:01:21.350> over

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
that maybe start with 1 and then over

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.530 
that maybe start with 1 and then over
time<00:01:21.860> holding<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.400> bit<00:01:22.549> longer<00:01:22.700> but<00:01:23.420> I'd

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
time holding it a bit longer but I'd

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.179 
time holding it a bit longer but I'd
like<00:01:23.689> to<00:01:23.840> show<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.290> second<00:01:24.680> stretch<00:01:24.950> and

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189
