00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.680 

mine<00:02:19.680> is

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.340 

I<00:02:22.830> think<00:02:23.830> God<00:02:24.100> constantly<00:02:24.760> constantly

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
I think God constantly constantly

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.350 
I think God constantly constantly
pressed<00:02:26.350> upon<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.670> learned<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.210> the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
pressed upon I like I learned I like the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.990 
pressed upon I like I learned I like the
only<00:02:28.450> difference

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.690 

I<00:02:31.240> think<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.320> think<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:32.710> clever<00:02:32.920> they're<00:02:33.520> so

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
I think I think it's clever they're so

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.630 
I think I think it's clever they're so
long<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:35.710> was<00:02:35.800> hard<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.130> remember

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
long and it was hard to remember

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.059 
long and it was hard to remember
yeah<00:02:36.970> for<00:02:37.630> sure<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:38.050> were<00:02:38.170> obviously<00:02:38.320> yeah

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.949 

yeah<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.849> think<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.239> don't<00:02:43.299> know<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.480> think<00:02:43.689> the

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
yeah I think I don't know I think the

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.780 
yeah I think I don't know I think the
song<00:02:44.620> titles<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.040> more<00:02:45.189> words<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.459> them<00:02:45.609> the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
song titles have more words in them the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.349 
song titles have more words in them the
songs<00:02:46.030> do<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.299> sometimes<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:47.639> just<00:02:48.639> there<00:02:49.060> I

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
songs do you sometimes it's just there I

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.110 
songs do you sometimes it's just there I
think<00:02:49.689> I<00:02:49.959> think<00:02:50.200> not<00:02:50.829> for<00:02:51.010> him<00:02:51.129> any<00:02:51.249> fans<00:02:51.909> -

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
think I think not for him any fans -

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.089 
think I think not for him any fans -
it's<00:02:52.269> just<00:02:52.480> like<00:02:52.599> something<00:02:53.469> like<00:02:53.590> rush<00:02:53.859> or

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
it's just like something like rush or

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.339 
it's just like something like rush or
like<00:02:54.249> still<00:02:54.579> isn't<00:02:55.150> as<00:02:55.359> interesting<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
like still isn't as interesting is and

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.319 
like still isn't as interesting is and
we<00:02:56.560> pay<00:02:56.829> more<00:02:57.099> attention<00:02:57.249> to<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.790> lyrics<00:02:58.150> to

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
we pay more attention to the lyrics to

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.970 
we pay more attention to the lyrics to
the<00:02:58.420> taya<00:02:58.629> so<00:03:00.840> since<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:01.930> read<00:03:02.139> the<00:03:02.260> lyrics<00:03:02.500> and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the taya so since I read the lyrics and

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.610 
the taya so since I read the lyrics and
I'm<00:03:03.099> kind<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.450> one<00:03:04.599> who<00:03:04.719> starts<00:03:05.139> the<00:03:05.319> songs

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
I'm kind of the one who starts the songs

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.220 
I'm kind of the one who starts the songs
I<00:03:06.040> write<00:03:06.849> songs<00:03:07.150> from<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.569> different<00:03:07.900> way<00:03:08.049> than

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
I write songs from a different way than

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.349 
I write songs from a different way than
a<00:03:08.290> lot<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.530> musicians<00:03:08.709> would<00:03:09.219> you<00:03:10.030> know<00:03:10.150> they

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
a lot of musicians would you know they

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.000 
a lot of musicians would you know they
focus<00:03:10.930> on<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.139> music<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.739> then<00:03:11.829> they'll

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
focus on the music and then they'll

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.470 
focus on the music and then they'll
focus<00:03:12.219> on<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.519> melody<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:13.090> then<00:03:13.150> they'll<00:03:13.299> put

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
focus on a melody and then they'll put

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.690 
focus on a melody and then they'll put
lyrics<00:03:13.659> to<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:15.069> I<00:03:15.099> wanted<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.519> make<00:03:15.669> sure

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
lyrics to that but I wanted to make sure

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.209 
lyrics to that but I wanted to make sure
I<00:03:15.879> liked<00:03:16.150> all<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.450> lyrics<00:03:16.629> before<00:03:17.260> even

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:18.219 
I liked all the lyrics before even

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.670 
I liked all the lyrics before even
starting<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.700> songs<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.349> I<00:03:20.409> think

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
starting the songs and so I think

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.119 
starting the songs and so I think
writing<00:03:20.949> that<00:03:21.790> way<00:03:22.000> just<00:03:22.269> made<00:03:22.590> our<00:03:23.590> band<00:03:23.919> a

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
writing that way just made our band a

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.449 
writing that way just made our band a
little<00:03:24.370> bit<00:03:24.519> different<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.949> lot<00:03:27.129> of<00:03:27.250> things

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
little bit different and a lot of things

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.610 
little bit different and a lot of things
you<00:03:27.819> know<00:03:27.939> just<00:03:28.239> didn't<00:03:28.870> end<00:03:28.989> up<00:03:29.169> fitting<00:03:29.379> in

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
you know just didn't end up fitting in

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.099 
you know just didn't end up fitting in
the<00:03:29.709> songs<00:03:29.949> and<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.209> didn't<00:03:31.719> feel<00:03:31.840> like<00:03:31.870> they

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
the songs and so I didn't feel like they

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.899 
the songs and so I didn't feel like they
should<00:03:32.290> be<00:03:32.319> cut<00:03:32.560> out<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:33.010> record<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.730> any

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
should be cut out of the record in any

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.339 
should be cut out of the record in any
way<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.599> they're<00:03:34.750> still<00:03:35.019> in<00:03:35.169> them

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
way so that they're still in them

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.050 
way so that they're still in them
they're<00:03:35.919> still<00:03:36.159> in<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.400> liner<00:03:36.579> notes<00:03:36.669> you

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
they're still in the liner notes you

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.319 
they're still in the liner notes you
know<00:03:37.180> they're<00:03:37.359> still<00:03:37.540> in<00:03:37.659> the<00:03:37.750> lyrics<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:39.329> you

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
know they're still in the lyrics and you

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.640 
know they're still in the lyrics and you
know<00:03:40.449> the<00:03:40.659> song<00:03:40.840> titles<00:03:41.199> were<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.439> another

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
know the song titles were just another

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.039 
know the song titles were just another
way<00:03:41.949> to<00:03:41.980> kind<00:03:42.579> of<00:03:42.669> put<00:03:43.419> a<00:03:43.449> little<00:03:43.510> bit<00:03:43.900> more

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
way to kind of put a little bit more

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.449 
way to kind of put a little bit more
thought<00:03:44.290> into<00:03:44.500> things<00:03:44.829> and<00:03:45.069> maybe<00:03:45.189> make

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
thought into things and maybe make

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.860 
thought into things and maybe make
people<00:03:45.849> want<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.150> listen<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.509> the<00:03:46.599> song<00:03:46.840> you

singing<00:06:07.570> them<00:06:07.720> and<00:06:07.900> I<00:06:07.930> felt<00:06:08.169> like<00:06:08.290> he<00:06:08.350> had<00:06:08.560> such

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
singing them and I felt like he had such

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.490 
singing them and I felt like he had such
a<00:06:09.490> stronger<00:06:10.180> voice<00:06:10.419> and<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:10.810> was<00:06:10.900> definitely<00:06:11.230> a

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
a stronger voice and I was definitely a

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.830 
a stronger voice and I was definitely a
voice<00:06:11.740> that<00:06:11.950> sort<00:06:12.160> of<00:06:12.280> like<00:06:12.460> demands<00:06:13.450> that

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
voice that sort of like demands that

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.400 
voice that sort of like demands that
it's<00:06:14.410> very<00:06:14.949> prominent<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:16.260> some<00:06:17.260> of<00:06:17.320> the

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
it's very prominent and some of the

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.960 
it's very prominent and some of the
lyrics<00:06:17.740> were<00:06:18.330> you<00:06:19.330> know<00:06:19.449> they're<00:06:19.900> not<00:06:20.050> exactly

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.710 
playing it safe I guess in any sort of
way<00:06:23.740> he's<00:06:24.550> kind<00:06:24.820> of<00:06:24.880> he<00:06:25.180> can<00:06:25.330> kind<00:06:25.479> of<00:06:25.510> hide

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
way he's kind of he can kind of hide

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.110

behind my voice and cuz it felt in a

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.800 
behind my voice and cuz it felt in a
