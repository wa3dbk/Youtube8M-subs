00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.410

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.890
 how is it all the same 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.719
 Stream your device screen to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.860
 twitch channel 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.000
 for this we need only 2 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.100
 programs this is a reflector and x plates yes to 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.779
 unfortunately stream itself and under or 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.609
 you canâ€™t get another device 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.949
 because you need a computer for this 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.300
 software not yet created 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.720
 created for live broadcast only 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.939
 video and to capture screen programs yet 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.850
 no, so we download the reflector 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.680
 to move and screen our device 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 on our computer we open it on the screen 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.489
 Our device will have such a function 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.129
 like airplay 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.670
 we click on it and video rep here you 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.850

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.039
 video repeat close here, see I already 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.050
 Immediately opened the tanks to approximately 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.359
 show what it looks like it 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.019
 quite colorful cool graphics 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.060
 a little lost you can put 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.439
 permission if you need if you have 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.100
 good monitor full hd or ultra hd then 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.080
 it will be cool so open their split 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.799

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.030

 live broadcast on twitch waiting for now 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.630
 x plates will load but I advise you for 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.259
 first for reflector it is minimum 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.820
 iphone 5 or ipad 4 ipad 2 ipad 2 too 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.530
 Will work but Stream doesn't know iphone 4 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.920
 iphone more precisely 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.970
 ipad 4 and ipad air 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:54.730

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:59.720

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.490

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.910
 on them the graphics are all different but something 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.430

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.990
