favorite board fest today this is the
Rossignol<00:00:13.290> Angus<00:00:13.710> amptek<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:16.130> this<00:00:17.130> board<00:00:17.430> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
Rossignol Angus amptek and this board is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.210 
Rossignol Angus amptek and this board is
just<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.240> really<00:00:18.480> sort<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.810> fun<00:00:19.140> versatile<00:00:19.920> twin

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
just a really sort of fun versatile twin

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.830 
just a really sort of fun versatile twin
tip<00:00:20.400> board<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.880> if<00:00:20.970> you're<00:00:21.150> into<00:00:21.390> more<00:00:21.539> sort<00:00:21.810> of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
tip board so if you're into more sort of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.890 
tip board so if you're into more sort of
freestyle<00:00:22.470> or<00:00:22.740> mountain<00:00:23.220> styles<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.689> seems

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
freestyle or mountain styles this seems

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.790 
freestyle or mountain styles this seems
to<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.289> good

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
to be really good

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.099 
to be really good
it's<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.849> twin<00:00:27.060> tip<00:00:27.240> board<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> same

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
it's a twin tip board so it's the same

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.290 
it's a twin tip board so it's the same
shape<00:00:28.410> their<00:00:28.769> nose<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.279> play<00:00:29.429> out<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.119> can

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
shape their nose and play out so you can

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.609 
shape their nose and play out so you can
land<00:00:30.449> switch<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.260> not<00:00:31.320> really<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
land switch on it it's not really a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.179 
land switch on it it's not really a
problem

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
problem

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.760 
problem
and<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.300> uses<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.780> Amtrak<00:00:34.290> all-mountain

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and it uses the Amtrak all-mountain

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.030 
and it uses the Amtrak all-mountain
Panda<00:00:35.579> pro<00:00:35.820> fob<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
Panda pro fob and what that is is a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.880 
Panda pro fob and what that is is a
positive<00:00:38.520> camber<00:00:38.790> between<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.600> bindings<00:00:39.890> so

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
positive camber between the bindings so

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.590 
positive camber between the bindings so
the<00:00:41.010> board's<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.399> nice<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.879> snappy<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the board's really nice and snappy and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.400 
the board's really nice and snappy and
really<00:00:43.469> fun<00:00:43.710> off<00:00:43.829> jumps<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:45.230> but<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
really fun off jumps actually but it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.770 
really fun off jumps actually but it
rolls<00:00:47.190> into<00:00:47.489> reverse<00:00:47.910> camber<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> nose

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
rolls into reverse camber in the nose

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.319 
rolls into reverse camber in the nose
and<00:00:48.809> tail<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.640> learn<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.059> get<00:00:51.180> you

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and tail so if you do learn to get you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.170 
and tail so if you do learn to get you
up<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.510> jump<00:00:51.780> or<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:53.190> sort<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.610> catch<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> net

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
up a jump or you sort of catch the net

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.510 
up a jump or you sort of catch the net
the<00:00:54.989> reverse<00:00:55.289> camber<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.980> sort<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.160> evens

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the reverse camber just sort of evens

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.220 
the reverse camber just sort of evens
you<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.270> means<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> board's<00:00:57.930> just

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you out and just means the board's just

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.479 
you out and just means the board's just
again<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.460> easy<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.030> ride<00:01:01.489> seventy

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
again really really easy to ride seventy

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.549 
again really really easy to ride seventy
five<00:01:02.730> thousand<00:01:03.180> base<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.840> super<00:01:04.290> fast

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
five thousand base so it's super fast

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.679 
five thousand base so it's super fast
high<00:01:04.830> quality<00:01:05.339> base<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
high quality base and you're going to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.750 
high quality base and you're going to
take<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.080> jigs<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.470> stuff<00:01:07.830> no<00:01:08.580> it's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
take that on jigs and stuff no it's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.039 
take that on jigs and stuff no it's
worried<00:01:09.060> your<00:01:09.270> base<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.600> really<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
worried your base is really going to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.520 
worried your base is really going to
hold<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.909> also<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.530> smooth

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
hold up and you also get a smooth

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.859 
hold up and you also get a smooth
lexcorp<00:01:14.220> combined<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> s<00:01:15.030> tips<00:01:15.390> so

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
lexcorp combined with the s tips so

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.899 
lexcorp combined with the s tips so
they've<00:01:16.560> actually<00:01:16.680> put<00:01:16.920> carbon<00:01:17.460> into<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
they've actually put carbon into the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.770 
they've actually put carbon into the
board<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.689> when<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.590> sort<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.920> change<00:01:20.780> weight

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
board so when you sort of change weight

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.100 
board so when you sort of change weight
from<00:01:22.170> toe<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.650> heel<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.210> board<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
from toe to heel and the board the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.690 
from toe to heel and the board the
carbon<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> board<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.100> directs

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
carbon in the board really directs

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340 
carbon in the board really directs
pressure<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:27.360> balls<00:01:27.570> edges<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> just

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
pressure to your balls edges and just

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.960 
pressure to your balls edges and just
means<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> board's<00:01:29.189> really<00:01:29.430> really

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
means that the board's really really

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.910 
means that the board's really really
sort<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> light<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.990> versatile<00:01:31.470> under<00:01:31.799> your

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
sort of light and versatile under your

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.990 
sort of light and versatile under your
feet<00:01:33.770> again<00:01:34.770> another<00:01:35.070> thing<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.610> sort<00:01:35.909> of

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
feet again another thing to sort of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.730 
feet again another thing to sort of
strengthen<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> board<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:37.170> put<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.560> this

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
strengthen the board they put like this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.370 
strengthen the board they put like this
aramid<00:01:38.310> Kevlar<00:01:38.850> which<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.689> actually<00:01:40.020> Kevlar

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
aramid Kevlar which is actually Kevlar

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.469 
aramid Kevlar which is actually Kevlar
they<00:01:40.470> useing<00:01:40.799> bulletproof<00:01:41.220> vests<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.329> that's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
they useing bulletproof vests so that's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.170 
they useing bulletproof vests so that's
actually<00:01:42.600> under<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> board<00:01:43.909> again<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
actually under the board again if you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.389 
actually under the board again if you
rip<00:01:45.390> through<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:45.810> base<00:01:46.009> mapping<00:01:47.009> just

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
rip through your base mapping just

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.100 
rip through your base mapping just
protects<00:01:47.880> your<00:01:48.090> core<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.689> means<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
protects your core and just means the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.490 
protects your core and just means the
ball<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> last<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.100> lifetime

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
ball is going to last a lifetime

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.370 
ball is going to last a lifetime
