with that means that you're making a new

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.679 
with that means that you're making a new
selection<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.700> I<00:00:17.029> want<00:00:17.210> to<00:00:17.270> get<00:00:17.360> rid<00:00:17.480> of<00:00:17.599> the

right<00:00:20.570> now<00:00:20.660> I<00:00:20.720> have<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:20.900> tolerance<00:00:21.079> on<00:00:21.560> 0

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
right now I have the tolerance on 0

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.159 
right now I have the tolerance on 0
because<00:00:22.460> there<00:00:23.180> are<00:00:23.240> no<00:00:23.329> gray<00:00:23.540> tones<00:00:23.810> in<00:00:24.020> here

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
because there are no gray tones in here

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
also did not use contiguous because I

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.990 
also did not use contiguous because I
want<00:00:30.860> it<00:00:31.070> to<00:00:31.399> pick<00:00:31.610> up<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.810> white<00:00:33.079> that's

have<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.330> worry<00:01:29.480> about<00:01:29.630> staying<00:01:29.840> in<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.080> lines

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
have to worry about staying in the lines

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.840 
have to worry about staying in the lines
this<00:01:30.620> is<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.860> reason<00:01:31.130> why<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.250> do<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.790> I

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
this is the reason why I do this and I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.950 
this is the reason why I do this and I
don't<00:01:31.910> worry<00:01:32.180> about<00:01:32.330> staying<00:01:32.540> within<00:01:32.750> the

don't worry about staying within the
lines<00:01:33.280> because<00:01:34.280> I<00:01:34.610> can't<00:01:34.850> go<00:01:34.970> outside<00:01:35.150> of<00:01:35.510> the

the way selections work and just paint
everything<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.690> Patrick's<00:01:44.690> outline

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
everything that is Patrick's outline

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.510 
everything that is Patrick's outline
color<00:01:45.950> I<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:48.020> make<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:48.440> bigger<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:49.250> make<00:01:49.340> it

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
color I can make this bigger to make it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.170 
color I can make this bigger to make it
go<00:01:49.670> quicker

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
go quicker

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.380 
go quicker
I<00:01:50.500> might<00:01:51.500> through<00:01:51.770> some<00:01:52.070> precision<00:01:52.730> but<00:01:53.000> you

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
I might through some precision but you

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.040 
I might through some precision but you
just<00:01:53.570> have<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.840> decide<00:01:54.220> his<00:01:55.220> dots<00:01:56.030> or<00:01:56.840> color

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
just have to decide his dots or color

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.020 
just have to decide his dots or color
ours<00:01:57.260> dot<00:01:57.530> those<00:01:57.860> dots<00:01:58.280> are<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.550> same<00:01:58.760> color

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
ours dot those dots are the same color

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.050 
ours dot those dots are the same color
okay<00:01:59.630> so<00:01:59.690> those<00:01:59.960> dots<00:02:00.290> get<00:02:00.530> colored<00:02:01.240> dot<00:02:02.240> dot

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
okay so those dots get colored dot dot

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.730 
okay so those dots get colored dot dot
