00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.830
 yo everyone knows that roos we get 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.560
 found at the point of small videos so 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.029
 a little clip score 3 probably yes 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.270
 I have already done a fine genre because 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.140
 this time it was in 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.890
 different circumstances we will say 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.480
 so here I've put a customer in 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.910
 wagon that's good I put them in 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.109
 the place of the wine of the blow for having 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.630
 the same usual compo and so I did 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.649
 a small clim men score 300 enough 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.870
 nice you'll see the video is 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.520
 really is really great there has been 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.070
 no faith really played very well 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.190
 then we really finished very quickly 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.039
 and quite easily so I was pretty 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.500
 content of durand du tounoi you go 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.239
 see one it's really a clip was 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.510
 done very easily and then very very 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.239
 quick 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.820
 so that's like I said one I did 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 pass my client so I finished them 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.300
 scores 300 with him so I did the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.609
 five dungeon and I redid the same 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.949
 with my compo of course I changed 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.640
 a lot of back she since now 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.270
 now that we know a little bit 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.409
 better idols 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.750
 there are combos told of them that they are 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.420
 a lot much easier especially 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.320
 for the climate you will see that 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.460
 compared to the first time I did that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.130
 otherwise I had taken idols that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.560
 were doing that I was doing bones if I got 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.759
 touched while the ana met 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.500
 is so I get touched there is no 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.820
 worry there is normally that she 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.590
 straw and finally that as what 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.150
 I have to single file clip forgiveness 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.320
 can touch me 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.030
 except that if it touches me it will not but 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.689
 weston cage issued other idols I 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.549
 wanted to put in 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.290
 registration for those who want 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.619
 go here there are a score of more 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.950
 of 300 so here it is otherwise I had a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.259
 pretty bad placement so I 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.369
 I'm pretty happy to have had 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.619
 succeeded that placement there because at 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.360
 early I thought at first I wanted to 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.380
 have the dungeon finish for then 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.270
 come back and have a new placement 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.820
 because you have to know in fact that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.890
 when to say when you touch 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.870
 finally the bosses of the dungeon 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.420
 the last room there are for example some 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.930
 different investments and started 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.030
 ranking 1 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.460
 then if you win you do 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.840
 dungeon you will have placement 2 you in 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.360
 do the xing dungeon and you go 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.560
 pinch 3 etc and so there is certainly a 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.690
 ranking who are really bad 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.640
 like for example there the big hives 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.050
 in front of me it's not it's not really 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.790
 an ideal placement since the big hive 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.680
 if you want I'd rather be played at 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.820
 turn 3 it's a lot nicer what 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.020
 to find all the pass we go out who 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.570
 m gives everyone they 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.250
 tap the allies who are a little bit 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.600
 far be it but its ranks quite a sense 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.950
 dear so I prefer to kill them pay 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.200
 directly then for not they 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.520
 come minus 8 after so here is the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.940
 big rush fell with it iop 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.110
 use the idol the kid a pure for 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.090
 to attract oneself is very very 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.350
 helpful once again and so here I 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 will come focus both so 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.610
 stuffing it and the bull heart so the leather 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.560
 red who has weaknesses earth in 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.670
 this very handy for the ofce with the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.870
 rape then we can see the little words 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.660
 forbid families in the void 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.700
 it's very important we know how to take it 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.620
 allows you to give thoroughbred 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.940
 damage so if you ever leave a 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.140
 word drool point of view beautiful to you 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.209
 to say is that here you could have killed 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.070
 if you would have liked your dishes in the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.700
 empty when you have them two 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.500
 available 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.579
 here for example drink that the enemy 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.040
 could not actually count because 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.190
 the employee plays right after and so if 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.530
 the calling neet payet impaler 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.540
 wheelan payet will win smes and so 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.810
 you will come and bang me and make me very 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.720
 wrong 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.040
 which gains +1% each time and that he 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.780
 there is also the idol that makes you 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.829
 have a lot of melee so I 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.450
 believe that lenny he can type me 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.190
 stuff it nita pictures or because 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.390
 that they enjoy after the stroke this is the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.650
 first that this placement there that makes that 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.600
 Lenin tower can strictly nothing 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.000
 to do apart from putting his footsteps in the wind 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.340
 So here it is the turn of the yop of 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.079
 havas loses the bull leather so stuff it 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.850
 I will have fallen with the panda he is 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.560
 nor a creature bull weaknesses 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.750
 earth it will go pretty easily with 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.519
 a land look where I told the globe 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.799
 Moreover, to put an end to all 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.410
 earthen features there he was 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.790
 not like becomes he had put he has a 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.709
 basis of this sort of movie here 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.319
 So it seems to me you see the tower there 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.599
 throws fate to have it on turn 4 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.980
 so then turn 4 we'll have to coconut and 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.849
 the descent of possible ten words the 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.530
 forgive and so it was great practice 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.400
 this technique is that you go 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.120
 see 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.269
 there I am you are stuffing it already here 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.259
 so the shock the panda is well that passes 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.930
 quite easily 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:21.150
 there are weaknesses at the Ã´ta bridge 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.740
 can not be bad so I took a good 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.539
 good melon however you will see this is 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.490
 for the for turn 4 can do 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.070
 to wear their stuff is thrown appalling 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.050
 for oxen the air conditioning stabilize the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.660
 clean for easter he tapped the allies and 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.099
 shooting is not what we pay 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.169
 1 happened one can be a single view 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.880
 Cylons if at home and with only one 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.610
 life is a I'm not sure of for the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.860
 finish here are the semi-finals in straw 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.110
 and suddenly there is more than the climate 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.430
 so is none of my characters have 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.759
 need to put on boxes 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.990
 white 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.639
 good I'm going to go a 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.259
 story to ensure the shot if ever I 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.490
 do not finish rounds 4 but what is 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.699
 although these techniques did not just 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.750
 there until late turns 4 you have 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.289
 strictly no need to put yourself 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.190
 on the white boxes of the bah bah 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.750
 blow the white boxes and serves 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.340
 strictly nothing in this dungeon know 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.389
 it's not something that will help you 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.400
 annoy if you do it in four 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.960
 laps here is the chance the greedy I 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.760
 throws the chance I had kept him for the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.120
 turn 4 so there next turn the place 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.460
 for allah destiny the coconut they have 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.070
 also the chance dax pis plus the 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.599
 power that will launch pushed jean xa 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.669
 so the iop will be really very very 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.960
 booster and so it's going to be very very 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.060
 bad weather the climate will fall enough 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.260
 easily despite the 13 points of life 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.919
 and then the big licenses that the 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.449
 so that's the little power 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.740
 besides one of the idols that makes that if 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.650
 you finish next to an opponent 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.870
 but you lose 50% of your vitality 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.909
 max so I'm going to lose you 50% and in 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.349
 the more you can not you are here 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.419
 that's why we can see that the 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.199
 panda it seemed to me 2000 points life and 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.729
 also the beds where I'm not sure 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.840
 so here they are taking quite expensive 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:00.290
 if you think you have an opponent 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.910
 also at level 10 dole wholesale it's 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.360
 especially idols that make that if at the 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.740
 long one that dogma power is to 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.169
 the long as the permanent climate ipp 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.639
 He has been keen on him for a while and at least 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.220
 he will have cattleya turn scales not 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.970
 typing tremendously what makes that what 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.780
 I do not need to look after myself 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.310
 all the fight is enough is 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.650
 well enough here we want the tours 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.000
 4 the panda will do his little offer 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.340
 very quiet which we understand 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.760
 nest is started just before you husband 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.639
 sale 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.770
 we put a climate stability and picole 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.820
 could guess at once it was the pay 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.020
 and peace 12 canons scenic and that's it 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.410
 by the way if you too want 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.680
 pass 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.750
 the ornament and you have no tim or that 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.040
 you do not manage well by 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.320
 example that you want to do the points 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.880
 of success and it's for the ladder 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.030
 or just for arming 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.150
 well I pass I do not know if 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.830
 the dungeons with so with the scores 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.860
 300 so the five dungeons for the sum 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.389
