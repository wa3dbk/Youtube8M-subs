00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
new car and do it about three years or

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.270 
new car and do it about three years or
what<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.290> here<00:03:16.440> about<00:03:16.709> half<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.100> time

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
what I have here about half the time

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.860 
what I have here about half the time
well<00:03:17.910> think<00:03:18.090> about<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.510> if<00:03:18.660> you're<00:03:18.720> only

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
well think about that if you're only

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.030 
well think about that if you're only
doing<00:03:18.959> half<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.320> time<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.620> instead<00:03:19.860> having

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
doing half the time you instead having

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.140 
doing half the time you instead having
those<00:03:20.160> people<00:03:20.430> working<00:03:20.550> all<00:03:20.640> along<00:03:20.880> pretty

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
those people working all along pretty

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.539 
those people working all along pretty
tight<00:03:21.360> costs<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.080> lot<00:03:22.200> less<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.709> plus<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.430> get

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
tight costs a lot less to plus you get

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.310 
tight costs a lot less to plus you get
ahead<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.880> market<00:03:24.060> plate<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.989> other<00:03:25.140> words

well<00:03:41.830> not<00:03:41.980> so<00:03:42.190> much<00:03:42.310> now<00:03:42.490> because<00:03:42.790> they<00:03:42.880> got<00:03:43.030> we

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
well not so much now because they got we

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.610 
well not so much now because they got we
got<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.360> currency<00:03:43.750> problem<00:03:44.050> but<00:03:44.170> before<00:03:44.260> that

well that means you know he's got a very

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.670 
well that means you know he's got a very

you<00:05:09.939> know<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.090> can't<00:05:10.360> win<00:05:10.539> when<00:05:10.750> you're<00:05:10.900> you

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
you know you can't win when you're you

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.240 
you know you can't win when you're you
can't<00:05:11.349> beat<00:05:11.500> somebody<00:05:11.800> if<00:05:11.860> that's<00:05:12.039> the<00:05:12.129> way

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
can't beat somebody if that's the way

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.930 

so<00:05:18.830> when<00:05:19.010> you<00:05:19.100> have<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.370> learn<00:05:19.460> how<00:05:19.640> to<00:05:19.670> do<00:05:19.820> is

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
so when you have to learn how to do is

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.020 
so when you have to learn how to do is
in<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.450> end<00:05:21.640> organization<00:05:22.640> by<00:05:22.760> itself

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
in the end organization by itself

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.670 
in the end organization by itself
doesn't<00:05:23.300> come<00:05:23.450> up<00:05:23.540> with<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.720> idea<00:05:24.140> per<00:05:24.470> se

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
doesn't come up with the idea per se

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.830 
doesn't come up with the idea per se
there's<00:05:24.980> people<00:05:25.160> working<00:05:25.460> together<00:05:25.790> and<00:05:26.630> then

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
there's people working together and then

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.120 
there's people working together and then
the<00:05:26.960> end<00:05:27.140> you<00:05:27.380> know<00:05:27.470> you<00:05:27.500> sometimes<00:05:27.980> you<00:05:28.040> have

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
the end you know you sometimes you have

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.890 
the end you know you sometimes you have
to<00:05:28.190> get<00:05:28.310> off<00:05:28.400> in<00:05:28.520> isolation<00:05:28.910> draw<00:05:29.720> from

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
to get off in isolation draw from

to get off in isolation draw from
somebody<00:05:30.200> else<00:05:30.320> figured<00:05:30.620> out<00:05:30.740> then<00:05:30.920> go<00:05:31.040> back

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
somebody else figured out then go back

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.860 
somebody else figured out then go back
in<00:05:31.490> he<00:05:31.670> just<00:05:31.700> can't<00:05:32.030> be<00:05:32.090> there<00:05:32.300> in<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.660> hubbub

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
in he just can't be there in the hubbub

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.870 
in he just can't be there in the hubbub
all<00:05:33.200> the<00:05:33.290> time<00:05:33.500> because<00:05:33.710> otherwise<00:05:33.950> you'd<00:05:34.190> be

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
all the time because otherwise you'd be

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.550 
all the time because otherwise you'd be
like<00:05:35.150> this<00:05:35.300> but<00:05:36.110> in<00:05:36.170> the<00:05:36.260> end<00:05:36.290> you're<00:05:36.530> still

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
like this but in the end you're still

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.710 
like this but in the end you're still
