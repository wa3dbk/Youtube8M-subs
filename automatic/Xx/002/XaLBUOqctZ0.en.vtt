00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
you've got both programs downloaded you

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.470 
you've got both programs downloaded you
want<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.350> open<00:01:44.470> up<00:01:44.650> empty<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.480> the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
want to open up empty and the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.240 
want to open up empty and the
application<00:01:47.170> will<00:01:47.200> ask<00:01:47.440> you<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.650> extract<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
application will ask you to extract the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.450 
application will ask you to extract the
files<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.810> put<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.050> into<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.350> well-known<00:01:51.040> file

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
files so put it into a well-known file

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.060 
files so put it into a well-known file
location<00:01:52.000> such<00:01:52.450> as<00:01:52.480> the<00:01:52.920> documents<00:01:53.920> for

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
location such as the documents for

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.210 
location such as the documents for
example<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.930> essentially<00:01:56.590> extract<00:01:57.070> the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
example and it's essentially extract the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.650 
example and it's essentially extract the
files<00:01:57.430> otherwise<00:01:57.730> the<00:01:57.970> program<00:01:58.300> won't<00:01:58.390> work

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
files otherwise the program won't work

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.990 
files otherwise the program won't work
so<00:01:59.530> once<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.770> files<00:01:59.980> extracted<00:02:00.550> go<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.760> the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
so once the files extracted go to the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.420 
so once the files extracted go to the
new<00:02:01.180> location<00:02:02.080> which<00:02:02.290> for<00:02:03.100> me<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.220> the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
new location which for me is the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.360 
new location which for me is the

which we just downloaded are there so we

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.199 
which we just downloaded are there so we
can<00:03:01.449> set<00:03:01.659> up<00:03:01.689> the<00:03:01.870> network<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.879> can

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
can set up the network so you can

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.149 
can set up the network so you can
connect<00:03:05.049> your<00:03:05.139> friends<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.769> play<00:03:06.010> together

network<00:03:51.729> and<00:03:52.419> and<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.739> is<00:03:53.799> important<00:03:54.579> that

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
network and and this is important that

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.729 
network and and this is important that
you<00:03:54.819> remember<00:03:55.090> what<00:03:55.540> your<00:03:55.689> network<00:03:56.049> name<00:03:56.470> and

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
you remember what your network name and

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.740 
you remember what your network name and
password<00:03:56.829> is<00:03:57.370> called<00:03:57.579> because<00:03:57.939> you<00:03:58.479> need<00:03:58.659> to

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
password is called because you need to

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.349 
password is called because you need to
give<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:59.049> to<00:03:59.199> your<00:03:59.290> friends<00:03:59.739> and<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:01.030> order

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
give this to your friends and in order

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.789 
give this to your friends and in order
for<00:04:01.389> them<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.750> connect<00:04:02.019> so<00:04:02.169> this<00:04:02.319> is<00:04:02.469> level

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
for them to connect so this is level

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.409 
for them to connect so this is level
gate<00:04:02.919> two<00:04:03.099> and<00:04:03.310> level<00:04:03.489> guide<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.090> password

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
gate two and level guide is the password

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.229 
gate two and level guide is the password
and<00:04:05.159> I'm<00:04:06.159> not<00:04:06.310> gonna<00:04:06.400> click<00:04:06.639> Save<00:04:06.669> but<00:04:07.120> you

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
and I'm not gonna click Save but you

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.659 
and I'm not gonna click Save but you
were<00:04:07.419> to<00:04:07.540> click<00:04:07.659> Save<00:04:08.099> and<00:04:09.099> that<00:04:09.159> would<00:04:09.430> create

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
were to click Save and that would create

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.159 
were to click Save and that would create
the<00:04:09.790> network<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:10.359> you<00:04:10.389> need<00:04:10.569> to<00:04:10.750> keep<00:04:10.900> note<00:04:11.139> of

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
the network so you need to keep note of

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.349 
the network so you need to keep note of
the<00:04:11.409> user<00:04:11.949> and<00:04:12.310> password<00:04:12.549> for<00:04:13.299> that

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
the user and password for that

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:20.339 
the user and password for that
particular<00:04:14.319> feature<00:04:17.099> because<00:04:19.049> your<00:04:20.049> friends

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
want just click start and then it might

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.960 
want just click start and then it might
not<00:06:02.680> work<00:06:02.710> the<00:06:03.040> first<00:06:03.280> couple<00:06:03.550> of<00:06:03.580> times<00:06:03.640> will

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
not work the first couple of times will

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.490 
not work the first couple of times will
just<00:06:04.090> keep<00:06:04.210> trying<00:06:04.750> keep<00:06:05.050> causing<00:06:05.290> the

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
just keep trying keep causing the

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.200 
just keep trying keep causing the
program<00:06:05.830> opening<00:06:06.220> again<00:06:06.520> and<00:06:07.090> you'll

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
program opening again and you'll

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.820 
program opening again and you'll
eventually<00:06:07.390> get<00:06:07.780> a<00:06:07.960> screen<00:06:08.200> like<00:06:08.350> this<00:06:08.410> where

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
eventually get a screen like this where

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.300 
eventually get a screen like this where
it<00:06:08.920> will<00:06:09.010> generate<00:06:09.790> a<00:06:09.850> map<00:06:10.120> for<00:06:10.450> you<00:06:10.600> and<00:06:11.310> will

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
it will generate a map for you and will

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.120 
it will generate a map for you and will
have<00:06:12.400> a<00:06:12.460> percentage<00:06:12.880> of<00:06:13.240> how<00:06:13.750> much<00:06:14.740> than<00:06:14.980> that

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
have a percentage of how much than that

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.630 
have a percentage of how much than that
puzzled<00:06:15.610> it<00:06:15.730> and<00:06:16.110> that's<00:06:17.110> that's<00:06:17.440> really<00:06:17.640> an

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
puzzled it and that's that's really an

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.340 
puzzled it and that's that's really an
indicator<00:06:19.120> of<00:06:19.240> when<00:06:19.720> you<00:06:19.840> can<00:06:20.020> connect

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
indicator of when you can connect

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.450 
indicator of when you can connect
because<00:06:20.560> once<00:06:20.890> once<00:06:21.340> I<00:06:21.490> reach<00:06:21.700> 100%<00:06:22.150> and<00:06:23.460> it's

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
because once once I reach 100% and it's

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.510 
because once once I reach 100% and it's
safety<00:06:24.730> connect<00:06:25.210> and<00:06:25.620> this<00:06:26.620> is<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:26.980> console

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
safety connect and this is the console

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.860 
safety connect and this is the console
for<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:27.850> server<00:06:28.150> you<00:06:28.330> can<00:06:28.480> do<00:06:28.570> different

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
for the server you can do different
