perhaps<00:00:44.970> that<00:00:45.350> in<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.500> position<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:46.949> get

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
perhaps that in this position we get

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.990 
perhaps that in this position we get
this<00:00:47.400> final<00:00:47.970> position<00:00:48.269> of<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.479> game<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:50.000> two

kiril's and also comment to 20 29 I have
pointed<00:01:00.360> out<00:01:00.540> that<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.989> final<00:01:01.409> position

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
pointed out that this final position

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.119 
pointed out that this final position
here<00:01:03.140> there's<00:01:04.140> an<00:01:04.260> interesting<00:01:04.470> thing<00:01:04.830> going

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
here there's an interesting thing going

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.070 
here there's an interesting thing going
on<00:01:05.250> which<00:01:05.460> may<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:06.150> been<00:01:06.180> Reggie<00:01:06.540> Bob's<00:01:06.810> idea

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
on which may have been Reggie Bob's idea

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
on which may have been Reggie Bob's idea
that<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> Queen<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.610> theory<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that the Queen in theory is is

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.950 
that the Queen in theory is is
supporting<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.490> h7<00:01:12.060> point<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.810> this

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
supporting the h7 point here so this

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.109 
supporting the h7 point here so this
pawns<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> verge<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.770> queening<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:15.000> it's

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
pawns on the verge of queening so it's

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.840 
pawns on the verge of queening so it's
actually<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> very<00:01:15.570> dramatic<00:01:15.720> position<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
actually a very dramatic position and I

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.030 
actually a very dramatic position and I
just<00:01:18.030> assumes<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.590> was<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.890> end

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
just assumes like this this was the end

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.840 
just assumes like this this was the end
of<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> game<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:21.230> you<00:01:22.230> know<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.580> mate's

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
of the game because you know of a mate's

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.410 
of the game because you know of a mate's
hair<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.680> i<00:01:26.070> thought<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.970> was<00:01:27.180> still<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
hair and i thought this this was still a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.300 
hair and i thought this this was still a
mating<00:01:27.840> thing<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.350> Queenie<00:01:28.620> for<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> didn't

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
mating thing with Queenie for I didn't

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
mating thing with Queenie for I didn't
mention<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.720> position<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
mention it here in this position that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.740 
mention it here in this position that
the<00:01:31.440> pawn<00:01:31.790> on<00:01:32.790> d5<00:01:33.710> vs<00:01:34.710> g<00:01:34.890> 6<00:01:35.190> gives<00:01:35.520> black<00:01:35.910> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the pawn on d5 vs g 6 gives black the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.190 
the pawn on d5 vs g 6 gives black the
option<00:01:37.050> of<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.320> kind<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.740> maneuver

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
option of this kind of maneuver

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.190 
option of this kind of maneuver
potentially<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.550> so<00:01:41.550> basically<00:01:42.300> Queen<00:01:42.960> takes

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
potentially and so basically Queen takes

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.730 
potentially and so basically Queen takes
e4<00:01:43.500> check<00:01:44.870> needs<00:01:45.870> to<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.080> Illustrated<00:01:48.350> okay<00:01:49.350> so

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
e4 check needs to be Illustrated okay so

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.980 
e4 check needs to be Illustrated okay so
rook<00:01:50.130> takes<00:01:50.370> e4<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.150> black<00:01:51.480> Queens<00:01:53.780> now<00:01:54.780> in

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
rook takes e4 and black Queens now in

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.100 
rook takes e4 and black Queens now in
this<00:01:55.140> position

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.150 

it<00:01:59.770> starts<00:02:00.190> off<00:02:00.280> with<00:02:00.460> rook<00:02:00.730> e6<00:02:01.360> check<00:02:01.630> king<00:02:02.560> h5

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
it starts off with rook e6 check king h5

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.410 
it starts off with rook e6 check king h5
and<00:02:03.520> here<00:02:04.510> you<00:02:04.690> might<00:02:04.900> think<00:02:05.370> ah<00:02:06.370> well<00:02:07.000> just

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
and here you might think ah well just

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.800 
and here you might think ah well just
taking<00:02:07.840> on<00:02:07.960> 87<00:02:08.640> that's<00:02:09.640> not<00:02:09.910> really<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.509> the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
taking on 87 that's not really of the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.470 
taking on 87 that's not really of the
case<00:02:11.050> if<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.890> take<00:02:12.130> on<00:02:12.400> h7<00:02:13.210> here<00:02:15.300> let's<00:02:16.300> just

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
case if you take on h7 here let's just

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.980 
case if you take on h7 here let's just
take<00:02:16.630> on<00:02:16.810> 87<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.920> second<00:02:18.250> engine<00:02:18.460> on<00:02:18.580> here

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
take on 87 and the second engine on here

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.590 
take on 87 and the second engine on here
if<00:02:19.990> we<00:02:20.140> take<00:02:20.290> on<00:02:20.440> 87<00:02:21.010> actually<00:02:21.520> plaque<00:02:22.150> is

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
if we take on 87 actually plaque is

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.580 
if we take on 87 actually plaque is
escaping<00:02:23.820> kingi<00:02:24.820> for<00:02:25.120> black<00:02:25.690> it's<00:02:25.840> got<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.110> f5

escaping kingi for black it's got the f5

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.490 
escaping kingi for black it's got the f5

everything's covered all the escape

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.500 
everything's covered all the escape
routes<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:41.799> think<00:03:42.010> earlier<00:03:42.640> with<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.209> porn

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510

that this final position had this

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.969 
that this final position had this
resource<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:16.990> kind<00:05:17.290> of<00:05:17.350> highlights<00:05:17.770> how

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
resource and that kind of highlights how

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.010 
resource and that kind of highlights how
clever<00:05:18.550> Aronian<00:05:19.450> is<00:05:20.250> sometimes<00:05:22.020> tactically

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
clever Aronian is sometimes tactically

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.680 
clever Aronian is sometimes tactically
even<00:05:23.740> though<00:05:23.830> he<00:05:24.010> had<00:05:24.160> some<00:05:24.430> tactical<00:05:25.390> slips

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
even though he had some tactical slips

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.440 
even though he had some tactical slips
during<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.020> torment<00:05:26.410> if<00:05:27.370> he'd<00:05:27.640> seen<00:05:27.910> this

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
during the torment if he'd seen this

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.510 
during the torment if he'd seen this
which<00:05:28.660> I<00:05:28.960> assume<00:05:29.290> he'd<00:05:29.740> seen<00:05:30.040> this<00:05:30.160> because

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
which I assume he'd seen this because

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.980 
which I assume he'd seen this because
this<00:05:30.669> porn<00:05:30.940> otherwise<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.810> whole<00:05:31.840> plan<00:05:33.990> could

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
this porn otherwise the whole plan could

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.870 
this porn otherwise the whole plan could
actually<00:05:35.050> be<00:05:35.530> working<00:05:35.770> with<00:05:36.070> this<00:05:36.280> Queen<00:05:36.580> sack

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
actually be working with this Queen sack

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.990 
actually be working with this Queen sack
so<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.390> think<00:05:37.479> it<00:05:37.810> is<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:38.020> very<00:05:38.350> important<00:05:38.710> note

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
so I think it is a very important note

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.760 
so I think it is a very important note
