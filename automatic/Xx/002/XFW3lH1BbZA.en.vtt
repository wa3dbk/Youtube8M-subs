Vietnam<00:00:28.230> era<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.029> I<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.240> even<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.480> Korean

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
Vietnam era and I think even a Korean

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.869 
Vietnam era and I think even a Korean
era<00:00:31.019> used<00:00:31.640> l19<00:00:37.370> it's<00:00:38.370> actually<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> wood

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
era used l19 it's actually a wood

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.560 
era used l19 it's actually a wood
structure<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:40.129> styrofoam<00:00:41.180> inlay<00:00:42.180> with

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
structure and styrofoam inlay with

structure and styrofoam inlay with
fiberglass<00:00:43.440> covering<00:00:49.399> now<00:00:50.399> they<00:00:50.550> were<00:00:50.610> Luna

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
fiberglass covering now they were Luna

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:00.950 
fiberglass covering now they were Luna
and<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.329> composite<00:00:58.879> I<00:00:59.879> think<00:01:00.359> that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and this is composite I think that

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.990 
and this is composite I think that
probably<00:01:01.350> there<00:01:01.649> things<00:01:02.160> about<00:01:02.309> chromoly

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
probably there things about chromoly

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.840 
probably there things about chromoly
steel<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.480> better<00:01:03.769> but<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:05.280> average<00:01:05.640> home

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
steel it's better but your average home

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.929

and<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.460> provides<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.390> pretty<00:02:46.110> hot<00:02:46.290> spark<00:02:46.650> an

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
and it provides a pretty hot spark an

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.310 
and it provides a pretty hot spark an
electrical<00:02:47.910> system<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:49.070> about<00:02:51.320> $350

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
electrical system and it's about $350

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.950 
electrical system and it's about $350
for<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.070> electrical<00:02:53.460> system<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.510> mag<00:02:54.720> I

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
for this electrical system and the mag I

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.150 
for this electrical system and the mag I
think<00:02:55.140> by<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> time<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.560> buy<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.740> adapter

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
think by the time you buy the adapter

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.250 
think by the time you buy the adapter
and<00:02:56.220> everything<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.670> closer<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.060> 700<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:58.110> it's

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
and everything is closer to 700 so it's

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.040 
and everything is closer to 700 so it's
about<00:02:58.410> low<00:02:58.590> cost<00:03:02.420> knows<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.660> direct<00:03:03.930> drive

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
about low cost knows the direct drive

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.260 
about low cost knows the direct drive

airplane<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:22.860> shaped<00:03:23.160> in<00:03:23.340> foam<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:24.000> then

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
airplane is shaped in foam and then

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:32.090 
airplane is shaped in foam and then
covered<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:24.930> fiberglass<00:03:30.470> matter<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.530> fact<00:03:31.740> I

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
covered with fiberglass matter of fact I

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.830 
covered with fiberglass matter of fact I
don't<00:03:32.700> know<00:03:32.790> if<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.000> can<00:03:33.120> see<00:03:33.300> inside<00:03:33.510> the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
don't know if you can see inside the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.300 
don't know if you can see inside the
wing<00:03:34.050> here<00:03:34.290> but<00:03:34.610> it's<00:03:35.610> kind<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:36.740> rigid<00:03:37.740> wing

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
wing here but it's kind of a rigid wing

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.270 
wing here but it's kind of a rigid wing
and<00:03:39.140> maybe<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.260> can<00:03:40.380> see<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.770> lot<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.070> people

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
and maybe you can see a lot of people

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.030 
and maybe you can see a lot of people
have<00:03:41.370> asked<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:41.910> took<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.930> little<00:03:43.110> inspection

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
have asked so I took a little inspection

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.260 
have asked so I took a little inspection

airplane this is a prototype it is the
only<00:04:02.850> one<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.090> fine

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
only one is fine

and<00:04:12.130> I've<00:04:13.130> been<00:04:13.280> flying<00:04:13.490> this<00:04:13.730> one<00:04:13.910> for<00:04:14.560> this

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
and I've been flying this one for this

and I've been flying this one for this
is<00:04:15.680> my<00:04:15.770> third<00:04:16.010> year<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.700> I've<00:04:16.970> got<00:04:17.180> about<00:04:17.480> 150

is my third year and I've got about 150
hours<00:04:18.170> total<00:04:18.470> time<00:04:24.220> on<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.370> hard<00:04:25.730> surface<00:04:26.030> I've

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
hours total time on a hard surface I've

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.390 
hours total time on a hard surface I've
had<00:04:26.690> off<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.990> ground<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.410> 200<00:04:27.920> feet<00:04:28.070> with<00:04:28.370> no

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
had off the ground and 200 feet with no

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.210 
had off the ground and 200 feet with no
wind<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:29.690> it<00:04:29.810> gives<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.050> good<00:04:30.080> honest<00:04:30.500> 700<00:04:31.160> feet

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
wind and it gives a good honest 700 feet

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.020 
wind and it gives a good honest 700 feet
a<00:04:31.280> minute<00:04:31.340> climb<00:04:32.830> we're<00:04:33.830> not<00:04:33.980> always<00:04:34.640> flying

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
a minute climb we're not always flying

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.510 
a minute climb we're not always flying
on<00:04:35.180> good<00:04:35.390> days<00:04:35.660> so<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.020> hate<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.340> exaggerate<00:04:37.340> but

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
on good days so I hate to exaggerate but

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.820 
on good days so I hate to exaggerate but
it<00:04:37.810> comes<00:04:38.810> off<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.080> ground<00:04:39.200> and<00:04:39.440> plenty<00:04:39.650> less

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
it comes off the ground and plenty less

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.980 
it comes off the ground and plenty less
than<00:04:39.980> 500<00:04:40.430> feet<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:43.490> cruises<00:04:43.820> it<00:04:44.210> likes<00:04:44.690> about

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
than 500 feet it cruises it likes about

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.130 
than 500 feet it cruises it likes about
6065<00:04:45.650> best<00:04:46.280> I've<00:04:46.880> had<00:04:47.060> it<00:04:47.180> at<00:04:47.270> 90<00:04:47.600> enough<00:04:47.840> ahead

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
6065 best I've had it at 90 enough ahead

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.020 
6065 best I've had it at 90 enough ahead
of<00:04:48.260> that<00:04:48.350> 30<00:04:50.890> yeah<00:04:51.890> I've<00:04:52.310> had<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.550> flying<00:04:52.790> power

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
of that 30 yeah I've had a flying power

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.000 
of that 30 yeah I've had a flying power
on<00:04:53.270> at<00:04:53.390> 30<00:04:53.630> and<00:04:53.900> is<00:04:54.110> still<00:04:54.290> very<00:04:54.530> controllable

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
on at 30 and is still very controllable

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:03.630 
on at 30 and is still very controllable
and<00:04:56.770> stall<00:04:57.770> speed<00:04:58.070> power<00:04:58.310> off<00:04:58.520> is<00:04:58.700> about<00:04:58.910> 38

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.710 

stick<00:05:04.640> and<00:05:04.790> rudder<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.330> all<00:05:06.190> both<00:05:07.190> cable<00:05:07.720> type

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
stick and rudder and all both cable type

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:20.490 
stick and rudder and all both cable type
controls<00:05:16.510> now<00:05:17.510> actually<00:05:18.050> I<00:05:18.110> used<00:05:18.850> dimensioned

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
controls now actually I used dimensioned

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.350 
controls now actually I used dimensioned
lumber<00:05:21.500> had<00:05:22.280> it<00:05:22.400> solved<00:05:22.760> for<00:05:22.970> me<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.120> don't<00:05:23.330> have

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
lumber had it solved for me I don't have

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.659 
lumber had it solved for me I don't have
electricity<00:05:23.810> at<00:05:24.080> home<00:05:24.140> so<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.650> done<00:05:25.340> most<00:05:25.550> of

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
electricity at home so I done most of

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:34.100 
electricity at home so I done most of
this<00:05:25.760> with<00:05:25.940> a<00:05:25.970> pocketknife<00:05:26.419> and<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.690> hands-on

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.260 

well<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.650> know<00:05:34.740> I<00:05:35.039> can't<00:05:35.400> say<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:35.789> but<00:05:36.030> I<00:05:36.120> did

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
well you know I can't say that but I did

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:50.270 
well you know I can't say that but I did
have<00:05:36.389> the<00:05:36.750> lover<00:05:37.020> dimensioned<00:05:48.020> they<00:05:49.020> sell<00:05:49.289> raw

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
have the lover dimensioned they sell raw

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.080 
have the lover dimensioned they sell raw
materials<00:05:50.669> kit<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:52.669> well<00:05:53.669> let's<00:05:53.819> say<00:05:53.940> the

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
materials kit and well let's say the

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.909 
materials kit and well let's say the
average<00:05:54.240> person<00:05:54.509> without<00:05:54.990> skills

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
average person without skills

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.850 
average person without skills
I<00:05:55.949> think<00:05:56.580> should<00:05:56.789> probably<00:05:57.360> plan<00:05:57.720> on<00:05:57.960> seven<00:05:58.800> or

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
I think should probably plan on seven or

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.279 
I think should probably plan on seven or
eight<00:05:58.919> hundred<00:05:58.949> hours<00:05:59.460> a<00:06:00.169> person<00:06:01.169> that's

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
eight hundred hours a person that's

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:10.189 
eight hundred hours a person that's
built<00:06:01.620> before<00:06:08.360> 500s<00:06:09.360> like<00:06:09.509> you<00:06:09.630> see<00:06:09.810> this<00:06:09.990> I've

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
built before 500s like you see this I've

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:16.969 
built before 500s like you see this I've
got<00:06:10.319> $3,500<00:06:11.280> in<00:06:11.460> it<00:06:15.380> just<00:06:16.380> like<00:06:16.500> it's<00:06:16.770> mine

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
got $3,500 in it just like it's mine

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.680 
got $3,500 in it just like it's mine
right<00:06:17.310> now

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.629
