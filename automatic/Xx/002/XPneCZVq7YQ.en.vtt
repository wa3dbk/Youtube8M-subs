dan Revere and I had discussed our

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.519 
dan Revere and I had discussed our
strategy<00:00:26.860> and<00:00:27.130> so<00:00:27.669> at<00:00:27.849> this<00:00:28.029> point<00:00:28.239> what<00:00:29.169> Dan

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
strategy and so at this point what Dan

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.830 
strategy and so at this point what Dan
and<00:00:29.710> I<00:00:29.739> focused<00:00:30.160> on<00:00:30.340> was<00:00:30.669> rolling<00:00:31.270> off<00:00:31.450> the<00:00:31.480> lip

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
and I focused on was rolling off the lip

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.260 
and I focused on was rolling off the lip
and<00:00:32.079> control<00:00:32.649> and<00:00:32.950> then<00:00:33.399> parting<00:00:33.910> from<00:00:34.059> the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
and control and then parting from the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.740 
and control and then parting from the
board<00:00:35.399> again<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.550> landing<00:00:36.969> was<00:00:37.059> crucial<00:00:37.540> and

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
board again the landing was crucial and

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.990 
board again the landing was crucial and
we're<00:00:38.440> trying<00:00:38.740> to<00:00:38.860> avoid<00:00:39.040> injury<00:00:39.520> at<00:00:39.700> all

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
not going to hit the bottom you also

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.990

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
lip that rolls off nicely it's nice and

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.569 
lip that rolls off nicely it's nice and
deep<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:05.229> know<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.409> also<00:01:05.799> got<00:01:06.009> a<00:01:06.040> look<00:01:06.220> at<00:01:06.369> at

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
deep you know you also got a look at at

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.719 
deep you know you also got a look at at
getting<00:01:07.570> into<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.409> water<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:09.009> place<00:01:09.490> like

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
getting into the water a place like

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.760 
getting into the water a place like
celestial<00:01:10.210> has<00:01:10.479> kind<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:10.899> tricky<00:01:11.289> entry<00:01:11.619> you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
celestial has kind of a tricky entry you

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.179 
celestial has kind of a tricky entry you
have<00:01:11.829> to<00:01:12.039> walk<00:01:12.789> down<00:01:12.819> some<00:01:13.299> slick<00:01:13.659> rocks<00:01:14.189> you

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
have to walk down some slick rocks you

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.499 
have to walk down some slick rocks you
want<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.460> be<00:01:15.549> careful<00:01:15.789> you<00:01:15.999> don't<00:01:16.299> want<00:01:16.359> to

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
want to be careful you don't want to

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.690 
want to be careful you don't want to
slip<00:01:16.749> and<00:01:16.869> fall<00:01:16.950> break<00:01:17.950> your<00:01:18.130> head<00:01:18.310> before<00:01:18.520> you

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
slip and fall break your head before you

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.649 
slip and fall break your head before you
even<00:01:18.969> get<00:01:19.119> there<00:01:19.289> so<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:21.520> all<00:01:21.700> these<00:01:21.880> these

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
even get there so with all these these

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.230 
even get there so with all these these
things<00:01:22.990> considered<00:01:23.619> dan<00:01:24.399> and<00:01:24.609> I<00:01:24.639> went<00:01:24.880> out<00:01:24.969> had

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
things considered dan and I went out had

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.539 
things considered dan and I went out had
a<00:01:25.270> great<00:01:25.569> day<00:01:25.840> both<00:01:26.649> of<00:01:26.679> us<00:01:26.829> had<00:01:27.039> great<00:01:27.280> lines

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
a great day both of us had great lines

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.260 
a great day both of us had great lines
no<00:01:28.450> injury<00:01:29.219> and<00:01:30.219> we<00:01:30.399> look<00:01:30.549> forward<00:01:30.789> to<00:01:30.909> pushing

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
no injury and we look forward to pushing

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.260 
no injury and we look forward to pushing
this<00:01:31.389> farther<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.469> again<00:01:33.459> I<00:01:33.609> think<00:01:33.670> safety<00:01:34.090> is

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
this farther so again I think safety is

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.050 
this farther so again I think safety is
the<00:01:34.719> most<00:01:34.869> crucial<00:01:35.609> component<00:01:36.609> of<00:01:36.729> doing

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
the most crucial component of doing

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.699 
the most crucial component of doing
anything<00:01:37.270> on<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.630> river<00:01:37.810> whether<00:01:38.469> you're<00:01:38.619> on

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
anything on the river whether you're on

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:40.289 
anything on the river whether you're on
a<00:01:38.740> board<00:01:39.039> or<00:01:39.130> in<00:01:39.279> a<00:01:39.310> kayak

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
a board or in a kayak

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.769 
a board or in a kayak
we<00:01:40.719> had<00:01:41.700> along<00:01:42.700> with<00:01:42.819> photographers<00:01:43.450> there<00:01:43.630> we

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:43.779 
we had along with photographers there we
