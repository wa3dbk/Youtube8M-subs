in a win I bust out with the other
figure<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.119> let's<00:02:06.299> set<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.810> side

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
figure so let's set that to the side

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.350 
figure so let's set that to the side
here<00:02:07.469> show<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.610> little<00:02:08.849> bit<00:02:08.940> about<00:02:09.060> this

aircraft launching have been stationed

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.020 
aircraft launching have been stationed
aircraft<00:02:37.980> carrier<00:02:38.250> before<00:02:38.580> us<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.910> know<00:02:39.000> I

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
aircraft carrier before us you know I

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.670 
aircraft carrier before us you know I
have<00:02:39.180> been<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.720> am<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.080> Navy<00:02:40.260> right<00:02:40.530> now

so I know what I'm talking about here so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.820 
so I know what I'm talking about here so
the<00:02:42.750> launching<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.260> kind<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.500> weird<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
the launching is kind of weird the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.870 
the launching is kind of weird the
arrows<00:02:44.100> are<00:02:44.250> backwards

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
wheels but it has three sets of wheels

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.610 
wheels but it has three sets of wheels
like<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.930> would<00:03:40.140> hey<00:03:41.040> freakin<00:03:41.820> aircraft

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
like it would hey freakin aircraft

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.600 
like it would hey freakin aircraft
alright<00:03:43.620> don't<00:03:43.890> know<00:03:44.070> what<00:03:44.220> those<00:03:44.340> are<00:03:44.400> but

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
alright don't know what those are but

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.460 
alright don't know what those are but
hey<00:03:44.880> I'll<00:03:45.030> show<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.450> got<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.049> point<00:03:46.350> on

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
hey I'll show you that got a point on

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.199 
hey I'll show you that got a point on
the<00:03:46.560> front<00:03:46.799> over<00:03:47.100> here<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:47.579> as<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.120> remember

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
the front over here so as you remember

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.810 
the front over here so as you remember
that<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.900> where<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.230> huge<00:03:49.650> cannon<00:03:50.280> laser

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
that is where that huge cannon laser

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.690 
that is where that huge cannon laser
would<00:03:51.209> shoot<00:03:51.480> out<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:52.410> yeah<00:03:53.100> pretty<00:03:53.459> well

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
would shoot out so yeah pretty well

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.720 
would shoot out so yeah pretty well
articulated<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.480> guess<00:03:54.690> this<00:03:55.680> mood<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.130> okay

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
articulated I guess this mood is okay

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.319 
articulated I guess this mood is okay
1985<00:03:57.630> I'll<00:03:58.590> give<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:58.880> slightly<00:03:59.880> above<00:04:00.150> average

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
1985 I'll give it slightly above average

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.060 
1985 I'll give it slightly above average
because<00:04:00.660> there's<00:04:00.780> nothing<00:04:00.930> horrible<00:04:01.290> give<00:04:01.980> it

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
because there's nothing horrible give it

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.100 
because there's nothing horrible give it
a<00:04:02.160> 6<00:04:02.459> out<00:04:02.579> of<00:04:02.610> 10<00:04:02.820> in<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.090> respect<00:04:03.600> alright

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
a 6 out of 10 in that respect alright

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.180 
a 6 out of 10 in that respect alright
let's<00:04:04.290> go<00:04:04.380> ahead<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.650> transform<00:04:04.950> into

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
let's go ahead and transform into

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.039 
let's go ahead and transform into
transformation<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.239> relatively<00:04:06.720> simple

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
transformation a is relatively simple

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.080 
transformation a is relatively simple
this<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.530> big<00:04:07.829> beast<00:04:08.100> but<00:04:08.579> leader<00:04:08.820> class

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
this is a big beast but leader class

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.530 
this is a big beast but leader class
size<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:09.390> first<00:04:09.840> let's<00:04:10.049> put<00:04:10.170> these<00:04:11.209> wheels<00:04:12.209> up

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
size so first let's put these wheels up

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.600 
size so first let's put these wheels up
so<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.260> transformation<00:04:13.620> split<00:04:14.220> open<00:04:14.579> the

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
so the transformation split open the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.770 
so the transformation split open the
arms<00:04:15.180> over<00:04:15.480> here<00:04:16.940> there<00:04:17.940> we<00:04:18.000> go<00:04:18.150> actually<00:04:18.600> move

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
arms over here there we go actually move

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.339 
arms over here there we go actually move
that<00:04:19.079> torso<00:04:19.440> oh<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.790> also<00:04:20.940> in<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:22.020> can<00:04:22.200> have

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
that torso oh and also in you can have

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.680 
that torso oh and also in you can have
you<00:04:22.560> can<00:04:22.590> store<00:04:22.890> some<00:04:23.099> some<00:04:24.000> components<00:04:24.570> in

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
you can store some some components in

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.500 
you can store some some components in
there<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:24.930> forgot<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.380> mention<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.890> so

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
there I forgot to mention that so

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.860 
there I forgot to mention that so
it<00:04:26.690> does<00:04:26.870> pop<00:04:27.080> up<00:04:27.140> oh<00:04:27.620> well<00:04:28.280> alright<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:29.390> we're

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
it does pop up oh well alright so we're

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.290 
it does pop up oh well alright so we're
going<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.080> do<00:04:30.230> it<00:04:30.350> in<00:04:30.470> attack<00:04:30.770> mode<00:04:30.800> first

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
going to do it in attack mode first

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.490 
going to do it in attack mode first
because<00:04:32.300> it's<00:04:32.480> easier<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:32.780> do<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.140> we're

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
because it's easier to do that we're

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.320 
because it's easier to do that we're
going<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.680> rotate<00:04:34.010> these<00:04:34.400> front<00:04:34.790> portions<00:04:35.210> of

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
going to rotate these front portions of

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.230 
going to rotate these front portions of
the<00:04:35.450> shift<00:04:35.710> 90<00:04:36.710> degrees<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.370> good<00:04:38.060> you're

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
the shift 90 degrees and good you're

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.910 
the shift 90 degrees and good you're
almost<00:04:38.390> in<00:04:38.600> attack<00:04:38.840> mode<00:04:38.870> then<00:04:39.560> we're<00:04:39.680> going

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
almost in attack mode then we're going

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.840 
almost in attack mode then we're going
to<00:04:39.950> lower<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.900> torso<00:04:42.130> put<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.280> upper<00:04:43.610> torso

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
to lower the torso put the upper torso

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.810 
to lower the torso put the upper torso
back<00:04:44.420> and<00:04:45.200> voila<00:04:45.620> so<00:04:46.100> this<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.370> pretty<00:04:46.610> much<00:04:46.760> a

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
back and voila so this is pretty much a

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.020 
back and voila so this is pretty much a
display<00:04:47.270> piece<00:04:47.480> let<00:04:47.750> me<00:04:47.840> rotate<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.470> arms<00:04:49.030> 180

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
display piece let me rotate the arms 180

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.690 
display piece let me rotate the arms 180
degrees<00:04:50.420> and<00:04:51.280> here<00:04:52.280> we<00:04:52.340> go

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
degrees and here we go

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.720 
degrees and here we go
not<00:04:53.390> very<00:04:53.540> articulated<00:04:54.260> but<00:04:55.040> just<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.550> show

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
not very articulated but just to show

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.530 
not very articulated but just to show

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.490 
figures I guess quick that's about it
has<00:05:43.100> a<00:05:43.130> little<00:05:43.580> bit<00:05:43.850> of<00:05:44.060> ankle<00:05:44.300> support<00:05:44.990> so<00:05:45.170> I

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
has a little bit of ankle support so I

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.740 
has a little bit of ankle support so I
don't<00:05:46.490> really<00:05:46.580> remember<00:05:46.730> what's<00:05:47.270> that<00:05:47.420> for<00:05:47.720> I

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
don't really remember what's that for I

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.120 
don't really remember what's that for I
guess<00:05:47.930> you<00:05:48.200> can<00:05:48.320> pop<00:05:48.470> it<00:05:48.650> out<00:05:48.740> make<00:05:48.920> him<00:05:49.100> a

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
guess you can pop it out make him a

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.850 
guess you can pop it out make him a
little<00:05:49.370> bit<00:05:49.460> taller<00:05:49.700> and<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:51.170> last<00:05:51.470> and<00:05:51.740> final

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
little bit taller and the last and final

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.770 
little bit taller and the last and final
mode<00:05:52.220> we<00:05:53.140> point<00:05:54.140> his<00:05:54.940> little<00:05:55.940> front<00:05:56.540> portion

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
mode we point his little front portion

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.480 
mode we point his little front portion
of<00:05:57.040> the<00:05:58.660> of<00:05:59.660> the<00:05:59.930> ship<00:06:00.170> up<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:00.800> you<00:06:01.160> have<00:06:01.340> his

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
of the of the ship up and you have his

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.850 
of the of the ship up and you have his
last<00:06:01.670> and<00:06:02.150> final<00:06:02.570> mode<00:06:02.750> which<00:06:03.320> makes<00:06:03.560> them

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
last and final mode which makes them

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.860 
last and final mode which makes them
truly<00:06:04.310> got<00:06:04.730> gigantic<00:06:05.480> and<00:06:06.190> as<00:06:07.190> for<00:06:07.550> scale

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
truly got gigantic and as for scale

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.870 
truly got gigantic and as for scale
let's<00:06:08.870> go<00:06:08.990> ahead<00:06:09.110> and<00:06:09.410> show<00:06:09.620> you<00:06:09.680> this<00:06:10.370> is<00:06:10.610> with

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
let's go ahead and show you this is with

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.310 
let's go ahead and show you this is with
a<00:06:10.910> leader<00:06:11.300> class<00:06:11.600> figure

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
a leader class figure

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.620 
a leader class figure
just<00:06:13.160> moving<00:06:13.460> to<00:06:13.670> the<00:06:13.700> side<00:06:14.000> over<00:06:14.210> here<00:06:14.450> so<00:06:14.570> you

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
just moving to the side over here so you

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.390 
just moving to the side over here so you
can<00:06:14.720> compare<00:06:15.560> them<00:06:16.750> okay<00:06:17.750> pretty<00:06:18.260> good<00:06:18.500> well

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
can compare them okay pretty good well

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.300 
can compare them okay pretty good well
that<00:06:19.850> is<00:06:20.030> the<00:06:20.270> SDF<00:06:20.630> one<00:06:20.900> because<00:06:21.800> of<00:06:21.980> both

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
that is the SDF one because of both

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.130 
that is the SDF one because of both
modes<00:06:22.610> are<00:06:22.790> kind<00:06:23.030> of<00:06:23.090> weak<00:06:23.300> I'm<00:06:23.690> just<00:06:23.990> going<00:06:24.110> to

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
modes are kind of weak I'm just going to

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.990 
modes are kind of weak I'm just going to
give<00:06:24.320> them<00:06:24.500> well<00:06:25.040> it's<00:06:25.160> not<00:06:25.280> bad<00:06:25.460> for<00:06:25.730> a<00:06:25.760> huge

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
give them well it's not bad for a huge

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.120 
give them well it's not bad for a huge
figure<00:06:26.300> back<00:06:26.480> in<00:06:26.660> the<00:06:26.720> day<00:06:26.870> so<00:06:26.930> let<00:06:27.890> me<00:06:27.980> give

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
figure back in the day so let me give

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.710 
figure back in the day so let me give
them<00:06:28.190> both<00:06:28.370> modes<00:06:28.610> six<00:06:29.060> out<00:06:29.180> of<00:06:29.210> ten<00:06:29.450> again

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
them both modes six out of ten again

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.870 
them both modes six out of ten again
that's<00:06:30.440> all<00:06:30.620> I<00:06:30.650> got<00:06:30.920> and<00:06:31.130> I'll<00:06:31.400> catch<00:06:31.640> you<00:06:31.700> all

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
that's all I got and I'll catch you all

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.480 
that's all I got and I'll catch you all
next<00:06:32.330> time
