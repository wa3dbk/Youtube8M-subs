00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.549
 well then welcome to tutorial in 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.630
 this case I bring you a pretty thing 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.910
 fast it's about the subject of being of 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.940
 free memory in this case I'm in 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.370
 mac but the theme is for windows or 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.170
 for whatever 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.850
 the fact is that there are many applications 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:25.220
 especially for the by the appstore 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.769
 they say that as they release you 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.860
 a branch that you have occupied and that does not 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:35.210
 you should have something like that 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.130
 this is really true these programs 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.680
 what they do is catch the memory 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.760
 inactive that is ram memory that is not 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.949
 using any program 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.109
 and they simply delete it then by 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.940
 example here I have 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.930
 350 megs for example is little but 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.600
 now I did not have many applications 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.239
 open and I wanted it this would erase it 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.590
 however in mac for example not 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.390
 we need no application of 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.989
 third parties to do this because the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.220
 own system brings a command that can 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.230
 do this for us 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.970
 to get it we just have to go to 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.410
 the terminal 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.410
 we are here but if not 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.870
 let's put it little big 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.670
 ok and now the next thing we have 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.710
 that writing is sudo to indicate that 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.720
 we are super users because this action 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.720
 it's something the user can do 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.270
 this is the command urge watch and if 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.020
 click enter will ask us our 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.850
 password 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.810
 this is what we use to start 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.610
 session 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.590
 you see that nothing is going to be written 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.299
 while you type a password but it's 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.750
 more than anything so that you do not see 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.090
 letters 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.530
 we now see it takes a little bit 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.660
 I do not take anything because it says 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.330
 that he had almost no memory but now 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.300
 we see that it goes from 350 megs to 27 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.120
 this is the example that I tell you not to 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.030
 we need a third - party application 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.470
 to do it 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.840
 another issue that we need to know is if 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.620
 we really need to release that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.980
 memory because I'm worth 350 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.880
 mega busy but had almost 5 gigs 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.850
 free 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.680
 and really that inactive memory though 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.250
 is not a memory that are occupying 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.620
 the applications at this precise moment 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.710
 is a memory that serves to accelerate 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.720
 your computer or when we use these 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.270
 programs to free that memory what 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.300
 What we do is that the computer goes more 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.100
 slow I explain 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.120
 if we open many applications 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.620
 or whatever 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.920
 these applications occupy a place in the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.790
 RAM 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.140
 this is an active memory at the moment 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.140
 but if we close these applications 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.860
 let's say that in inactive memory we see 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.750
 that we now have a little more 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.990
 and it stays like 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.360
 a kind of memory reserved for 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.580
 those programs that we had opened and 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.840
 that if we open again it will take a lot 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.980
 less in loading because it 's in the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.170
 ram memory and not on the disk then 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.240
 obviously when he remembers 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.280
 we subtract that inactive if I now by 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.680
 example again release the memory 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.320
 with this command and open one of those 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.000
 applications then it would open slower 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.620
 because I would have to go take it from 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.570
 disk instead of the ram memory that is 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.470
 where I had it reserved in memory 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.490
 inactive for that reason when you think that 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.959
 you are recording memory and you are 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.580
 making your computer more 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.030
 fast it's probably everything 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.030
 contrary 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.000
 and well this is not always true because 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.730
 sometimes we have liberated by 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.159
 example 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.730
 I use this command a lot when 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:07.170
 I have a windows virtual machine 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.240
 open I will not use mac for anything 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.990
 then this memory has the 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.780
 has the 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.180
 the programs that I have a mac 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.239
 preloaded or let's say 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.500
 those pre-loaded memory chunks and I 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.810
 I'm going to open a virtual machine in 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.280
 eggs to work on windows and I want 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.050
 forget about those programs because I do not 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.970
 I'll reopen maybe even 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.759
 to restart the computer 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.580
 then in that case if it would make sense 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:37.310
 use this command to release that 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.680
 memory that we can use with 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.470
 virtual box example or any program 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.180
 what virtual did I say and 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.370
 virtualization because it is the case in the 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.970
 that I use it mostly but it could be 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.970
 any other
