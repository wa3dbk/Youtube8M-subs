to wear it now as far as this hair goes

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.950 
to wear it now as far as this hair goes
on<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:38.340> density<00:04:38.850> on<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.180> is<00:04:39.360> I<00:04:39.570> would<00:04:39.750> say<00:04:39.900> so

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
on the density on it is I would say so

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.140 
on the density on it is I would say so
light<00:04:40.320> density<00:04:40.770> it's<00:04:40.920> not<00:04:41.070> thick<00:04:41.400> or<00:04:41.820> it's<00:04:42.060> not

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
light density it's not thick or it's not

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.060 
light density it's not thick or it's not
too<00:04:42.390> thick<00:04:42.600> at<00:04:42.750> all<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:43.110> does<00:04:43.320> look<00:04:43.350> very<00:04:43.620> nice

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
too thick at all it does look very nice

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.920 
too thick at all it does look very nice
when<00:04:44.370> it's<00:04:44.490> straightened<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.540> does<00:04:45.750> look

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
when it's straightened and it does look

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.270 
when it's straightened and it does look
like<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.260> could<00:04:46.410> be<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.620> thick<00:04:46.890> wood<00:04:47.070> but<00:04:47.250> it's

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
like it could be a thick wood but it's

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.160 
like it could be a thick wood but it's
actually<00:04:47.550> very<00:04:47.880> very<00:04:48.420> light<00:04:48.630> so<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:48.870> would<00:04:49.050> say

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
actually very very light so I would say

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.620 
actually very very light so I would say
the<00:04:49.260> density<00:04:49.680> is<00:04:49.710> light<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:50.220> it's<00:04:50.970> very<00:04:51.480> very

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
the density is light and it's very very

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.020 
the density is light and it's very very
airy<00:04:52.230> and<00:04:52.530> flow<00:04:52.830> as<00:04:53.040> you<00:04:53.250> guys<00:04:53.400> see<00:04:53.700> like<00:04:53.910> you
