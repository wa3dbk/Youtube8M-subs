00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
of probably the obvious difference that

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.170 
of probably the obvious difference that
you're<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> see<00:00:25.859> right<00:00:26.010> away<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.550> that

you're going to see right away and that
is<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.720> Start<00:00:27.990> screen<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.429> see

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
is the Start screen so as you can see

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.380 
is the Start screen so as you can see
Windows<00:00:30.689> Phone<00:00:30.900> 8.1<00:00:31.529> adds<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.489> background<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
Windows Phone 8.1 adds a background and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.880 
Windows Phone 8.1 adds a background and
they've<00:00:33.540> done<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.899> their<00:00:34.050> own<00:00:34.079> unique<00:00:34.620> way

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
they've done it in their own unique way

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.940 
they've done it in their own unique way
they've<00:00:35.160> kind<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.399> done<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.700> where<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.950> still

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
they've kind of done it where it's still

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.729 
they've kind of done it where it's still
kind<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.370> maintaining<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.090> tile<00:00:39.540> layout<00:00:40.260> in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
kind of maintaining that tile layout in

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.860 
kind of maintaining that tile layout in
the<00:00:40.890> live<00:00:41.070> tiles<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:41.879> as<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.300> move<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> has

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the live tiles but as you move it it has

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.630 
the live tiles but as you move it it has
a<00:00:42.899> parallax<00:00:43.440> effect<00:00:43.890> which<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.489> nice

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
a parallax effect which is really nice

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.020 
a parallax effect which is really nice
instead<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> static<00:00:45.960> tiles<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
instead of just the static tiles and

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
instead of just the static tiles and
depending<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.180> device<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.840> this

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
depending on the device you have this

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.600 
depending on the device you have this
layout<00:00:49.379> could<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> little<00:00:50.070> bit<00:00:50.190> different

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
layout could be a little bit different

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
layout could be a little bit different
but<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.059> get<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> idea<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.930> got<00:00:52.079> some

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
but you get the idea it's got some

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.250 
but you get the idea it's got some
really<00:00:52.559> great<00:00:52.860> backgrounds<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:55.020> works

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
really great backgrounds in and it works

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.920 
really great backgrounds in and it works
really<00:00:55.530> well<00:00:56.210> one<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> other<00:00:57.480> things<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
really well one of the other things that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.110 
really well one of the other things that
has<00:00:58.440> notably<00:00:58.980> been<00:00:59.250> added<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> the

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
pretty fast to begin with I will do this

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.970 
pretty fast to begin with I will do this
and

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.270

photos and we can share and it goes to

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.860 
photos and we can share and it goes to
the<00:04:54.860> app<00:04:55.040> instead<00:04:55.760> of<00:04:55.910> going<00:04:56.330> into<00:04:56.450> its<00:04:56.660> own

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870
