this<00:00:32.309> cool<00:00:32.369> gear<00:00:33.270> shift<00:00:33.600> lever<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.860> can

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
this cool gear shift lever that you can

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.250 
this cool gear shift lever that you can
move<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.520> down<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.030> underneath<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.020> desk

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
move up and down and underneath the desk

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.290 
move up and down and underneath the desk
you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.829> there's<00:00:38.040> also<00:00:38.219> these<00:00:38.610> three

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you can see there's also these three

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.510 
you can see there's also these three
foot<00:00:39.660> pedals<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.680> that's<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.430> whole<00:00:41.610> setup

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
foot pedals so that's the whole setup

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.310 
foot pedals so that's the whole setup
okay<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.730> first<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.390> demo<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
okay so first I'm going to demo the the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
okay so first I'm going to demo the the
actual<00:00:46.620> launch<00:00:46.829> control<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> first<00:00:47.879> thing

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
actual launch control so the first thing

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.940 
actual launch control so the first thing
you<00:00:48.120> do<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> kick<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.809> purple<00:00:49.230> space<00:00:49.410> program

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you do is kick in a purple space program

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.389 
you do is kick in a purple space program
whenever<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.969> fire<00:00:51.210> off<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> new<00:00:51.629> rocket<00:00:51.930> is

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
whenever you fire off a new rocket is

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.299 
whenever you fire off a new rocket is
you<00:00:53.399> turn<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> SAS<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.710> then<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.160> usually

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
you turn on the SAS and then you usually

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.760 
you turn on the SAS and then you usually
set<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> throttle<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.239> full<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.899> then<00:00:58.680> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
set the throttle to full and then you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.229 
set the throttle to full and then you
launch<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.250> actual<00:00:59.640> rocket<00:00:59.910> which<00:01:00.270> is

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.730 

what's<00:01:05.810> really<00:01:06.020> awesome<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.409> you've<00:01:06.530> got<00:01:06.650> this

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
what's really awesome is you've got this

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.100 
what's really awesome is you've got this
cupboard<00:01:07.040> switch<00:01:07.460> here<00:01:07.850> that<00:01:08.060> also<00:01:08.750> triggers

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
cupboard switch here that also triggers

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.280 
cupboard switch here that also triggers
the<00:01:09.260> abort<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:11.450> that's<00:01:11.659> just<00:01:11.869> that's<00:01:12.110> just

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
the abort and that's just that's just

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.940 
the abort and that's just that's just
really<00:01:12.710> fun<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:13.070> press<00:01:14.380> so<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.530> joystick

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
really fun to press so the joystick

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.260 
really fun to press so the joystick
bindings<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.580> tried<00:01:16.790> out<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:16.940> couple<00:01:17.000> things

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
bindings I tried out a couple things

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.440 
bindings I tried out a couple things
what<00:01:18.080> felt<00:01:18.710> most<00:01:18.890> natural<00:01:19.280> is<00:01:19.850> using<00:01:20.299> the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
what felt most natural is using the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.080 
what felt most natural is using the
right<00:01:21.170> stick<00:01:21.470> for<00:01:21.860> your<00:01:22.070> yaw<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:22.700> your<00:01:22.850> pitch

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
right stick for your yaw and your pitch

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.950 
right stick for your yaw and your pitch
controls<00:01:24.159> for<00:01:25.159> rolling<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:25.759> actually<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
controls for rolling it's actually the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.930 
controls for rolling it's actually the
foot<00:01:27.170> pedals<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.130> center<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.520> right<00:01:28.610> one<00:01:28.820> are

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
foot pedals the center and right one are

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.490 
foot pedals the center and right one are
bound<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> common<00:01:29.659> axis<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.259> since<00:01:30.409> you

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
bound to a common axis and since you

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.649 
bound to a common axis and since you
need<00:01:30.619> to<00:01:30.710> roll<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.920> lot<00:01:31.159> less<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:31.850> makes<00:01:32.390> sense

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
need to roll a lot less that makes sense

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.990 
need to roll a lot less that makes sense
since<00:01:33.110> it's<00:01:33.290> a<00:01:33.350> lot<00:01:33.500> less<00:01:33.649> precise<00:01:34.040> your

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
since it's a lot less precise your

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.030 
since it's a lot less precise your
throttle<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.899> rotation<00:01:36.590> lever<00:01:36.800> the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
throttle is the rotation lever the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.520 
throttle is the rotation lever the
leftward<00:01:37.460> lever<00:01:37.789> over<00:01:37.940> here<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:38.929> it's<00:01:39.200> just<00:01:39.470> a

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
leftward lever over here so it's just a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.279 
leftward lever over here so it's just a
little<00:01:39.649> increments<00:01:40.250> push<00:01:40.820> your<00:01:41.170> throttle<00:01:42.170> up

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
little increments push your throttle up

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.590 
little increments push your throttle up
and<00:01:42.440> down<00:01:42.590> you've<00:01:43.580> also<00:01:43.729> got<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:43.970> continuous

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
and down you've also got a continuous

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.650 
and down you've also got a continuous
throttle<00:01:45.050> as<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.310> left<00:01:46.520> pedal<00:01:46.789> which<00:01:47.479> is

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
throttle as the left pedal which is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.210 
throttle as the left pedal which is
analogous<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.080> like<00:01:48.289> a<00:01:48.350> gas<00:01:48.560> pedal<00:01:48.740> in<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:49.009> car

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
analogous to like a gas pedal in a car

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.279 
analogous to like a gas pedal in a car
you<00:01:49.399> just<00:01:49.550> hold<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.850> down<00:01:50.060> throttle<00:01:50.960> goes<00:01:51.080> up

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
you just hold it down throttle goes up

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.050 
you just hold it down throttle goes up
let<00:01:51.590> go<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:51.950> throttle<00:01:52.280> goes<00:01:52.460> back<00:01:52.670> down<00:01:55.060> so

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
let go of it throttle goes back down so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.399 
let go of it throttle goes back down so

they don't return to neutral when you
move<00:03:21.319> them<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.340> sometimes<00:03:22.700> it's<00:03:22.819> kind<00:03:22.969> of<00:03:22.999> hard

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
move them so sometimes it's kind of hard

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.819 
move them so sometimes it's kind of hard
to<00:03:23.209> tell<00:03:23.510> when<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.139> sticks<00:03:24.409> are<00:03:24.590> sending

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
to tell when the sticks are sending

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.410 
to tell when the sticks are sending
input<00:03:25.159> and<00:03:25.310> when<00:03:25.430> they're<00:03:25.549> not<00:03:25.579> so<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.209> gives

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
input and when they're not so that gives

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.300 
input and when they're not so that gives
you<00:03:26.569> a<00:03:26.810> very<00:03:27.230> nice<00:03:27.560> indication<00:03:28.129> of<00:03:28.219> when

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
you a very nice indication of when

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.860 
you a very nice indication of when
you're<00:03:28.430> actually<00:03:28.700> sending<00:03:28.849> pitch<00:03:29.269> if<00:03:29.599> you're

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
you're actually sending pitch if you're

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.770 
you're actually sending pitch if you're
only<00:03:30.139> meaning<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.680> be<00:03:30.769> sending<00:03:31.099> y'all<00:03:31.780> so

natural<00:03:45.040> if<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.250> hit<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.639> swap<00:03:47.000> switch<00:03:47.480> over

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
natural if you hit the swap switch over

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.819 
natural if you hit the swap switch over
here<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.499> changes<00:03:49.069> it<00:03:49.219> to<00:03:49.249> roll<00:03:50.049> which<00:03:51.049> is<00:03:51.079> you

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
here it changes it to roll which is you

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.369 
here it changes it to roll which is you
know<00:03:51.919> actual<00:03:52.400> airplane<00:03:52.760> controls<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:54.290> can

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
know actual airplane controls so you can

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.170 
know actual airplane controls so you can
switch<00:03:54.829> back<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.099> forth<00:03:55.310> pretty<00:03:55.639> easily

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
switch back and forth pretty easily

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.270 
switch back and forth pretty easily
between<00:03:56.450> flying<00:03:56.840> space<00:03:57.500> planes<00:03:57.829> airplanes

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
between flying space planes airplanes

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.629 
between flying space planes airplanes
and<00:03:58.459> rockets<00:03:58.519> which<00:03:59.150> is<00:03:59.299> a<00:03:59.329> pretty<00:03:59.780> handy<00:04:00.639> so

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
and rockets which is a pretty handy so

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.220 
and rockets which is a pretty handy so
the<00:04:01.730> last<00:04:01.909> thing<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.329> the<00:04:02.510> gear<00:04:02.750> lever<00:04:02.959> here

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
the last thing is the gear lever here

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.539 
the last thing is the gear lever here
which<00:04:03.260> controls<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:03.980> mode<00:04:04.189> that<00:04:04.219> the

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
which controls the mode that the

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.539 
which controls the mode that the
controller<00:04:05.180> is<00:04:05.359> in<00:04:05.389> so<00:04:06.139> there's<00:04:06.290> different

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
controller is in so there's different

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.979 
controller is in so there's different
different<00:04:07.549> key<00:04:07.760> bindings<00:04:08.239> basically<00:04:08.750> for<00:04:08.900> all

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
different key bindings basically for all

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.619 
different key bindings basically for all
the<00:04:09.079> buttons<00:04:09.790> for<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.909> different<00:04:11.150> modes<00:04:11.389> I've

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
the buttons for the different modes I've

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.089 
the buttons for the different modes I've
been<00:04:11.750> showing<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.139> flight<00:04:12.409> mode<00:04:12.680> here

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
been showing you the flight mode here

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.559 
been showing you the flight mode here
which<00:04:13.459> is<00:04:13.639> pretty<00:04:13.819> much<00:04:13.939> just<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.209> flying

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
which is pretty much just the flying

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.990 
which is pretty much just the flying
controls<00:04:15.079> you<00:04:15.709> can<00:04:15.829> also<00:04:15.949> shift<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.430> down<00:04:16.639> into

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
controls you can also shift it down into

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.449 
controls you can also shift it down into
reverse<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:17.780> that<00:04:18.199> remaps<00:04:18.769> all<00:04:18.979> the<00:04:19.130> buttons

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
reverse and that remaps all the buttons

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.020 
reverse and that remaps all the buttons
to<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:20.630> be<00:04:20.750> used<00:04:20.930> with<00:04:21.079> ship<00:04:21.289> editors<00:04:22.030> first

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
to to be used with ship editors first

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.330 
to to be used with ship editors first
gear<00:04:23.330> is<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.599> basic<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.320> know<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.770> launches

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
gear is a basic you know that launches

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.270 
gear is a basic you know that launches
it<00:04:25.460> into<00:04:25.610> pilot<00:04:25.820> mode<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.360> then<00:04:27.020> first<00:04:27.919> year

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
it into pilot mode and then first year

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.279 
it into pilot mode and then first year
switches<00:04:28.699> you<00:04:28.789> into<00:04:28.970> E<00:04:29.000> VA<00:04:29.300> which<00:04:29.900> gives<00:04:30.199> you

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
switches you into E VA which gives you

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.350 
switches you into E VA which gives you
basically<00:04:30.710> WASD<00:04:31.430> controls<00:04:31.610> on<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.120> center

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
basically WASD controls on the center

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.969 
basically WASD controls on the center
block<00:04:32.570> here<00:04:32.870> so<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.110> can<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.650> can<00:04:33.800> do<00:04:33.860> all

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
block here so you can you can do all

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.520 
block here so you can you can do all
your<00:04:34.099> curb<00:04:34.310> alleviation<00:04:35.300> but<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.199> coolest

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
your curb alleviation but the coolest

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.290 
your curb alleviation but the coolest
thing<00:04:36.830> is<00:04:37.099> if<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.430> switch<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:37.699> up<00:04:37.849> into<00:04:37.970> fifth

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
thing is if you switch it up into fifth

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.350 
thing is if you switch it up into fifth
gear<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:39.770> game<00:04:40.039> or<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:40.669> controller<00:04:41.120> starts

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
gear the game or the controller starts

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.710 
gear the game or the controller starts
receiving<00:04:42.280> state<00:04:43.280> input<00:04:43.759> from<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.120> mod<00:04:44.330> running

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
receiving state input from a mod running

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.230 
receiving state input from a mod running
inside<00:04:45.020> KSP<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.009> then<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.699> figures<00:04:46.880> out<00:04:47.090> the

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
inside KSP and then it figures out the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.080 
inside KSP and then it figures out the
the<00:04:47.630> state<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.080> controller<00:04:48.800> for<00:04:49.159> you<00:04:49.400> so

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
the state of the controller for you so

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.089 
the state of the controller for you so
for<00:04:50.300> example<00:04:50.630> right<00:04:50.750> now<00:04:50.810> I've<00:04:51.020> got<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.349> gear

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
for example right now I've got the gear

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.960 
for example right now I've got the gear
lights<00:04:52.370> on<00:04:52.639> and<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.360> overlay<00:04:54.199> lights<00:04:54.440> on<00:04:54.970> and

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
lights on and the overlay lights on and

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.060 
lights on and the overlay lights on and
SAS<00:04:56.419> is<00:04:56.570> turned<00:04:56.780> off<00:04:56.990> so<00:04:57.199> it's<00:04:57.349> just<00:04:57.560> flashing

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
SAS is turned off so it's just flashing

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.580 
SAS is turned off so it's just flashing
here<00:04:58.310> I<00:04:58.460> can<00:04:58.849> switch<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.330> ship<00:04:59.720> on<00:04:59.960> the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
here I can switch to a ship on the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.659 
here I can switch to a ship on the
runway<00:05:01.009> and<00:05:02.889> then<00:05:03.889> it<00:05:03.979> turns<00:05:04.190> on<00:05:04.370> all<00:05:04.639> the

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
runway and then it turns on all the

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.159 
runway and then it turns on all the
controls<00:05:05.120> that<00:05:05.210> ought<00:05:05.389> to<00:05:05.509> be<00:05:05.570> turned<00:05:05.780> on<00:05:05.960> so

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
controls that ought to be turned on so

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.159 
controls that ought to be turned on so
RCS<00:05:06.620> is<00:05:06.800> turned<00:05:07.009> on<00:05:07.449> brakes<00:05:08.449> lights<00:05:08.750> landing

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
RCS is turned on brakes lights landing

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.820 
RCS is turned on brakes lights landing
gears<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:10.849> same<00:05:11.060> overlay<00:05:11.539> and<00:05:12.229> SAS<00:05:12.650> is

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
gears and that same overlay and SAS is

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.950 
gears and that same overlay and SAS is
turned<00:05:13.039> on<00:05:13.190> over<00:05:13.430> here<00:05:13.669> so<00:05:14.419> that's<00:05:14.599> pretty

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
turned on over here so that's pretty

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.040 
turned on over here so that's pretty
cool<00:05:15.259> and<00:05:15.620> that<00:05:15.889> pretty<00:05:16.130> much<00:05:16.190> wraps<00:05:16.490> it<00:05:16.699> up<00:05:17.050> if

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
cool and that pretty much wraps it up if

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.870 
cool and that pretty much wraps it up if
you<00:05:18.110> like<00:05:18.199> it<00:05:18.590> go<00:05:18.949> download<00:05:19.219> it<00:05:19.430> if<00:05:19.669> you<00:05:19.759> don't

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
you like it go download it if you don't

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.279 
you like it go download it if you don't
have<00:05:19.969> a<00:05:20.030> steel<00:05:20.180> battalion<00:05:20.599> controller<00:05:20.960> you

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
have a steel battalion controller you

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.260 
have a steel battalion controller you
should<00:05:21.440> go<00:05:21.530> ahead<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:21.680> buy<00:05:21.889> one<00:05:22.159> I<00:05:22.400> think<00:05:23.150> it's

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
should go ahead and buy one I think it's

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.149 
should go ahead and buy one I think it's
really<00:05:23.389> awesome<00:05:23.509> and<00:05:24.050> well<00:05:24.860> worth<00:05:25.009> the

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
really awesome and well worth the

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.310 
really awesome and well worth the
investment
