00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.910
 tutorial where you can super galaxies 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.160

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.110

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.430
 camera how are the nails going to be 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.430
 but today you lewis 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.340
 let's start painting our nails 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.650
 of a very light gray color. 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.689
 that is the gray color as the color of 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.610
 the newspaper sheet since we finished 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.710
 to paint our nails we are going to take 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.199
 a container and we're going to fill it with 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.530
 alcohol let's submerge our line 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.600
 to alcohol and let's take a piece of paper 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.960
 newspaper 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.879
 [Music] 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:53.690
 we take them out and we get strong 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:56.510
 and for about 20 seconds 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.000
 since our 20 seconds pass we go 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.899
 to withdraw our paper and we will 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.899
 stay like this 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.600
 and we do the same with all of our 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:14.300
 dinners 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:17.000
 [Music] 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.280
 and that's how it looks on our nails and 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.190
 to finish we will clean the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.320
 outline of our nail that remained 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.130
 newspaper letters 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 so do it with all your energies 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.119
 and to finish we will put in your 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.840
 varnish protector in all our 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.140

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.439
