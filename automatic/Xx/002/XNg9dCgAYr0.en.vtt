and a each of us has qualities that make

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.700 
and a each of us has qualities that make
them<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:14.810> little<00:01:14.990> different<00:01:15.409> than

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
them a little different than

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.040 
them a little different than
characteristics<00:01:16.610> from<00:01:16.760> each<00:01:17.030> other<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.540> you

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
characteristics from each other and you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.440 
characteristics from each other and you
should<00:01:18.320> build<00:01:18.470> pick<00:01:18.740> out<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:19.130> deep<00:01:19.909> chord<00:01:20.210> and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
should build pick out a deep chord and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.850 
should build pick out a deep chord and
hear<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.780> it's<00:01:20.900> different<00:01:21.320> in<00:01:21.500> tone<00:01:21.800> and

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
hear that it's different in tone and

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.180 
hear that it's different in tone and
character<00:01:23.229> then<00:01:24.229> in<00:01:24.409> cheek<00:01:24.560> or<00:01:24.799> not<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.070> much

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
character then in cheek or not so much

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.600 
character then in cheek or not so much
tone<00:01:25.490> but<00:01:26.350> richness<00:01:27.350> fullness<00:01:27.860> G<00:01:28.190> has<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.400> lot

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
tone but richness fullness G has a lot

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.370 
tone but richness fullness G has a lot
more<00:01:28.759> notes<00:01:29.000> in<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:29.240> lower<00:01:29.479> base<00:01:29.750> notes<00:01:30.050> and

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
more notes in it lower base notes and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.070 
more notes in it lower base notes and
things<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:31.490> then<00:01:32.149> also<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:32.630> should<00:01:32.810> be<00:01:32.869> able<00:01:32.930> to

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
things so then also I should be able to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.680 
things so then also I should be able to
recognize<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.860> three<00:01:34.729> common<00:01:35.240> or<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.509> three

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
recognize the three common or the three

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.109 
recognize the three common or the three
open<00:01:36.110> minor<00:01:36.740> chords<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.399> minor<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:38.380> minor<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.850> D

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
open minor chords a minor a minor and D

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.320 
open minor chords a minor a minor and D

come across what's happening right there
now<00:03:03.010> there's<00:03:03.220> another<00:03:03.370> big<00:03:03.910> hint<00:03:04.180> that

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
now there's another big hint that

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.699 
now there's another big hint that
happens<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.840> lesson<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.319> is<00:03:05.530> we

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
happens in the lesson and that is we

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.650 
happens in the lesson and that is we
hear<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.040> played<00:03:06.580> like<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:07.000> we<00:03:07.239> also<00:03:07.390> heard

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
hear it played like that we also heard

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.820 
hear it played like that we also heard
played<00:03:07.959> like<00:03:08.140> this

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.950 

you

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.470 

and<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:18.550> can<00:03:18.670> hear<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.060> same<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.450> same

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
and you can hear it's the same the same

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.320 
and you can hear it's the same the same
chord<00:03:20.020> progression<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.030> again<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.240> an

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
chord progression so again this is an

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.130 
chord progression so again this is an
exploring<00:03:22.870> like<00:03:23.650> work<00:03:24.520> it<00:03:24.670> out<00:03:24.820> lesson<00:03:25.780> like

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
exploring like work it out lesson like

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.210 
exploring like work it out lesson like
many<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.500> other<00:03:26.590> ones<00:03:26.860> that<00:03:26.920> we<00:03:27.040> have

many of the other ones that we have

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.150 
many of the other ones that we have
there<00:03:27.460> but<00:03:27.640> really<00:03:28.330> important<00:03:29.170> thing<00:03:29.710> for<00:03:29.740> all
