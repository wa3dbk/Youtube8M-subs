00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.259
 Welcome to the Nerd Praise I am 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.630
 Attila biologist researcher and my super 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.010
 to be dissatisfied with the universe 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.720
 from the comics 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.460
 today we will understand what would happen 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.820
 with whom the sources were available 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.590
 scientific superpowers super heroes 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.390
 can achieve power in various ways 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.199
 may be mythological as thorium 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.060
 Hercules 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.059
 although the power that the tor can inherit 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.610
 has declined quite recently in this 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.280
 in case the character is often born 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.290
 with that gift others have mystical origin 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.510
 with the psychic or magical powers of the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.760
 strange doctor of source cause 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.520
 known mechanisms but what does not 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.559
 lack are scientific or pseudo sources 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.059
 power that bring 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.730
 capacity for the character that even 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.070
 then it was an ordinary person gamma radiation 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.500
 cosmic radiation chemical bath 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.690
 genetic modification and until now have been 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.489
 used as a source of ae powers 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.710
 we left the super-soldier's serum to 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.320
 another episode what all these sources 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.510
 have in common is the wrong premise that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.290
 they change the genome of the character to 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.990
 best 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.790
 change what the body is capable of and 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.610
 let's explain with these two points 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.590
 how change happens and what it 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.630
 cause the first problem with this type 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.520
 source of power is that even in the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.710
 best of scenarios with changes that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.810
 really would bring them 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.420
 would be restricted to one part of the body 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.520
 as a pair of muscles fundamental to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.799
 Flash race the glutes won 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.900
 powers in the chemical bath if he was 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.970
 dress and whatever fell 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.549
 in it could very well absorb us 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.890
 very deeply the cells 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.290
 would prevent the poison from 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.840
 transgenic radioactive spider changed the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.729
 peter parker's entire body does not exist 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.439
 the central control that says what 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.750
 world has to do and can be 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.579
 modified, each cell has its own 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.340
 own backpackers guide copy 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.350
 the genome and need to consult 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.329
 your own instructions 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.070
 so in the case of the spider man the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.740
 genes that give superpowers would be 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.259
 restricted to the bite region or 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.659
 circulatory system it could become 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.849
 John our spider cells begin to 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.610
 life with all the instructions to do 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.799
 all parts of the body and according to 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.829
 aging them inactive or not 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.560
 need a chick beak cell 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.810
 only forms the beak because it inactive 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.310
 instructions to do everything else and not 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.860
 because some part of the central body 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.780
 decided that she would be after adulthood 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.569
 only a technology that purposely 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.640
 attacks all cells would generate a 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.400
 GM to act around 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.470
 the body or mutation is present in the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.690
 cell that originates the whole embryo and comes 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.250
 of parents or this mutation happens soon 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.709
 in the early stages of 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.750
 development so the mutants 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.049
 x-men make much more biological sense 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.120
 and will have their own neurology 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.159
 universe of comics would be much more 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.799
 accurate that whoever had superpowers 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.349
 were the children whose exposure was 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.930
 West had spilled record in the lap 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.359
 for example and our second problem 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.159
 would happen even in the case of sources of 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.560
 powers with the potential to act in the body 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.150
 all as some types of radiation to 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.829
 radiation that the quartet 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.769
 fantastic was exposed is formed 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.480
 mainly protons and electrons 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.190
 pieces of atoms formed and destroyed 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.430
 stars that are traveling and 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.290
 high speeds yes the sun has its 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.449
 own proton weapon but it does not 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.280
 only affects ghosts when you are 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.900
 particles loaded against the 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.329
 cells they transmit an energy 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.639
 huge to a very small point. 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.470
 new molecules causing among others 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:43.949
 things damage to dna 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.500
 the result mutations the same happens 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:48.569
 with gamma radiation that hit the hulk 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.609
 I say bruce banner or wave type 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.709
 electromagnetic as light but very 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.599
 more energy emitted mainly 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.919
 nuclear reactions and large 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.480
 space events 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.340
 the gamma ray eruptions are 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.180
 event that is brighter than 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.829
 knows 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.079
 probably formed when the nucleus 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.449
 of a massive collapsing star and she 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.519
 form a little black hole 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:10.590
 this gamma radiation can cross 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.150
 more barriers than protons and 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.819
 electrons and can easily reach 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.620
 whole body cells also transfers 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.530
 energy to the cells and destroys 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.010
 the dna which brings the question of which power 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.980
 that someone would win like 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.320
 random dance in dna and I bring a 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.600
 bad news with the marvel universe 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.490
 ruins pictures and to do in the article by 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.650
 michael lynch on the consequences of 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.330
 mutations and humans considering the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.640
 main causes of mortality in the 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.490
 world stroke stroke 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.520
 nearly half of the causes of 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.410
 human death are due to mutations 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.330
 and as with some women 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.600
 infected with the human papilloma virus 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.020
 or hpv that inserts its DNA into the cells 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.880
 of the uterus and causes mutations a true 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.340
 virus t but in real life is 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.010
 closely associated with the second tumor 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.990
 most common in women there is no 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.880
 because it is much more likely that 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.860
 a mutation to destroy a gene that 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.480
 works especially well for those who 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.090
 control how much the cell can 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.100
 divide than to bring powers if who 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.140
 mutations would suffer the embryo 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.150
 chances would be better because the 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.130
 own process of developing the 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.710
 fetus selects only that they able to 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.930
 grow properly we do not 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.730
 account but more or less half of the 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.100
 Fertilized eggs are aborted 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.350
 spontaneously before the fetus 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.340
 develop well before the woman knows 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.590
 who is pregnant 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.350
 after adult neutral mutations or 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.000
 positive cells will affect only that cell or 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.380
 at most to the neighbors 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.090
 unless it is divided 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.740
 wildly 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.960
 I am afraid that the flight that 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.000
 would probably only become one of the 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.860
 time, do not forget to enjoy and 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.690
 share the video and if in our 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.180
 channel to continue destroying the 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.160
 childhood dream and until the next fifth 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.630
 but thanks to Gomes Gomes for the 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.790
 help the episode 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.430
 please comments suggestions comments 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.590

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.900
 this episode was an offer from 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.640
 nerdice I'm there beyond the income protocol 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.640
 you find other books t-shirts 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.390
 mugs and even stop there the young average 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:28.730
 I'm at the point with br
