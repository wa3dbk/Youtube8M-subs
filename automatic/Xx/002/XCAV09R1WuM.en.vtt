thought that was really cool and I
wanted<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.090> make<00:00:24.240> one<00:00:24.449> better<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.740> here's<00:00:25.980> mine

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
wanted to make one better so here's mine

wanted to make one better so here's mine
a<00:00:26.640> lot<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> videos<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.349> watched<00:00:28.619> didn't

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
a lot of the videos I watched didn't

a lot of the videos I watched didn't
really<00:00:29.310> show<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:29.849> was<00:00:30.000> inside<00:00:30.390> until

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
really show you what was inside until

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.310 
really show you what was inside until
the<00:00:30.929> end<00:00:31.880> you<00:00:32.880> got<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.210> put<00:00:33.360> ice<00:00:33.570> inside<00:00:34.079> these

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the end you got to put ice inside these

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.979 
the end you got to put ice inside these
things<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.850> if<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.270> don't<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.690> an<00:00:36.809> ice

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

don't<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.940> ice<00:00:45.180> supply<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.710> bother

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
don't have ice supply then don't bother

with this I haven't really done any

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.600 
with this I haven't really done any
extensive<00:00:52.770> test<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.989> most<00:00:54.989> chunk<00:00:55.890> ice<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
extensive test but most chunk ice you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
extensive test but most chunk ice you
know<00:00:56.760> cracked<00:00:57.090> ice<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.780> whatever<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.620> out

this thing on

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.750 
this thing on
maybe<00:01:06.840> three<00:01:07.380> hours<00:01:07.530> maybe<00:01:07.950> less<00:01:08.280> depending

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
maybe three hours maybe less depending

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.399 
maybe three hours maybe less depending
on<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> temperature<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.930> really<00:01:10.290> high

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
on the temperature we have really high

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.850 
on the temperature we have really high
temperatures<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.479> mine<00:01:12.479> runs<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.290> two

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
temperatures here mine runs on two

temperatures here mine runs on two
12-volt<00:01:14.460> computer<00:01:15.030> fan<00:01:15.270> motors<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:16.590> cut<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
12-volt computer fan motors just cut the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.700 
12-volt computer fan motors just cut the
top<00:01:17.189> out<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.670> an<00:01:18.270> old<00:01:18.450> cooler<00:01:18.960> cleaned<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> out

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
top out of an old cooler cleaned it out

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.260 
top out of an old cooler cleaned it out
and<00:01:20.840> installed<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> fans<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:23.490> didn't<00:01:24.060> really

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and installed the fans I didn't really

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.609 
and installed the fans I didn't really
feel<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.540> how-to<00:01:25.350> video<00:01:26.040> was<00:01:26.369> necessary

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
feel like how-to video was necessary

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.770 
feel like how-to video was necessary
considering<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.430> how<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.700> cut<00:01:30.509> holes

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
considering if you know how to cut holes

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.120 
considering if you know how to cut holes
in<00:01:31.140> plastic<00:01:33.320> that's<00:01:34.320> what<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.680> need<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.890> know

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
in plastic that's what you need to know

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.969 
in plastic that's what you need to know
I<00:01:35.430> made<00:01:36.119> mine<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.780> little<00:01:37.020> bit<00:01:37.140> fancier<00:01:37.799> than

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
I made mine a little bit fancier than

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.620 
I made mine a little bit fancier than
the<00:01:38.040> other<00:01:38.280> ones<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.729> actually<00:01:38.909> took<00:01:39.329> and

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
printed these out these outer parts on

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
printed these out these outer parts on
the<00:01:43.590> printer<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.310> center<00:01:44.640> part<00:01:44.909> came<00:01:45.240> out<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the printer the center part came out of

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.740 
the printer the center part came out of
a<00:01:45.750> Honda<00:01:46.079> Accord<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:47.240> basically<00:01:48.240> those<00:01:48.450> just

thing<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:58.079> I'll<00:01:58.350> show<00:01:58.380> y'all<00:01:58.860> what<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> sounds

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
thing on I'll show y'all what it sounds

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.139 
thing on I'll show y'all what it sounds
like

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
like

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.350 
like
I'll<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:01.259> running<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.680> off<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.130> one<00:02:02.670> 12-volt

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
I'll be running it off of one 12-volt

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.200 
I'll be running it off of one 12-volt
battery

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.590 

I<00:02:08.270> don't<00:02:08.600> have<00:02:08.810> any<00:02:09.230> little<00:02:09.470> string<00:02:10.330> things<00:02:11.330> on

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
I don't have any little string things on

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.840 
I don't have any little string things on
the<00:02:11.690> front<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.170> show<00:02:12.380> y'all<00:02:12.680> but<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.550> see

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the front to show y'all but I can see

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:44.500 
the front to show y'all but I can see
it's<00:02:14.090> close

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.360 

so<00:02:45.019> your<00:02:45.260> temperature<00:02:45.800> going<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.159> vary

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
so your temperature going to vary

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.420 
so your temperature going to vary
depending<00:02:46.670> on<00:02:47.150> how<00:02:47.930> much<00:02:48.530> ice<00:02:48.799> you<00:02:49.069> got<00:02:49.280> in

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
depending on how much ice you got in

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.449 
depending on how much ice you got in
there<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.950> how<00:02:51.950> much<00:02:52.129> of<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.819> air<00:02:53.390> flows

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
there and how much of the air flows

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.240 
there and how much of the air flows
across<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.730> ice

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.580 

so<00:03:01.250> it's<00:03:01.400> going<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.610> depend<00:03:01.760> how<00:03:02.360> on<00:03:03.110> your<00:03:03.410> air

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
so it's going to depend how on your air

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.160 
so it's going to depend how on your air
how<00:03:03.860> cold<00:03:04.160> your<00:03:04.340> area<00:03:04.670> is<00:03:04.730> depending<00:03:05.240> on<00:03:05.390> how

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
how cold your area is depending on how

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.440 
how cold your area is depending on how
much<00:03:06.350> ice<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.860> got<00:03:07.069> and<00:03:07.430> how<00:03:07.640> much<00:03:07.850> air<00:03:08.180> you

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
much ice you got and how much air you

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.390 
much ice you got and how much air you
can<00:03:08.630> get<00:03:08.810> across<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.650> going<00:03:10.190> out<00:03:10.990> of<00:03:11.990> the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
can get across it going out of the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.860 
can get across it going out of the
contraption<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:13.790> when<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.060> design<00:03:14.420> these<00:03:14.630> you

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
contraption so when you design these you

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.350 
contraption so when you design these you
may<00:03:15.020> want<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.260> consider<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.920> only<00:03:16.760> thing<00:03:17.090> I

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
may want to consider that only thing I

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.570 
may want to consider that only thing I
would<00:03:17.600> have<00:03:17.630> done<00:03:17.800> differently<00:03:18.800> is<00:03:19.190> move

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
would have done differently is move

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.120 
would have done differently is move
these<00:03:19.850> back<00:03:20.270> a<00:03:20.300> little<00:03:20.630> bit<00:03:20.840> different<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:22.010> I

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
these back a little bit different and I

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.400 
these back a little bit different and I
thought<00:03:22.370> about<00:03:22.670> putting<00:03:23.050> maybe<00:03:24.050> a<00:03:24.200> little

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
thought about putting maybe a little

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.190 
thought about putting maybe a little
plastic<00:03:24.800> guard<00:03:25.400> going<00:03:25.730> downwards<00:03:26.390> but<00:03:27.050> it

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
plastic guard going downwards but it

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.530 
plastic guard going downwards but it
would<00:03:27.290> really<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.650> get<00:03:27.890> in<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.040> way<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:28.540> I'm

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
would really just get in the way so I'm

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.160 
would really just get in the way so I'm
not<00:03:29.780> going<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.989> bother<00:03:30.110> with<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.970> I've<00:03:32.170> also

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
not going to bother with it I've also

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.900 
not going to bother with it I've also
made<00:03:33.860> basically<00:03:34.670> or<00:03:35.269> converted<00:03:35.870> just<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.910> piece

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
made basically or converted just a piece

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.080 
made basically or converted just a piece
you<00:03:38.060> plug<00:03:38.300> into<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.630> wall<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.920> it's<00:03:40.220> 12<00:03:40.550> volts

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
you plug into the wall and it's 12 volts

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.920 
you plug into the wall and it's 12 volts
just<00:03:41.480> like<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.840> fans<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:43.459> one<00:03:43.670> wasn't

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
just like the fans this one wasn't

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.309 
just like the fans this one wasn't
wasn't<00:03:44.930> quite<00:03:45.110> enough<00:03:45.260> for<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.739> fans<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.250> chose

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
wasn't quite enough for the fans I chose

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.309 
wasn't quite enough for the fans I chose
was<00:03:48.319> like<00:03:48.560> 12<00:03:48.890> volt<00:03:49.510> 1000<00:03:50.510> milliamps<00:03:51.110> my

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
was like 12 volt 1000 milliamps my

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.759 
was like 12 volt 1000 milliamps my
camera's<00:03:51.739> not<00:03:51.769> focusing<00:03:52.489> I'm<00:03:52.670> sorry<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:54.410> I

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
camera's not focusing I'm sorry so I

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.530 
camera's not focusing I'm sorry so I
have<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.160> get<00:03:55.310> one<00:03:55.489> a<00:03:55.519> little<00:03:55.700> bit<00:03:55.910> bigger<00:03:56.120> or

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
have to get one a little bit bigger or

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.370 
have to get one a little bit bigger or
maybe<00:03:56.810> one<00:03:57.410> for<00:03:57.680> each<00:03:57.739> fan<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:59.019> last<00:04:00.019> but<00:04:00.230> not

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
maybe one for each fan and last but not

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.000 
maybe one for each fan and last but not
least<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:01.100> solar<00:04:01.430> panel<00:04:01.910> this<00:04:02.810> one<00:04:03.110> actually

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
least the solar panel this one actually

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.990 
least the solar panel this one actually
got<00:04:04.250> out<00:04:04.519> of<00:04:04.700> a<00:04:05.269> Volkswagen<00:04:06.019> years<00:04:06.890> ago<00:04:07.220> I'm

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
got out of a Volkswagen years ago I'm

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.479 
got out of a Volkswagen years ago I'm
sure<00:04:08.299> they<00:04:08.450> make<00:04:08.720> probably<00:04:09.500> better<00:04:09.799> that<00:04:10.340> are

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
sure they make probably better that are

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.039 
sure they make probably better that are
cheaper<00:04:10.910> now<00:04:11.170> but<00:04:12.170> this<00:04:12.709> one<00:04:12.920> was<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.220> VW

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
cheaper now but this one was a VW

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.150 
cheaper now but this one was a VW
there's<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.170> part<00:04:15.410> number<00:04:15.739> if<00:04:15.829> you<00:04:15.920> want<00:04:16.100> to

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
there's the part number if you want to

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.699 
there's the part number if you want to
look<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:16.430> up<00:04:16.519> and<00:04:16.579> research<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.470> it's<00:04:18.470> got<00:04:18.680> a

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
look it up and research it it's got a

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.759 
look it up and research it it's got a
cigarette<00:04:19.130> plug<00:04:19.609> on<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.060> end<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.690> sticks<00:04:21.530> to

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
cigarette plug on the end and sticks to

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.270 
cigarette plug on the end and sticks to
a<00:04:21.799> window<00:04:22.630> I'm<00:04:23.630> probably<00:04:23.930> going<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.380> get<00:04:24.530> some

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
a window I'm probably going to get some

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.170 
a window I'm probably going to get some
multiple<00:04:25.850> ones<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:27.070> maybe<00:04:28.070> keep<00:04:28.700> that<00:04:28.940> for

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
multiple ones and maybe keep that for

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.930 
multiple ones and maybe keep that for
the<00:04:29.210> car<00:04:29.590> got<00:04:30.590> some<00:04:30.860> cord<00:04:31.220> here<00:04:31.550> if<00:04:31.760> you're

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
the car got some cord here if you're

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.580 
the car got some cord here if you're
going<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.150> do<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.510> I<00:04:32.750> would<00:04:32.900> just<00:04:33.110> wire<00:04:33.350> the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
going to do that I would just wire the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.150 
going to do that I would just wire the
solar<00:04:33.860> panel<00:04:34.310> into<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.330> battery<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.160> then

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
solar panel into the battery and then

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.219 
solar panel into the battery and then
the<00:04:37.310> battery<00:04:37.700> into<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.300> motor<00:04:38.570> because<00:04:39.050> the

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
the battery into the motor because the

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.650 
the battery into the motor because the
solar<00:04:39.500> panels<00:04:40.010> by<00:04:40.250> themselves<00:04:40.940> sometimes<00:04:41.150> are

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
solar panels by themselves sometimes are

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.350 
solar panels by themselves sometimes are
a<00:04:41.690> pain<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.260> keep<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.310> speed<00:04:43.610> up<00:04:43.640> on<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.030> motor

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
a pain to keep the speed up on the motor

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.150 
a pain to keep the speed up on the motor
so<00:04:44.690> it's<00:04:44.840> nice<00:04:45.020> just<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.410> keep<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.800> battery

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
so it's nice just to keep the battery

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.390 
so it's nice just to keep the battery
charged<00:04:46.930> so<00:04:47.930> y'all<00:04:48.650> come<00:04:48.860> up<00:04:49.039> with<00:04:49.220> some

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
charged so y'all come up with some

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.260 
charged so y'all come up with some
