I've<00:00:26.679> just<00:00:26.710> decided<00:00:27.009> to<00:00:27.429> switch<00:00:27.609> them<00:00:27.759> over<00:00:27.849> it

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
I've just decided to switch them over it

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.359 
I've just decided to switch them over it
was<00:00:28.210> just<00:00:28.359> easy<00:00:28.630> so<00:00:29.470> that's<00:00:29.650> why<00:00:29.830> it<00:00:29.890> handles

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
was just easy so that's why it handles

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.550 
was just easy so that's why it handles
aren't<00:00:30.669> on<00:00:30.849> their<00:00:31.060> backs<00:00:31.810> or<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.080> step<00:00:32.290> is<00:00:32.439> at

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
aren't on their backs or the step is at

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.010 
aren't on their backs or the step is at
theirs<00:00:32.970> but<00:00:33.970> to<00:00:35.100> say<00:00:36.100> I'm<00:00:36.309> using<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:37.780> keys

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
theirs but to say I'm using the the keys

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.000 
theirs but to say I'm using the the keys
on<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.410> keyboard

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
on the keyboard

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:46.350 
on the keyboard
I'm<00:00:39.969> just<00:00:40.450> gonna<00:00:40.629> rim<00:00:43.379> jog<00:00:44.379> this<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:45.579> melon

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
I'm just gonna rim jog this the melon

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.319 
I'm just gonna rim jog this the melon
machine<00:00:46.600> around<00:00:46.809> so<00:00:47.559> here<00:00:47.739> we<00:00:47.829> go<00:00:48.120> let's<00:00:49.120> take

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
machine around so here we go let's take

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:59.900 
machine around so here we go let's take
the<00:00:50.250> z-axis<00:00:51.250> back<00:00:51.879> up

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.119 

it<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.810> run<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.050> faster<00:01:01.230> steps<00:01:01.739> than<00:01:01.980> this

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
it can be run it faster steps than this

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.520 
it can be run it faster steps than this
but<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.540> business<00:01:06.540> mop<00:01:06.750> rates<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> by<00:01:07.260> hands

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
but to business mop rates it by hands

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.200 
but to business mop rates it by hands
and<00:01:07.800> I<00:01:07.890> don't<00:01:07.920> want<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.580> now<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.060> it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and I don't want to do that now is it

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.980 
and I don't want to do that now is it
that<00:01:09.360> fast

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that fast

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.740 
that fast
there's<00:01:10.680> no<00:01:10.830> end<00:01:11.070> stops<00:01:11.460> yet<00:01:11.760> because<00:01:12.720> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
there's no end stops yet because I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.320 
there's no end stops yet because I
haven't<00:01:12.990> connected<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.770> rim<00:01:14.330> micro

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
haven't connected up to the rim micro

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330 
haven't connected up to the rim micro
switches<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.410> just<00:01:16.590> watching<00:01:16.800> for<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
switches so I'm just watching for the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.760 
switches so I'm just watching for the
endler<00:01:20.510> that's<00:01:21.510> that's<00:01:22.260> about<00:01:22.410> me<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:22.740> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
endler that's that's about me what I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.740 
endler that's that's about me what I
think<00:01:22.890> yeah<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.430> fully<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.710> then

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
think yeah that's fully up and then

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.920 
think yeah that's fully up and then
let's<00:01:27.750> swing<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.560> table<00:01:29.450> one<00:01:30.450> way<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
let's swing the table one way in the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.550 
let's swing the table one way in the
other<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.780> do

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
other to do to do

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.120 
other to do to do
like<00:01:36.130> say<00:01:36.369> there's<00:01:36.610> no<00:01:36.790> and<00:01:37.890> stops<00:01:38.890> at<00:01:39.070> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
like say there's no and stops at the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.850 
like say there's no and stops at the
moment<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.659> software<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.290> stops<00:01:41.560> haven't

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
moment the software and stops haven't

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.020 
moment the software and stops haven't
been<00:01:41.979> set<00:01:42.220> up<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:44.340> you're<00:01:45.340> judging<00:01:45.640> where<00:01:45.820> to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
been set up so you're judging where to

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.240 
been set up so you're judging where to
stop<00:01:46.270> at<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.479> moment<00:01:47.070> okay

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
stop at the moment okay

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:57.429 
stop at the moment okay
that's<00:01:48.490> fully<00:01:48.729> across<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.180> way

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.380 

due<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:59.179> fourth<00:01:59.450> axis<00:01:59.749> is<00:02:00.429> not<00:02:01.429> CNC

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
due to the fourth axis is not CNC
