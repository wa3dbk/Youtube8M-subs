00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
about going from point A harmonically

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.470 
about going from point A harmonically
and<00:00:37.820> melodically<00:00:38.260> back<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.559> point<00:00:39.800> a

and melodically back to point a
harmonically<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:41.630> melodically<00:00:42.579> with<00:00:43.579> a

harmonically and melodically with a
seamless<00:00:44.949> quality<00:00:46.059> here's<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.269> beginning<00:00:47.839> of

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
seamless quality here's the beginning of

00:00:48.050 --> 00:01:26.500 
seamless quality here's the beginning of
the<00:00:48.410> Rachmaninoff<00:00:49.010> vocal<00:00:49.460> ease

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:38.450 

the<00:01:27.510> point<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.650> went<00:01:28.950> from<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:37.460> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the point is that I went from to the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.440 
the point is that I went from to the
whole<00:01:38.610> phrase<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:40.940> I'm<00:01:41.940> gonna<00:01:42.119> play<00:01:42.390> it

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
whole phrase is just I'm gonna play it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.430 
whole phrase is just I'm gonna play it
once<00:01:42.690> more

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
once more

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.700 
once more
and<00:01:44.420> take<00:01:45.420> some<00:01:45.450> breaths<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.110> time<00:01:46.320> because

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and take some breaths this time because

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.190 
and take some breaths this time because
it's<00:01:47.190> not<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.150> yes<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.600> took<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.869> couple<00:01:49.110> of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it's not just a yes I took a couple of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.410 
it's not just a yes I took a couple of
circular<00:01:49.560> breasts<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:50.190> it's<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.520> not

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
circular breasts and it's really not

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.170 
circular breasts and it's really not
just<00:01:51.900> about<00:01:52.640> circular<00:01:53.640> breathing<00:01:53.880> that's

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
just about circular breathing that's

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.499 
just about circular breathing that's
just<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.420> technique<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.380> could<00:01:55.860> use<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.280> not

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
just a technique you could use or not

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.580 
just a technique you could use or not
it's<00:01:57.509> about<00:01:58.070> playing<00:01:59.070> note<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.940> note

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
it's about playing note to note

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.010 
it's about playing note to note
seamlessly<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.119> did<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> incorrectly

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
seamlessly so if you did it incorrectly

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:14.720 
seamlessly so if you did it incorrectly
it<00:02:04.410> might<00:02:04.619> sound<00:02:04.830> like<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:14.580> would<00:02:14.700> be

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
it might sound like this that would be

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.440 
it might sound like this that would be
incorrect

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
incorrect

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.900 
incorrect
obviously<00:02:15.959> not<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.950> musical<00:02:17.430> line<00:02:17.580> let<00:02:17.850> me

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
obviously not the musical line let me

00:02:17.910 --> 00:03:06.100 
obviously not the musical line let me
try<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.180> once<00:02:18.480> again

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110
