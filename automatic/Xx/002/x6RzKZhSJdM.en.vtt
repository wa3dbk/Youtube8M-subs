help<00:00:55.320> define<00:00:55.830> the<00:00:56.520> two<00:00:56.760> we're<00:00:57.330> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> look

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
help define the two we're going to look

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.290 
help define the two we're going to look
at<00:00:57.809> Lance<00:00:58.050> Moore<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.949> launch<00:00:59.220> the<00:01:00.059> wide

the what would be defined as a jam at

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.340 
the what would be defined as a jam at
the<00:01:05.460> line<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.729> scrimmage<00:01:05.909> by<00:01:06.360> EA<00:01:06.600> standards

wide receivers the wide receivers turn

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.270 
wide receivers the wide receivers turn
and<00:01:12.390> look<00:01:13.050> back<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> quarterback<00:01:13.890> which

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
and look back at the quarterback which

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
and look back at the quarterback which
they<00:01:14.520> should<00:01:14.820> by<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> way<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.200> notice<00:01:16.470> how

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
they should by the way but notice how

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.110 
they should by the way but notice how
much<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> wide<00:01:17.070> receivers<00:01:17.490> turn<00:01:17.670> their<00:01:17.850> heads

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
much the wide receivers turn their heads

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.170 
much the wide receivers turn their heads
to<00:01:18.870> look<00:01:19.080> back<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.590> defensive<00:01:20.040> backs<00:01:20.310> don't

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
to look back the defensive backs don't

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570 
to look back the defensive backs don't
look<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:22.110> they<00:01:22.260> do<00:01:22.320> why<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.400> happening

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
look when they do why is this happening

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.580 
look when they do why is this happening
well<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.360> because<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.960> read<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> react

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
well it's because the read and react

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.929 
well it's because the read and react
system<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.880> big<00:01:27.150> illusion<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:28.140> madden<00:01:28.710> 13

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
system is one big illusion in madden 13

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.550 
system is one big illusion in madden 13
the<00:01:29.939> developers<00:01:30.479> say<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> defensive

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the developers say that the defensive

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.319 
the developers say that the defensive
backs<00:01:31.770> won't<00:01:32.070> react<00:01:32.549> unless<00:01:32.789> they<00:01:33.119> actually

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
backs won't react unless they actually

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.630 
backs won't react unless they actually
see<00:01:33.840> what's<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> question

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
see what's going on but the question

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.749 
see what's going on but the question
becomes<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.750> actually<00:01:37.409> triggers<00:01:37.950> these

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
becomes what actually triggers these

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.520 
becomes what actually triggers these
defensive<00:01:39.360> bags<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.840> turn<00:01:40.049> their<00:01:40.320> heads

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
defensive bags to turn their heads

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.039 
defensive bags to turn their heads
because<00:01:41.000> it's<00:01:42.000> supposed<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.539> be<00:01:42.750> when<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
because it's supposed to be when the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.810 
because it's supposed to be when the
wide<00:01:43.229> receiver<00:01:43.649> turns<00:01:44.219> around<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.729> looks

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
wide receiver turns around and looks

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.270 
wide receiver turns around and looks
back<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> quarterback<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.130> see

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
back at the quarterback but we can see

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.279 
back at the quarterback but we can see
that<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.759> not<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:48.090> case<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.990> is

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
that that is not the case so what is

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.830 
that that is not the case so what is
actually<00:01:49.979> causing<00:01:50.700> these<00:01:51.090> defensive<00:01:51.630> backs

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
actually causing these defensive backs

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.840 
actually causing these defensive backs
to<00:01:52.020> turn<00:01:52.200> their<00:01:52.409> heads<00:01:52.649> keep<00:01:53.250> an<00:01:53.369> eye<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.520> Leon

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
to turn their heads keep an eye on Leon

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.789 
to turn their heads keep an eye on Leon
Hall<00:01:54.119> he's<00:01:54.359> watching<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.780> wide<00:01:55.020> receiver<00:01:55.469> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
Hall he's watching the wide receiver and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.609 
Hall he's watching the wide receiver and
Devery<00:01:56.759> Henderson<00:01:56.880> again<00:01:57.630> he's<00:01:57.990> looking<00:01:58.380> back

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
Devery Henderson again he's looking back

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.370 
Devery Henderson again he's looking back
as<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.729> he's<00:01:59.880> anticipating<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.899> past<00:02:01.140> but

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
as if he's anticipating the past but

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.160 
as if he's anticipating the past but
Leon<00:02:01.649> Hall<00:02:01.890> never<00:02:02.189> turns<00:02:02.520> his<00:02:02.640> head<00:02:03.170> until

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
Leon Hall never turns his head until

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.740 
Leon Hall never turns his head until
this<00:02:04.439> moment<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.280> at<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.850> moment<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.539> ball

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
this moment but at this moment the ball

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.529 
this moment but at this moment the ball
is<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.679> the<00:02:07.799> air<00:02:07.829> already<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:09.090> we<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.420> it's

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
is in the air already so we know it's

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.150 
is in the air already so we know it's
not<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.750> wide<00:02:10.020> receivers<00:02:10.530> turning<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
not the wide receivers turning and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.770 
not the wide receivers turning and
looking<00:02:11.190> back<00:02:11.670> at<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:11.940> quarterback<00:02:12.330> that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
looking back at the quarterback that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.110 
looking back at the quarterback that
triggers<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.260> defensive<00:02:13.860> backs<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.730> turn<00:02:14.940> and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
triggers the defensive backs to turn and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.620 
triggers the defensive backs to turn and
look<00:02:15.240> for<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> ball<00:02:17.090> finally<00:02:18.090> let's<00:02:18.300> look<00:02:18.420> at

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
look for the ball finally let's look at

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.010 
look for the ball finally let's look at

knows that the ball is in the air and
that<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.070> what<00:02:53.280> triggers<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.180> defensive

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
that is what triggers the defensive
