00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.580
 I remember how much I felt then 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.890
 today my mother is with me 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.920
 birthday the yellow pokémon special 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.230
 pikachu edition handed over this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.969
 For the moment I was my gameboy again 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.340
 tied up and could not do anything else 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.740
 do as my pokémon to exercise 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.920
 I was really addicted to this 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.260
 Game I always bought more edition 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.650
 but until today, no one has even me 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.380
 Almost as excited as that all 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.309
 is already a while ago 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.010
 meanwhile, I'm actually with 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.960
 pokémon finished who was not the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.840
 the day my mother was my mother 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.790
 wanted to renovate the room 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.860
 She said I should have one already 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.520
 everything starts from the room 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.220
 to vacate 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.010
 she would be in the meantime new color 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.140
 buy so I was now alone too 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.520
 home and started all posters 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.660
 hang out and my wardrobe 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.090
 overcome 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.309
 to me something out of his jacket in the 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.530
 Cabinet fell to him 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.770
 I looked and realized that it was 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.300
 was a yellow pokémon edition 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.010
 I wanted to go crazy 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.380
 actually I thought I had that 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.520
 lost the game 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.060
 Of course, I immediately had a round 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.340
 play 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.410
 So I took my old gameboy and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.450
 whether the game is on 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.810
 but the opening video appeared to me 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.200
 Somehow strange something was 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.590
 that the melody which in the background too 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.240
 hearing was not like I could 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.090
 to remind me that the city 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.390
 melodee always very happy sounded this 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.670
 but sounded a bit happy it was 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.229
 a dull electronic noise too 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.910
 hear 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.190
 since my gameboy is not exactly the newest 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.069
 I thought it was just a sound 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.050
 error the game showed me mine now 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.060
 score 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.100
 I started and everything seemed as usual 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.530
 I was in my room and 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.360
 immediately ran outside 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.209
 but as soon as I left my house 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.869
 to get the music smelling again 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.620
 This time I found it a bit 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.780
 peculiarly 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.670
 i opened my pokemon team and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.260
 was amazed that it was only 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.700
 out of a pokémon I was pikachu 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.150
 saw the picture just one more 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.239
 had half full life announcement 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.250
 So I ran to the pokémon center as me 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.390
 I immediately realized that something 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.590
 not true on the walls were red 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.099
 recognize pixel 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.250
 almost as blood I went to 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.290
 nurse and squeezed it is closed 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.329
 late 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.459
 The ad only appeared very briefly 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:41.689
 just long enough to read it 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.109
 I press again disappeared shone 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:46.069
 a new ad on what was just with 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.840
 happened to the game 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.900
 that could not be ordinary 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 still be a game mistake 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.010
 the pokémon center 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.620
 but what awaited me outside choice 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.510
 even worse 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.750
 you could recognize the figurines 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.359
 Everything was on the ground 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.599
 full of red pixels and the worst 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.409
 the music was suddenly ice cold to me 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.769
 go down 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.859
 when I heard the awful melody 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.959
 My head started to hurt 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.819
 i opened my pokémon team again and 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.769
 realized that pikachu now too 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.269
 had disappeared 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.549
 I considered shortening the game to end 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.639
 and restart the gameboy 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.440
 but something looks me off 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.040
 caught the game character to be at 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.340
 move 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.540
 I just walked straight ahead but on 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.470
 Landscape changed nothing 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.270
 suddenly a black one 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.700
 Einblendung made 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.100
 just like being on a pokemon 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.880
 met and must now fight 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.250
 and that's exactly how it became the screen 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.470
 bright again and I saw pikachu in front of me 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.470
 but now with a full one 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.090
 life announcement but it did not look like 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.610
 otherwise 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.860
 his eyes were overblown 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.060
 shown 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.700
 besides, they were dyed dark red 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.190
 pikachu's look was threatening and 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.220
 hateful i played a growing one 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.840
 Queasy feeling in the stomach area 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.850
 I saw my trainer figure instead 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.390
 an otherwise trained by me pokémon 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.150
 it looked like I should be standing there 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.830
 fight against pikachu 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.670
 Suddenly a speech bubble appeared 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.800
 the screen fight as you have us 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.230
 let fight 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.420
 the duel started I had the first 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.440
 attacked but I could not untermain anything 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.230
 find attacks 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.510
 I had no choice but one 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.940
 to throw a cup 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.290
 but retract instead of the picacho 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.220
 he shattered even before you even 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.080
 came near him 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.610
 It felt like I was entering 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.530
 perceive soft laughter 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.570
 which but not from the game too 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.430
 but seemed to come through the 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.960
 entire room pulled pikachu in the row 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.770
 I expected a usual attack like 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.690
 donna flash but I was far off 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.790
 instead of seeing his ability to use 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.640
 it looks like the pikachu is his 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.650
 trainer jumping right in the face 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.520
 the whole screen was red 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.230
 pixel covered i was shocked now 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.920
 dipped the picacho again on the 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.710
 screen up 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.020
 It was now sad and his ears 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.060
 hung limp down 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.740
 it has affected down yet it 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.410
 still had a trace of anger in it 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.020
 it looked like one 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.870
 Speech bubble that would not have happened 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.090
 have to 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.640
 me it is enough to panic rang through 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.919
 the game boy removed the game and 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.870
 threw it in a corner I ran out 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.790
 my room 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:55.060
 only when my mother came back again 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:58.810
 I looked back I looked after the game 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.080
 but it was gone and that remained 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.080
 is
