00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
is any different now I appreciate the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.899 
is any different now I appreciate the
fact<00:01:49.799> they're<00:01:50.009> trying<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> exact

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
timing these sorts of things is

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
timing these sorts of things is
difficult<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.600> knew<00:01:54.810> where<00:01:55.140> Simon<00:01:55.380> US

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649

you say painful and prolonged twenty
five<00:02:20.670> percent<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.420> figure<00:02:21.620> had<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.769> in

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
five percent is the figure had that in

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.649 
five percent is the figure had that in
the<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.189> the<00:02:23.219> intro<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:23.819> for<00:02:24.090> long<00:02:24.299> what<00:02:24.599> do

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
the in the intro but for long what do

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.940 
the in the intro but for long what do
you<00:02:24.719> mean<00:02:24.840> by<00:02:24.870> prolonged<00:02:25.230> what<00:02:25.709> something

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
you mean by prolonged what something

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.190 
you mean by prolonged what something
nothing<00:02:26.069> will<00:02:26.250> play<00:02:26.400> out<00:02:26.430> over<00:02:26.579> a<00:02:26.730> few<00:02:26.879> years

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
nothing will play out over a few years

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.220 
nothing will play out over a few years
and<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.500> will<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:29.430> will<00:02:29.489> have<00:02:30.299> much<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.140> know

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
and it will it will have much you know

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.259 
and it will it will have much you know
very<00:02:31.560> broad<00:02:31.799> implications<00:02:32.069> for<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.819> domestic

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
very broad implications for the domestic

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.690 
very broad implications for the domestic
economies<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.859> know<00:02:34.950> Canada's<00:02:35.459> past

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
economies I think you know Canada's past

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.280 
economies I think you know Canada's past
performance<00:02:36.390> really<00:02:36.720> isn't<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.109> good

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
performance really isn't a good

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.869 
performance really isn't a good
indicator<00:02:37.769> of<00:02:37.890> future<00:02:38.010> performance<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.790> this

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
indicator of future performance in this

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.339 
indicator of future performance in this
case<00:02:39.090> because<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.420> think<00:02:39.540> housing<00:02:40.049> will<00:02:40.200> be

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
case because I think housing will be

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.500 
case because I think housing will be
awfully<00:02:41.310> big<00:02:41.459> drag<00:02:41.700> on<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:41.909> economy<00:02:42.030> over<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
awfully big drag on the economy over the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.500 
awfully big drag on the economy over the
next<00:02:42.569> few<00:02:42.900> years<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:44.310> as<00:02:44.909> you<00:02:45.120> know<00:02:45.269> better

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
next few years but as you know better

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.699 
next few years but as you know better
than<00:02:45.689> I<00:02:47.239> this<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.420> all<00:02:48.599> about<00:02:48.750> local<00:02:49.290> markets

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
than I this is all about local markets

than I this is all about local markets
really<00:02:50.310> rather<00:02:50.760> than<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.180> national<00:02:52.169> view<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
really rather than a national view and

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
back in nineteen ninety six so the

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.539 
back in nineteen ninety six so the

that actually over a quarter of
homeowner<00:04:07.889> households<00:04:08.609> are<00:04:08.729> actually

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
homeowner households are actually

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.360 
homeowner households are actually
spending<00:04:10.290> more<00:04:10.620> than<00:04:10.680> thirty<00:04:10.949> percent<00:04:11.189> their

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
income on shelter costs which actually

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.159 
income on shelter costs which actually
close<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:13.379> a<00:04:13.560> record<00:04:13.919> high<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:15.750> we<00:04:15.840> set<00:04:16.019> back

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
close to a record high that we set back

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.629 
close to a record high that we set back
in<00:04:16.199> 1996<00:04:17.009> when<00:04:17.099> interest<00:04:17.340> rates<00:04:17.459> were

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
in 1996 when interest rates were

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.069 
in 1996 when interest rates were
actually<00:04:18.000> much<00:04:18.239> much<00:04:18.449> higher<00:04:18.690> than<00:04:18.750> they<00:04:19.049> are

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
actually much much higher than they are

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.890 
actually much much higher than they are
today<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.159> think<00:04:20.280> even<00:04:20.579> modest<00:04:21.269> or<00:04:21.479> moderate

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
today so I think even modest or moderate

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.360 
today so I think even modest or moderate
increases<00:04:22.469> and<00:04:22.620> mortgage<00:04:22.889> rates<00:04:23.099> over<00:04:23.340> the

next<00:04:23.669> few<00:04:23.940> years<00:04:24.080> put

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
next few years put

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.460 
next few years put

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.710 
serious impact on housing affordability
but<00:04:27.980> do<00:04:28.130> you<00:04:28.190> actually<00:04:28.340> think<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:29.300> is<00:04:29.480> going

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
but do you actually think that is going

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.140 
but do you actually think that is going
to<00:04:29.840> happen<00:04:30.020> because<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:31.490> most<00:04:31.730> recent

more dovish i think i think we over the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
the next few years i think we'll see

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.590 
the next few years i think we'll see
