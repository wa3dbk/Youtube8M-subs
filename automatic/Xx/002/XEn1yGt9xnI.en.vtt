 fry 3 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.010
 3 chops and let's bake 3 chops 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.530
 so that he sees how to do the two ways 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.860
 The first thing we are going to do is have a 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.640
 that the flour first the egg and the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.010
 bank first and the chop already have 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.620
 salt and pepper to taste 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.730
 let's put it first in the ávila 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.010
 Be well covered with flour 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.010

 that is well covered also egg 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.980
 and then to the bank we press so that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.980
 the bank sticks well 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.220
 and covert of so co 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.710
 Y 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.710
 we are going to fry 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.390
 and so we are going to do with the other three 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.670
 let's leave about a few 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.640
 that is golden three or four 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.210
 minutes on each side we go to oblivion with 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.600
 the rounds and here the total of 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.140
 almost seven minutes we flipped it and three 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.300
 and three 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.210

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.880
 up and down we are going to 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.760
 with the agent there for 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.290
 remove the excess we lower the temperature 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.540
 of the oil because it will be without 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.280
 obsolete in the case of going to 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.319
 do the other three 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.620
 you have to be careful with the racing and 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.620
 slowly 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:45.210
 the oil removed we will need it 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.890
 and we're going to make those that go to the oven 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.170
 you can cut to see that they are well 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.630
 cooked from the middle but mixed we are going to 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.790
 make the ones that are going to bake the tower 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.390

 let's put the same chops here 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.280
 the same way we will pass it to the 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.019
 flour 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.769
 the egg and the bank and put them in the 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.769
 tray 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.150

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:31.060
 Bake for 8 minutes each 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.030
 side taking care not to leave anything else and 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.509
 with that they're going to be ready let's put 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.509
 the oven 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.200
 in what this is in what is in the 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.070
 same oven we can go preparing the 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:50.070
 sauce that is basically simple this 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.740
 sauce with kapszuk they sell it already 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.900
 made or equal you can use sauce 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.450
 barbeque but in this case this is the 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.090
 that takes salsa act capsule that is 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:05.180
 simple to do here we have a 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:07.400
 sorry half a cup of ketchup sauce 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.560
 and we are going to put two tablespoons of 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:15.530
 soy sauce 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:18.790
 two spoonfuls of English sauce one 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:23.610
 teaspoon of dijon mustard 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.610
 and all this we are going to mix it well 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.070
 let's just beat well beaten and ready 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.220
 it will be 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.380
 and this is our sauce we put it to 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.680
 somewhere for when we're going to 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.950
 use and here you are ready and you are baked 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.230
 and above are alike doraditas 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.650
 try the 10 minutes on each side that you already 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.300
 we flip them are the 20 minutes 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.210
 same as you can put it and make sure 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.640
 put into the furnace so as 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.770
 can put 4 25 degrees follow styles and 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.390
 only leave them about 67 minutes 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.660
 each side but the case is that they are 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.540
 golden on top I had forgotten that 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.200
 when we put to put the chops there 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.120
 to put a little spray of 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.680
 spray oil above that helps you 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.259
 a lot to brown 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.770
 we are going to close and ready, we have them 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:21.009

 and we're going to serve them only for you 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:26.200
 see if there is a difference when 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.650
 bakes are those 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.010
 and when he writes it that way it's much more 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:36.010
 fast they are much more golden and but 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.680
 that's something and also there is a little more 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:41.380
 juicy when fried 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.750
 well here we made them baked for 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:48.430

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.000
 katsu over 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:31.420
 to one side or both of those things that separate 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.420
 state 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:39.639
