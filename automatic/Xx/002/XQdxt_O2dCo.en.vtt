00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello everyone today i am going one 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.890
 do a tutorial about the essence gel nails 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.069
 at home 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.300
 put I have this set now 1 time 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.460
 used in this is the second time 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.780
 going to use to move forward and me too 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.759
 For a moment I say that I am completely 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.809
 no nail art m 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.789
 and many of you know this 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.500
 probably already makes it happy for it 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.810
 very interesting to me because I think so 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.490
 anyone could really do the and out 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.199
 even if you do not who it 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.050
 are actually through the steps on the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.789
 box are yet to come to a 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.710
 perfect gel manicure that is emmy 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.420
 for the essentials I have the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 essence cleanser 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.399
 the essence primer the essence and pilot 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.940
 shell base and just color sometimes 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.050
 a hand against if you have miami and have 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.079
 also one 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.980
 cleo gel top coat and of course the led 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.629
 lamp 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.070
 so let's start here quickly on the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.930
 back of those boxes are all 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.489
 instructions so I'll just follow them 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.110
 and Kelly and you show 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.489
 clean the first steps with 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.489
 this essence cleanser 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.100
 and then we have to apply the primer 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.690
 You have to leave this one at the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.890
 apply other edges to your nail 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.890
 to succeed with a neat 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.670
 then my essence gel nails at home 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.530
 apply pill or basecoat and this is one 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.150
 whole sticky basecoat 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.670
 You also need a dots media we bring with you 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.660
 nail and l6 is applied then you go that 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.140
 under the lamp 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.140
 let it dry 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.369
 after pressing the lamp once 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.159
 something in it yet it doesn't dry so I go 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.200
 now there is a bow on the package 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.659
 really busy at times and it is dry 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.939
 but I don't really feel that I'm drying 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.350
 So just search a few times and 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.850
 the sky be okay 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.830
 And now you will just be with your nails 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.810
 very sticky and everything is now 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.849
 really completely sticky so that is why 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.099
 now with a cotton pad 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.780
 apply the smallest one above your nails 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.780
 because sticky a bit 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.360
 then it is time to antje your nail 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.190
 This can really be any one is one 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.769
 butcher i you are there is milk that tells 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.540
 you also just use one actually 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.090
 so for example from the hema or catrice 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.680
 and so on but I think that's a cutting mat 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.080
 Cabin is safest if you have it for it 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.090
 try armpit first and I have it in it 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.769
 also give the best result 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.330
 mind you this day that you are not with you 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.980
 Another thing to do the LED lamp is this you need 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.970
 just let it dry as you normally do 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.200
 is doing 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.180
 and then we move on to the next one 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.180
 step girls we are going to paint our nails 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.340
 if your nails are completely dry really 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.080
 completely dry then you can topcoat 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.760
 apply a thick layer here 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.920
 of application and again the dots 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.620
 and then you can go to Gorius any time 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.800
 a few seconds under this led lamp 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.800
 holder 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.640
 now your nail social are very bad 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.620
 you sticky in that so very dirty 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.710
 let your set start doing new is smells 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:48.040
 proceed with the cleanser and I him 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:51.310
 sticky feeling away it 's now you 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.740
 nails done I can now move on him 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.180
 yes , nothing actually pressed 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.910
 stay that way so they are there 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.920
 become very hard and it shows at the beginning 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.270
 also the end of this tutorial i hope 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.000
 that you liked this video 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.560
 I think that's an advantage to this kit 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.540
 it is pretty cheap to it 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.980
 I might try for a total before 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.530
 all products together pluses 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.300
 nail polish about 30 euros what paid 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.640
 not so very much in comparison 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.280
 with other gmail products on the market 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.680
 and disadvantage I think it is very bad 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.090
 it really does take a lot of time 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.140
 I am your about one 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.350
 hour 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.790
 been busy for half an hour so it is 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.740
 quite expensive nevertheless long I am 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.750
 just polish your nails the result 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.700
 I think it is very beautiful but sight 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.290
 close look at your nails it here 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.690
 that it is not really done professionally 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.890
 is' but you know I think it's there anyway 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.210
 to try 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.880
 which is also ideal for the summer and 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.260
 actually stays on for a long time 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.360
 a chinese afternoon debtor here 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.160
 not really busy 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.500
 afghaans i said i am not 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.390
 professional in a place like this 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.050
 I want a girl here 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.060
 on Youtube 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.620
 but if you still have tips for and there 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.300
 girls or for myself 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.280
 certainly let them have new relationships 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.970
