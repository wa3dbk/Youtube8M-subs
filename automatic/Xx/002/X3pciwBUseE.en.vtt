menu buttons right here led LED display

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.540 
menu buttons right here led LED display
right<00:03:01.080> here<00:03:01.140> when<00:03:01.740> you're<00:03:01.860> programming<00:03:02.310> it

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
right here when you're programming it

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.000 
right here when you're programming it
you<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:02.880> see<00:03:03.090> what's<00:03:03.300> going<00:03:03.360> on<00:03:03.780> with<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> LED

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
you can see what's going on with the LED

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.000 
you can see what's going on with the LED
display<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.660> think<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.110> about<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.620> on

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
display and so I think it's about it on

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.360 
display and so I think it's about it on
this<00:03:11.160> assume<00:03:11.550> back<00:03:11.760> out<00:03:11.970> again<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.270> little<00:03:12.510> bit

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
this assume back out again a little bit

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.560 
this assume back out again a little bit
so<00:03:14.370> yeah<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:16.230> records<00:03:16.800> on<00:03:17.490> an<00:03:17.790> SD<00:03:17.970> card

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
so yeah and it it records on an SD card

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.430 
so yeah and it it records on an SD card
it<00:03:19.200> takes<00:03:19.440> up<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.620> 32<00:03:20.070> gigabytes<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.720> runs<00:03:22.320> on

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
it takes up to 32 gigabytes and runs on

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.900 
it takes up to 32 gigabytes and runs on
battery<00:03:22.709> power<00:03:22.739> right<00:03:23.160> now<00:03:23.370> but<00:03:23.610> there's<00:03:23.760> an

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
battery power right now but there's an

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.530 
battery power right now but there's an
external<00:03:24.890> power<00:03:25.890> supply<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.580> can<00:03:26.610> buy<00:03:27.120> to

to 50 feet so yeah

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.760 
to 50 feet so yeah
and<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.910> has<00:04:03.120> variable<00:04:03.510> settings<00:04:04.140> like<00:04:04.260> timers

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
and it has variable settings like timers

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.760 
and it has variable settings like timers
and<00:04:05.340> other<00:04:06.270> settings<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.200> quality<00:04:07.739> of

your video and photos that kind of stuff

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.699 
your video and photos that kind of stuff
so<00:04:10.640> it<00:04:11.640> runs<00:04:11.760> on<00:04:11.940> eight<00:04:12.360> double-a<00:04:13.110> batteries

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
so it runs on eight double-a batteries

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.039 
so it runs on eight double-a batteries
in<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:13.890> field<00:04:14.160> oh<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.480> forgot<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.900> show<00:04:16.019> you

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
in the field oh and I forgot to show you

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.360 
in the field oh and I forgot to show you
all<00:04:16.230> this<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.590> box<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:16.859> comes<00:04:17.040> in<00:04:17.250> right

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
all this is the box that comes in right

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.310 
all this is the box that comes in right
here<00:04:17.720> trace<00:04:18.720> premise<00:04:19.549> yeah<00:04:20.960> it<00:04:21.960> I<00:04:22.049> could<00:04:22.200> go

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
here trace premise yeah it I could go

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.440 
here trace premise yeah it I could go
over<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.560> specs<00:04:22.740> with<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.160> real<00:04:23.340> quick

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
over the specs with it real quick

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.050 
over the specs with it real quick
alright<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.770> average<00:04:25.980> detection<00:04:26.820> rate

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
alright so the average detection rate

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.780 
alright so the average detection rate
the<00:04:27.810> distance<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:28.410> that<00:04:28.560> it's<00:04:28.680> Texas<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.370> forty

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
the distance so that it's Texas is forty

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.170 
the distance so that it's Texas is forty
feet<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.750> it's<00:04:31.110> not<00:04:31.260> a<00:04:31.320> long<00:04:32.280> range<00:04:32.670> type<00:04:33.030> of

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
feet so it's not a long range type of

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.310 
feet so it's not a long range type of
detection<00:04:33.510> camera<00:04:33.960> but<00:04:34.200> forty<00:04:34.830> feets<00:04:35.010> not<00:04:35.190> bad

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
detection camera but forty feets not bad

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.640 
detection camera but forty feets not bad
the<00:04:37.320> flash<00:04:37.590> distance<00:04:38.130> on<00:04:38.310> this<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.670> fifty<00:04:39.030> feet

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
the flash distance on this is fifty feet

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.230 
the flash distance on this is fifty feet
it<00:04:40.650> takes<00:04:40.770> about<00:04:40.980> sixteen<00:04:41.580> thousand<00:04:42.030> images

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
it takes about sixteen thousand images

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.560 
it takes about sixteen thousand images
on<00:04:42.660> an<00:04:42.840> average<00:04:42.960> battery<00:04:44.330> supply<00:04:46.400> takes<00:04:47.570> low

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
on an average battery supply takes low
