00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.529
 casually 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.420
 alexander aja has simply become 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.160
 the most successful French director 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.080
 prolific america 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.670
 we are here in vancouver there is everything 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.800
 just a few weeks on the set 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.960
 of sundance life of louise drax 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.960
 literally the ninth life of louis 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.779
 drax the fifth American film of 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.910
 the friend alexandre in less than 12 years aja 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.570
 has become one of the predominant authors 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.690
 of world fantasy cinema that has 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.390
 started when you know twelve years ago 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.150
 now we have turned to tensions in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.519
 2002 it was at one time there was no 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.640
 great thing in France in terms of movies 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.680
 of kind there was a desire for greg 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.800
 levasseur and I when we wrote our 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.050
 intention to pay tribute to the cinema 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.879
 American horror of the 70s that 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.250
 we had marked who had sucked us 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.199
 it was also a desire to answer the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.059
 frustration that we had as 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.790
 viewer more see movie that was doing 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.040
 really scared in sand 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.170
 and it turns out we were not the only ones 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.030
 so there were quite a few directors 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.370
 precisely who had the same frustration 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.370
 who wanted to go back to facts 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.610
 that are really scary and it happened 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.380
 and it's true that a decade ago 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.170
 like that pretty amazing movies 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.130
 of horror me precisely in the middle of that 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.900
 I love genre cinema I like it 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.090
 horror cinema I like the cinema of 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.140
 suspense I like to put myself with 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.390
 characters facing situations 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.460
 extremes I like to find those stories there 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.320
 and I'm always looking 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.610
 I am always looking for the story that will me 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.340
 allow to do something 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.690
 different 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.670
 this story is that of louis 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.500
 drax and there one has the impression that the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.850
 age cinema has evolved that he is trying 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.490
 to move on 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.200
 witness this scene a tarantinesque hair 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.390
 and that he was turning that day into a 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.390
 disused hospital of vancouver 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.239
 well pulp stuff is there but it's 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.010
 fantastic in the water idrac this a 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.670
 question that we of course asked at 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.760
 director 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.799
 it's a movie that wander the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.079
 ninth he will want to wander to the 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.730
 limit of the kind have never entered 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.560
 the genre is really a mystery 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.739
 it's a lot more an investigation 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.430
 police officer and it's all told by 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.139
 a rather unique child enough original 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.919
 very intelligent who has the particularity 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:07.169
 to describe yourself as the accident meeting 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.760
 playboy who could be so child 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.439
 to whom all the accidents happen 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.200
 the movie starts with him falling 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.569
 from a cliff to san francisco that falls 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.840
 in the ocean and falls into a coma and 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.479
 so that's a little bit the idea of ​​this 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.520
 ninth life or to the king that he's dead and 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:26.730
 all of a sudden he will come back 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.890
 on the surface while being in common and 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.380
 the whole story of the movie is going to be from 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.560
 understand how and why it is 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.560
 falls 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.760
 louis drax is a film at the limit 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.370
 of many genres but when filmed 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.320
 the kid's resurrection scene not 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.580
 of doubt we are there in full fantastic 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.580
 obviously assume 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.849
 the scenario is adapted from a bestseller 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.530
 by max minghella his father anthony 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.069
 had to realize it before dying 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.019
 suddenly 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.489
 this is Alexandre who cares 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.470
 today after cracking for 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.260
 this story but for once not the 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.820
 everything because it scares me I was 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:29.030
 ordered to absorb and passionate about 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.040
 the story of this little boy so much 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.270
 particular and unique and his vision of 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.090
 world of adults who were 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.800
 extremely poignant obviously too 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.810
 I did not expect to be upset at 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.560
 this point because it is a cetain 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.440
 it's a mystery a thriller it's also 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.419
 a love story but that's 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.090
 fantastic elements because of the domain 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.050
 of the dream of the subconscious and the world of 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.229
 common 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.940
 but there are trout emotional at the 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:06.660
 end who who I think is really it's 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.840
 a great strength that was for me that 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.940
 unexpected world today aja is 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.400
 in full post production of the nine 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.110
 lives of law is grax the film should 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.580
 be ready in the month of May more than 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.479
 a few weeks so to wait 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.479
 unexpected
