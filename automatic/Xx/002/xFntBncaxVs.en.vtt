00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
thing is the animation settings you're

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.950 
thing is the animation settings you're
gonna<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> uncheck<00:01:23.250> everything<00:01:24.060> here

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
gonna want to uncheck everything here

and you're going to want to leave check

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.080 
and you're going to want to leave check
or<00:01:28.920> check<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.970> dynamic<00:01:30.659> rate<00:01:30.900> compiler<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
or check it's dynamic rate compiler and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.149 
or check it's dynamic rate compiler and
right<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.659> mine<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> hundred<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
right here I have mine at a hundred and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.300 
right here I have mine at a hundred and
as<00:01:35.790> it'll<00:01:36.180> say<00:01:36.360> right<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.049> hundred<00:01:37.920> equals

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
as it'll say right here a hundred equals

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.260 
as it'll say right here a hundred equals
the<00:01:38.460> fastest<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> best

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the fastest and a one is the best

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.950 
the fastest and a one is the best
graphics<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.369> should<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:45.149> default<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
graphics so it should be default on a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.569 
graphics so it should be default on a
hundred<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.040> leave<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.399> there

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
hundred so you can just leave it there

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.080 
hundred so you can just leave it there
and<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.810> ours<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.939> next<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:53.090> really

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and it's ours so the next one is really

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.270 
and it's ours so the next one is really
nothing<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.600> 3d<00:01:54.869> settings<00:01:57.170> but<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:58.619> go

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
nothing in 3d settings but if you do go

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
nothing in 3d settings but if you do go
here<00:01:59.610> you're<00:02:00.030> gonna<00:02:00.149> want<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.509> change<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
here you're gonna want to change it to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.630

whatever<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:02.060> too<00:02:03.060> soft<00:02:03.829> rasterizer

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
whatever is too soft rasterizer

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.219 
whatever is too soft rasterizer
are<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.300> soft<00:02:06.720> rasterizer<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:09.020> we<00:02:10.020> want

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
are you a soft rasterizer and we want

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.390 
are you a soft rasterizer and we want
uncheck<00:02:10.710> all<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.070> this<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.780> then<00:02:12.900> it's<00:02:13.050> just
