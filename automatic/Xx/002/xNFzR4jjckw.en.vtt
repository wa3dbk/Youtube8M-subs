00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.580
 because a woman does not respond to 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.730
 phone 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.410
 the importance of the report can happen that 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.929
 after meeting a woman and having 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.810
 spoken for a while we exchange numbers but 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.369
 when we call her then she doesn't answer 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.470
 maybe she is busy at the time of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 call and obviously in that case yes 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.160
 will have to wait to try again 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.000
 later but even if not later 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.050
 responds 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.019
 it means that most likely 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.300
 we were wrong about something 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.370
 yes and it's a real shame when it happens 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.079
 because you impressed a woman 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 the yard is you exchanged numbers 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.440
 and after all this she does not respond to 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.260
 phone 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.239
 what may have happened there are two 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.309
 main reasons why a woman does not 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.180
 answers the telephone for reasons that 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.860
 depend on us 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.829
 if instead for example he lost the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.260
 cell phone is there we can not help it 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.030
 the first reason is not having created 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.010
 enough attraction 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.559
 in this case, in fact, you have no reason to 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.539
 you don't like answering enough 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.369
 in this case the error was that 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.950
 to have passed too early to 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.990
 Reporting phase is not having created the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.420
 traction is enough to switch to 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.430
 reporting phase as we explain in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.619
 other videos the attraction phase is the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.380
 moment in which it creates attraction 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.780
 in a woman the reporting phase that follows 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.180
 it is the phase in which you know it the most 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.850
 in depth and let you know everything 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.890
 this indeed creates connection but for 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.930
 reporting is necessary 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.909
 enough to pull otherwise her 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.990
 will not answer you on the phone like 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.610
 understand these things 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.470
 how to understand when she is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.210
 sufficiently to treat we have 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.009
 prepared a video with the signals of 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.170
 interest that a woman can send you 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.840
 signs that it is attracted 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.530
 find the link below the video in the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.689
 information 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.119
 let's see now the second reason why 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.890
 a woman does not answer the phone 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.470
 another reason that is often what 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.299
 it makes you suffer more and the lack of relationship 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.790
 that is the fact of not having created a 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:05.939
 sufficiently report the report or report 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.459
 how important and often forgotten 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.179
 I refer to the phase in which after having 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.519
 created attraction in a woman 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.560
 let's get to know it really by creating 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.269
 then a deep connection the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.280
 tendency of those who start to improve 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.439
 his seductive abilities and that of 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.629
 be so focused on the phase of 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.180
 attraction to forget the phase of 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.129
 report and I can understand that at the beginning 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.099
 can piss off because they are there 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.230
 past you too you say but how it was 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.120
 treats gave me many signs of 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.659
 interest because it doesn't respond to mine 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.540
 calls 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.489
 the answer is because the traction drops 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.950
 quickly if it is not supported by 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.959
 secret traction report 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.310
 the next day you will be just one type 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.799
 who knew how to do it 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.480
 if instead it creates both attraction and report 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.669
 you become a person you like 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.220
 it really is deeply and you 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:56.319
 will certainly answer in other words the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.569
 traction serves to please her that is for 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.450
 identify you as a possible partner 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.489
 sexual instead the report serves as 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.989
 identify you as a person with whom 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.780
 can't wait to get out 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.239
 so remember traction is needed 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.639
 but the attraction without relations will bring 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.260
 inevitably to call it without 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.819
 receive reply 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.579
 on the other hand be careful because the 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.220
 report without attraction takes you straight 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.379
 in the friendship area, last thing you can do 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.199
 a perfect traction a relationship 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.540
 equally perfect to talk to 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:31.959
 a girl how to play it well 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.609
 but you can still not answer i 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.530
 reasons can be many 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.900
 we don't know what's going on in the 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.889
 life of a person maybe dead on 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.139
 canary 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.449
 maybe she's back with the ex maybe 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.159
 met another or maybe he was already 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.810
 girlfriend and told us nothing but 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.090
 then she regretted having quoted the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.099
 number and don't answer you can't 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.870
 check everything that happens but 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.519
 you can do your best if you do 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.829
