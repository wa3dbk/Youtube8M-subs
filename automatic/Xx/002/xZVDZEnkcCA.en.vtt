00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
almost a pound but in my opinion it is

about pedigree at all and for that very

about pedigree at all and for that very

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
same reason it turns out to be a great

ultimate<00:04:24.030> knife<00:04:24.270> is<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.690> knife

ultimate knife is a knife

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.190 
ultimate knife is a knife
a for<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.220> masses<00:04:26.639> not<00:04:27.120> for<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.540> militia<00:04:27.870> and

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
a for the masses not for the militia and

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.890 
a for the masses not for the militia and
definitely<00:04:28.800> not<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:29.669> being<00:04:29.970> taken<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.720> the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
definitely not for being taken to the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.409 
definitely not for being taken to the
limit<00:04:31.260> in<00:04:31.500> my<00:04:31.710> opinion<00:04:31.950> it<00:04:32.340> is<00:04:32.430> perfect<00:04:33.030> for

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
limit in my opinion it is perfect for

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.480 
limit in my opinion it is perfect for
somebody<00:04:33.840> who<00:04:34.110> keeps<00:04:34.290> it<00:04:34.530> in<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.710> case<00:04:34.950> of<00:04:35.190> an

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
somebody who keeps it in the case of an

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.700 
somebody who keeps it in the case of an
eventual<00:04:36.060> re-offer<00:04:36.480> use<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.200> country

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
eventual re-offer use it on a country

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.340 
eventual re-offer use it on a country
house<00:04:37.889> maybe<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.669> hike<00:04:38.940> but<00:04:39.240> above<00:04:39.600> all<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:40.110> I

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
house maybe a hike but above all this I

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.860 
house maybe a hike but above all this I
think<00:04:40.440> is<00:04:41.040> designed<00:04:41.550> for<00:04:41.639> the<00:04:41.940> Boy<00:04:42.150> Scout<00:04:42.630> in

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
think is designed for the Boy Scout in

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.409 
think is designed for the Boy Scout in
mind<00:04:43.139> my<00:04:43.590> advice<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.040> if<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:44.910> take<00:04:45.150> things

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
mind my advice is if you take things

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.210 
mind my advice is if you take things
more<00:04:45.630> seriously<00:04:45.810> you<00:04:46.650> might<00:04:46.860> want<00:04:47.070> to

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
more seriously you might want to

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.640 
more seriously you might want to
consider<00:04:47.610> other<00:04:47.910> options<00:04:48.090> but<00:04:48.990> for<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.440> most

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
consider other options but for the most

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.920 
consider other options but for the most
other<00:04:49.950> people<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:50.730> could<00:04:50.970> be<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.510> way<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.720> go

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
other people this could be the way to go

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.260 
other people this could be the way to go
for<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.740> do-it-all<00:04:53.190> survival<00:04:53.820> knife<00:04:54.260> thanks
