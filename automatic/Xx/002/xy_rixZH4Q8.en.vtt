different<00:02:08.369> from<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:08.940> you're<00:02:09.179> doing

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
different from you because you're doing

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.479 
different from you because you're doing
things<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.959> would<00:02:10.140> never<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.920> and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
things that you would never do and and

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.860 
things that you would never do and and
just<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:12.860> judging<00:02:13.860> it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
just not judging it

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:26.000 
just not judging it
I<00:02:22.159> think<00:02:23.159> that<00:02:23.400> these<00:02:24.330> characters<00:02:25.049> all<00:02:25.500> sort

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.369 
I think that these characters all sort
of<00:02:26.069> exists<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.849> their<00:02:27.420> own<00:02:27.599> world<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.200> think

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379

that<00:02:28.470> Ella<00:02:28.650> especially<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.879> sort<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:31.819> when<00:02:32.819> I

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
that Ella especially is sort of when I

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.600 
that Ella especially is sort of when I
read<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.329> scripts<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:34.290> was<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:35.190> nothing<00:02:35.340> I'd

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
rolling in the dirt and it's true we

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.230 
rolling in the dirt and it's true we
were<00:04:20.709> just<00:04:21.280> out<00:04:21.400> in<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.609> middle<00:04:21.729> of<00:04:21.850> nowhere

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
were just out in the middle of nowhere

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.629 
were just out in the middle of nowhere
like<00:04:23.610> having<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.669> time<00:04:24.850> of<00:04:24.880> our<00:04:25.060> lives<00:04:25.210> I

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
like having the time of our lives I

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.080 
like having the time of our lives I
think<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:28.150> major<00:04:28.810> difference<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:30.160> me<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.729> is

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
think a major difference to me is is is

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.950 
think a major difference to me is is is
just<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.479> preparation<00:04:32.080> time<00:04:32.290> on<00:04:32.760> TV<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:34.840> know

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
just the preparation time on TV you know

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.930 
just the preparation time on TV you know
especially<00:04:35.350> on<00:04:35.620> community<00:04:36.010> its<00:04:36.580> comedy

especially on community its comedy

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.219 
especially on community its comedy

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.230 
what's going on but you got to be ready
to<00:04:50.350> just<00:04:50.500> kind<00:04:50.680> of<00:04:50.710> like<00:04:50.890> crime<00:04:51.130> roll<00:04:51.940> with<00:04:52.120> the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
to just kind of like crime roll with the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.810 
to just kind of like crime roll with the
punches<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.410> in<00:04:54.010> film<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.550> especially

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
punches and and in film and especially

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.460 
punches and and in film and especially
with<00:04:55.030> this<00:04:55.120> movie<00:04:55.390> I<00:04:55.419> think<00:04:55.630> we<00:04:55.720> had<00:04:55.930> the

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
with this movie I think we had the

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.900 
with this movie I think we had the
material<00:04:56.890> ahead<00:04:57.130> of<00:04:57.220> time<00:04:57.400> we<00:04:57.610> could<00:04:57.760> really

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
material ahead of time we could really

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.550 
material ahead of time we could really
kind<00:04:58.210> of<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:58.900> was<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:59.050> good<00:04:59.140> thing<00:04:59.200> because

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
kind of and it was a good thing because

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.300 
kind of and it was a good thing because
these<00:04:59.740> characters<00:05:00.190> are<00:05:00.340> so<00:05:02.310> intricately

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
these characters are so intricately

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.520 
these characters are so intricately
bizarre<00:05:04.710> that<00:05:05.710> it<00:05:05.860> was<00:05:05.979> this<00:05:06.760> sort<00:05:07.000> of

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
bizarre that it was this sort of

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.150 
bizarre that it was this sort of
framework<00:05:08.530> that<00:05:08.830> we<00:05:09.789> had<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.090> find<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:10.570> build

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
framework that we had to find and build

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.070 
framework that we had to find and build
so<00:05:12.160> anyway<00:05:12.490> we<00:05:12.669> went<00:05:12.789> into<00:05:12.970> it<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.660> Saudi<00:05:13.900> way

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
so anyway we went into it the Saudi way

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.260 
so anyway we went into it the Saudi way
we<00:05:14.229> went<00:05:14.380> into<00:05:14.470> it<00:05:14.620> I<00:05:14.680> think<00:05:14.820> sort<00:05:15.820> of<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:16.030> you

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
we went into it I think sort of you you

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.900 
we went into it I think sort of you you
have<00:05:16.510> more<00:05:16.750> time<00:05:16.960> that<00:05:17.229> character<00:05:18.039> is<00:05:18.550> always

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
have more time that character is always

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.430 
have more time that character is always
going<00:05:19.030> to<00:05:19.120> be<00:05:19.180> that<00:05:19.360> character<00:05:19.690> like<00:05:20.320> the

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
going to be that character like the

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.320 
going to be that character like the
pages<00:05:20.800> are<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.010> same<00:05:21.220> materials<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.150> same

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
pages are the same materials the same

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.909 
pages are the same materials the same
and<00:05:22.539> you're<00:05:22.630> just<00:05:22.720> like<00:05:22.870> finding<00:05:23.740> new<00:05:23.890> things

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
and you're just like finding new things

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.480 
and you're just like finding new things
within<00:05:24.460> it<00:05:24.700> on<00:05:25.200> TV<00:05:26.200> you're<00:05:27.039> learning<00:05:27.370> new

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
within it on TV you're learning new

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.770 
within it on TV you're learning new
things<00:05:27.520> about<00:05:27.760> your<00:05:28.000> character<00:05:28.360> all<00:05:28.479> the<00:05:28.600> time

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
things about your character all the time

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.360 
things about your character all the time
that<00:05:29.110> you've<00:05:29.229> never<00:05:29.380> been<00:05:29.530> playing<00:05:29.919> or<00:05:30.160> even

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
that you've never been playing or even

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.860 
that you've never been playing or even
thought<00:05:30.520> about<00:05:30.550> before<00:05:30.910> but<00:05:31.450> you<00:05:31.570> do<00:05:31.690> have<00:05:31.780> to

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
thought about before but you do have to

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.180 
thought about before but you do have to
kind<00:05:32.050> of<00:05:32.080> stay<00:05:32.229> within<00:05:32.380> a<00:05:32.500> framework<00:05:32.770> though

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
kind of stay within a framework though

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.620 
kind of stay within a framework though
because<00:05:33.400> I<00:05:33.550> character<00:05:33.910> there's<00:05:34.330> almost<00:05:34.479> an

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
because I character there's almost an

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.420 
because I character there's almost an
expectation<00:05:34.960> for<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:35.560> character<00:05:36.039> especially

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
expectation for a character especially

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.830 
expectation for a character especially
over<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:36.850> course<00:05:37.090> of<00:05:37.210> once<00:05:37.390> I<00:05:37.479> character<00:05:37.750> has

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
over the course of once I character has

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.120 
over the course of once I character has
been<00:05:37.930> established<00:05:38.410> right<00:05:38.620> you<00:05:38.770> know<00:05:38.860> isn't

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
been established right you know isn't

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.469 
been established right you know isn't
there<00:05:39.250> kind<00:05:39.430> of<00:05:39.490> a<00:05:39.580> thing<00:05:39.700> that's<00:05:40.180> true<00:05:40.450> I

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
there kind of a thing that's true I

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.390 
there kind of a thing that's true I
you're<00:05:40.960> right<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.260> I<00:05:41.320> think<00:05:41.350> that<00:05:41.650> there<00:05:42.160> is

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
you're right and I think that there is

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.700 
you're right and I think that there is
almost<00:05:42.729> maybe<00:05:43.000> a<00:05:43.090> little<00:05:43.210> more<00:05:43.360> freedom<00:05:43.720> in<00:05:44.139> a

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
almost maybe a little more freedom in a

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.910 
almost maybe a little more freedom in a
movie<00:05:44.919> like<00:05:45.039> this<00:05:45.250> to<00:05:45.550> really<00:05:45.580> kind<00:05:46.120> of<00:05:46.560> it

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
movie like this to really kind of it

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.770 
movie like this to really kind of it
or<00:05:48.070> because<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:49.030> don't<00:05:49.180> have<00:05:49.270> right<00:05:49.570> there's

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
or because you don't have right there's

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.150 
or because you don't have right there's
zero<00:05:49.990> expectations<00:05:50.710> for<00:05:50.860> this<00:05:50.980> character

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
zero expectations for this character

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.650 
zero expectations for this character
people<00:05:51.640> are<00:05:51.700> not<00:05:51.850> going<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.090> meet<00:05:52.210> them<00:05:52.360> until

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
people are not going to meet them until

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.690 
people are not going to meet them until
they<00:05:53.080> see<00:05:53.140> the<00:05:53.440> movie<00:05:53.680> and<00:05:53.830> then<00:05:53.950> so<00:05:54.280> once<00:05:54.490> a

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
they see the movie and then so once a

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.750 
they see the movie and then so once a
one-time<00:05:55.090> deal<00:05:55.120> so<00:05:55.870> yeah<00:05:56.050> I<00:05:56.080> think<00:05:56.430> on<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:57.490> TV

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
one-time deal so yeah I think on a TV
