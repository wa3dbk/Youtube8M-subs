00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.499 
security and privacy I'm gonna go into
the<00:01:26.040> general<00:01:26.340> tab<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.150> mines

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the general tab and as you can see mines

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.730 
the general tab and as you can see mines
locked<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> moment<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> unlock

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
locked at the moment so I have to unlock

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.530 
locked at the moment so I have to unlock
it<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.310> now<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.640> change<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.150> say<00:01:30.270> allow

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
it and now I can change it to say allow

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.690

apps downloaded from anywhere which

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.460 
apps downloaded from anywhere which
should<00:01:32.880> allow<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.479> run<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> apps<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.259> I'm

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
should allow this to run the apps so I'm

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.289 
should allow this to run the apps so I'm
gonna<00:01:34.590> allow<00:01:34.770> from<00:01:35.009> anywhere<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:36.030> gonna<00:01:36.210> go

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
gonna allow from anywhere I'm gonna go

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.590 
gonna allow from anywhere I'm gonna go

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
software loads if this is the first time

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.539 
software loads if this is the first time
it<00:01:58.049> could<00:01:58.170> take<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> 10<00:01:58.890> minutes<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.280> finish

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
it could take up to 10 minutes to finish

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.310 
it could take up to 10 minutes to finish
the<00:01:59.670> installation<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.840> may<00:02:00.990> go<00:02:01.110> ahead<00:02:01.229> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the installation so we may go ahead and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.289 
the installation so we may go ahead and
speed<00:02:01.560> through<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.100> alright<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:02.909> there<00:02:03.180> we

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
speed through this alright and there we

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.940 
speed through this alright and there we
go<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.719> says<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.259> ready<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.530> run<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.829> for

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
go it says that it's ready to run it for

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.260 
go it says that it's ready to run it for
the<00:02:04.979> first<00:02:05.189> time<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.729> did<00:02:05.880> go<00:02:05.969> ahead<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.119> pull

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the first time it did go ahead and pull

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.940 
the first time it did go ahead and pull
up<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.479> M<00:02:06.600> 3d<00:02:06.869> print<00:02:07.140> spooler<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:07.860> in

up the M 3d print spooler and then in

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.499 
up the M 3d print spooler and then in
the<00:02:08.039> background<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.459> see<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.000> software<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.420> now

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the background I see the software is now

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.910 
the background I see the software is now
running<00:02:09.720> looks<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.470> you're<00:02:10.619> using<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.890> for

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
running looks like you're using it for

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.290 
running looks like you're using it for
the<00:02:11.069> first<00:02:11.220> time<00:02:11.370> make<00:02:11.610> sure<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.879> remove<00:02:12.150> your

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
the first time make sure you remove your

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.850 
the first time make sure you remove your
gantry<00:02:12.660> protectors<00:02:13.140> I've<00:02:13.379> been<00:02:13.560> using

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
gantry protectors I've been using

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.960 
gantry protectors I've been using
pretty<00:02:14.040> for<00:02:14.190> quite<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> while<00:02:14.520> now<00:02:14.580> those<00:02:14.880> have

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
pretty for quite a while now those have

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.490 
pretty for quite a while now those have
been<00:02:15.120> long<00:02:15.300> gone<00:02:15.330> for<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> while<00:02:16.020> there's<00:02:16.380> no

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
been long gone for a while there's no

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.140 
been long gone for a while there's no
models<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.980> display<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.640> doesn't<00:02:17.880> show<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
models to display it doesn't show the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.980 
models to display it doesn't show the
printer<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.600> it's<00:02:18.750> not<00:02:18.870> actually

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
printer because it's not actually

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.780 
printer because it's not actually
plugged<00:02:19.380> in<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.190> should<00:02:20.430> be<00:02:20.550> about<00:02:20.730> it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
plugged in but that should be about it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.370 
plugged in but that should be about it
so<00:02:21.300> let's<00:02:21.480> go<00:02:21.600> ahead<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.960> move<00:02:22.050> over<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
so let's go ahead and move over to the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.570 
so let's go ahead and move over to the
printer<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.740> we'll<00:02:23.040> get<00:02:23.160> everything<00:02:23.370> hooked

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
printer and we'll get everything hooked

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.070 
printer and we'll get everything hooked
up<00:02:23.820> all<00:02:24.360> right<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.570> I've<00:02:24.750> gone<00:02:24.840> ahead<00:02:24.900> and

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
up all right so I've gone ahead and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.990 
up all right so I've gone ahead and
moved<00:02:25.290> over<00:02:25.530> next<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> 3d<00:02:26.250> printer<00:02:26.280> let<00:02:26.910> me

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
moved over next to the 3d printer let me

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.310 
moved over next to the 3d printer let me
go<00:02:27.090> ahead<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.240> plug<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.630> animal<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.080> see<00:02:28.170> what

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
go ahead and plug it animal to see what

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.500 
go ahead and plug it animal to see what
happens<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.550> appears<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.210> it's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
happens and it appears that it's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.300 
happens and it appears that it's
actually<00:02:30.900> doing<00:02:31.200> something<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:32.130> been

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
actually doing something it's been

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.740 
actually doing something it's been
sitting<00:02:32.580> here<00:02:32.610> for<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> couple<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.600> minutes

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
looking at the software itself you can't

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.670 
looking at the software itself you can't
tell<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.790> it's<00:02:36.120> doing<00:02:36.420> anything<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:37.440> the

this<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.540> shot<00:03:57.810> it's<00:03:58.049> just<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.350> test<00:03:58.590> one<00:03:58.850> so

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
this a shot it's just a test one so

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.880 
this a shot it's just a test one so
there<00:03:59.970> we<00:04:00.090> go<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:00.570> just<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.350> says<00:04:01.530> it's<00:04:01.739> a

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
there we go it's just it says it's a

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.640 
there we go it's just it says it's a
retract<00:04:02.700> test<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.570> let's<00:04:04.170> just<00:04:04.350> see<00:04:04.440> if<00:04:04.530> this

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
retract test so let's just see if this

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.670 
retract test so let's just see if this
works<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:05.430> print<00:04:05.730> will<00:04:06.420> do<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.660> lo<00:04:06.840> will<00:04:07.380> do<00:04:07.500> it

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
works it print will do it lo will do it

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.610 
works it print will do it lo will do it
I<00:04:07.950> don't<00:04:08.700> know<00:04:08.790> lo<00:04:09.180> fill<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.720> density<00:04:10.170> we're

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
I don't know lo fill this density we're

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.380 
I don't know lo fill this density we're
not<00:04:10.709> gonna<00:04:10.799> need<00:04:10.980> any<00:04:11.130> support<00:04:11.400> material<00:04:11.880> we

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
not gonna need any support material we

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.880 
not gonna need any support material we
probably<00:04:12.600> won't<00:04:12.780> need<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:12.989> raft<00:04:13.230> so<00:04:13.650> I'll<00:04:13.739> turn

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
probably won't need a raft so I'll turn

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.640 
probably won't need a raft so I'll turn
all<00:04:14.070> that<00:04:14.220> off<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.820> we'll<00:04:15.000> just<00:04:15.120> hit<00:04:15.209> print

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
all that off and we'll just hit print

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.560 
all that off and we'll just hit print
says<00:04:16.650> it's<00:04:16.799> gonna<00:04:16.890> take<00:04:17.100> 37<00:04:17.609> minutes<00:04:17.820> let's

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
says it's gonna take 37 minutes let's

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.530 
says it's gonna take 37 minutes let's
start<00:04:18.840> now<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.640> you<00:04:20.640> probably<00:04:20.940> can't<00:04:21.359> hear

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
start now and you probably can't hear

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.480 
start now and you probably can't hear
that<00:04:21.720> but<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.260> printer<00:04:22.590> is<00:04:22.770> moving<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.310> does

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
that but the printer is moving it does

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.610 
that but the printer is moving it does
appear<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.789> be<00:04:23.910> working<00:04:24.300> appropriately<00:04:24.479> so<00:04:25.229> we

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
appear to be working appropriately so we

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.879 
appear to be working appropriately so we
call<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:26.039> success

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
call that a success

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.260 
call that a success
I'll<00:04:26.979> probably<00:04:27.460> get<00:04:27.729> back<00:04:27.849> with<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.120> with

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
I'll probably get back with you with

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.670 
I'll probably get back with you with
some<00:04:28.419> actual<00:04:28.659> video<00:04:28.960> just<00:04:29.199> to<00:04:29.289> show<00:04:29.349> you<00:04:29.469> what

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
some actual video just to show you what

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.850 
some actual video just to show you what
it<00:04:29.770> looks<00:04:29.949> like<00:04:30.219> but<00:04:30.550> for<00:04:30.610> now<00:04:31.180> it's<00:04:31.860> it's

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
it looks like but for now it's it's

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.739 
it looks like but for now it's it's
definitely<00:04:33.370> early<00:04:33.550> in<00:04:33.849> the<00:04:33.939> process<00:04:34.120> I'm<00:04:34.599> not

00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:34.749 
definitely early in the process I'm not

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:35.999 
definitely early in the process I'm not
gonna<00:04:34.900> say<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.319> software<00:04:35.680> is<00:04:35.800> really

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
gonna say that the software is really

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.920 
gonna say that the software is really
good<00:04:36.370> or<00:04:36.580> perfect<00:04:36.759> or<00:04:37.090> anything<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.749> is

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
good or perfect or anything it is

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.050 
good or perfect or anything it is
running<00:04:38.169> in<00:04:38.349> mono<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:38.979> it's<00:04:39.159> not<00:04:39.430> native

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
running in mono so it's not native

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.640 
running in mono so it's not native
software<00:04:40.270> it's<00:04:40.870> running<00:04:41.199> inside<00:04:41.409> of<00:04:41.469> a

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
software it's running inside of a

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.709 
software it's running inside of a
compatibility<00:04:42.129> layer<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.759> sorts<00:04:43.120> but<00:04:43.449> if<00:04:43.599> you

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:43.719 
compatibility layer of sorts but if you

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:45.300 
compatibility layer of sorts but if you
are<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.900> Mac<00:04:44.139> user<00:04:44.379> and<00:04:44.529> you<00:04:44.740> do<00:04:44.919> not<00:04:45.069> have<00:04:45.279> a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
are a Mac user and you do not have a

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.159 
are a Mac user and you do not have a
Windows<00:04:45.580> machine<00:04:45.699> to<00:04:45.999> do<00:04:46.120> this<00:04:46.240> on<00:04:46.449> this<00:04:46.779> might

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
Windows machine to do this on this might

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.869 
Windows machine to do this on this might
be<00:04:47.349> an<00:04:47.439> option<00:04:47.770> for<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:48.009> but<00:04:48.610> that's<00:04:48.759> probably

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
be an option for you but that's probably

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.309 
be an option for you but that's probably
gonna<00:04:49.120> be<00:04:49.210> about<00:04:49.419> all<00:04:49.569> for<00:04:49.749> me<00:04:49.840> for<00:04:49.990> today
