be so and I've noticed just in my

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.260 
be so and I've noticed just in my
general<00:02:42.280> testing<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.880> seems<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> little

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
general testing that it seems a little

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.200 
general testing that it seems a little
slower<00:02:43.510> than<00:02:43.690> modal<00:02:43.960> blur<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:45.430> certainly<00:02:45.760> it's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
slower than modal blur it certainly it's

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.390 
slower than modal blur it certainly it's
certainly<00:02:46.450> slick<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.080> like<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.500> design<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:48.160> like

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
certainly slick I like the design I like

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.030 
certainly slick I like the design I like
the<00:02:48.550> overall<00:02:48.880> visual<00:02:49.330> effects<00:02:49.690> seems<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.890> be

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
the overall visual effects seems to be

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.620 
the overall visual effects seems to be
just<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.400> tiniest<00:02:51.820> bit<00:02:52.030> clunky<00:02:52.210> though<00:02:52.480> in

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
just the tiniest bit clunky though in
