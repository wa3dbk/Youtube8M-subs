come<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.120> well<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.629> thing<00:00:51.809> over<00:00:51.960> here

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
come in here well this thing over here

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.959 
come in here well this thing over here
is<00:00:52.320> probably<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.250> thing<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.460> Garner's<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
is probably the thing that Garner's the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.720 
is probably the thing that Garner's the
most<00:00:54.180> attention<00:00:55.070> this<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> solar<00:00:56.520> hot<00:00:56.670> water

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
most attention this is a solar hot water

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.549 
most attention this is a solar hot water
collector<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.899> called<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.170> heat<00:00:58.350> pipe

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
collector this is called a heat pipe

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
collector this is called a heat pipe
these<00:00:58.770> tubes<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.219> actually<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> vacuum<00:00:59.820> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
these tubes are actually in a vacuum it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.459 
these tubes are actually in a vacuum it
because<00:01:00.420> they're<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> vacuum<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.170> water

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
because they're in a vacuum the water

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.390 
because they're in a vacuum the water
inside<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> boils<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> 80<00:01:03.480> degrees<00:01:04.189> we<00:01:05.189> run

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
inside the boils of 80 degrees we run

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.649 
inside the boils of 80 degrees we run
water<00:01:05.610> through<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.970> header<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
water through that header up there and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.120 
water through that header up there and
pull<00:01:06.960> all<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> heat<00:01:07.380> off<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.560> tubes<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
pull all the heat off the tubes and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.600 
pull all the heat off the tubes and
voila<00:01:08.610> hot<00:01:09.119> water<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:10.220> where<00:01:11.220> he<00:01:11.340> put<00:01:11.580> that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
voila hot water and where he put that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.340 
voila hot water and where he put that
heat<00:01:11.939> well<00:01:12.510> we've<00:01:13.110> put<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.470> heat<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
heat well we've put that heat in a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.679 
heat well we've put that heat in a
storage<00:01:16.350> tank<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.860> might<00:01:17.009> look<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.220> this

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
storage tank that might look like this

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.730 
storage tank that might look like this
this<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> actually<00:01:19.170> an<00:01:19.259> electric<00:01:19.560> water

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
this is actually an electric water

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.020 
this is actually an electric water
heater<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.100> been<00:01:20.220> made<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.580> years<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
heater it's been made for years as a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.249 
heater it's been made for years as a
water<00:01:21.270> heater<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.750> turns<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
water heater but it turns out to be a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.840 
water heater but it turns out to be a
great<00:01:22.439> solar<00:01:22.860> storage<00:01:23.220> tank<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.700> it's

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
great solar storage tank because it's

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
great solar storage tank because it's
all<00:01:23.970> plastic<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.960> warrantied<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.380> life<00:01:25.710> so

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
all plastic it's warrantied for life so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.320 
all plastic it's warrantied for life so
it's<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> last<00:01:26.340> water<00:01:26.610> heater<00:01:26.820> anyone<00:01:27.180> will

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it's the last water heater anyone will

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
it's the last water heater anyone will
ever<00:01:27.420> buy<00:01:27.659> yeah<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.770> better<00:01:28.920> insulated

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
ever buy yeah and it's better insulated

65 watt floodlight under the light
here's<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.590> 65<00:02:16.160> watt<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:16.550> can<00:02:16.700> tell<00:02:16.850> from<00:02:16.940> the

here's a 65 watt we can tell from the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
Gator here great okay doctors turn that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.400 
Gator here great okay doctors turn that
one<00:02:20.180> off<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.600> go<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.990> compact

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
one off and we go to a compact

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.310 
one off and we go to a compact
fluorescent<00:02:21.980> okay<00:02:22.970> now<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:23.690> one's<00:02:23.960> once<00:02:24.200> it

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
fluorescent okay now this one's once it

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.230 
fluorescent okay now this one's once it
warms<00:02:24.440> up<00:02:24.680> will<00:02:24.800> be<00:02:24.890> just<00:02:25.100> as<00:02:25.220> bright<00:02:25.400> mm-hmm

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
warms up will be just as bright mm-hmm

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.060 
warms up will be just as bright mm-hmm
but<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.990> uses<00:02:27.200> one-third<00:02:27.800> as<00:02:27.920> much

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
but it uses one-third as much

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.070 
but it uses one-third as much
electricity<00:02:28.250> actually<00:02:28.880> 12<00:02:29.209> watts<00:02:29.510> well<00:02:29.870> where

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
electricity actually 12 watts well where

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.230 
electricity actually 12 watts well where
the<00:02:30.830> reason<00:02:31.160> for<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.340> yeah<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.209> a

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
the reason for that yeah is that a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.150 
the reason for that yeah is that a
conventional<00:02:32.510> light<00:02:32.900> bulb<00:02:33.170> is<00:02:33.620> ninety

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
conventional light bulb is ninety

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.770 
conventional light bulb is ninety
percent<00:02:34.340> heat<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.910> ten<00:02:35.150> percent<00:02:35.450> light<00:02:35.600> this

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
percent heat and ten percent light this

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.660 
percent heat and ten percent light this
is<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.959> huge<00:02:36.290> amount<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.560> waste<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.100> how<00:02:37.580> it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
is a huge amount of waste and how it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.580 
is a huge amount of waste and how it
makes<00:02:37.880> what<00:02:38.360> these<00:02:38.930> are<00:02:39.080> just<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.260> opposite

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
makes what these are just the opposite

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.590 
makes what these are just the opposite
ninety<00:02:39.860> percent<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.280> ten<00:02:40.490> percent<00:02:40.790> now<00:02:41.450> if

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
ninety percent like ten percent now if

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.979 
ninety percent like ten percent now if
we<00:02:41.720> go<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.320> next<00:02:42.470> generation<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.190> stuff<00:02:43.989> we

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
we go to the next generation of stuff we

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.780 
we go to the next generation of stuff we
go<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.200> LEDs<00:02:46.930> that's<00:02:47.930> 8<00:02:48.140> watts<00:02:48.350> Wow<00:02:49.160> then

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
go to LEDs that's 8 watts Wow then

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.479 
go to LEDs that's 8 watts Wow then
really<00:02:50.180> those<00:02:50.300> are<00:02:50.330> supposed<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.780> last<00:02:51.489> 50,000
