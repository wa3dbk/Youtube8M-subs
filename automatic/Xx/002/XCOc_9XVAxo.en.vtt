the early 1900's because there's no
roadways<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:01.950> get<00:04:02.489> here<00:04:02.910> this<00:04:03.299> is<00:04:03.480> out<00:04:03.630> in<00:04:03.780> the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
roadways to get here this is out in the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.099 
roadways to get here this is out in the
middle<00:04:04.140> of<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.290> pasture<00:04:04.819> but<00:04:05.819> this<00:04:06.000> house<00:04:06.209> was<00:04:06.660> a

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
middle of a pasture but this house was a

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.430 
middle of a pasture but this house was a
very<00:04:07.769> nice<00:04:08.010> place<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:08.549> its<00:04:08.700> time<00:04:09.319> wasn't<00:04:10.319> very

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
very nice place in its time wasn't very

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.979 
very nice place in its time wasn't very
big<00:04:10.739> I'm<00:04:11.010> guesstimating<00:04:11.760> about<00:04:12.030> 20<00:04:12.569> feet<00:04:12.780> by

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
big I'm guesstimating about 20 feet by

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.740 
big I'm guesstimating about 20 feet by
20<00:04:13.410> feet<00:04:13.440> which<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.459> about<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.940> norm<00:04:15.180> for<00:04:15.569> back

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
20 feet which is about the norm for back

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.990 
20 feet which is about the norm for back
then

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
then

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.309 
then
but<00:04:18.000> they<00:04:18.150> survived<00:04:18.739> they<00:04:19.739> survived<00:04:20.400> and

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:21.319 
but they survived they survived and

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:25.820 
but they survived they survived and
perhaps<00:04:22.319> if<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:24.030> economy<00:04:24.539> goes<00:04:24.780> down<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.470> we

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
perhaps if the economy goes down and we

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.710 
perhaps if the economy goes down and we
have<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.190> go<00:04:26.340> back<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.880> dark<00:04:27.120> ages

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
have to go back to the dark ages

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.200 
have to go back to the dark ages
you<00:04:28.349> could<00:04:28.650> come<00:04:28.949> to<00:04:29.099> a<00:04:29.160> place<00:04:29.400> like<00:04:29.580> this<00:04:29.970> and

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
you could come to a place like this and

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.890 
you could come to a place like this and
have<00:04:30.690> a<00:04:30.720> lot<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.319> ready<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.919> build<00:04:32.610> material<00:04:33.389> to

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
have a lot of ready to build material to

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.089 
have a lot of ready to build material to
create<00:04:34.349> your<00:04:34.650> own<00:04:34.680> new<00:04:35.610> home<00:04:36.289> be<00:04:37.289> it<00:04:37.500> small<00:04:37.710> as

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
create your own new home be it small as

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.670 
create your own new home be it small as
it<00:04:38.280> would<00:04:38.490> be<00:04:38.630> but<00:04:39.630> there's<00:04:40.080> all<00:04:40.289> sorts<00:04:40.590> of

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
it would be but there's all sorts of

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.980 
it would be but there's all sorts of
stuff<00:04:40.919> like<00:04:41.220> this<00:04:41.550> out<00:04:41.789> in<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.360> pastures

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
stuff like this out in the pastures

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.650 
stuff like this out in the pastures
that's<00:04:43.590> why<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.800> say<00:04:44.160> you're<00:04:44.849> foolish<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.300> go<00:04:45.599> to

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
that's why I say you're foolish to go to

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.870 
that's why I say you're foolish to go to
the<00:04:45.840> state<00:04:46.139> parks<00:04:46.620> when<00:04:46.919> there<00:04:47.160> are<00:04:47.340> so<00:04:47.639> much

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
the state parks when there are so much

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.480 
the state parks when there are so much
to<00:04:47.940> learn<00:04:48.449> from<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.470> pastures<00:04:50.069> and<00:04:50.370> the
