00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
in 2015 so I think that's part of the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.060 
in 2015 so I think that's part of the
goal<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.929> that's<00:00:13.049> part<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:13.620> makes<00:00:13.830> being

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
goal and that's part of what makes being

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.340

was<00:00:36.930> probably<00:00:37.260> some<00:00:37.500> point<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.829> college<00:00:38.690> when

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
was probably some point in college when

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.150 
was probably some point in college when
I<00:00:39.750> transferred<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> Wisconsin<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.950> was<00:00:41.070> on

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I transferred to Wisconsin and I was on

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.530 
I transferred to Wisconsin and I was on
the<00:00:41.250> scout<00:00:41.489> team<00:00:41.520> there<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.450> up

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the scout team there and I was going up

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.209 
the scout team there and I was going up
against<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> Wisconsin<00:00:43.590> offensive<00:00:44.040> line

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
against the Wisconsin offensive line

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.639 
against the Wisconsin offensive line
which<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.610> fantastic<00:00:45.420> offensive<00:00:46.260> line<00:00:46.410> every

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
which is fantastic offensive line every

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.869 
which is fantastic offensive line every
day<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.039> started<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.579> little<00:00:47.730> bit

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
day and I started to have a little bit

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.279 
day and I started to have a little bit
of<00:00:47.910> success<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.539> think<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.050> really<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
of success I think that was really the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.040 
of success I think that was really the
first<00:00:49.410> time<00:00:49.860> when<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.539> pretty<00:00:51.539> confident

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
first time when I was pretty confident

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.510 
first time when I was pretty confident
that<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.260> would<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> ability<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.219> maybe

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
that I would have the ability to maybe

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.090 
that I would have the ability to maybe
do<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.079> but<00:00:55.079> there's<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.680> many<00:00:55.770> things<00:00:55.890> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
do it but there's so many things that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.500 
do it but there's so many things that
can<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.309> wrong<00:00:56.399> along<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.969> way<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.329> never

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
can go wrong along the way and you never

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.189 
can go wrong along the way and you never
really<00:00:57.719> fully<00:00:58.020> know<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.070> it's<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.239> every

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
really fully know so it's just every

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.599 
really fully know so it's just every
single<00:01:01.500> day<00:01:01.590> working<00:01:01.949> hard<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.250> try<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.460> make

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
single day working hard to try and make

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.200 
single day working hard to try and make
that<00:01:02.789> dream<00:01:02.940> come<00:01:03.000> true<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.850> I've<00:01:09.060> been

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that dream come true then I've been

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.460 
that dream come true then I've been
fortunate<00:01:09.450> enough<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.140> many<00:01:10.290> great

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
fortunate enough to have so many great

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.500 
fortunate enough to have so many great
moments<00:01:10.680> throughout<00:01:11.040> my<00:01:11.220> career<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.850> think<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
moments throughout my career I think the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.719 
moments throughout my career I think the
very<00:01:12.659> first<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.409> NFL<00:01:13.650> career<00:01:14.040> was<00:01:14.400> the

very first one in my NFL career was the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
very first one in my NFL career was the
the<00:01:15.060> pic<00:01:15.270> 6<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> playoffs<00:01:15.780> against<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the pic 6 in the playoffs against the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
the pic 6 in the playoffs against the
Cincinnati<00:01:16.890> Bengals<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.610> such<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> big

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
Cincinnati Bengals that was such a big

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 
Cincinnati Bengals that was such a big
moment<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:19.380> was<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> playoffs<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.250> was

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
moment it was in the playoffs it was

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.580 
moment it was in the playoffs it was
Texans<00:01:21.210> first-ever<00:01:21.600> playoff<00:01:21.810> victory<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.560> I

Texans first-ever playoff victory and I
got<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> chance<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> part<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.729> a
