that we were attacking here and let's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.049 
that we were attacking here and let's
try<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.140> figure<00:00:37.230> out<00:00:37.380> why<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> only<00:00:38.370> got<00:00:38.700> two

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
important to look at attacks where

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.610 
important to look at attacks where
things<00:00:45.360> don't<00:00:45.600> completely<00:00:45.899> go<00:00:46.079> your<00:00:46.289> way<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
things don't completely go your way and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.139

figure out you know what little mistakes
you<00:00:48.300> made<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.660> how<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:49.050> improve<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
you made and how we can improve on that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.840 
you made and how we can improve on that
so<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.960> attack<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:53.219> know<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.610> tell

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
so for this attack you know you can tell

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.790 
so for this attack you know you can tell
all<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> air<00:00:54.539> defenses<00:00:54.899> aren't<00:00:55.199> too<00:00:55.500> deep

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
all the air defenses aren't too deep

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.240 
all the air defenses aren't too deep
inside<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> base<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.530> they<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.800> else<00:00:59.010> they

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
inside the base and they are else they

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.099 
inside the base and they are else they
also<00:00:59.430> aren't<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.120> well<00:01:00.359> upgraded<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
also aren't that well upgraded for a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.880 
also aren't that well upgraded for a
townhall<00:01:01.469> 9

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
townhall 9

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.270 
townhall 9
usually<00:01:02.820> you're<00:01:03.059> gonna<00:01:03.120> find<00:01:03.449> air<00:01:03.629> defenses

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
usually you're gonna find air defenses

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.350 
usually you're gonna find air defenses
you<00:01:05.280> know<00:01:05.369> there<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.670> more<00:01:05.790> upgraded<00:01:06.240> than

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
you know there are more upgraded than

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.750 
you know there are more upgraded than
the<00:01:06.479> 8<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.040> particular<00:01:08.310> base

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the 8 they are with this particular base

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.240 
the 8 they are with this particular base
so<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:10.049> are<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.650> able<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
so we are going to be able to get to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.020 
so we are going to be able to get to
those<00:01:11.400> 2<00:01:11.760> lowly<00:01:12.710> upgraded<00:01:13.710> air<00:01:14.130> defenses<00:01:14.729> over

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
those 2 lowly upgraded air defenses over

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.420 
those 2 lowly upgraded air defenses over
there<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.420> side<00:01:15.780> very<00:01:16.170> quickly<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
there on that side very quickly and the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.740 
there on that side very quickly and the
reason<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:17.790> deploying<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.450> side

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
reason we're deploying on that side

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.370 
reason we're deploying on that side
first<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:20.479> again<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.810> clan<00:01:22.110> castle

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
first is because again the clan castle

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.719 
first is because again the clan castle
is<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.820> range<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.750> where<00:01:25.350> my<00:01:25.500> dragons<00:01:25.950> will

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
is out of range of where my dragons will

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.140 
is out of range of where my dragons will
be<00:01:27.000> until<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.810> Dragons<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:29.100> taken<00:01:29.970> out<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
be until the Dragons have taken out the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.920 
be until the Dragons have taken out the
air<00:01:30.360> defenses<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.790> want<00:01:33.060> remember<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.659> want

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
air defenses so we want remember we want

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.760 
air defenses so we want remember we want
the<00:01:34.200> dragons<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:34.950> distracted<00:01:35.610> by<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.900> clan

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the dragons to be distracted by the clan

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.109 
the dragons to be distracted by the clan
castle<00:01:37.950> troops<00:01:38.100> only<00:01:38.490> once<00:01:38.820> they've<00:01:39.000> already

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
castle troops only once they've already

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
within range of but as it turns out with

within range of but as it turns out with
this<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.570> base<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.439> clan<00:01:47.250> castle

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
this with this base the clan castle

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.899 
this with this base the clan castle
troops<00:01:47.630> were<00:01:48.630> ground<00:01:49.470> only<00:01:49.710> attacking<00:01:50.520> troops

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
troops were ground only attacking troops

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
troops were ground only attacking troops
or<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.899> other<00:01:51.990> words<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.409> wouldn't<00:01:52.740> target

or in other words they wouldn't target
my<00:01:53.220> dragons<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.210> didn't<00:01:54.420> even<00:01:54.540> matter<00:01:54.750> but

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
my dragons so it didn't even matter but

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.350 
my dragons so it didn't even matter but
if<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.250> could<00:01:56.399> if<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> didn't<00:01:56.939> know<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.180> I

if you could if you didn't know this I

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.530 
if you could if you didn't know this I
waited<00:01:57.840> until<00:01:58.490> my<00:01:59.490> dragons<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.939> came<00:02:00.360> in

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
waited until my dragons that came in

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.260 
waited until my dragons that came in
from<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.229> right<00:02:01.409> side<00:02:01.710> were<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.060> pretty

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
from the right side were you know pretty

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.819 
from the right side were you know pretty
much<00:02:03.420> within<00:02:03.780> range<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> clan<00:02:04.619> castle

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
much within range of the clan castle

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.789 
much within range of the clan castle
before<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.270> deployed<00:02:06.840> most<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.290> my<00:02:07.350> dragons<00:02:07.680> on

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
before I deployed most of my dragons on

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.249 
before I deployed most of my dragons on
the<00:02:07.829> left<00:02:08.270> because<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.360> wanted<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> try<00:02:10.140> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the left because I wanted to try and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
the left because I wanted to try and
make<00:02:10.379> sure<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.310> dragons<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.760> left

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
make sure that the dragons on the left

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.710 
make sure that the dragons on the left
wouldn't<00:02:12.239> be<00:02:12.330> distracted<00:02:12.629> by

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
wouldn't be distracted by

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.840 
wouldn't be distracted by
clan<00:02:14.720> castle<00:02:15.050> troops<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:16.040> we<00:02:16.250> actually<00:02:16.400> do<00:02:16.700> end

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
clan castle troops so we actually do end

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.130 
clan castle troops so we actually do end
up<00:02:16.940> taking<00:02:17.300> out<00:02:17.390> all<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.570> air<00:02:17.780> defense<00:02:18.020> is

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
up taking out all the air defense is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.240 
up taking out all the air defense is
fine<00:02:18.380> but<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.430> combination<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:21.070> one<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.160> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
fine but a combination of one of the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.270 
fine but a combination of one of the
dragons<00:02:22.730> getting<00:02:23.000> distracted<00:02:23.360> down<00:02:23.720> below<00:02:24.280> by

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
dragons getting distracted down below by

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.960 
dragons getting distracted down below by
the<00:02:25.340> Town<00:02:25.640> Hall<00:02:25.790> for<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> while<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:27.640> also<00:02:28.640> just

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
the Town Hall for a while and also just

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.320 
the Town Hall for a while and also just
seeking<00:02:29.480> mines<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.490> just<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.670> way<00:02:31.850> all<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
seeking mines and just the way all the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.820 
seeking mines and just the way all the
other<00:02:32.480> structures<00:02:33.020> like<00:02:33.170> archer<00:02:33.470> towers<00:02:33.710> and

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
other structures like archer towers and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.740 
other structures like archer towers and
Tesla's<00:02:34.160> were<00:02:34.250> spread<00:02:34.550> apart<00:02:34.670> all<00:02:35.210> of<00:02:35.600> that

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
Tesla's were spread apart all of that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.020 
Tesla's were spread apart all of that
combined<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.860> just<00:02:37.160> kind<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.490> ended<00:02:37.820> up<00:02:37.880> we

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
combined it just kind of ended up we

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.380 
combined it just kind of ended up we
think<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.870> situation<00:02:39.440> where<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:40.640> weren't

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
think to a situation where we weren't

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.030 
think to a situation where we weren't
able<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.810> come<00:02:42.140> up<00:02:42.200> with<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.650> three<00:02:42.830> star

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
able to come up with the three star

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.930 
able to come up with the three star
victory<00:02:43.900> I'm<00:02:44.900> not<00:02:45.170> sure<00:02:45.500> what<00:02:45.920> much<00:02:46.280> more<00:02:46.910> I

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
victory I'm not sure what much more I

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.510 
victory I'm not sure what much more I
could<00:02:47.150> have<00:02:47.450> done<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.110> situation<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:49.130> get

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
could have done in that situation to get

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.670 
could have done in that situation to get
the<00:02:49.760> three<00:02:50.000> star<00:02:50.270> just<00:02:51.080> because<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
the three star just because of the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.050 
the three star just because of the
placement<00:02:51.920> of<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.280> seeking<00:02:52.610> mines<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.970> all

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
placement of the seeking mines and all

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.510 
placement of the seeking mines and all
the<00:02:53.180> structures<00:02:53.600> there<00:02:54.530> probably<00:02:54.890> was<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.190> way

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
the structures there probably was a way

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.490 
the structures there probably was a way
that<00:02:55.550> make<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.090> happen<00:02:56.480> like<00:02:56.810> if<00:02:56.990> my<00:02:57.140> dragons

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
that make it happen like if my dragons

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.430 
that make it happen like if my dragons
on<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.680> right<00:02:57.920> had<00:02:58.550> gotten<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.750> two<00:03:00.320> air

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
on the right had gotten to the two air

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.230 
on the right had gotten to the two air
defenses<00:03:00.830> on<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.070> right<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.490> little<00:03:02.090> more

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
defenses on the right a little more

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.120 
defenses on the right a little more
quickly<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.780> not<00:03:03.320> been<00:03:03.500> distracted<00:03:03.980> by<00:03:04.070> the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
quickly and not been distracted by the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.920 
quickly and not been distracted by the
high<00:03:04.280> hitpoints<00:03:04.460> storages<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:05.720> would<00:03:05.840> be

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
high hitpoints storages that would be

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.330 
high hitpoints storages that would be
one<00:03:06.080> example<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.590> something<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:06.950> might<00:03:07.160> have

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
one example of something that might have

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.850 
one example of something that might have
that<00:03:07.910> might<00:03:08.120> have<00:03:08.270> made<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.540> difference

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
that might have made the difference

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.500 
that might have made the difference
where<00:03:09.860> if<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:09.980> was<00:03:10.100> employed<00:03:10.340> my<00:03:10.490> dragons<00:03:11.390> on

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
where if I was employed my dragons on

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.550 
where if I was employed my dragons on
the<00:03:11.540> other<00:03:11.720> side<00:03:12.020> a<00:03:12.050> little<00:03:12.230> bit<00:03:12.440> more

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
the other side a little bit more

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.200 
the other side a little bit more
effectively<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:13.610> there<00:03:13.760> are<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.850> few<00:03:14.000> little

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
effectively so there are a few little

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.690 
effectively so there are a few little
little<00:03:15.110> things<00:03:15.410> or<00:03:16.280> if<00:03:16.460> I<00:03:16.550> would<00:03:16.640> have

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
little things or if I would have

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.260 
little things or if I would have
deployed<00:03:17.060> dragons<00:03:17.840> just<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.230> tiny<00:03:18.590> bit

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
deployed dragons just a tiny bit

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.000 
deployed dragons just a tiny bit
differently<00:03:20.270> than<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.570> did<00:03:20.810> like<00:03:21.020> just<00:03:21.230> moving

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
differently than I did like just moving

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.670 
differently than I did like just moving
where<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.850> pressed<00:03:23.570> on<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.959> screen<00:03:24.260> or<00:03:24.470> clicked

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
where I pressed on the screen or clicked

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.430 
where I pressed on the screen or clicked
on<00:03:24.770> the<00:03:24.890> screen<00:03:25.160> just<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.730> slight<00:03:26.060> amount<00:03:26.540> that

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
on the screen just a slight amount that

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.690 
on the screen just a slight amount that
it<00:03:27.620> really<00:03:27.860> could<00:03:28.130> have<00:03:28.160> made<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.580> difference

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
it really could have made the difference

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.250 
it really could have made the difference
there<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:29.980> that's<00:03:31.840> that's<00:03:32.840> what<00:03:33.080> can<00:03:33.230> happen

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
there so that's that's what can happen

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.500 
there so that's that's what can happen
when<00:03:33.830> you're<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:34.130> townhall<00:03:34.610> 7<00:03:34.640> attacking<00:03:35.420> a

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
when you're a townhall 7 attacking a

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.340 
when you're a townhall 7 attacking a
townhall<00:03:35.870> 9<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:37.040> have<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.430> be<00:03:38.080> perfect<00:03:39.080> with

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
townhall 9 you have to be perfect with

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.890 
townhall 9 you have to be perfect with
your<00:03:39.380> deployment<00:03:40.010> if<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:41.030> townhall<00:03:41.360> 9<00:03:41.390> you

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
your deployment if the townhall 9 you

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.020 
your deployment if the townhall 9 you
know<00:03:41.989> is<00:03:42.170> these<00:03:42.410> as<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:43.250> know<00:03:43.340> all<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:43.670> its

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
know is these as you know all of its

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.090 
know is these as you know all of its
structures<00:03:44.420> built<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.140> has<00:03:45.560> them<00:03:45.830> you<00:03:45.980> know

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
structures built and has them you know

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.370 
structures built and has them you know
decently<00:03:46.790> well<00:03:46.940> spaced<00:03:47.300> apart<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.110> all

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
decently well spaced apart and and all

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.370 
decently well spaced apart and and all
that<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.880> know<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.030> have<00:03:50.300> to<00:03:50.480> be<00:03:50.660> perfect<00:03:51.200> if

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
that you know you have to be perfect if

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.210 
that you know you have to be perfect if
you<00:03:51.500> want<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.920> be<00:03:52.070> able<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.690> 3<00:03:53.690> start<00:03:53.989> with<00:03:54.260> only

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
you want to be able to 3 start with only

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.550 
you want to be able to 3 start with only
level<00:03:55.580> 2<00:03:55.670> dragons<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:59.360> attack<00:03:59.630> is<00:04:00.260> pretty

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
level 2 dragons so this attack is pretty
