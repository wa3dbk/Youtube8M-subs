00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:04.280
 One or two days recommended no 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.450
 to know 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.450
 a cousin in a quick review the game to game is his 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.119
 well saints 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:13.149
 a yellow part ended 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:18.439
 little by little bad but good the curious burned 13 welfare a barbarity 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.579
 I do not want to kill anyone I do not know why 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.689
 and to the strength divided program that gave that pomp hiding the second 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.509
 part that played fire 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.380
 it cost us a lot of compensation 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.529
 r 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.100
 I wanted to talk about a little of the games 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.360
 it was not this generation and as what the operation showed 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.410
 could this generation have emerged nothing more than 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.210
 that if all the great majority 60% in his country 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.910
 something quite a quite high percentage 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.200
 and good measures that look bad 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.690
 in fact I see it perfect since 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.690
 the index sum in prison two never play their case 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.080
 in the first generation in which he played from home to which he played his lousy 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.820
 no I'm not taking advantage now 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.189
 to do well 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.420
 I am liking and one wanted to know if your opinion is that there is 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 too many and believes that if you think it's too little 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.970
 it depends too much 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.330
 there should be more games of all kinds low type a pan low types of 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.720
 arzo guadarrama spy mappus type you stay 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.490
 balfour type of tourism monfort type live mao 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.170
 the redheads that do not blame have 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.210
 metal splitter day 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.330
 it's good that I do not see many acceleration to mockus that precisely 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.230
 by wind took all already known efe 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.260
 nothing new nothing hobby the dialogue 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.720
 it's something that we all work for and 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.890
 we do not see progress 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.770
 I advanced the supers 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.170
 They are the only ones but maybe they do not abandon us, they do not seem like something 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 repetitive only one 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.970
 with these clarifications to that nation are mothers who 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.030
 we want a scare and 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.880
 the big events or less four or five will play two cases of measles 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.529
 4 5 in each in each system 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.759
 we would say 1 12 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.739
 12 eye 15 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.889
 depending on how you look 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.119
 and good is something negative for everyone 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:31.609
 we all liked the substitutes and maybe the best that now is now 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.200
 or 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.369
 almost the best 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:37.129
 I think it was fair with what matters most, it exploits for free 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.700
 that they have in the acclaimed online the only thing that people are fixed by a car 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.499
 after a little 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.609
 but those who believe that for quite some 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.299
 is what we see 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.459
 the ultras 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.459
 and that's what you need to see 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.439
 of other action games adventures in a good story from the entity 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.739
 finish 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.719
 it's good that although it did not last long 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.979
 franciso increased a lot of 13 satisfied by its total 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:09.409
 do not worry five others 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.129
 yes I have clear is that the rise of types know perfectly well 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.390
 I packed in Madrid not everyone has as much money as 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.050
 other people and that's why he was next to the two days of Roman power 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.039
 but yes for his father 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.809
 centuries of exploitation happens if you like them 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:30.319
 then he commented that two men safety when questioned in 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.989
 will also urge something of him 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.329
 of history 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.619
 I think maybe the next generation is going to be more if dylan 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.359
 dog again to the ultras but improving something lunar 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.489
 when he deserves it most what is ready and 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.079
 roan 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.419
 it is due for the next generation 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.509
 it hurts me to see it or if she believes 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.749
 since well I like more deep little of history you have juices final type 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:55.799
 fantasy 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.519
 justy publicly 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.519
 the point according to your a different day 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.039
 role-playing fights 3% alcohol 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:10.149
 but good are short are a few bad flights 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:14.119
 and he went back to this good guy 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.099
 who have their loan own 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:22.270
 n eye there are many others terrific indeed 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:24.800
 2 no 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.570
 three of the four games that I am waiting for are events and what is a 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.039
 fact that we can not qualify as 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.370
 half suter 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.520
 duties for motogp after the uncharted masters effects as an example that is 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.849
 nelson documents juste are saved 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.760
 it took us that he did not play good with good stories 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.370
 a video that I have told you 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.370
 but the same operation also little enough 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.090
 the balance of dead another 100 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.520
 Najera who was not at all 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.529
 I think so 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:01.009
 there are many good ones I think in the best players themselves or mouth insults 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.639
 if the best in a top 5 of each console would enter the odd super 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.029
 forever 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.870
 of salary pretty well 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.510
 but well I think there are some that it was not for some call them what they are 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.770
 remain for being of course 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.979
 should be 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.360
 nothing more I want there to be more jujuy history juana sim 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.759
 that is defined as a roll I do not care that it is the result of the results 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:27.349
 ours 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:30.809
 suddenly something decent that no pains are tempted 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:35.189
 the online the Dutch you can not take me profitability to quote by 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:38.219
 how do we add that we do not benefit from having as only people 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.680
 will be thrown and perhaps because they know they can take advantage of many speak 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.099
 the others if we approve it by 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.009
 the three million per day 2 that 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.469
 it's good that he waited well because he recommends the rent at least 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.190
 for what you already did if it is another to buy it 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.080
 from there they sell themselves to a possible attack that when they are in 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.529
 provision 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:01.740
 we want are little 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.740
 but could not sir more 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.729
 Well, that is not prepared for the character just tension like stasi 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.229
 in Syria interested calmly like crazy 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.779
 I think as a final conclusion 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.520
 on coast 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.490
 but maybe more more creative fires are needed better 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.389
 when history and impunity best 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.539
 the people always the same 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.319
 same game system 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:37.339
 that just bores him a hundred that are thrown to innovate a little and even have no 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:38.569
 so afraid 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.800
 the broken hugs next Saturday and leave us your comments 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.759
 the comments efe 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:45.469
 straw last
