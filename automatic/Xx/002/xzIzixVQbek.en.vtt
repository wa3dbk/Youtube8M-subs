 He stressed that the beaches are of use 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.390
 public beaches because of ignorance 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.180
 from the general public all phases 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.310

 after the complaint made by Bambarén 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.649
 through atv plus the club the terraces 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.210
 issued a statement stating that 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.390
 it is false that they seek to convert 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.130
 beaches of that reason in private property 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.420
 much less block some way of 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.979
 Admission to the beaches of Cerro Azul 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.979
 although the recorded images 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.310
 by terraces recognized that it is in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.410
 land acquisition process 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.990
 riparian and in tacit reference 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.300
 bambarén condemned that they look for to damage 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.870
 the image of a club that wants to build 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.310
 a beach seat on private property 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.650

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.310
 strange since you visit on a beach 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.860
 public yesterday there is a diligence that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.620
 people of our association 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.050
 safely or by usurpation of 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.690
 Private property is not funny because 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.070
 we are on a public beach 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.560
 For his part, the mayor of Serra Azul

 indicated that the club the terraces has not 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.860
 started any procedure in the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.950
 municipality to acquire land 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.460
 coastal terraces do not present any 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.410
 document here where they have bought 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.080
