way<00:00:20.580> now<00:00:21.420> I'm<00:00:21.480> going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.660> start<00:00:21.900> by<00:00:21.990> telling

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
way now I'm going to start by telling

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.050 
way now I'm going to start by telling
you<00:00:22.650> about<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.890> product<00:00:23.220> itself<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.820> then<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
you about the product itself and then I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
you about the product itself and then I
will<00:00:24.210> move<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.660> my<00:00:25.350> thoughts<00:00:25.680> about<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.189> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
will move on to my thoughts about it and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.250 
will move on to my thoughts about it and
I<00:00:26.789> will<00:00:26.849> plug<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> little<00:00:27.869> bit<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.109> just

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
I will plug it in a little bit I just

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.990 
I will plug it in a little bit I just
wanted<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.800> go<00:00:29.070> over<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.250> few<00:00:29.400> things<00:00:29.460> before<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
wanted to go over a few things before I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.150 
wanted to go over a few things before I
do<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> first<00:00:31.439> thing<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:32.040> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
do that so the first thing is that it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.670 
do that so the first thing is that it
has<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> 1<00:00:32.790> millisecond<00:00:33.149> response<00:00:33.360> time<00:00:33.899> which

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
has a 1 millisecond response time which

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.290 
has a 1 millisecond response time which
is<00:00:34.829> really<00:00:35.040> fast<00:00:35.340> if<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.760> about<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is really fast if you think about it and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
is really fast if you think about it and
also<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.350> has<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> 7-foot<00:00:38.489> braided<00:00:39.450> fiber<00:00:39.750> cable

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
also it has a 7-foot braided fiber cable

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.900 
also it has a 7-foot braided fiber cable
now<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> good<00:00:41.040> thing<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.250> braided<00:00:41.730> fiber

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
now the good thing about braided fiber

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910 
now the good thing about braided fiber
cables<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:43.020> don't<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.320> stuck<00:00:43.620> to

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
cables is that they don't get stuck to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.850 
cables is that they don't get stuck to
your<00:00:44.250> surface<00:00:44.879> desk<00:00:45.600> or<00:00:45.870> whatever<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.350> table

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
your surface desk or whatever your table

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.450 
your surface desk or whatever your table

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and it doesn't affect you at all like

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.209 
and it doesn't affect you at all like
the<00:00:50.489> rubber<00:00:50.879> or<00:00:51.239> plastic<00:00:51.379> rubber<00:00:52.379> ones<00:00:52.739> how

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the rubber or plastic rubber ones how

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
the rubber or plastic rubber ones how
they<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.510> hot<00:00:54.930> enough<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:55.770> get

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
they if it's hot enough they will get

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.290 
they if it's hot enough they will get
stuck<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> table<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:56.910> you'll<00:00:57.090> just

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
stuck to the table and then you'll just

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.560 
stuck to the table and then you'll just
be<00:00:57.719> moving<00:00:58.559> around<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.969> could<00:01:00.239> affect

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
be moving around and it could affect

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.950

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
this mouse such as the sensitivity now

these side buttons can also be

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.729 
these side buttons can also be
programmed<00:03:17.359> now<00:03:18.359> as<00:03:18.629> I<00:03:18.780> said<00:03:18.840> before<00:03:19.019> all<00:03:19.560> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
software and I think that's really great

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.390

program these buttons but also you have

program these buttons but also you have
the<00:03:28.949> option<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:29.579> program<00:03:29.910> all<00:03:30.060> these<00:03:30.329> are

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
the option to program all these are

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.080 
the option to program all these are
depending<00:03:31.379> on<00:03:31.500> what<00:03:31.769> game<00:03:32.250> or<00:03:32.549> application

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
you are using now one last thing I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
forgot to mention is that it has a 3500

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.240 
forgot to mention is that it has a 3500
DPI<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:39.359> a<00:03:39.569> 3.5<00:03:40.290> g<00:03:40.970> infrared<00:03:41.970> sensor<00:03:42.949> now<00:03:43.949> i'm

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
DPI and a 3.5 g infrared sensor now i'm

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.610 
DPI and a 3.5 g infrared sensor now i'm
going<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.459> hop<00:03:44.579> over<00:03:44.639> into<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.379> Razer<00:03:46.379> synapse

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
going to hop over into the Razer synapse

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.640 
going to hop over into the Razer synapse
software<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.549> show<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.389> that<00:03:48.510> all<00:03:49.410> right<00:03:49.500> now

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
software and show you that all right now

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.800 
software and show you that all right now
I'm<00:03:49.799> at<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.220> software<00:03:50.699> splash<00:03:51.090> screen<00:03:51.540> and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
I'm at the software splash screen and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.449 
I'm at the software splash screen and
one<00:03:52.680> thing<00:03:52.829> i<00:03:52.889> don't<00:03:52.949> like<00:03:53.129> about<00:03:53.220> the

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
one thing i don't like about the

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.460 
one thing i don't like about the
software<00:03:53.819> is<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.150> have<00:03:54.389> to<00:03:54.599> login<00:03:54.900> to

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
software is that you have to login to

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.379 
software is that you have to login to
get<00:03:55.829> into<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.190> which<00:03:56.790> i<00:03:56.879> think<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.090> kind<00:03:57.299> of

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
get into it which i think is kind of

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.059 
get into it which i think is kind of
pointless<00:03:57.540> but<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.079> does<00:03:58.230> sync<00:03:58.590> your<00:03:58.709> settings

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
pointless but it does sync your settings

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.369 
pointless but it does sync your settings
to<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.310> cloud<00:03:59.699> and<00:03:59.940> i<00:04:00.419> still<00:04:00.720> think<00:04:01.169> that's

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
to the cloud and i still think that's

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.770 
to the cloud and i still think that's
kind<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.620> pointless<00:04:01.889> ok<00:04:02.639> now<00:04:02.940> i'm<00:04:03.150> actually<00:04:03.449> in

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
kind of pointless ok now i'm actually in

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.899 
kind of pointless ok now i'm actually in
the<00:04:03.930> software<00:04:04.319> here<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:04.919> you<00:04:05.519> can<00:04:05.639> see

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
the software here and you can see

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.089 
the software here and you can see
there's<00:04:06.180> two<00:04:06.510> main<00:04:07.139> categories<00:04:07.500> there's

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
there's two main categories there's

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.490 
there's two main categories there's
mouse<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.669> macros<00:04:09.209> now<00:04:09.870> i'm<00:04:10.169> going<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.349> start

them say you're playing one game you

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.379 
them say you're playing one game you
have<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:29.530> setting<00:04:30.340> for<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:31.000> can<00:04:31.150> just

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
have a setting for that you can just

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.420 
have a setting for that you can just
change<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:32.470> can<00:04:32.590> save<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:32.949> and<00:04:33.160> then<00:04:33.280> you

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
change you can save that and then you

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.770 
change you can save that and then you
have<00:04:33.610> a<00:04:33.639> setting<00:04:34.090> for<00:04:34.120> another<00:04:34.330> game<00:04:34.479> you<00:04:34.660> can

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
save that as well now let's go into

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.430 
save that as well now let's go into
performance<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:37.449> and<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:37.990> can<00:04:38.080> see<00:04:38.229> you<00:04:38.320> can

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
performance here and you can see you can

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.770 
performance here and you can see you can
change<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.800> sensitivity<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:40.060> acceleration

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
change the sensitivity the acceleration

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.740 
change the sensitivity the acceleration
and<00:04:41.050> also<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.680> can<00:04:41.949> add<00:04:42.190> profiles<00:04:42.820> in<00:04:43.120> here<00:04:43.600> as

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
and also you can add profiles in here as

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.620 
and also you can add profiles in here as
well<00:04:44.050> now<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:44.979> lighting<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:46.030> can<00:04:46.180> also<00:04:46.330> set

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
well now in lighting you can also set

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.870 
well now in lighting you can also set
profiles<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:47.800> can<00:04:47.979> turn<00:04:48.160> off<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.580> scroll

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
profiles and you can turn off the scroll

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.080 
profiles and you can turn off the scroll
wheel<00:04:48.910> and<00:04:49.419> thumb<00:04:50.320> grid<00:04:50.729> and<00:04:51.729> you<00:04:51.850> can<00:04:51.970> also

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
wheel and thumb grid and you can also

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.990 
wheel and thumb grid and you can also
turn<00:04:52.449> off<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.630> logo<00:04:53.320> now<00:04:54.130> those<00:04:54.760> are<00:04:54.790> just

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
turn off the logo now those are just

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.270 
turn off the logo now those are just
different<00:04:55.419> settings<00:04:56.080> for<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.470> lighting<00:04:56.710> here

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
different settings for the lighting here

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.310 
different settings for the lighting here
and<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:58.180> think<00:04:58.360> it's<00:04:58.450> pretty<00:04:58.570> cool<00:04:58.810> that<00:04:58.870> you

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
and I think it's pretty cool that you

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.740 
and I think it's pretty cool that you
can<00:04:59.560> turn<00:04:59.860> off<00:04:59.919> the<00:05:00.190> lights<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.550> everything

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
can turn off the lights and everything

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.690 
can turn off the lights and everything
now<00:05:01.750> let's<00:05:01.900> go<00:05:02.020> over<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.200> macros<00:05:02.650> here<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.130> you

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
now let's go over to macros here and you

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.750 
now let's go over to macros here and you
can<00:05:03.820> set<00:05:04.060> macros<00:05:04.600> for<00:05:04.630> any<00:05:05.410> game<00:05:05.950> you'd<00:05:06.370> like

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
can set macros for any game you'd like

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.240 
can set macros for any game you'd like
which<00:05:07.479> i<00:05:07.600> think<00:05:07.660> is<00:05:07.870> pretty<00:05:08.110> cool<00:05:08.200> and<00:05:08.889> it

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
which i think is pretty cool and it

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.820 
which i think is pretty cool and it
doesn't<00:05:09.490> just<00:05:09.639> work<00:05:09.970> for<00:05:10.180> certain<00:05:10.479> ones<00:05:10.660> so<00:05:11.530> I

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
doesn't just work for certain ones so I

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.680 
doesn't just work for certain ones so I
think<00:05:11.950> that's<00:05:12.220> really<00:05:12.760> cool<00:05:13.090> that<00:05:13.270> you<00:05:13.300> can<00:05:13.510> do

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
think that's really cool that you can do

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.240 
think that's really cool that you can do
that<00:05:13.870> now<00:05:14.260> i'm<00:05:14.320> going<00:05:14.410> to<00:05:14.500> give<00:05:14.620> you<00:05:14.650> my<00:05:14.919> final

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
that now i'm going to give you my final

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.490 
that now i'm going to give you my final
thoughts<00:05:15.639> on<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.120> mouse<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.570> a<00:05:17.350> lot<00:05:17.470> of

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
thoughts on the mouse and a lot of

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.650 
thoughts on the mouse and a lot of
people<00:05:17.590> ask<00:05:17.860> me<00:05:17.979> is<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.310> worth<00:05:18.729> buying<00:05:18.760> a<00:05:19.450> razer

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
people ask me is it worth buying a razer

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.110 
people ask me is it worth buying a razer
mouse<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.440> I<00:05:20.620> actually<00:05:20.740> do<00:05:21.039> think<00:05:21.070> so<00:05:21.550> because

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
mouse and I actually do think so because

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.469 
mouse and I actually do think so because
you<00:05:23.080> don't<00:05:23.289> know<00:05:23.590> how<00:05:23.949> good<00:05:24.550> these<00:05:24.940> mice<00:05:25.210> are

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
you don't know how good these mice are

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.040 
you don't know how good these mice are
until<00:05:26.410> you<00:05:26.800> actually<00:05:27.430> have<00:05:27.820> one<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:28.360> I<00:05:28.630> had<00:05:28.840> an

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
until you actually have one and I had an

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.670 
until you actually have one and I had an
old<00:05:29.260> ps2<00:05:29.740> mouse<00:05:30.100> before<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:31.200> it<00:05:32.200> just<00:05:32.470> I

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
old ps2 mouse before and it just I

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.800 
old ps2 mouse before and it just I
thought<00:05:33.100> it<00:05:33.250> was<00:05:33.340> good<00:05:33.580> but<00:05:34.120> then<00:05:34.300> I<00:05:34.389> got<00:05:34.539> this

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
thought it was good but then I got this

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.020 
thought it was good but then I got this
and<00:05:35.080> this<00:05:35.500> is<00:05:35.680> so<00:05:35.979> much<00:05:36.130> better<00:05:36.340> it's<00:05:36.669> so<00:05:36.880> much

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
and this is so much better it's so much

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.060 
and this is so much better it's so much
easier<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.360> move<00:05:37.630> and<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.350> buttons<00:05:38.710> are<00:05:38.860> so

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
easier to move and the buttons are so

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.969 
easier to move and the buttons are so
much<00:05:39.220> easier<00:05:39.460> to<00:05:39.820> click<00:05:40.600> and<00:05:40.870> I<00:05:41.500> just<00:05:41.710> think

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
much easier to click and I just think

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.370 
much easier to click and I just think
it's<00:05:42.160> great<00:05:42.639> now<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.660> also<00:05:43.780> has<00:05:43.990> these<00:05:44.139> two

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
it's great now it also has these two

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.230 
it's great now it also has these two
buttons<00:05:44.620> that<00:05:44.919> I<00:05:44.950> did<00:05:45.130> not<00:05:45.160> have<00:05:45.430> before<00:05:45.610> and

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
buttons that I did not have before and

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.930 
buttons that I did not have before and
you<00:05:46.990> can<00:05:47.139> program<00:05:47.380> them<00:05:47.680> per<00:05:48.310> application

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
you can program them per application

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.719 
you can program them per application
which<00:05:49.270> i<00:05:49.389> think<00:05:49.450> is<00:05:49.630> really<00:05:49.780> cool<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.400> also<00:05:51.400> on

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
which i think is really cool and also on

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.540 
which i think is really cool and also on
the<00:05:51.880> back<00:05:52.060> you<00:05:52.450> have<00:05:52.479> these<00:05:53.050> feet<00:05:53.500> which<00:05:54.099> they

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
the back you have these feet which they

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.210 
the back you have these feet which they
are<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:54.970> perfect<00:05:55.240> size<00:05:55.740> they<00:05:56.740> don't<00:05:56.950> affect

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
are the perfect size they don't affect

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.400 
are the perfect size they don't affect
anything<00:05:57.849> on<00:05:58.389> the<00:05:58.539> mouse<00:05:58.690> and<00:05:58.720> so<00:05:59.050> you<00:05:59.110> can<00:05:59.289> see

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
anything on the mouse and so you can see

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.650 
anything on the mouse and so you can see
the<00:05:59.530> camera<00:05:59.740> there<00:06:00.030> but<00:06:01.030> they<00:06:01.240> don't<00:06:01.270> really

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
the camera there but they don't really

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.360 
the camera there but they don't really
affect<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:01.990> mouse<00:06:02.169> at<00:06:02.349> all<00:06:02.470> and<00:06:02.710> they're<00:06:03.190> just

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
affect the mouse at all and they're just

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.250 
affect the mouse at all and they're just
the<00:06:03.520> perfect<00:06:04.000> thickness<00:06:04.360> that<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:05.110> moves

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
the perfect thickness that it moves

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.900 
the perfect thickness that it moves
around<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.650> nicely<00:06:06.099> and<00:06:06.280> there's<00:06:06.430> also<00:06:06.580> one

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
around the nicely and there's also one

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.240 
around the nicely and there's also one
