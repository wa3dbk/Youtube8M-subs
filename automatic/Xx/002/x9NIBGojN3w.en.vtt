00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello to all friends a panic greeting e 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.310
 welcome back to this new video yesterday 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.859
 after dealing for the first time 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.050
 the raid at the end of the crust at level 33 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.120
 I'm here today to explain you and 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.490
 show you the loot table of these 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.560
 mode first I make two promises two 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.080
 premisses what is the uute glutei ball not 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.970
 it's nothing but a guide, let's say one 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.910
 caption an agenda to make you understand 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 what and where to drop into the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.430
 raid 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.080
 we know very well that every part of the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.240
 raids to his specific drops e 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.390
 especially these vary according to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.489
 difficulty with which we will play laughs 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.120
 today we will talk specifically about the drop 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.469
 obtainable at level 33 in the raid the end 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.360
 of crotta that came out yesterday for 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.010
 understand the other premise that I have to 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.629
 to make you is that I will speak only of the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.030
 rewards obtainable at the end of each 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.440
 area I will not talk about the baskets then 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.660
 of the rewards obtainable through 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.180
 the boxes because these are in common 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.770
 between both modes of raids 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.420
 so both that normal level and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.050
 that difficult level and why 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.730
 especially dropper only have energy and 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.530
 radiant fragments so we won't go to 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.159
 speak specifically we will talk 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.930
 but specifically of weapons 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.030
 obtainable and above all where to get 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.400
 the specific weapons we start from the first one 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.960
 area or the abyss the forest 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.909
 call it what you want it to be clear 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.860
 the one with the lanterns at the end of 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.280
 this area will be possible to drop 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.290
 lover soul and ict the gun pulse 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.730
 in order to understand each other 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.490
 we say that drop a is quite rare 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.050
 you have a 15 20 percent to get 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.930
 many have obtained this weapon 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.760
 yesterday and it is fairly good I repeat 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.680
 in the first zone that of the lanterns 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.570
 at the end then completing 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.420
 the latter can be obtained 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.510
 we only pass it on to companies 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.670
 to the bridge area and then to the bridge 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.980
 which is quite complicated to 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.070
 end of this area will be possible 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.280
 get both lo towards the udc then 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.290
 impulse gun is the business yount that 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.770
 the automatic rifle is the one with damage 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.210
 in focus the area and then drop will be 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.950
 once obtained having killed the orcs 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.320
 and it will be possible to get these two 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.330
 rewards also here you will have a 15 20 per 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.880
 hundred of possibilities to get these 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.380
 single weapons I have many people lists 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.000
 friends who got the gun 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.270
 I have not yet had this automatic 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.100
 luck so I'll have to wait 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.050
 many of you and many people think that 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.060
 if it is only possible to obtain the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.590
 automatic rifle inside this 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.240
 area is not true because you can get it 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.950
 I also have the impulse rifle 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.989
 mathematical certainty of what I am 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.880
 saying why all I say is 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.680
 taken from planet destiny I leave you the 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.250
 link in description with the whole table 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.870
 of all of all modes and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.720
 difficulty in such a way that it will be able to 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.750
 you can control yourself 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.160
 let's move on to the next or the real area 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.800
 the one where you have to kill here you 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.350
 the debt singer the shirt to understand 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.050
 here the drop is in common between the two 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.660
 difficulty and will not find any weapon 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.700
 then legendary crota primary 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.450
 it will be possible to obtain an exotic weapon 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.000
 or 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.150
 a legendary armor beyond of course 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.310
 both fragments and non-radiant energy 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.660
 we know if this thing was wanted 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.100
 of bungee because many expected 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.930
 that he could drop the rifle 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.790
 reconnaissance in this in this 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.030
 particular area of ​​the raid is not so not 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.250
 too much no legendary weapon then 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.720
 this drop will be in common with 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.010
 normal difficulty so they are made to 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.540
 normal and when I remade it 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.190
 difficult will not give you a second drop 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.410
 will be in common as for the cases for 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.360
 to understand each other let's move on to the part 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.239
 really more difficult and demanding 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.260
 I assure you of all the raids 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.420
 you have to be pretty good for 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.070
 being able to do it fairly 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.770
 many are not easy in Italy 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.360
 those who did do not know of it 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.070
 no one on my friends list 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.750
 if you if any of you did it has 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.090
 had the skill to do it write me 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.880
 below in the comments however we pass to the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.130
 drop which are the world of Croatian or 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.209
 the cannon brought and the friends of here 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:04.290
 youth or the reconnaissance rifle e 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.310
 the crus rota regarding weapons 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.170
 we talk in a little bit a little more 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.120
 specifically, here you have a 15 20 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.549
 Percent chance of drop for 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.220
 As for the world of Croatian I come 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.229
 fir youth for cruz rota which is the 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.750
 exotic material that allows it to 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.790
 enhance your allied appearance 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.989
 to the negro kazma the percentage of 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.360
 possibility of drop lowers 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.310
 drastically in very few have it 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.490
 therefore obtained if you are among the lucky ones 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.260
 in short, you rub your hands because you don't 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.050
 they have us in many is not everything 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.430
 because you can also find Croatian there 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.330
 blue shader v 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.500
 the ship ben of the dark goth and the 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.510
 history el s13 graves rober 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.430
 in short, they are however unique elements 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.660
 is not that going to influence more than 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.270
 so much our gameplay does however 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.640
 however nice to have both art and 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.110
 spaceship that the story of the raid me 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.820

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.310
 especially the most concise possible vi 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.660
 I refer to the planet destiny article 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.820
