00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.240
 what I have done so far I have 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.759
 done very fast and a little bit so 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.229
 that has improved the game is not here 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.520
 You can create a new world and 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.890
 worlds they are saved they put the name 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.500

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.539
 select one can join and they can 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.720
 create a server also to play 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.340
 online as in minecraft the same is created 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.470
 a server and can play online the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.270
 friends to be building and in this 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.740
 I'm not going to do it and I think that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.619
 in the future I will bring you a tutorial 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.020
 how they are made or do not go to many 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.210
 we have here look to start one of 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.909
 the change classes is the zoom now see 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.320
 you can approach the monkey can be 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.900
 super servita can see 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:01.010
 the big sample of the no 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.010
 to see there is displayed wow wow 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.880
 good is one of which does not separate the 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.190
 effect on 3-d looks a lot more bastard it 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.770
 he sees very licit in the cubes of everything very 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.560
 well I like that's one of the most 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.710
 things that they added from this beta version 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.890
 0.3 view 10 in the block completely 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.890
 do not 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.740
 or very well that you already see that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.210
 sing in my carnal as always that 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.450
 I was always screaming when I make a 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.450
 video 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.500
 good that yes you have to go up and good as 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.870
 is a beta version has some 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.010
 clichés of thousands we climb with an elevator 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.709
 a box of balls pierced here 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.180
 let's go up a little more to we are them 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.040
 I'm going to teach something of what you build 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.860
 to build the truth is very little time 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.200
 He has not had so much time to immerse me 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.000
 goes in the game besides that still 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.530
 like in a beta phase it's not all 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.750
 complete there are many things that make you 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.340
 missing but you do see a great improvement 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.500
 the previous version to this and you see that 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.720
 they are changing it there in the phase of 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.739
 programming and I will give you many 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.470
 ideas that you want to put 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.840
 then this is going to be good the game 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.269
 one life nothing surprised me very much 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.180
 what has changed from the previous of 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.040
 previous version to this and they will see that 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.470
 It will be very good in addition to adding 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.389
 a new layer the game look at this layer 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.329
 from here to the bottom that was not her 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.069
 third layer a background added the 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.950
 clouds made it a little more realistic 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.290
 and this is third capon gives you a greater 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.139
 effect nothing because sometimes a little house 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.139
 that I build here we enter and 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.860
 we come to the house my kids we are going to 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.770
 serve here 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.290
 and well here you hear here you can 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.820
 put the jacuzzi 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.310
 at the bottom it says a little garden 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.670
 here as I could add you where 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.980
 follow the stairs when it's over 2002 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.560
 but because she 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.400
 and then comes this picture said 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.400
 well loaded the world 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.630
 look here a little tree told you that the 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.150
 background layer that is this these are the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.220
 three layers that there is right now is this 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.040
 is where the player who is the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.030
 select with the efe key three 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.370
 select the player's layer here 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.160
 come out in the console play to if you tighten 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.290
 key f 2 is passed to the back one which is 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.880
 the objects that are here rotate 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.370
 Right click deletes cyberclick e 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.730
 left puts objects without squeezing the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.190
 f1 key goes to the bottom it 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.110
 press right click is deleted but the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.970
 background that is already set by the map does not 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.220
 they can erase it they press click 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.380
 left is consolidated and 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.700
 always has 3 we go back to the layer where 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.040
 is the monkey and what is 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.260
 in front of the monkey and put things to the 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.090
 height of where the doll is worth 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.930
 that is one of the new things that 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.640
 they added 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.220
 this makes the game a lot 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.220
 more chunky much more real and gives you a 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.110
 best effect is not it already too 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.210
 they added the coin counter here 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.100
 I know if they reach it to see up here that 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.690
 there will also be coins will be 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.880
 gold having copper is going to see blogs and that's going 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.569
 to take out of the caves and they have already added 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.339
 the caves 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.699
 let's see them here is here there is a what 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:15.699
 new 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.160
 this is a cave these were not in the 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.320
 previous version and this one I also know that 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.360
 there is another here soon, because 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.060
 they are going to add minerals that are going to 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.040
 add other monsters and new things 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.320
 things but I like the effect knowing 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.590
 the effect of the cave already saw how it 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.550
 see or it looks very father looks dark 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.980
 behind 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.990
 here is light light the front be better 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.850
 then he's very father I think he's going to 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.290
 be an excellent game for kids and 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.690
 remember search is a developer 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.090
 independent that is starting as the 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.500
 night weight with minecraft and this this 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.710
 dude has a company called 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.300
 the rest solutions and this one as good there 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.400
 It's changing, I'm liking your 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.710
 work and that's why they were presented 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.900
 and this one, I hope you liked it 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.610
 band that's pretty much all that 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.710
 you have added this version here in 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.390
 the description of the video is the link 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.720
 to download it now it's easier 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.640
 kids look let me put it on pause 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.200
 or sorry I forgot to tell you here in 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.180
 the bottom part to say as I put 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.310
 blocks not because here is just a 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.440
 selected block and up here are 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.420
 these are the tools that are 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.430
 they will use but they still do not appear or 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.500
 here below or no closer to here 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.900
 down since they choose the block that 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.590
 want and do not want to put land and 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.590
 now the earth 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.220
 hahahahaha I tell you that has to highlight 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:42.830
 that read some clichés but good this 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.910
 I'm going to show you how you are doing here 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.170
 simple they will not install 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.630
 when we are back in my 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:52.980
 desk guys remember that it's a 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:55.380
 beta or because you know this is for 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.600
 that people try it and if you have 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.610
 an idea to improve it for you see 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.590
 you find some error in the reports 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.210
 to the developer and already this goes 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.330
 improving and if it's a good game between 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.830
 everyone look when you download the 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.470
 game is going to download this folder 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.860
 it says but real and 0.3 give it double 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.810
 click opens and here says put and that's how it is 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.180
 so I double- click it and it opens no longer 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.330
 stick install anything is already done I think 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.250
 that only a library of xm to 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.140
 installs but it downloads equal from the 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.880
 game page if you want to with more 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.860
 I give you a tutorial on how to create 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.270
 a server and how to download the game 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.860
 because the simplest thing in the world 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.780
