00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.830 

all<00:00:01.709> right<00:00:01.920> so<00:00:02.129> we'll<00:00:02.429> do<00:00:02.550> one<00:00:03.030> more<00:00:03.330> set<00:00:03.659> the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
all right so we'll do one more set the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.559 
all right so we'll do one more set the
patient<00:00:04.230> also<00:00:04.350> has<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:05.069> pain<00:00:05.640> on<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.210> posterior

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
patient also has a pain on the posterior

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.820 
patient also has a pain on the posterior
aspect<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:07.290> her<00:00:07.529> shoulder<00:00:09.410> that<00:00:10.410> pain

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
aspect of her shoulder that pain

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.530 
aspect of her shoulder that pain
obviously<00:00:11.550> it's<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.790> small<00:00:12.059> intestine<00:00:12.509> channel

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
obviously it's a small intestine channel

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.680 
obviously it's a small intestine channel
but<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:14.070> pain<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.610> actually<00:00:15.089> controlled<00:00:15.509> by

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
but that pain is actually controlled by

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.349 
but that pain is actually controlled by
the<00:00:16.070> supraspinatus<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.880> superspinatus

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the supraspinatus and that superspinatus

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.179 
the supraspinatus and that superspinatus
is<00:00:18.869> controlled<00:00:19.680> by<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.010> triple<00:00:20.520> warmer<00:00:22.189> so

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
is controlled by the triple warmer so

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.160 
is controlled by the triple warmer so
one<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.029> wonderful<00:00:24.300> points<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:25.019> do

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
one of the wonderful points we can do

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.580 
one of the wonderful points we can do
for<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:29.300> Shen<00:00:30.300> Guan<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> half

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
for that is Shen Guan one and a half

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.580 
for that is Shen Guan one and a half
soon<00:00:31.830> down<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.279> spleen<00:00:32.579> nine<00:00:33.590> that's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
soon down from spleen nine that's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.729 
soon down from spleen nine that's
inserted<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:36.510> then<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> other<00:00:37.230> point<00:00:37.500> will

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
inserted and then the other point will

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.990 
inserted and then the other point will
do<00:00:38.270> will<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> guiding<00:00:40.230> point<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:41.000> triple

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
do will do a guiding point at triple

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.740 
do will do a guiding point at triple
warmer<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:43.110> reformer<00:00:43.649> three

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.979 

you<00:00:49.290> fine

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
you fine

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.260 
you fine
right<00:00:51.559> here<00:00:52.000> Shan<00:00:53.000> Shan

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
right here Shan Shan

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.590 
right here Shan Shan
inserted<00:00:56.489> right<00:00:57.489> back<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.030> base<00:00:58.210> of<00:00:58.239> the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
inserted right back to the base of the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.630 
inserted right back to the base of the
palm<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.730> way<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.739> what<00:01:02.890> we're<00:01:03.040> doing<00:01:03.070> is

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
palm this way so what we're doing is

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.840 
palm this way so what we're doing is
we're<00:01:04.350> creating<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.650> circuit<00:01:06.070> we've<00:01:06.250> got<00:01:06.460> the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
we're creating the circuit we've got the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.600 
we're creating the circuit we've got the
triple<00:01:07.360> warmer<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:08.320> spleen<00:01:08.619> nine<00:01:09.159> or<00:01:09.430> shin

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
triple warmer the spleen nine or shin

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.420 
triple warmer the spleen nine or shin
bone<00:01:09.790> pain<00:01:10.090> down<00:01:10.390> there<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.840> needle<00:01:11.080> inserted

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
bone pain down there the needle inserted

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.100 
bone pain down there the needle inserted
coming<00:01:12.430> up<00:01:12.550> here<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.909> shoulder<00:01:13.300> and<00:01:13.509> then

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
coming up here to the shoulder and then

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.350 
coming up here to the shoulder and then
we<00:01:14.170> have<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.350> guiding<00:01:14.710> point<00:01:14.920> here<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.850> shoe

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
we have the guiding point here the shoe

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.670 
we have the guiding point here the shoe
stream<00:01:16.630> point<00:01:16.899> trip<00:01:17.110> when<00:01:17.259> were<00:01:17.350> three<00:01:17.530> or

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
stream point trip when were three or

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.730 
stream point trip when were three or
sanches<00:01:18.070> on<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.550> that<00:01:19.330> should<00:01:19.780> alleviate<00:01:20.350> the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
sanches on and that should alleviate the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.499 
sanches on and that should alleviate the
pain<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.460> she<00:01:21.640> has<00:01:21.820> on<00:01:22.000> this<00:01:22.119> posterior

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
pain that she has on this posterior

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.230 
pain that she has on this posterior
aspect<00:01:23.080> of<00:01:23.220> her<00:01:24.220> shoulder<00:01:24.610> does<00:01:24.970> that<00:01:25.119> feel

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
aspect of her shoulder does that feel

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.580 
aspect of her shoulder does that feel
better

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.550 

that's<00:01:32.189> good<00:01:32.399> yeah<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.119> she<00:01:33.990> had<00:01:34.110> pain<00:01:34.320> prior

that's good yeah so she had pain prior
to<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> two<00:01:34.860> needles<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.390> now<00:01:36.390> she<00:01:36.479> feels

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to the two needles and now she feels

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.639 
to the two needles and now she feels
relief<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.439> she<00:01:37.649> feels<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.610> lot<00:01:39.210> better<00:01:39.649> so
