00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:06.179
 Hi (Vsauce), I'm Joe 

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:10.220
 Assassin's Creed series takes place in real historical times, but what is 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.460
 The parts of the game are already built on these times, and what are the imaginary parts in full? 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.890
 Some deep understanding of the historical context may help 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.140
 For example, organizations in the game. Were they the group Hashashin and the Knights 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.980
 Structure already exist? 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.090
 Well, the Hashashin organization was a real organization of Shia Muslims and was founded by Hasan al-Sabah during 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.199
 The First Crusade. Instead of direct attacks, Sabah was sending members of his loyal organization 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.180
 To kill top enemy leaders in fact, he currently believes 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.860
 That the term "killer" is derived from the term "Assassiyun", meaning "those loyal 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.610
 Organization " 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.440
 In the game Castle Qnassy Musayaf is the head of the organization, while 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.270
 This was the case during the game time frame, the year 1191, most of the Castle design was fanciful 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.410
 The power of the Hashashin began to dissipate when the Mughal Empire destroyed many of their strongholds 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.229
 In the 13th century. By the 14th century, the last remains of the original brothers 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.439
 Has been eliminated 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.779
 Therefore, the techniques of the Hashashin may have been inherited from that time, for example the Renaissance 

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:16.700
 In Italy or the American colony, but the real organization of the Haspashin is completely over 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.529
 Now, in contrast to this series, the Knights Templar is another real organization which 

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:25.369
 Has been the source of many conspiracy theories for centuries 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.279
 It was founded as a monastic organization shortly after the first crusade, and they were charged 

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:34.130
 To protect Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land. At first it was a poor organization 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.159
 The cavalry then gained wealth and power thanks to the pope 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.990
 Between military victories against Muslims and the use of their property to establish a banking system 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.770
 For pilgrims, the Templars became one of the most powerful organizations in the world 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.799
 the world. However the crusades continued, and Muslims eventually recovered most 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.239
 The Holy Land and the cavalry lost their castles and supported the people, they were accused 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:00.439
 Heretical by the king of France only to evade his debts to them 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.779
 By 1312, the church formally dissolved the organization. While claiming several groups 

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:10.459
 As the heirs of philosophy to organize knights like Freemasons, there is none 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.170
 Direct link of any kind. 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.060
 Therefore, the tales of the eternal conflict between the Assassins and the Knights, during the Crusades 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.819
 Largely unfounded. 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.060
 Another interesting topic is how do junkies carry out their deadly actions? To what extent they are 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.290
 Weapons and tactics game real? 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.950
 The original killers were carrying out their attacks with knives or swords because they were their real weapons 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.099
 But unfortunately the retractable hidden swords in the game really do not exist 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.019
 In addition, grasshoppers did not normally use poison, arches and arrows, they thought they were 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.030
 Soft weapons increase the chance of survival target 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.099
 But beside the sword, the assailants also used the means of intimidation to achieve their goals 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:55.099
 The famous Sultan Salah al-Din, who was mentioned in the first game, woke up from his sleep one night 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.670
 To find a dagger and wrote a note on his pillow that he could be killed if attacked 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.780
 The stronghold of Hashashi Musayaf, and shortly afterwards entered a truce with the Hashashin 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.650
 Another tactic is not worth anything in this version 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.200
 An advantage exists in the game but in order to emphasize not fear. Junkies sometimes 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.370
 They were killing in public and the players themselves were doing it in games 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.079
 This devotion to their missions was a famous feature of this organization 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.269
 The next downloadable content of Assassin's Creed 3, which chronicles the American Revolution 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.709
 Will include a story where George Washington becomes a tyrant and king of the United States 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.709
 After the success of his defeat for the British interesting this alternative history 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.189
 But the question remains: George Washington could have been king 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.150
 For America if he wants this? 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.430
 Well, there were at least two points in history where such an outcome could actually take place 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.189
 The first was at the end of the revolution when he had many officers 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:57.150
 The continental army is angry that they have not received their salaries from Congress and are looking for one strong personality 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.620
 To complete their full control over the new state Washington was able to fill 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.870
 This role is easy if he succeeds in persuading them 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.709
 The next step would have been a march to Philadelphia, 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.069
 Resolve Congress and persuade state governments to comply 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.380
 For his regime and his central command and a second war if necessary, but instead, Washington 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.210
 He expressed his dissatisfaction with the speech of his men and urged them to the sovereignty of the Republic 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.580
 He resigned from his post as Commander-in-Chief later that year. 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.960
 However, another chance in the unlimited power given to Washington when it was 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.729
 Elected as the first president in 1789. During the Washington administration, he set many standards 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.030
 Of the position that still exists today, including its limits. 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.520
 The suppression of the farmers during the rebellion was met with popular approval 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.550
 We can believe that he could have expanded his executive powers 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.949
 With the support of the people, to extend to Congress if necessary 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.870
 He also refused to run for a third term, a custom that all presidents kept until Roosevelt in 1940 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.400
 Yet he could remain in office until his death, bearing in mind 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.270
 A dangerous precedent for the imperialist presidency. 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.870
 Even in the modern era, the American people have shown an interest in the reelection of politicians 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.729
 forever. The Senate alone has many of the remaining incumbents for a long time and does not leave 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.520
 Their seats are only at death 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.900
 It is not hard to imagine that the president of the United States has also been elected for decades 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.819
 They all follow examples of Washington's prospects (in expanding its powers) 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:28.060
 Therefore, in general, the historical context of the Assassin doctrine is real and accurate 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.110
 Even alternative schedules are not too far away and by blending myth into reality, games are capable 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.009
 To provoke attention to history stretching back thousands of years and hidden swords, a lot of excitement 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.789
 In the hidden swords of the wrist 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:47.039
 As usual, thanks for watching
