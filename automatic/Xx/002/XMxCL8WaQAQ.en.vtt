00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.450 

I<00:05:34.900> tell<00:05:35.900> my<00:05:36.080> students<00:05:36.530> that<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.980> sill<00:05:37.190> logs

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
I tell my students that the sill logs

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.850 
I tell my students that the sill logs
are<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:37.850> most<00:05:38.150> important<00:05:38.780> logs<00:05:39.110> in<00:05:39.500> their

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
are the most important logs in their

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.440 
are the most important logs in their
house<00:05:40.100> and<00:05:40.720> it's<00:05:41.720> true<00:05:42.580> let's<00:05:43.580> see<00:05:43.820> that<00:05:44.000> magic

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450

again<00:05:47.980> get<00:05:48.980> your<00:05:49.130> sill<00:05:49.370> log<00:05:49.580> started<00:05:50.090> right

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
again get your sill log started right

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.600 
again get your sill log started right
and<00:05:50.540> the<00:05:51.170> rest<00:05:51.410> of<00:05:51.560> the<00:05:51.680> building<00:05:52.040> will<00:05:52.430> be<00:05:52.580> a

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
and the rest of the building will be a

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.310 
and the rest of the building will be a
