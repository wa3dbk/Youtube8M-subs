 we get the better than very 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.989
 simple and natural at the time 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.430

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.170

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.640
 having to take it off 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.559
 yes it seems to me is a historical one 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.330
 smoking event and as news 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.610
 people do you tend to 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.259
 by wanting to be yes and yes I have 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.450
 also what with the Netherlands of course that you 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.619
 are married in half 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.630
 dutch indonesian man is right 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.520
 and what's that rennie's name anyway 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.390
 filing dock dock so do not 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.820
 so 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.590
 no very crazy brewer just women yes 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.080
 that is not really indonesia but that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.230
 is higher in the family there is ever again 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.330
 once a netherlands started from kunta 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.230
 kinteh by it has nothing to do with it 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.800
 most brewer 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.570
 indeed and luckily is still whole 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.250
 very nice very Dutch minded row 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.540
 then with green underpants 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.080
 of course through the house too heavy or 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.350
 not 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.290
 green orange or when good she gives 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.550
 after you 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.750
 but three days have been to me 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.030
 in the Netherlands 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.350
 now he stays in a tree and keeps forgetting 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.450
 you have had your channel in london 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.740
 in fun to do delicious and huge 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.990
 understood a lot 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.100
 yes i have i just got my feet 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.300
 broke down 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.340
 everything done on foot but I found it 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.260
 also needed because if you are in such a city 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.300
 then you want your reporting 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.830
 bringing what is going on so you 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.630
 must feel as much as possible what is there 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.490
 the yes is going on so i found it 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.200
 important to do everything on foot and 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.790
 by walking and feeling all those parks 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.260
 what lives and most people are 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.720
 it doesn't matter if you are royal 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.220
 or not is just something very positive 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.080
 an ordinary girl can be a princess here 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.330
 and that is the dream of so many 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.670
 women and and then I saw in one 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.020
 positive vibes in that city and me 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.160
 found his meanwhile we can not 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.390
 Flemings 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.700
 Berger doesn't really put up with it 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.350
 royal family really you do n't really like it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.400
 the royal family is also a completely different one 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.010
 given the orange feeling is such a thing 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.130
 unique I think you have a color 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.180
 we have no color once a3 color 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.870
 but that also says something about the country we 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.220
 to be 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.080
 blocks with a puzzle while 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.180
 The Netherlands has actually been one for a long time 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.070
 whole and if I do the interview now 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.980
 van willem-alexander he says me too 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.180
 wild unity that has been around all the time 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.120
 I want again 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.420
 yes also the w van willem van 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.750
 share 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.739
 alexander maxima 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.739
 I don't have a button for you 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.530

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.569
 on you it is it is a totally new on 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.090
 your mobile mobile do you have 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.489
 I think the Netherlands is a whole anyway 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.450
 and you see the feeling through it 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.160
 in so much and it 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.810
 that is with both sport and you 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.530
 Olympic Games or the World Cup 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.660
 football 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.739
 you name it and and the royal family is like that 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.550
 with you the ultimate natural thymus 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.050
 middle thinking so 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.330
 I also did monaco with that whole one 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.760

 sung along 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.229

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.300

 no values 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.129
 you know i have i had another 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.719
 expectations that was what do you expect 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.599
 You already know the Netherlands very often 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:45.190
 of those sing-alongs and you think so 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.690
 sometimes composer of song service 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.430
 real shouts from borsato then I had 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.340

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.979

 part was actually paid 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:20.169
 I think you're dealing with the fact that it sticks 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:24.800

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:47.630
 you have to keep it safe so long 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.630
