00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.440
 no no 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.690
 is one more day to my channel as you see 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.260
 I bring another video of the vine and blender and 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.540
 concretely it is like washing it and with what 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.689
 product wash it so that the visible 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.579
 be completely perfect if you want 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.300
 see what product is to continue seeing the 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.230
 video 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.970
 good to say to you until you find a 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.059
 product that I left the adif and blender 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.079
 Perfect cost me because I refused 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.420
 to buy the ham of the brand because 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.220
 because not because I find it very expensive to 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.590
 what is so first what I started 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.880
 using was a gel 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.550
 normal as gel bic really does not 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.650
 removed all the makeup but 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.579
 took a part but the leaves were still 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.570
 dirty I decided to try soaps for the 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.189
 face with soap 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.930
 specifically that I am using myself 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.810
 for the face that is of the nivea brand 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.220
 this is exactly what happened to me 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.770
 it took off a little makeup but the 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.060
 things looked very dirty 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.630
 with a cleansing soap plus fountain 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.270
 so to speak that the previous and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.759
 nor would the sponge be more or less 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.030
 the same already desperate put us to look 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.280
 on YouTube to see how the boarding 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.159
 of this sponge because there was no way 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.929
 that it would stay pink like when I 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.929
 I bought so I came to the video of a 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.850
 girl washing the leaves with thaily 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.969
 maybe in principle different from me 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.640
 wash with a file and sponge 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.399
 that's how it's broken, but later I 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.720
 yalava with a normal soap I'm not going to 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.789
 use directly after having it 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.009
 given with the good end well with the friar 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.380
 neither is society 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.140
 yes that can be was a little more than with 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.149
 the previous soaps but the sponge 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.590
 it was not as you see now we are going to 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.790
 completely if what had spots of 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.170
 make up 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:15.250
 I took to try like the house type 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.350
 and the soap in question is soap from 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.540
 lizard let's soap leaves us from 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.580
 impeccable sponge and if you do not want it 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.950
 Here you have the video demonstration for 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.269
 that you see that it is perfect good 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.409
 here as you see I have 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.830
 completely full of makeup like 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.830
 you can see 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.269
 As you can see there is no trap or cardboard 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.069
 in the lizard ham and first what 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.069
 I'm going to do is wet the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.020
 and when I have it completely 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.460
 wet what we are going to pass on the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:58.050
 soap making sure that the soap reaches 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.050
 all parts of the sponge 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.490
 and I'm clarifying this step not only do 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.330
 several times as you are going to see 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:15.230
 now clear and as you see, the 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.080
 makeup is also true that the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.700
 a lot of color because it not only puts this 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.890
 soap but I put a all the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.020
 young people who used absolutely with 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.270
 all of me has also left the pink water 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.270
 that is, losing, you also become scared 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.610
 As you can see, he was already Maria's father and 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:41.430
 gone so how do I stay here for the 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.430
 tip a little bit I will return to give 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.310
 and return to clarify 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:33.889
 and is ready to use to be a 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:37.100
 little with so much that he applied so that 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:41.060
 go of excess water good then here 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:44.570
 is the bible to the band as it is 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.419
 completely clean is very easy going 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.090
 pretty fast you just have to 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.800
 the soap sprays the sponge a couple of times 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.979
 and it is true that we have to influence a little 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.630
 in the area where the makeup took 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.010
 little more between the set but simply 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.500
 because the makeup has penetrated a 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.949
 little bit more and you have to give it a tad more 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.680
 but but as you can see it's super easy super 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.120
 fast and over cash then once 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.979
 that things have gotten worse with this 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.380
 soap what is true is that a 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.660
 then he has given you with the soap that 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.210
 I used to face because it gives me a little 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.400
 of thing to use the sponge after 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.310
 of having washed with this kind of 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.560
 soap as you see is 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.180
 perfect what I really like this 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.800
 soap is that it does not do too much 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.840
 foam because of course I like us 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.460
 I never used to have to be 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.960
 squeezing and squeezing and squeezing and 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.540
 clarifying and clarifying that 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.370
 coming out soap every two for three but 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.880
 with this soap to us on the basis of 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.240
 foam is perfect once she 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.940
 nun with lizard soap after yes 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.890
 that the flattery with the soap that I am 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.780
 to wash my face and you'll stay 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.250
 with hit to ready to use soap 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.040
 lizard you can find it in any 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.140
 pipeline of any supermarket this 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.810
 concretely it cost me one euro so 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.500
 over is super to look at what piece of 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:06.460
 soap is that you have to wash many 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.200
 years so if there was one that did not 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.360
 I had found a soap that was 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.490
 good for the different claw try with 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.380
 this good soap girls this site of 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.150
 videos if you have any soap 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.890
 that also works very well 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.750
 leave me the comments 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.430
