00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
the flow is generally high cars only

have<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.810> yield<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.170> cyclists<00:01:11.950> when<00:01:12.430> they

have to yield to cyclists when they

have to yield to cyclists when they
leave<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.060> roundabout<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.680> they<00:01:14.830> are<00:01:14.950> not<00:01:15.159> in

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
leave the roundabout but they are not in

leave the roundabout but they are not in
the<00:01:15.460> way<00:01:15.580> of<00:01:15.640> automotive<00:01:16.330> traffic<00:01:16.690> on<00:01:16.810> the

roundabout

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.910

so<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.360> flow<00:01:19.570> never<00:01:19.899> really<00:01:20.229> comes<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.649> a<00:01:20.679> full

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
so the flow never really comes to a full

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:37.529 
so the flow never really comes to a full
stop

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.349 

sometimes<00:01:38.560> cyclists<00:01:39.560> yields<00:01:40.130> slightly<00:01:40.700> so

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
sometimes cyclists yields slightly so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.889 
sometimes cyclists yields slightly so
everything<00:01:41.990> can<00:01:42.229> run<00:01:42.469> smoothly<00:01:43.689> but<00:01:44.689> the

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
everything can run smoothly but the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.620 
everything can run smoothly but the
moment<00:01:45.289> a<00:01:45.350> cyclist<00:01:45.799> hesitates<00:01:46.429> other<00:01:46.850> traffic

moment a cyclist hesitates other traffic

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.260 
moment a cyclist hesitates other traffic
will<00:01:47.899> go<00:01:48.109> first<00:01:48.409> instead
