I don't know whether I'm allowed to ask
this<00:02:20.599> but<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.930> g-class<00:02:21.439> is<00:02:21.650> quite<00:02:21.799> an<00:02:21.920> iconic

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
this but the g-class is quite an iconic

this but the g-class is quite an iconic
looking<00:02:22.909> vehicle<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.900> one<00:02:24.139> a<00:02:24.469> little<00:02:25.069> bit

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
looking vehicle this one a little bit

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.890 
looking vehicle this one a little bit
more<00:02:25.249> curvaceous<00:02:25.700> are<00:02:26.329> you<00:02:26.389> going<00:02:26.659> in<00:02:26.749> that

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
more curvaceous are you going in that

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.410 
more curvaceous are you going in that
sort<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.290> direction<00:02:27.769> and<00:02:28.099> future<00:02:28.609> yeah<00:02:29.150> we're

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
sort of direction and future yeah we're

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.330 
sort of direction and future yeah we're
definitely<00:02:29.599> moving<00:02:30.019> away<00:02:30.319> from<00:02:30.499> that<00:02:30.950> stiff

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
definitely moving away from that stiff

definitely moving away from that stiff
shapes<00:02:31.609> I<00:02:31.760> mean<00:02:31.939> if<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.180> look<00:02:32.329> at<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.599> 70s

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.469 
shapes I mean if you look at the 70s

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.250 
shapes I mean if you look at the 70s
where<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.859> g-class<00:02:34.250> was<00:02:34.609> created<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.900> shapes

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
where the g-class was created the shapes

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.229 
where the g-class was created the shapes
have<00:02:36.590> been<00:02:36.829> literally<00:02:37.280> made<00:02:37.459> like<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:37.939> due

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
have been literally made like that due

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.179 
have been literally made like that due
to<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.989> know<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.260> bending<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.709> sheet<00:02:39.980> metal

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.140 
to you know the bending of sheet metal
now<00:02:40.969> in<00:02:41.389> 20<00:02:42.319> let's<00:02:42.980> say<00:02:43.099> 15<00:02:43.609> you<00:02:43.819> know<00:02:43.939> we

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
now in 20 let's say 15 you know we

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.330 
now in 20 let's say 15 you know we
design<00:02:44.840> changed<00:02:45.409> and<00:02:45.560> it's<00:02:45.709> going<00:02:45.889> to<00:02:45.980> be<00:02:46.069> more

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
design changed and it's going to be more

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.339 
design changed and it's going to be more
sophisticated<00:02:46.579> and<00:02:47.419> you<00:02:47.569> see<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.989> in<00:02:48.200> the

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
sophisticated and you see that in the

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.559 
sophisticated and you see that in the
shape<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.459> shape<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:49.969> actually<00:02:50.180> very

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
shape so the shape is actually very

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.530 
shape so the shape is actually very
central<00:02:51.319> it's<00:02:51.889> very<00:02:52.129> producti<00:02:53.000> but<00:02:53.299> very

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
central it's very producti but very

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.349 
central it's very producti but very
defined<00:02:54.049> and<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:54.500> again<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.219> is<00:02:55.430> how<00:02:56.299> we

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
defined and so again this is how we

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:07.000 
defined and so again this is how we
bring<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.959> g-wagen<00:02:57.500> into<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.859> future

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.069
