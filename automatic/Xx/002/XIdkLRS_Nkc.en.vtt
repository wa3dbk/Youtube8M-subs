00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
conditioning to the next level so one of

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.449 
conditioning to the next level so one of
the<00:02:21.930> exercises<00:02:22.140> we<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.190> called<00:02:23.430> a

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
the exercises we do in that is called a

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.890 
the exercises we do in that is called a
quick<00:02:23.640> switch<00:02:23.850> one<00:02:24.420> point<00:02:24.600> underneath<00:02:24.750> your

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
quick switch one point underneath your

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.370 
quick switch one point underneath your
hips

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
hips

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.590 
hips
switch<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.890> okay<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.270> going<00:02:27.450> out<00:02:27.570> with

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
switch it okay so you going out with

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.360 
switch it okay so you going out with
your<00:02:27.810> stride<00:02:28.140> length<00:02:28.170> they're<00:02:28.620> staying<00:02:29.190> nice

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
your stride length they're staying nice

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.880 
your stride length they're staying nice
and<00:02:29.430> low<00:02:29.840> that's<00:02:30.840> why<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> conditioning<00:02:31.590> says

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
and low that's why the conditioning says

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.570 
and low that's why the conditioning says
to<00:02:32.010> begin

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
to begin

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.610 
to begin
well<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.510> stretches<00:02:33.900> we<00:02:34.020> do<00:02:34.170> probably<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
well the stretches we do probably the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.110 
well the stretches we do probably the
most<00:02:34.740> important<00:02:35.100> one<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.310> for<00:02:35.459> hip<00:02:35.670> flexors

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
most important one is for hip flexors

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.030 
most important one is for hip flexors
this<00:02:36.360> muscle<00:02:36.690> right<00:02:36.720> here<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.680> when<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.830> use

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
this muscle right here so when you use

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.800 
this muscle right here so when you use
every<00:02:38.400> single<00:02:38.520> time<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:38.910> take<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.090> stride<00:02:39.450> bring

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
every single time we take a stride bring

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.540 
every single time we take a stride bring
that<00:02:39.900> leg<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.920> got<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.160> make<00:02:41.250> sure<00:02:41.400> those

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
that leg in you got to make sure those

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.400 
that leg in you got to make sure those
are<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.760> loose<00:02:41.940> also<00:02:42.750> what<00:02:42.870> happens<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.260> get

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
are the loose also what happens to get

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.470 
are the loose also what happens to get
back<00:02:43.620> pain<00:02:43.920> okay<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.790> pulls<00:02:45.000> your<00:02:45.120> hips<00:02:45.270> out<00:02:45.450> of

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
back pain okay it pulls your hips out of

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.150 
back pain okay it pulls your hips out of
alignment<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:46.140> get<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> arch<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:47.010> your<00:02:47.040> back

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
alignment you get the arch in your back

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.610 
alignment you get the arch in your back
hey<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.300> know<00:02:48.570> maybe<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.900> start<00:02:49.170> beginning

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
hey you know maybe you start beginning

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440 
hey you know maybe you start beginning
of<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.770> season<00:02:49.980> you're<00:02:50.760> back<00:02:50.910> on<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.270> it's<00:02:51.360> a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
of the season you're back on here it's a

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.910 
of the season you're back on here it's a
little<00:02:51.540> bit<00:02:51.660> when<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.930> started<00:02:52.170> skating<00:02:52.440> it's

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
little bit when you started skating it's

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.990 
little bit when you started skating it's
because<00:02:53.070> those<00:02:53.160> hip<00:02:53.370> flexors<00:02:53.400> are<00:02:53.760> super

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
because those hip flexors are super

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.820 
because those hip flexors are super
tight<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:54.840> one<00:02:54.989> stretch<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.380> do<00:02:55.500> for<00:02:55.709> that

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
tight so one stretch you can do for that

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.360 
tight so one stretch you can do for that
with<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.910> nice<00:02:57.060> long<00:02:57.450> lunge<00:02:58.080> position<00:02:58.340> get<00:02:59.340> a
