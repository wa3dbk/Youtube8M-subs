actual develop module itself which I
feel<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.199> is<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.770> core<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070

module<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:59.010> let's<00:00:59.160> talk<00:00:59.250> about<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.610> again

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
module so let's talk about that again

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.930 
module so let's talk about that again
this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.200> like<00:01:01.379> an<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.649> beta<00:01:01.860> and<00:01:02.129> adobe<00:01:02.790> does

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
this is like an for beta and adobe does

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.579 
this is like an for beta and adobe does
make<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.239> perfectly<00:01:03.690> clear<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.020> there's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
make it perfectly clear that there's

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
gives me a little bit of hope but you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.770 
gives me a little bit of hope but you
know<00:01:11.399> we'll<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.670> we'll<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.060> what<00:01:12.300> happens<00:01:12.390> so

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
know we'll see we'll see what happens so

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.920 
know we'll see we'll see what happens so
let's<00:01:13.560> jump<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.860> develop<00:01:14.220> module<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.930> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
let's jump in the develop module and the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.190 
let's jump in the develop module and the
first<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.590> most<00:01:16.979> probably<00:01:17.970> broad<00:01:18.420> change<00:01:18.869> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
first and most probably broad change is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.309 
first and most probably broad change is
changes<00:01:20.039> to<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.369> actual<00:01:20.700> basic<00:01:21.330> panel<00:01:21.929> right

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
changes to the actual basic panel right

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.130 
changes to the actual basic panel right
here<00:01:22.670> we<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.850> major<00:01:24.119> changes<00:01:24.569> to<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.810> layout

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
here we have major changes to the layout

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.230 
here we have major changes to the layout
as<00:01:25.319> well<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.009> actual<00:01:26.429> functions

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
as well as the actual functions

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.699 
as well as the actual functions
themselves<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.750> well<00:01:27.929> as<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.050> actual<00:01:28.259> sliders

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
themselves as well as the actual sliders

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.710 
themselves as well as the actual sliders
you<00:01:29.280> notice<00:01:29.550> that<00:01:29.580> contrast<00:01:30.300> is<00:01:30.450> actually

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
you notice that contrast is actually

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.380 
you notice that contrast is actually
brought<00:01:30.959> now<00:01:31.170> right<00:01:31.470> below<00:01:31.740> exposure<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:33.240> we

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
brought now right below exposure and we

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.719 
brought now right below exposure and we
have<00:01:33.630> four<00:01:34.229> new<00:01:34.560> sliders<00:01:35.039> 1-4<00:01:35.580> highlights

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
have four new sliders 1-4 highlights

shadows<00:01:36.450> whites<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:37.289> blacks<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:38.490> when<00:01:38.789> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
shadows whites and blacks now when you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.969 
shadows whites and blacks now when you
first<00:01:39.179> see<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.599> it<00:01:40.470> might<00:01:40.649> be<00:01:40.770> really

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
first see this it might be really

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.469 
first see this it might be really
frustrating<00:01:41.160> because<00:01:41.459> you're<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.789> okay<00:01:42.030> why

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
is it doe be changing this standard but

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.550 
is it doe be changing this standard but
I<00:01:45.179> mean<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.479> were<00:01:45.780> kind<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> used<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.440> whole

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
I mean we were kind of used to the whole

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.010 
I mean we were kind of used to the whole
exposure<00:01:47.009> brightness<00:01:47.459> thing<00:01:47.810> but<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> know<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
exposure brightness thing but you know I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.040 
exposure brightness thing but you know I
remember<00:01:49.500> countless<00:01:50.039> times<00:01:50.429> explaining<00:01:51.240> what

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
remember countless times explaining what

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.630 
remember countless times explaining what
the<00:01:52.170> difference<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.530> between<00:01:52.590> exposure<00:01:53.459> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the difference is between exposure and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
this new system is actually much more

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.499 
this new system is actually much more
intuitive<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.880> it's<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.270> really

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
intuitive and it's going to be really

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.449 
intuitive and it's going to be really
great<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.410> still<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.830> exposure<00:02:11.190> still

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
great you still have exposure still

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.979 
great you still have exposure still
works<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> exact<00:02:12.000> same<00:02:12.180> way<00:02:12.360> contrast<00:02:12.840> still

works the exact same way contrast still

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.350 
works the exact same way contrast still
works<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.349> same<00:02:13.380> way<00:02:13.760> but<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.060> unique<00:02:15.300> thing

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
works the same way but the unique thing

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.910 
works the same way but the unique thing
is<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:15.750> highlights<00:02:16.140> shadows<00:02:16.319> whites<00:02:16.739> and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
is that highlights shadows whites and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.150 
is that highlights shadows whites and
blacks<00:02:17.130> now<00:02:17.520> do<00:02:18.410> kind<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.470> their<00:02:19.950> very

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
blacks now do kind of their very

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.309 
blacks now do kind of their very

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
the highlights up you are brightening

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.940

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
your highlights if you drag it down you

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.320 
your highlights if you drag it down you
are<00:02:26.129> pulling<00:02:26.549> down<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:26.730> highlights

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
are pulling down your highlights

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.240 
are pulling down your highlights
same<00:02:28.170> thing<00:02:28.350> with<00:02:28.470> shadows<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.040> drag

is essentially your recovery you have

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.470 
is essentially your recovery you have
even<00:02:35.010> more<00:02:35.130> control<00:02:35.610> over<00:02:35.640> specifically<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
even more control over specifically the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.990 
even more control over specifically the
whites<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> blacks<00:02:37.430> if<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.670> drag<00:02:38.880> your

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
whites and the blacks if you drag your

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.640 
whites and the blacks if you drag your
whites<00:02:39.210> up<00:02:39.420> it's<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.080> pumping<00:02:40.470> up<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
whites up it's a it's pumping up the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.530 
whites up it's a it's pumping up the
whites<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> image<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.180> blacks

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
whites in the image and you have blacks

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.390 
whites in the image and you have blacks
again<00:02:42.900> where<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.470> drag<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.770> blacks<00:02:43.980> up<00:02:44.190> is

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
again where if you drag the blacks up is

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.370 
again where if you drag the blacks up is
you're<00:02:44.550> increasing<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.360> blacks<00:02:45.600> or<00:02:45.900> decrease

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
you're increasing the blacks or decrease

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.870 
you're increasing the blacks or decrease
in<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.560> blacks<00:02:46.770> based<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.130> where<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.340> go<00:02:47.400> kind

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
in the blacks based on where you go kind

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.340 
in the blacks based on where you go kind
of<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.000> function<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.390> same<00:02:48.540> way<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:49.170> now<00:02:49.290> we

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
of a function the same way but now we

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.650 
of a function the same way but now we
actually<00:02:49.650> have<00:02:49.740> white<00:02:49.890> control<00:02:50.280> as<00:02:50.400> well<00:02:50.660> so

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
actually have white control as well so

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.020 
actually have white control as well so
between<00:02:52.170> these<00:02:52.410> four<00:02:53.160> adjustments<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.880> have

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
between these four adjustments you have

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.730 
between these four adjustments you have
much<00:02:54.330> more<00:02:54.360> control<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.960> more<00:02:55.170> intuitive

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
much more control and more intuitive

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.580 
much more control and more intuitive
control<00:02:56.280> over<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.330> exposure<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.200> your<00:02:58.440> image

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
control over the exposure of your image

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.140 
control over the exposure of your image
it's<00:02:58.770> essentially<00:02:59.280> taking<00:02:59.610> your<00:02:59.730> tone<00:02:59.910> curve

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
it's essentially taking your tone curve

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.380 
it's essentially taking your tone curve
and<00:03:00.650> giving<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.740> slider<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.370> each<00:03:02.580> level<00:03:03.150> to

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
and giving a slider to each level to

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.000 
and giving a slider to each level to
each<00:03:03.510> region<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.260> tone<00:03:04.470> curve<00:03:04.740> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
each region of this tone curve and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.980 
each region of this tone curve and
putting<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:05.940> into<00:03:06.060> your<00:03:06.180> basic<00:03:06.510> panel<00:03:06.720> which

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
putting it into your basic panel which

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.360 
putting it into your basic panel which
is<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.410> nice<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.860> going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.070> be<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> really

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
is really nice it's going to be a really

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.440 
is really nice it's going to be a really
nice<00:03:08.580> feature<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:09.090> gonna<00:03:09.180> be<00:03:09.270> very

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
nice feature it's gonna be very

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.630 
nice feature it's gonna be very
intuitive<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:09.990> really<00:03:10.230> help<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.680> explaining

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
intuitive and really help in explaining

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.000 
intuitive and really help in explaining
and<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.450> kind<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.720> just<00:03:13.050> understanding<00:03:13.680> how

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
and and kind of just understanding how

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.730 
and and kind of just understanding how
the<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:15.420> basic<00:03:15.720> panel<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.200> exposure

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
the the basic panel and the exposure

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.620 
the the basic panel and the exposure
adjustments<00:03:17.160> are<00:03:17.220> going<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.400> work<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:18.450> that's

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
adjustments are going to work so that's

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.230 
adjustments are going to work so that's
a<00:03:18.750> great<00:03:18.930> adjustment<00:03:19.170> there<00:03:19.850> now<00:03:20.850> when<00:03:21.120> it

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
a great adjustment there now when it

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.360 
a great adjustment there now when it
comes<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.930> tone<00:03:22.140> curve<00:03:22.410> when<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:22.920> comes<00:03:23.130> to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
comes to the tone curve when it comes to

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.340 
comes to the tone curve when it comes to
basically<00:03:24.270> everything<00:03:24.720> else<00:03:24.870> split<00:03:25.140> toning

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
basically everything else split toning

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.890 
basically everything else split toning
detail<00:03:25.890> most<00:03:26.490> everything<00:03:26.790> else<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.390> exact

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
kind of stuff you need to be able to

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.540 
kind of stuff you need to be able to
create<00:05:18.780> presets<00:05:19.379> with<00:05:19.560> local<00:05:19.889> area<00:05:20.099> justement

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
create presets with local area justement

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.820 
create presets with local area justement
with<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.509> brushes<00:05:22.139> and<00:05:22.319> the<00:05:22.379> graduated

with the brushes and the graduated

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.920 
with the brushes and the graduated
filter<00:05:22.860> adjustments<00:05:23.610> we<00:05:24.330> see<00:05:24.509> graduate

hopefully<00:05:31.440> that's<00:05:31.590> going<00:05:31.710> to<00:05:31.800> change<00:05:32.009> in<00:05:32.190> the

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
hopefully that's going to change in the

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.589 
hopefully that's going to change in the
final<00:05:32.550> version<00:05:32.729> it's<00:05:33.120> kind<00:05:33.300> of<00:05:33.389> disappointing

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
final version it's kind of disappointing

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.930 
final version it's kind of disappointing
to<00:05:33.900> see<00:05:34.020> that<00:05:34.139> that's<00:05:34.259> not<00:05:34.440> in<00:05:34.620> here<00:05:34.889> now<00:05:35.849> the

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
to see that that's not in here now the

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.850 
to see that that's not in here now the
next<00:05:36.000> thing<00:05:36.300> if<00:05:36.599> we<00:05:36.719> go<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.020> we<00:05:37.110> look<00:05:37.319> at<00:05:37.530> like

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
next thing if we go and we look at like

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.040 
next thing if we go and we look at like
the<00:05:38.129> spot<00:05:38.370> removal<00:05:38.669> tool<00:05:38.849> we<00:05:39.120> have<00:05:39.270> no

the spot removal tool we have no

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.959 
the spot removal tool we have no
additional<00:05:40.469> control<00:05:40.889> over<00:05:41.280> spot<00:05:41.520> removal<00:05:41.849> we

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
additional control over spot removal we

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.430 
additional control over spot removal we
can't<00:05:42.210> do<00:05:42.330> any<00:05:42.479> additional<00:05:42.840> cloning<00:05:43.259> any

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
can't do any additional cloning any

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.930 
can't do any additional cloning any
additional<00:05:43.860> healing<00:05:44.250> we<00:05:44.340> can't<00:05:44.520> change<00:05:44.759> the

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
additional healing we can't change the

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.149 
additional healing we can't change the
shape<00:05:45.719> of<00:05:45.870> the<00:05:45.900> brush<00:05:46.169> we<00:05:46.380> can't<00:05:46.590> do<00:05:46.740> any<00:05:46.919> like

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
shape of the brush we can't do any like

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.490 
shape of the brush we can't do any like
kind<00:05:47.340> of<00:05:47.460> brushing<00:05:48.120> and<00:05:48.360> masking<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:49.229> and

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
kind of brushing and masking and and

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.450 
kind of brushing and masking and and
that<00:05:49.650> kind<00:05:49.860> of<00:05:49.889> stuff<00:05:49.949> that<00:05:50.159> you<00:05:50.219> would<00:05:50.370> in

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
that kind of stuff that you would in

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.120 
that kind of stuff that you would in
Photoshop<00:05:50.909> I<00:05:51.090> think<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.229> reason<00:05:52.469> for<00:05:52.800> this<00:05:52.889> is

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
Photoshop I think the reason for this is

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.100 
Photoshop I think the reason for this is
really<00:05:53.400> to<00:05:53.610> keep<00:05:53.849> Lightroom<00:05:54.509> independent<00:05:55.080> a

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
really to keep Lightroom independent a

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.719 
really to keep Lightroom independent a
Photoshop<00:05:55.560> and<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:55.800> make<00:05:55.949> sure<00:05:56.159> that<00:05:56.400> you<00:05:56.580> know

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
Photoshop and to make sure that you know

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.600 
Photoshop and to make sure that you know
there's<00:05:57.330> still<00:05:57.479> a<00:05:57.630> need<00:05:57.779> for<00:05:58.409> users<00:05:59.370> to<00:05:59.400> be

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
there's still a need for users to be

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.040 
there's still a need for users to be
able<00:05:59.639> to<00:05:59.880> you<00:06:00.090> know<00:06:00.180> pull<00:06:00.449> things<00:06:00.779> into

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
able to you know pull things into

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.629 
able to you know pull things into
photoshop<00:06:01.469> it'd<00:06:01.860> be<00:06:02.099> great<00:06:02.370> if<00:06:02.400> those<00:06:02.610> things

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
photoshop it'd be great if those things

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.700 
photoshop it'd be great if those things
were<00:06:02.849> added<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:03.150> layer<00:06:03.300> them<00:06:03.449> but<00:06:03.719> I<00:06:03.930> don't<00:06:04.229> see

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
were added to layer them but I don't see

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.010 
were added to layer them but I don't see
it<00:06:04.740> happening<00:06:04.949> with<00:06:05.250> lightroom<00:06:05.550> 4<00:06:05.810> aside<00:06:06.810> from

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
it happening with lightroom 4 aside from

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.269 
it happening with lightroom 4 aside from
that<00:06:07.110> there's<00:06:07.500> not<00:06:07.620> really<00:06:07.830> any<00:06:08.069> other

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
that there's not really any other

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.740 
that there's not really any other
adjustments<00:06:08.789> cropping<00:06:09.240> everything<00:06:09.599> else

adjustments cropping everything else

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.839 
adjustments cropping everything else
works<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.110> exact<00:06:10.440> same<00:06:10.680> way<00:06:10.889> the<00:06:11.460> develop

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
works the exact same way the develop

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:13.909 
works the exact same way the develop
module<00:06:11.940> for<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.360> most<00:06:12.509> part<00:06:12.690> is<00:06:12.900> is<00:06:13.199> identical

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
module for the most part is is identical

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.219 
module for the most part is is identical
in<00:06:14.099> every<00:06:14.250> other<00:06:14.460> way<00:06:14.580> to<00:06:14.759> line<00:06:15.479> 3<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:16.139> that's

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
in every other way to line 3 and that's

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.570 
in every other way to line 3 and that's
what's<00:06:16.500> a<00:06:16.590> little<00:06:16.740> bit<00:06:16.919> disappointing<00:06:17.490> is

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
what's a little bit disappointing is

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.749 
what's a little bit disappointing is
that<00:06:17.610> I<00:06:17.909> was<00:06:18.389> really<00:06:18.719> looking<00:06:18.900> forward<00:06:19.110> to

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 
that I was really looking forward to

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.189 
that I was really looking forward to
Adobe<00:06:20.759> beefing<00:06:21.120> up<00:06:21.210> the<00:06:21.360> develop<00:06:21.719> module<00:06:21.840> and

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
Adobe beefing up the develop module and

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.019 
Adobe beefing up the develop module and
that<00:06:22.800> hasn't<00:06:23.009> happened<00:06:23.279> yet<00:06:23.520> so<00:06:23.699> hopefully

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029 
that hasn't happened yet so hopefully

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:25.399 
that hasn't happened yet so hopefully
it'll<00:06:24.360> happen<00:06:24.509> with<00:06:24.719> the<00:06:24.779> release<00:06:25.050> version

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
it'll happen with the release version

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.469 
it'll happen with the release version
keeping<00:06:26.219> our<00:06:26.279> hopes<00:06:26.460> up<00:06:26.610> Adobe<00:06:26.969> but<00:06:27.270> we'll

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
keeping our hopes up Adobe but we'll

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.229 
keeping our hopes up Adobe but we'll
we'll<00:06:27.779> see<00:06:27.990> what<00:06:28.139> happens
