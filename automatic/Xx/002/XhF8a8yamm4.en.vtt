00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello how about this time we are going to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.450
 present the latest collection of the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.890
 line 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.490
 of the brand line 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.490
 as you well know before nike mercurial 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.230
 I had many many many many categories in 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.869
 regarding their models of shoes and 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.720
 football boots as it turns out that now 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.939
 there are only three categories in this 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.380
 case let's move on to name one of 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.220
 they are fortunate to have 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.430
 with all the range here present let's start 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.890
 for the highest range that is the model 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.790
 realistic the professional model for 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.790
 players this 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.370
 they are mercurial mercurial 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.880
 steam 99 tacos is that example of what 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.040
 professional 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.060
 As you well know, this model is a 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.910
 material from Medellin fiber soles 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.790
 of glass has tacos mixed tacos de 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.480
 aluminum and acrylic studs on 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.140
 the front tractor part 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.190
 the entire back part of the sole is all 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.040
 she is fiberglass 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.380
 and we also usually emphasize 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.270
 easily if a product is professional 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.140
 or not with the accessories that this one 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.660
 it brings then the steam mercurial model us 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.840
 brings especially not with a field of 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.240
 the axles a set of 12 of 12 studs for 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.300
 able to replace the one key for 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.500
 adjust it and a bag the mercurial that 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.320
 It is also included in this part 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.810
 only in this payment then we have the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.940
 same model but in the fg version that 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.400
 they come to be the models of fixed tacos 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.920
 Well, the features are exactly 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.380
 the same the only difference is that 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.020
 they are therefore not adjusted tacos proves cost 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.760
 children in this case I have focused on 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.690
 three in three different directions 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.909
 being fiberglass 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.939
 the material is still matter 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.490
 very soft and very light but very 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:05.009
 resistant and you're mercurial vapor 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.530
 they only include this bag 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.450
 very well and two months ago 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.180
 approximately in mercury yet 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.910
 had the semi pro model that was the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.920
 mercury model admirable because that model 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.590
 It has stopped being manufactured and it has 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.010
 replaced by the fast model that is 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.470
 this here that are the mercury nike 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.280
 fast and the difference for example from 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.920
 some steam and a faster 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.900
 the sole that is very laughter highlights very 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.980
 fast the difference both the color of 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.280
 the tacos like just say it 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.170
 in a 40% fiberglass sole to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.880
 difference in the difference of water 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.760
 because it's all fiber soles 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.670
 glass then the material of the this 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.800
 micro model 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.530
 of a synthetic material also from 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.470
 ying but let's say less benefits 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.270
 and less and less quality the subject of 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.690
 the template is also very similar 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.650
 which is a template as you can see 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.739
 microperforated 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.739
 this is because the model is micro 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.170
 mercury and in this case also 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.780
 the mercurial have stopped being manufactured 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.400
 like the model let's say it gave me so much 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.950
 in soccer boots as in serradilla 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.960
 and they're only divided into three 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.220
 three lines that are mercurial vapor 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.200
 the mercuria barbers and the most curious 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.930
 good victory for the final victory 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.480
 difference of the mercurial vapor by 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.860
 example is very easy to highlight 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.780
 the difference 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.520
 as long as you are touching a booty 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.190
 so simple the experience then both 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.350
 models are the same but yes that is 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.060
 noteworthy for example the sole the sole 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.640
 of a professional model and model 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.150
 basic as you see they do not have 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.180
 fiberglass technology the 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.550
 plastic dowels and only the tip 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.550
 metallic, however, in the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.850
 Professionals are all aluminum 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.250
 all adjustable studs skin 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.680
 the skin is much more much harder is 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.890
 of a synthetic material then this 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.070
 material is much more resistant but not 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.680
 very flexible at the moment for the time 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.090
 to be able to play 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.610
 there are several presentations in this 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.110
 version in the mercury to the scalpel that 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.850
 they have the tacos 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:38.480
 fg also have payments efe sf example and 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:42.200
 they also have what is the model that 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.830
 it is the most that says that it is usually used 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.810
 both to play in futsal and to 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.480
 play on you'll have synthetic too 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.490
 personal memory 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.190
 with a flag shield name and also 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.930
 the shields of the club 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.930
 Peruvian thank you very much
