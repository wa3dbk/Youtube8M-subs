here they're running a 352 formation
decided<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.559> my<00:00:40.680> stream<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.250> should

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
decided with my stream that we should

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.580 
decided with my stream that we should
try<00:00:41.640> out<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.969> formation<00:00:42.390> apparently<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
try out this formation apparently it's a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.860 
try out this formation apparently it's a
little<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:43.950> attacking<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.480> belgian

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
little more attacking and the belgian

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.889 
little more attacking and the belgian
centre-backs<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.250> good<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.629> doesn't

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
centre-backs are so good that it doesn't

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.180 
centre-backs are so good that it doesn't
matter<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.829> three<00:00:50.010> back

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
matter that you can have three back

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.860 
matter that you can have three back
there<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.940> play<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.300> pretty<00:00:51.629> good

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
there and you can play some pretty good

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.229 
there and you can play some pretty good
defense<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> left<00:00:53.699> side<00:00:53.940> striker

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
defense up here in the left side striker

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.080 
defense up here in the left side striker
position<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.960> picked<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.410> Kevin<00:00:56.070> Morales<00:00:56.579> he

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
position we picked up Kevin Morales he

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.459 
position we picked up Kevin Morales he
has<00:00:57.239> eighty<00:00:57.480> eight<00:00:57.690> paces<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.199> biggest

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
has eighty eight paces the biggest

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
has eighty eight paces the biggest
reason<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.100> decided<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
reason is that I decided to do that and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.270 
reason is that I decided to do that and
he's<00:01:01.020> been<00:01:01.199> nothing<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.500> great<00:01:01.800> he<00:01:01.949> scored

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
he's been nothing but great he scored

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.910 
he's been nothing but great he scored

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
maybe most of them eighty-five percent

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.810 
maybe most of them eighty-five percent
right<00:01:07.500> side<00:01:07.710> striker<00:01:08.010> position<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.670> got

83 defense 85 heading that's what you're
looking<00:03:45.810> for<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.680> was<00:03:46.859> what<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.100> thought

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
looking for this was what I thought

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.400 
looking for this was what I thought
would<00:03:47.519> be<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.700> best<00:03:48.000> keeper<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:49.019> think<00:03:49.319> his

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
would be the best keeper I think his

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.280 
would be the best keeper I think his
name<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.590> about<00:03:49.980> courtois<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.060> he<00:03:51.989> has<00:03:52.079> six

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
name is about courtois and he has six

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.610 
name is about courtois and he has six
foot<00:03:52.470> six<00:03:52.680> he<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.400> young<00:03:53.760> he<00:03:54.389> is<00:03:54.720> quick<00:03:55.410> in

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
foot six he is young he is quick in

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.949 
foot six he is young he is quick in
nifty<00:03:56.069> although<00:03:56.790> sometimes<00:03:57.060> his<00:03:57.480> positioning

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
nifty although sometimes his positioning

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.300 
nifty although sometimes his positioning
is<00:03:58.049> not<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.350> greatest<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:58.980> got<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.220> watch

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
is not the greatest so you got to watch

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.680 
is not the greatest so you got to watch
out<00:03:59.459> for<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.700> sometimes<00:04:00.120> I'd<00:04:00.239> have<00:04:00.359> put<00:04:00.540> in

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
out for that sometimes I'd have put in

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.990 
out for that sometimes I'd have put in
check<00:04:01.590> who<00:04:01.709> wasn't<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> Belgian<00:04:02.340> at<00:04:02.639> that<00:04:02.790> time

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000

I<00:04:03.030> had<00:04:03.329> that<00:04:03.480> keeper<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.900> was<00:04:03.989> like<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.170> gotta

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
I had that keeper and I was like I gotta

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.809 
I had that keeper and I was like I gotta
put<00:04:04.620> him<00:04:04.739> in<00:04:04.859> so<00:04:05.100> they<00:04:05.220> don't<00:04:05.370> score<00:04:05.609> on<00:04:05.700> me

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
put him in so they don't score on me

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.759
