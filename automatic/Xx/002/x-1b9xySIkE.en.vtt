think this is still alive yeah that's

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.840 
think this is still alive yeah that's
pretty<00:00:57.550> cool<00:00:58.470> okay<00:00:59.470> we<00:00:59.770> have<00:00:59.950> what<00:01:00.310> looks<00:01:00.340> like

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
pretty cool okay we have what looks like

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.979 
pretty cool okay we have what looks like
a<00:01:00.880> possible<00:01:01.830> handprint<00:01:02.830> right<00:01:02.950> here<00:01:03.989> with

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
a possible handprint right here with

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.700 
a possible handprint right here with
that<00:01:05.199> looks<00:01:05.500> like<00:01:05.800> two<00:01:06.330> fingertips<00:01:07.470> right<00:01:08.470> in

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
that looks like two fingertips right in

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.440 
that looks like two fingertips right in
there<00:01:08.920> very<00:01:09.160> clear<00:01:09.580> it's<00:01:09.760> not<00:01:09.790> really<00:01:10.180> showing

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
there very clear it's not really showing

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.400 
there very clear it's not really showing
up<00:01:10.600> on<00:01:10.780> video<00:01:10.960> very<00:01:11.440> well<00:01:12.240> right<00:01:13.240> there<00:01:13.600> right

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
up on video very well right there right

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.870 
up on video very well right there right
there

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
there

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.880 
there
possible<00:01:16.630> thumb<00:01:16.930> yeah<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.320> that's<00:01:17.470> gonna<00:01:17.650> put

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
possible thumb yeah and that's gonna put

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.020 
possible thumb yeah and that's gonna put
his<00:01:17.979> hand<00:01:18.250> in<00:01:18.400> there<00:01:18.660> there<00:01:19.660> we<00:01:19.810> go<00:01:19.990> very<00:01:21.030> cool

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
his hand in there there we go very cool

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.999 
his hand in there there we go very cool
and<00:01:22.570> I'm<00:01:22.840> thinking<00:01:23.260> that<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.620> may<00:01:23.770> have<00:01:23.979> been

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
and I'm thinking that it may have been

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.300 
and I'm thinking that it may have been
smeared<00:01:24.580> over<00:01:24.940> here<00:01:25.360> as<00:01:25.630> it<00:01:26.080> pushed<00:01:26.470> itself<00:01:27.009> up

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
smeared over here as it pushed itself up

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:35.300 
smeared over here as it pushed itself up
the<00:01:27.460> hill<00:01:28.740> awesome

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.480 
on top of it this tree that grows from
way<00:06:01.789> down<00:06:02.000> there<00:06:02.330> is<00:06:03.080> bent<00:06:03.470> over<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:04.009> top<00:06:04.280> of

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
way down there is bent over the top of

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.629 
way down there is bent over the top of
it<00:06:04.639> and<00:06:04.820> is<00:06:05.330> folded<00:06:05.840> back<00:06:06.220> into<00:06:07.220> the<00:06:07.340> trees

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
it and is folded back into the trees

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.920 
it and is folded back into the trees
right<00:06:08.300> here<00:06:09.759> isn't<00:06:10.759> that<00:06:11.090> something

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
right here isn't that something

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.589 
right here isn't that something
that<00:06:12.830> is<00:06:13.190> definitely<00:06:13.759> a<00:06:13.909> good<00:06:14.150> wraparound

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
that is definitely a good wraparound

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.909 
that is definitely a good wraparound
right<00:06:15.050> there<00:06:16.479> okay<00:06:17.479> here's<00:06:17.750> another<00:06:17.810> angle<00:06:18.349> of

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
right there okay here's another angle of

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.209 
right there okay here's another angle of
that<00:06:19.190> tree<00:06:19.520> that's<00:06:19.789> bent<00:06:20.440> back<00:06:21.440> around<00:06:21.860> that

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
that tree that's bent back around that

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:27.339 
that tree that's bent back around that
one<00:06:22.659> over<00:06:23.659> here<00:06:23.979> back<00:06:24.979> around<00:06:25.310> these<00:06:26.349> we've

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
one over here back around these we've

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.850 
one over here back around these we've
got<00:06:27.530> that<00:06:27.770> one<00:06:28.449> back<00:06:29.449> here<00:06:29.870> back<00:06:30.289> to<00:06:30.349> these

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
got that one back here back to these

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.450 
got that one back here back to these
trees<00:06:31.280> here<00:06:31.909> I<00:06:32.180> mean<00:06:33.020> literally<00:06:33.500> curled<00:06:34.159> back

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
trees here I mean literally curled back

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.219 
trees here I mean literally curled back
and<00:06:35.080> another<00:06:36.080> broken<00:06:36.590> one<00:06:36.770> right<00:06:36.949> there

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
and another broken one right there

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.930 
and another broken one right there
looks<00:06:39.229> like<00:06:39.440> maybe<00:06:39.710> a<00:06:40.130> stick<00:06:40.490> stuck<00:06:40.639> in<00:06:40.880> the

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
looks like maybe a stick stuck in the

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.200 
looks like maybe a stick stuck in the
ground<00:06:41.150> too

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
ground too

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:51.780 
ground too
you

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790
