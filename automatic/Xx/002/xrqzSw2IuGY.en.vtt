these all are one light setups that are

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.940 
these all are one light setups that are
very<00:00:34.860> simple<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.880> when<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.180> understand

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
very simple but when you understand

these lighting setups efficiently enough

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.920 
these lighting setups efficiently enough
you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.460> start<00:00:41.790> playing<00:00:42.120> around<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:42.600> them

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
you can start playing around with them

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.779 
you can start playing around with them
and<00:00:43.170> come<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.710> new<00:00:43.770> lighting<00:00:44.280> setups

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
and come up with new lighting setups

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.940 
and come up with new lighting setups
that<00:00:44.910> work<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.930> all<00:00:46.379> different

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
situations but these are the three basic

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.100 
situations but these are the three basic
setups<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:50.190> need<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.879> should<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.510> when

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
setups we all need and should know when

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.100 
setups we all need and should know when
shooting<00:00:52.800> studio<00:00:53.670> photos<00:00:54.149> or<00:00:54.420> even<00:00:54.780> outside

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
shooting studio photos or even outside

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.639 
shooting studio photos or even outside
using<00:00:55.920> external<00:00:56.430> flashes<00:00:57.149> or<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.500> with

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
using external flashes or so but with

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.979 
using external flashes or so but with
that<00:00:58.800> said<00:00:58.859> let's<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.640> started<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.840> first

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that said let's get started so the first

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.349 
that said let's get started so the first
lighting<00:01:01.680> setup<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.520> are<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> go

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
lighting setup that we are going to go

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
lighting setup that we are going to go
through<00:01:03.780> today<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.739> Rembrandt<00:01:05.220> lighting

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
through today is the Rembrandt lighting

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.350 
through today is the Rembrandt lighting
so<00:01:06.420> how<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.049> lighting<00:01:07.590> comes<00:01:08.040> about<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.670> we

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
so how this lighting comes about is we

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.340 
so how this lighting comes about is we
position<00:01:10.049> our<00:01:10.200> light<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.310> 45<00:01:11.880> degree<00:01:12.090> angle

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
position our light in a 45 degree angle

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.090 
position our light in a 45 degree angle
from<00:01:13.350> where<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> stand<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.689> in<00:01:15.799> reference<00:01:16.799> to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
from where I stand and in reference to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.240 
from where I stand and in reference to
my<00:01:17.549> nose<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.810> position<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> light<00:01:19.619> 45

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
my nose so we position to light 45

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.130 
my nose so we position to light 45
degrees<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> side<00:01:21.150> either<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> left

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
degrees to the side either to the left

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.080 
degrees to the side either to the left
or<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.189> doesn't<00:01:23.430> matter<00:01:23.700> that's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
or the right that doesn't matter that's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.200 
or the right that doesn't matter that's
up<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.810> yourself<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.670> position

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
up to you yourself and then we position

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.910 
up to you yourself and then we position
the<00:01:27.360> light<00:01:27.540> also<00:01:28.350> 45<00:01:28.890> degrees<00:01:29.369> upwards<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.920> 45

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the light also 45 degrees upwards so 45

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.450 
the light also 45 degrees upwards so 45
degrees<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.490> side<00:01:32.700> 45<00:01:33.420> degrees<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:34.460> that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
degrees to the side 45 degrees up that

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.240 
degrees to the side 45 degrees up that
way<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:36.210> create<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.570> light<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.380> hits<00:01:37.680> our<00:01:37.979> nose

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
way we create a light that hits our nose

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.730 
way we create a light that hits our nose
and<00:01:38.640> when<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> light<00:01:39.750> hits<00:01:40.020> our<00:01:40.229> nose<00:01:40.439> our

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
and when the light hits our nose our

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100 
and when the light hits our nose our
nose<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> shape<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.759> our<00:01:42.000> nose<00:01:42.270> blocks

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
nose and the shape of our nose blocks

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.179 
nose and the shape of our nose blocks
the<00:01:43.350> light<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.000> creates<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.240> triangle-shaped

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
the light and creates a triangle-shaped

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.859 
the light and creates a triangle-shaped
highlight<00:01:47.189> area<00:01:47.700> under<00:01:48.000> shadow<00:01:48.240> side<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> the

position<00:02:09.479> our<00:02:09.599> lights<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.080> front<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.370> our

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
position our lights in front of our

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.820 
position our lights in front of our
subject

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
subject

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.530 
subject
in<00:02:12.890> front<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.610> nose<00:02:13.820> I'm<00:02:14.090> going<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.360> lift

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
in front of the nose I'm going to lift

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.290 
in front of the nose I'm going to lift
this<00:02:14.720> up<00:02:14.900> now<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:15.770> guys<00:02:16.010> can<00:02:16.250> see<00:02:16.520> my<00:02:16.790> face

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
this up now so you guys can see my face

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.720 
this up now so you guys can see my face
a<00:02:17.330> bit<00:02:17.690> better

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
a bit better

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.690 
a bit better
see<00:02:19.730> how<00:02:20.000> high<00:02:20.180> can<00:02:20.390> we<00:02:20.450> take<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:21.700> we

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
see how high can we take this we

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.360 
see how high can we take this we
position<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.450> light<00:02:23.650> we<00:02:24.650> position<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.220> light

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
position the light we position the light

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.170 
position the light we position the light
quite<00:02:25.670> high<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.330> then<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.860> bring<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.400> down<00:02:28.430> on

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
quite high and then we bring it down on

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.950 
quite high and then we bring it down on
our<00:02:29.870> subject<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.730> delight<00:02:32.090> hits<00:02:32.450> our<00:02:32.720> nose

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
our subject so the delight hits our nose

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.290 
our subject so the delight hits our nose
once<00:02:33.410> again<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:33.920> now<00:02:33.950> creates<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.090> shadow

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
once again and now creates a shadow

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.890 
once again and now creates a shadow
underneath<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.920> nose<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.760> we<00:02:38.210> if<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.720> use<00:02:38.870> a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
underneath that nose and we if you use a

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.450 
underneath that nose and we if you use a
bit<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.260> our<00:02:39.380> imagination

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
bit of our imagination

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.240 
bit of our imagination
this<00:02:40.940> shadow<00:02:41.390> underneath<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.230> nose<00:02:42.410> looks<00:02:43.160> a

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
this shadow underneath the nose looks a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.750 
this shadow underneath the nose looks a
bit<00:02:43.370> like<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.850> butterfly<00:02:44.420> because<00:02:44.870> of<00:02:45.080> this

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
bit like a butterfly because of this

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.450 
bit like a butterfly because of this
tree<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.030> circular<00:02:47.900> shapes<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.920> we<00:02:49.070> have<00:02:49.250> in

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
tree so circular shapes that we have in

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.840 
tree so circular shapes that we have in
our<00:02:49.580> nose<00:02:49.820> so<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.930> creates<00:02:51.290> nice<00:02:51.860> very

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
our nose so this creates nice very

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.120 
our nose so this creates nice very
beautiful<00:02:53.080> type<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.260> lighting<00:02:54.500> on<00:02:54.800> our

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
beautiful type of lighting on our

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.420 
beautiful type of lighting on our
subjects<00:02:55.760> face<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.410> also<00:02:57.410> accentuates<00:02:58.130> these

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
subjects face and also accentuates these

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.570 
subjects face and also accentuates these
cheek<00:02:58.850> lines<00:02:59.150> cheekbones<00:02:59.810> around<00:03:00.350> here<00:03:01.010> by

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
cheek lines cheekbones around here by

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.570 
cheek lines cheekbones around here by
creating<00:03:01.880> shadows<00:03:02.480> underneath<00:03:02.930> them<00:03:03.580> then

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
creating shadows underneath them then

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.180 
creating shadows underneath them then
finally<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.780> third<00:03:05.960> lighting<00:03:06.530> setup<00:03:06.860> which

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
finally the third lighting setup which

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.760 
finally the third lighting setup which
is<00:03:07.340> again<00:03:07.640> very<00:03:08.000> easy<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:08.510> simple<00:03:08.900> using<00:03:09.440> just

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
is again very easy and simple using just

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.190 
is again very easy and simple using just
one<00:03:10.010> light<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.550> positioning<00:03:11.450> our<00:03:11.660> light<00:03:11.900> to

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
one light is positioning our light to

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.700 
one light is positioning our light to
the<00:03:12.710> site<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.790> sliding<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.510> called<00:03:14.960> split

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
the site this sliding is called split

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.880 
the site this sliding is called split
lighting<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:16.690> we're<00:03:17.690> going<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.870> position<00:03:18.709> this

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
lighting so we're going to position this

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.770 
lighting so we're going to position this
slide<00:03:19.160> down<00:03:19.610> let's<00:03:20.360> see<00:03:21.760> how<00:03:22.760> low<00:03:23.090> can<00:03:23.360> we<00:03:23.570> put

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
slide down let's see how low can we put

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.210 
slide down let's see how low can we put
this<00:03:24.110> about<00:03:24.739> like<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.190> and<00:03:25.989> now<00:03:26.989> I'm<00:03:27.980> going

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
this about like this and now I'm going

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:42.190 
this about like this and now I'm going
to<00:03:28.280> change<00:03:28.520> the<00:03:28.700> angle<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.360> slide<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.630> bit

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.110 

like<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.770> now<00:03:44.010> we<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.940> light

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
like this so now we have the light

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.450 
like this so now we have the light
coming<00:03:45.570> from<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.870> side<00:03:46.110> now<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:47.070> bit<00:03:47.250> too

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
coming from the side now it's a bit too

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.350 
coming from the side now it's a bit too
low<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.120> should<00:03:48.300> go<00:03:48.480> down<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> bit<00:03:49.020> but<00:03:50.360> by

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
low so I should go down a bit but by

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.600 
low so I should go down a bit but by
positioning<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.260> light<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.710> the<00:03:52.800> side<00:03:53.070> it

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
positioning the light to the side it

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.820 
positioning the light to the side it
lights<00:03:53.940> up<00:03:54.180> only<00:03:54.510> one<00:03:54.840> side<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.320> face<00:03:55.590> and

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
lights up only one side of the face and

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.430 
lights up only one side of the face and
the<00:03:55.980> other<00:03:56.130> side<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.880> face<00:03:57.120> stays<00:03:57.840> dark

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
the other side of the face stays dark

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.950 
the other side of the face stays dark
and<00:03:58.860> this<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.370> called<00:03:59.670> split<00:04:00.330> lighting<00:04:00.660> as<00:04:00.810> you

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
and this is called split lighting as you

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.730 
and this is called split lighting as you
can<00:04:01.110> see<00:04:01.350> in<00:04:01.440> this<00:04:01.590> reference<00:04:02.070> photo<00:04:02.310> here<00:04:03.740> if

can see in this reference photo here if
you<00:04:05.310> want<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.700> get<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.880> bit<00:04:06.090> more<00:04:06.300> details<00:04:06.810> on

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
you want to get a bit more details on

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.270 
you want to get a bit more details on
the<00:04:07.140> other<00:04:07.290> side<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:07.800> face

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
the other side of the face

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.120 
the other side of the face
you<00:04:08.550> can<00:04:08.700> always<00:04:08.910> position<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.870> light<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.380> bit

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
you can always position the light a bit

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.030 
you can always position the light a bit
forward<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:12.630> way<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.900> kind<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.350> feather<00:04:13.710> the

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
forward this way you kind of feather the

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.940 
forward this way you kind of feather the
light<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:15.030> light<00:04:15.210> hits<00:04:15.660> or<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.590> center

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
light and the light hits or the center

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.490 
light and the light hits or the center
of<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.160> light<00:04:17.340> doesn't<00:04:17.640> hit<00:04:17.940> your<00:04:18.720> ear<00:04:19.019> but

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
of the light doesn't hit your ear but

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.700 
of the light doesn't hit your ear but
instead<00:04:19.830> it<00:04:20.040> hits<00:04:20.840> your<00:04:21.840> nose<00:04:22.140> or<00:04:22.410> even

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
instead it hits your nose or even

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.560 
instead it hits your nose or even
doesn't<00:04:23.040> really<00:04:23.190> even<00:04:23.340> hit<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.420> way

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
doesn't really even hit you and that way

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.600 
doesn't really even hit you and that way
the<00:04:24.780> light<00:04:24.960> kind<00:04:25.230> of<00:04:25.380> wraps<00:04:25.710> around<00:04:25.890> your<00:04:26.370> face

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
the light kind of wraps around your face

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.820
