00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.410
 play home between the two 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.610
 the northern lights bremen and hamburg has 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.710
 the fsv mainz 05 in the 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.380
 football league being guest at the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.360
 first fc nuremberg to contest on 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.439
 sunday at 15 o'clock 30 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.930
 we're talking to 05 striker sean parker 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.670
 thomas tuchel has said these days 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.290
 wants to play from the last seven 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.739
 season everything out press what's in it 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.260
 what is still in it for the fsv mainz 05 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.730
 So we have a whole team 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.840
 much that we made everything 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.580
 invest in the last seven 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:53.020
 play and want the best possible 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.760
 achieve everything and give it 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.630
 look what the end of it 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.490
 pops 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.200
 now the table space is six topics 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.010
 currently occupied outstanding history 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.070
 for mainz 05 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.780
 but do you have puma with you on the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.700
 to look at the table and to calculate where 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.770
 you could not stand that way 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.930
 many opportunities and opportunities lie 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.700
 calmly 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.400
 So you look is clear that you on 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.070
 The table looks but especially 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.940
 on us so that we say that we 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.300
 just give the best 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.950
 that would be the rausholen out of us and the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.460
 table if you look at the table 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.670
 you can see that everything is tight so that 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.950
 the bavaria and changes but otherwise 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.390
 Everything is open and you can do it very fast 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.860
 up and also very nice 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.850
 fall down so we want as 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.350
 get the best out of us and we could 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.000
 opponent the first FC Nuremberg is very 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.799
 Heimstark has since september last 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.510
 year no home game lost 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.920
 how do you play a game against such a 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.860
 strong home opponents to know yes about the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.150
 Strengthen the knowledge of the strengths 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.040
 We will do everything in the game 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:02.190
 try to bring in our game 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.320
 to get through there too 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.740
 our strengths will be exploited there 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.410
 but also be prepared for the 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.030
 places of nuremberg 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.810
 you were different later on 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.060
 systems 4 2 3 1 4 4 2 with rhombus 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.620
 flat quad chains you already have 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.510
 different positions played in 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.430
 before that the lace hanging lace as 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.840
 tens in which system and on which 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.840
 position you feel most comfortable 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.959
 I feel most comfortable when I am with you 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.269
 But two things are the deciding factors 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.019
 trainer ultimately what was best 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.030
 Open opponents fit the coach has 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.690
 let's say it's easier 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.459
 to become a Bundesliga player 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.930
 to stay a Bundesliga player 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.910
 you are in this season's bundesliga 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.110
 become a player, how hard is it? 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.250
 to stay in the bundesliga 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.300
 permanently establish 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.980
 yes, of course, he was absolutely right 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.489
 hard to stay pure as one too 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.730
 become 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.819
 You notice this training for training 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.310
 so you have to specialize every one of you 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.799
 training gas must give in everyone 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.540
 training to go to my limits and allowed 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.850
 then you can not let it go 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.260
 quite a short question again 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.060
 andreas ivanschitz the contract for 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.549
 seasonal is not renewed 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.459
 how do you see this personality he is 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.320
 Of course it is a pity that has us 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.019
 I have to be a little shocked 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.350
 say that I have that too yesterday 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.450
 first heard as already television 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.240
 have already seen that on 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.870
 who leaves us 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.380
 Andy is a great guy so we are too 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.730
 we have to conclude on your own 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.680
 tip for sunday the game in nuremberg 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.010
 against mainz of course hope that we 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.110
 but we know that Nuremberg 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.020
 but is strong at home very 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.920
 confident for many then try 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.920
 thanks and much success scarce
