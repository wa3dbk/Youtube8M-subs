 The aim of the lecture was to show the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.149
 difference between writing tests between 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.329

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.930
 I pointed out the importance of 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.039
 objectivity and clarity today a text and 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.070

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.739

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.430
 differential 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.789
 You need to make it your point. 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.880
 strong and there are more and more students 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.250
 They need to train the immediate training 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.310
 is essential because only with training 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.619
 constant and organized that you can 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.360
 to arrive at a grade 10 and that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.100
 such specific criteria 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.030
 candidates should use to make a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.250
 good writing 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.680
 good it is very important that the candidates 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.350
 good you first need to know the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.000
 themes and a style of banking it is necessary that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.869
 the candidates seek the evidence 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 and try to draw a profile of the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.479
 of the bank they are going to is for which they 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.680
 they will give the contest well beyond that 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.520
 they need is to organize the thinking 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.360
 use the resources that grammar 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.159
 behind the clearest objective 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.220
 need to work with short periods 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.890
 can not amend and iso but in the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.290
 others need to use the texts that 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.149
 the bunkers bring as guides 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.020
 those texts that precede the theme 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.950
 need to use them as is inspiration 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.810
 for 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.420
 ideas can not take away the idea 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.369
 I also told you of the importance today 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.319
 unaware of the profile of a 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.800
 Today, for example, there are few 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.890
 benches that claim title a while ago 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.330
 ago people thought that title was 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.769
 mandatory today in public tender 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.170
 hardly used 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.000
 are important details that 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.940
 make an essay essay 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.750
 know and during the lecture how was the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.239
 interaction with the public I am 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.430
 always very happy because students beyond 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.010
 to be a very interesting topic is 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.680
 an issue that raises many questions and 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.620
 students are attending analyzed 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.390
 the themes with me and there already suggested there 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.069
 So I have to start my 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.760
 paragraph has to be so then so 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.349
 already tried to format a text I say 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.470
 always with a conversation of one 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.750
 time you can with these tips you 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.690
 can write a note 10 out of 50 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.220
 minutes you can and teacher is 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.519
 what is the importance of an event like 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.069
 This is what I need to praise. It's not me. It's already the 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.829
 3rd show I attended all snow 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.790
 as a speaker and come to us 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.010
 days I think people like us have 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.780
 that unite and we who are in this 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.030
 public tender environment only we 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.980
 we know our anguish 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.639
 aspirations our desires 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.220
 directed sheet is so far behind is 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.049
 of the best organized events I am 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.209
 very happy to attend and I think 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.209
 more and more is better
