00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
here's the first aquascape with all the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.500 
here's the first aquascape with all the
corals<00:03:34.049> in<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.440> spots<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:35.480> believe<00:03:36.480> that

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
corals in the spots that I believe that

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.850 
corals in the spots that I believe that
they'll<00:03:36.840> stay<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.590> long-term<00:03:39.620> water<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.829> a

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
they'll stay in long-term water is a

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.100 
they'll stay in long-term water is a
little<00:03:41.100> bit<00:03:41.190> cloudy<00:03:41.459> right<00:03:41.730> now<00:03:41.970> but<00:03:42.900> I'm

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
little bit cloudy right now but I'm

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.729 
little bit cloudy right now but I'm
pretty<00:03:43.320> sure<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:45.510> water<00:03:45.810> will<00:03:46.079> clear<00:03:46.530> up

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
pretty sure that the water will clear up

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.650 
pretty sure that the water will clear up
and<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.370> corals<00:03:47.760> will<00:03:47.910> start<00:03:48.180> fully

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
and the corals will start fully

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.430 
and the corals will start fully
extending<00:03:49.350> their<00:03:49.500> polyps<00:03:51.049> nothing<00:03:52.049> seems<00:03:52.290> out

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
extending their polyps nothing seems out

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.470 
extending their polyps nothing seems out
of<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.620> ordinary<00:03:53.060> nothing<00:03:54.060> different<00:03:54.239> than

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
of the ordinary nothing different than

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.720 
of the ordinary nothing different than
