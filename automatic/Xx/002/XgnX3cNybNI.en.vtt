00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.430
 I will teach how to remove a control 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.980
 so they can paint it and so on 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.960
 etcetera etcetera truth that for example 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.230
 is prepared for rapid fire 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.769
 here are several LEDs do not learn to 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.019
 web 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.310
 they will not learn because they are not 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.559
 connected does not have enough power 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.050
 so they all learn but they are from 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:31.899
 ornament to make it look true but good 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.379
 I want to make this video fast 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:38.659
 explain it quickly if you do not understand me 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.570
 something like that and comment ask and I'll 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:43.000
 I will answer ok 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.380
 this 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.280
 Well the first thing is going to be disarm 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.160
 and have screws ok there will be seven 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.310
 three screws on each side and one just 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.130
 in the piles if you can see it here your 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.800
 controls there may be a label the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.510
 remove and there is no fart to remove that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.390
 mother et cetera et cetera 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.180
 now to remove that chingadera from here 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.750
 what I 'm going to do is push from 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.190
 the triggers that they saw with a little hand 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:21.670
 easy for the other and pull this to this one 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.810
 Well now the following to disassemble 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.230
 All this 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.280
 is going to be unplugging the vibrators 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.280
 it's easy 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.020
 they drank 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.390
 carefully and then it will cost a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.620
 little more work 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.620
 good now 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.560
 is going to remove the plate ok all those that 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.200
 they were this hard they did not drop the ball 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.070
 how will they control me? 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.310
 the control 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.790
 this with your fingers and they are going to push the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.790
 levers or how agile 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.690
 a veron 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.800
 now they are going to remove all the buttons 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.980
 all the buttons 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.110
 and the rubber bands with the vibrators so 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.630
 do not miss them for the next thing you're going 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.200
 to remove the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.100
 the directional all this is going to see the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.980
 screws I already remove them already makes 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.160
 they will be removed with a 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.680
 small cross screwdriver and now here 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.020
 in these tabs there will be a 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.040
 little hole out there 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.150
 a screwdriver do not want to put him 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.940
 they were going to be lever ok 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.770
 is already button 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.080
 until the two pieces also put with 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.700
 ok buttons now what are we going to 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.500
 remove will be those of congratulate these 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.680
 ok first the one in back that is more 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.680
 easy 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.220
 we 're going to take this key now 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.060
 there are some people that are going to be 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.040
 harder and another easier to me is 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.480
 difficult to put on and take out the others with 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.459
 be careful, let's pull 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.290
 this is in that it breaks ok also eye 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.780
 when this button comes out that is the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.580
 xbox 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.970
 Check that your outline has come out 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.670
 for example the same came out 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.140
 fucking mother not that out to this one do not 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.800
 they are going to paint that asshole who 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.950
 paint 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.400
 Well, it's already gone, everything is already 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.299
 nothing 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.879
 ok already if you are going to do a drilling or 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.159
 something so be it before you paint it 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.970
 or that you want in the perforations that 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.760
 want and point 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.450
 now since they have their stones like this the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.970
 they're going to put it like that so 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.290
 they are going to paint them with them I recommend that 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.049
 use comex spray paints 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.870
 and prefer for example I chose one that 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.079
 It was as extra chromium to tin 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.060
 see how he looks and says chrome and paints well 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.579
 it is painted gray I thought that to paint with 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.189
 look at this control I thought I was going to 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.519
 to be this way in fact I before 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:20.039
 buy me this chrome control I wanted 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.160
 filming so good films that asshole this 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.800
 painted and my control to make it look 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.150
 yards could not and gray dick or that 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.030
 then paint spray connection the one 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.340
 you like 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.320
 and when at the time of painting ten 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.860
 centimeters away from the can of 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.810
 control and leave not tight like that 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.060
 because it's going to mark all the paint and 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.310
 know everything drained and everything ok ugly ok 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:52.680
 Let her slow if not deliberate grips 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.250
 so shit not so that it remains vergas see 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.699
 as it is, 5 minutes are expected and 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.430
 then they turn this control and they do 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.979
 the same and then check that the 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.110
 contours look good well good well 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.060
 painted or that is not of another color 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.330
 with the color 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.060
 previous though 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.009
 well this is the first part in the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.379
 Second part, I'm going to show you how 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:21.699
 assemble the control and what until the 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.699
 video that thanks
