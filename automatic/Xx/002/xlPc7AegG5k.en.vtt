00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 a new victory does not advance as already 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.379
 you came out that if you add a lot to the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.990
 team confidence so glad 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.750
 then not personally 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.799
 time that feels a bit given after 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.560
 this reason that I am going to change and the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.470
 true that very well because so drowned 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.140
 because there where I do not do the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.789
 warm up and I at the time of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.920
 change the pending air if all the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.160
 team did not give a better version on 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.720
 second time if I believe that if we do 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.480
 time we can handle more the ball and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.149
 we had to treat badly better with in the air 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.760
 how did you see the whole team whom I 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.450
 I think we're fine, we're holding on 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.210
 trust out there 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.030
 we are better is what is the team and 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.330
 the truth is that when you see it better 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.620
 the operation from back to forward 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.930
 I believe that while solid defense 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.410
 I think it is recovering the Bard 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.660
 an injury so expecting that too 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.760
 that is crazy but fast well everything 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.520
 think that you can give the party and 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.430
 before mouth by cup the truth that never 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.430
 it was against the mouth I do not know how and how 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.800
 not so so not 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.350
 busy and worried but I'm with 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.420
 hurricane and I think we're going to be the same 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.460
 however, it has a plus everything 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.660
 that is happening in the mouth this of the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.120
 life of an idol as big as 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.550
 Ricely, you come on the rise as 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.320
 we said keeping at the base with nothing 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.050
 I think that's the problem with that 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.390
 when we set this we play 11 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.400
 against 11 and I think it's better this one goes 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.990
 to win is going to be more of a match 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.820
 inside is very well shaped that is 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.470
 mocking the national b and as for the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.409
 format of the tournament as I think it's going to 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.719
 affect this change 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.719
 this less computers in less time 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.049
 what sense to affect us for example this 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.909
 of the teams to face also in 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.770
 less time this is that I do not know anything else 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.250
 that's why you should not let that you can 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.250
 the teams 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.530
 lower we have to play is of 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.760
 more hierarchy and that I think I have 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.760
 to take advantage of the first game to 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.950
 for the network of that streak of not to lose 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.800
 if it is what kudelka is marking the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.530
 time to play stop to improve or 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.040
 to stay the same will not always have 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.049
 I think the ball is part of it 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.180
 the team game a lot of good foot play 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.219
 and the truth is that we have that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.319
 take advantage when it comes to having silver 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.390
 do not miss the quick how you feel 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.219
 with the players who came see you 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.250
 with Augustine torassa that together with you 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.810
 with duck they make very good attacks very 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.159
 good combinations is also said I 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.870
 I think we are final in the 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:40.489
 counterattack we can do a lot of damage 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.170
 still very fast he knows he has a lot with 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.180
 the ball and you have to take advantage of it because 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.180
 explaining thank you very much
