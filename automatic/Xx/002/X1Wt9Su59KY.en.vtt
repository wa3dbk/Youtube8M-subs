00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 a few hours ago in new york 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.410
 made a new president of Iran Hassan 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.600

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.710
 This session of the UN General Assembly and many 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.840
 Were ready to announce in advance 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.320

 leaders 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.360
 Iran and the United States but the sensation did not work 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.760
 ruhani from talking with obama dodged 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.960
 however made clear and from tehran now 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.970
 the wind of change is blowing 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.800
 so new Iranian leader difference from 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.740
 its predecessor Ahmadinejad 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.420
 acknowledged the fact of the holocaust arrival of the vorukh they 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.580
 nearly eclipsed the main theme form 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.560
 Syrian crisis though on this issue 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.090
 negotiations have already begun on a broad 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.340
 discussions in new york alexey 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.780

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.579
 meeting of the head of the Russian mida Sergey 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.290
 Lavrova and US Secretary of State John Kerry 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.969
 on strength and lasted two hours 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.860
 interlocutors left the meeting room 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.079
 the rooms are clearly satisfied but from deployed 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.940
 comments to journalists refused judging 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.980
 throughout until they are ready to announce that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.800
 all roughness of the syrian project 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.210
 resolutions overcame we held very 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.879
 constructive negotiations 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.379
 very constructive us some 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.420
 Western countries insist on turning 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.579
 in the text of the resolution on syria paragraph 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 use of force if that fails 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.570
 chemical weapons agreement 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.490
 Russia is categorically against it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.409
 so we decided to work on the text 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.479
 continue but judging by the words of Russian 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.479
 minister understanding how to move on 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.220
 there are in both countries we are stressed with 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.350
 Russian American side what is it 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.210
 should go about eliminating everything 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.299
 chemical weapons that are in Syria 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.119
 because there are serious concerns 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.869
 evidence that in opposition 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.450
 there may be separate components of these 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.549

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.290
 the theme of which she is this little assembly 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.329

 projections for improving relations with Iran 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.500
 it was even said what could happen 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.210
