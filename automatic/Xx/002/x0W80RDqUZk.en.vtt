00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.370 

and<00:01:04.990> then<00:01:05.230> this<00:01:05.500> is<00:01:05.650> where<00:01:05.800> you<00:01:05.980> do<00:01:06.160> that<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
and then this is where you do that and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.550 
and then this is where you do that and
it's<00:01:10.770> 799<00:01:11.770> on<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.190> D<00:01:12.460> string<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:13.480> then<00:01:14.110> turn

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
it's 799 on the D string and then turn

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.730 
it's 799 on the D string and then turn
on<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.280> string<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:16.270> then<00:01:16.750> I<00:01:17.080> guess<00:01:17.710> a

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
on the a string and then I guess a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:29.600 
on the a string and then I guess a
hammer<00:01:18.160> on<00:01:18.370> of<00:01:18.520> 9<00:01:18.760> and<00:01:18.940> 10<00:01:19.120> on<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:20.310> shinobi

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.730 

then<00:01:30.610> it's<00:01:31.049> seven<00:01:32.049> on<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.920> E<00:01:33.159> string<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.740> then

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
then it's seven on the E string and then

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.550 
then it's seven on the E string and then
you<00:01:36.340> just<00:01:36.610> play<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.390> power<00:01:37.570> cord<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:37.960> eight<00:01:38.140> to

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
you just play the power cord of eight to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.350 
you just play the power cord of eight to
seven<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.240> eight<00:01:43.570> on<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.900> E<00:01:43.930> string<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.850> then

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
seven and eight on the E string and then

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.010 
seven and eight on the E string and then
you<00:01:46.509> do<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.659> power<00:01:46.930> cord<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.259> six<00:01:47.560> on<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.399> east

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
you do a power cord of six on the east

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.650 
you do a power cord of six on the east
86<00:01:50.020> on<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.259> string<00:01:50.700> 27<00:01:51.700> on<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.850> E<00:01:51.970> string

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:07.010 

so<00:01:57.660> although<00:01:58.350> first<00:01:58.800> they'll<00:01:59.070> be

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.710
