okay<00:00:08.630> the<00:00:08.750> other<00:00:08.809> thing<00:00:09.080> I<00:00:09.170> wanted<00:00:09.410> to<00:00:09.469> talk

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.680 
okay the other thing I wanted to talk

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.369 
okay the other thing I wanted to talk
about<00:00:09.889> today<00:00:10.309> was<00:00:10.610> the<00:00:11.389> hybrid<00:00:11.750> Pekin<00:00:12.080> and<00:00:12.170> how

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:12.379 
about today was the hybrid Pekin and how

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.110 
about today was the hybrid Pekin and how
it<00:00:12.590> plays<00:00:13.190> a<00:00:13.219> role<00:00:13.340> within<00:00:13.700> my<00:00:13.820> legato

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
it plays a role within my legato

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.099 
it plays a role within my legato
technique<00:00:15.160> in<00:00:16.160> answer<00:00:16.940> to<00:00:17.090> that<00:00:17.270> I<00:00:17.480> do<00:00:17.930> a

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
technique in answer to that I do a

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.260 
technique in answer to that I do a
little<00:00:18.830> bit<00:00:18.920> of<00:00:19.010> hybrid<00:00:19.340> picking<00:00:19.490> I<00:00:19.820> wouldn't

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
little bit of hybrid picking I wouldn't

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.830 
little bit of hybrid picking I wouldn't
say<00:00:20.420> it<00:00:20.480> takes<00:00:20.660> pole<00:00:20.960> position<00:00:21.470> I<00:00:22.279> do<00:00:23.090> use<00:00:23.600> it

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
say it takes pole position I do use it

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.520 
say it takes pole position I do use it
more<00:00:24.770> for<00:00:24.800> when<00:00:25.340> I'm<00:00:25.460> sort<00:00:25.610> of<00:00:25.700> playing<00:00:26.530> you

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
more for when I'm sort of playing you

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.890 
more for when I'm sort of playing you
know<00:00:27.620> bunch<00:00:27.860> of<00:00:28.010> sixes<00:00:28.460> or<00:00:28.780> you<00:00:29.780> know<00:00:29.869> just

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
know bunch of sixes or you know just

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.319 
know bunch of sixes or you know just
string<00:00:30.590> skipping<00:00:30.770> in<00:00:31.010> general

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
string skipping in general

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.510 
string skipping in general
I'll<00:00:32.899> never<00:00:33.350> sort<00:00:33.649> of<00:00:33.710> tend<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:33.980> use<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.370> in

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
I'll never sort of tend to use it in

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.430 
I'll never sort of tend to use it in
quicker<00:00:34.879> legato<00:00:35.270> lines<00:00:35.449> especially<00:00:36.260> within

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
quicker legato lines especially within

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.880 
quicker legato lines especially within
my<00:00:36.620> legato<00:00:36.920> playing<00:00:37.870> I<00:00:38.870> always<00:00:39.409> tend<00:00:39.649> to<00:00:39.769> sort

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
my legato playing I always tend to sort

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.889 
my legato playing I always tend to sort
of<00:00:40.010> hammer<00:00:40.190> things<00:00:40.519> on<00:00:40.699> you<00:00:41.269> know<00:00:41.390> with<00:00:41.749> my

of hammer things on you know with my

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:42.579 
of hammer things on you know with my
left<00:00:42.079> hand

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
left hand

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:43.689 
left hand
you<00:00:42.679> know<00:00:42.800> without<00:00:43.100> using<00:00:43.399> my<00:00:43.519> route

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
you know without using my route

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.040 
you know without using my route
right-handed<00:00:44.300> or<00:00:44.390> especially<00:00:44.600> when<00:00:44.809> it<00:00:44.899> comes

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
right-handed or especially when it comes

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.169 
right-handed or especially when it comes
to<00:00:45.109> sort<00:00:45.319> of<00:00:45.379> string<00:00:45.559> skimming<00:00:45.859> as<00:00:45.979> well<00:00:46.179> you

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
to sort of string skimming as well you

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.469 
to sort of string skimming as well you
know<00:00:47.269> force<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.629> do<00:00:47.749> something<00:00:48.019> like<00:00:48.079> that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
know force to do something like that

00:00:49.479 --> 00:01:06.190 
know force to do something like that
I'll<00:00:50.479> just<00:00:50.659> have<00:00:50.809> everything

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.539 

as<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.440> see<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.040> hand<00:01:08.220> hardly

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
as you can see the right hand hardly

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.719 
as you can see the right hand hardly
does<00:01:08.700> anything<00:01:10.009> you<00:01:11.009> know<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> other<00:01:11.580> thing

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
does anything you know the other thing

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.940 
does anything you know the other thing
that<00:01:11.850> contributes<00:01:12.149> to<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:13.290> legato<00:01:13.619> technique

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that contributes to the legato technique

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.370 
that contributes to the legato technique
is<00:01:14.399> you<00:01:14.610> know<00:01:14.700> how<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.149> toss<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.659> now

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
is you know how you can toss it up now

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840 
is you know how you can toss it up now
so<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> allows<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.190> do<00:01:17.340> these<00:01:17.520> type<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
so it allows you to do these type of

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.980 
so it allows you to do these type of
things

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
things

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.080 
things
you<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.770> my<00:01:20.039> guitars<00:01:20.430> are<00:01:20.610> always<00:01:20.820> set<00:01:21.060> up

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
you know my guitars are always set up

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.420 
you know my guitars are always set up
you<00:01:21.690> know<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> forward<00:01:22.440> reaction<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.340> I'm

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you know with a forward reaction so I'm

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.649 
you know with a forward reaction so I'm
assuming<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:23.880> four<00:01:24.180> millimeters<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
assuming that's four millimeters and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.450 
assuming that's four millimeters and
three<00:01:24.899> millimeters<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.530> four<00:01:25.830> millimeters<00:01:26.340> on

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
three millimeters so four millimeters on

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.880 
three millimeters so four millimeters on
the<00:01:26.880> bottom<00:01:27.119> string<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.140> top<00:01:28.409> high<00:01:28.619> E

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the bottom string and and the top high E

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.180 
the bottom string and and the top high E
string<00:01:29.210> three<00:01:30.210> millimeters<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.039> does

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
string three millimeters and it does

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.130 
string three millimeters and it does
allow<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.670> sort<00:01:32.940> of<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.929> whole

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
allow you to sort of do that that whole

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.859 
allow you to sort of do that that whole
technique<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.240> horse<00:01:36.450> sound

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
technique you know your horse sound

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.380 
technique you know your horse sound
contributes<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.069> I<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.819> can<00:01:39.030> jump<00:01:39.240> on

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
contributes you know I can I can jump on

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.120 
contributes you know I can I can jump on
other<00:01:39.630> rigs<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.170> stuff<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.679> and<00:01:40.890> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
other rigs and stuff like that and you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.309 
other rigs and stuff like that and you
know<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:42.300> it<00:01:42.450> doesn't<00:01:42.630> sort<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.929> feel<00:01:43.110> right

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
know if it doesn't sort of feel right

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.749 
know if it doesn't sort of feel right
under<00:01:43.500> my<00:01:43.619> fingers<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.069> know<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.190> struggle

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
under my fingers you know I struggle

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.330 
under my fingers you know I struggle
with<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:44.970> technique<00:01:45.710> because<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.950> know<00:01:47.069> if

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
with the technique because you know if

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.230 
with the technique because you know if
it's<00:01:47.520> too<00:01:47.729> Gainey

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it's too Gainey

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.289 
it's too Gainey
if<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:49.470> enough<00:01:49.799> going<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.880> tend

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
if it's not enough going you know I tend

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.380 
if it's not enough going you know I tend
to<00:01:51.390> sort<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.920> not<00:01:52.920> play<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.490> whale<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.299> know

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
to sort of not play the whale you know

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.059 
to sort of not play the whale you know
approach<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.319> you<00:01:55.649> know<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> whole

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
approach it and then you know the whole

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.830 
approach it and then you know the whole
style<00:01:56.429> some<00:01:56.700> goes<00:01:56.880> out<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> window<00:01:57.179> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
style some goes out the window so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.560 
style some goes out the window so
something<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.170> keep<00:01:58.289> in<00:01:58.440> mind<00:01:58.470> where<00:01:59.450> you<00:02:00.450> know

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
something to keep in mind where you know

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.270 
something to keep in mind where you know
sort<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.259> work<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.530> your<00:02:01.680> sound<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.100> sort<00:02:02.250> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
sort of work on your sound that sort of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.660 
sort of work on your sound that sort of
works<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:03.390> know<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.539> your<00:02:03.810> approach<00:02:04.579> you<00:02:05.579> know

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
works you know to your approach you know

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.340

I've<00:02:05.850> been<00:02:05.880> using<00:02:06.270> these<00:02:06.539> guitars<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.289> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
I've been using these guitars and the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.410 
I've been using these guitars and the
Bondurant<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.340> fires<00:02:08.519> you<00:02:08.700> know<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:09.000> pretty

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
Bondurant for fires you know for pretty

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.360 
Bondurant for fires you know for pretty
much<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.690> last<00:02:09.810> eight<00:02:10.049> years<00:02:10.079> and<00:02:10.560> I've

much the last eight years and I've

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.170 
much the last eight years and I've
developed<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.840> know<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.989> style<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.910> works

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
developed you know a style that works

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.810 
developed you know a style that works
with<00:02:15.420> these<00:02:15.570> sounds<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.769> always<00:02:17.010> sort<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.489> I

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
with these sounds so it always sort of I

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.270 
with these sounds so it always sort of I
sort<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.630> built<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.049> whole<00:02:19.260> technique<00:02:19.680> you

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
sort of built this whole technique you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.550 
sort of built this whole technique you
know<00:02:20.400> within<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.150> three<00:02:22.079> things<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.410> know

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.970 
know within the three things you know
the<00:02:22.709> amplifier<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.329> guitar<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.620> that's

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the amplifier and the guitar and that's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.770 
the amplifier and the guitar and that's
what<00:02:26.220> sort<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.489> helped<00:02:26.820> me<00:02:26.910> sort<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.329> create
