00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:08.870
 honda cr-z small car coupÃ© hybrid 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.330
 Saver and parquet 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.530
 the short japanese wants a lot 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.390
 for his short four meters outside length 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.730
 sports car front and dumb lay above all 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.930
 reminds cr-z of his legendary 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.689
 ancestor the honda crx under the tin 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.689
 put a 1.5 liter four-cylinder sucker 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.949
 and an electric motor with 78 newton meters 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.699
 torque 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.909
 the result 137 ps at 5 liters 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:43.120
 consumption topspeed smooth 200 km h 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:43.120
 the basic price is about 22,700 euros 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.750
 honda cr-z the car belongs to one 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.990
 dying species namely the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.910
 genus of forest hybrid that are hybrid 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.920
 the systems are not independent 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.780
 can approach electrically but where 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.560
 the electric motor the internal combustion engine 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.410
 supports a worthwhile stir 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.690
 From 0 to 100, it goes smooth 9 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.680
 seconds 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.040
 the cr-z has 137 ps as system performance 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.390
 if you look at that now 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.750
 internal combustion engine itself 121 ps 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.010
 makes that the electric motor 20 hp 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.040
 then it should actually do that 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.280
 adds more hybrid system can one 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.830
 actually just add the power 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.680
 the system performance of the honda cr z with 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.600
 137 ps below the maximum power of the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.150
 electric motor of the internal combustion engine 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.520
 that has a simple reason you can 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.140
 in a hybrid system not assume 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.000
 go out that the electric motor in the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.950
 internal combustion engine at the same 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.600
 Their maximum performances are theirs 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.520
 give up power and that's what they are 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.549
 do not just add 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 yet swift and economical yet reveals the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.229
 cr-z also weakens 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.799
 the 1.5 liter engine throws itself yes 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.210
 tidy and tries so too 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.100
 but a bit to pack around 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.770
 that is not really great sound and 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.840
 that is a pity because you are sitting here 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.500
 over the winding country roads 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.970
 flitz then the car is already fun 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:21.080
 nice and deep you can clean nice proportion 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.630
 steering collected speak directly hybrid 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.140
 and sport fun and save money 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.760
 difficult balancing act 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.069
 the consumption of the cr-z is with honda 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.530
 five liters per 100 kilometers 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.880
 also a very optimistic eu worth in 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.220
 the practice it is quite possible 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.030
 to drive the car with six liters the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.680
 Honda CR -Z as a guide small easy 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:51.010
 crisp 137 ps are enough on the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.010
 fun to turn gala into the red area
