charm the fury we wanted to make
something<00:00:44.080> that<00:00:44.440> would<00:00:45.430> set<00:00:46.150> us<00:00:46.300> apart<00:00:46.420> as<00:00:46.870> a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
something that would set us apart as a

something that would set us apart as a
bad<00:00:47.200> but<00:00:47.739> also<00:00:47.950> would<00:00:48.460> give<00:00:49.270> us<00:00:49.420> the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.619 
bad but also would give us the
opportunity<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:50.230> get<00:00:51.160> somewhere<00:00:51.640> I<00:00:51.850> hope<00:00:52.239> that

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
opportunity to get somewhere I hope that

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.350

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.319 

the<00:01:09.249> writing<00:01:09.520> process<00:01:09.670> was<00:01:09.850> really<00:01:10.119> different

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
the writing process was really different

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:11.969 
the writing process was really different
from<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.780> EP<00:01:11.020> because<00:01:11.439> there<00:01:11.710> was<00:01:11.829> no

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
from the EP because there was no

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.130 
from the EP because there was no
pressure<00:01:12.249> at<00:01:12.609> that<00:01:13.149> moment<00:01:13.509> you<00:01:13.749> know<00:01:13.840> we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
pressure at that moment you know we

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.559 
pressure at that moment you know we
could<00:01:14.289> do<00:01:14.409> whatever<00:01:14.619> we<00:01:14.799> wanted<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.819> now<00:01:16.509> we

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:16.569 
could do whatever we wanted and now we

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:18.529 
could do whatever we wanted and now we
have<00:01:16.899> any<00:01:17.289> PD<00:01:17.530> out<00:01:17.649> people<00:01:18.069> have<00:01:18.159> expectations

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
have any PD out people have expectations

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.059 
have any PD out people have expectations
they<00:01:19.539> want<00:01:19.719> an<00:01:19.810> album<00:01:20.140> as<00:01:20.259> soon<00:01:20.409> as<00:01:20.530> possible

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
they want an album as soon as possible

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.010 
they want an album as soon as possible
so<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:21.939> know<00:01:22.090> there<00:01:22.270> was<00:01:22.390> there<00:01:22.659> was<00:01:22.719> pressure

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
so you know there was there was pressure

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.770 
so you know there was there was pressure
on<00:01:23.289> us<00:01:23.459> so<00:01:24.459> that<00:01:24.670> was<00:01:24.789> different<00:01:25.060> but<00:01:25.600> I<00:01:25.659> think

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
on us so that was different but I think

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.529 
on us so that was different but I think
it<00:01:26.140> helped<00:01:27.039> us<00:01:27.159> because<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.819> made<00:01:28.299> us<00:01:28.420> more

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
it helped us because it made us more

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:44.100 
it helped us because it made us more
