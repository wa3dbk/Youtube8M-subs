00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 blunt gore and superheroes welcome 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.660
 to discuss animal and band 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.660
 once hunting was printed here 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.170
 buddy becker is mmn a superhero no 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.720
 as high profile holds as superman or 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.040
 batman but a superhero oh well 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.170
 Mainly was always 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.000
 activist is committed to animals and 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.960
 nature and he is not meat 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.970
 buddy becker is a hero with 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.200
 supernatural forces when needed can 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.360
 he himself the characteristics and 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.530
 skills of animals 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.570
 For example, he can fly like a bird 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.970
 bird or the power of a rhino 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.710
 borrow or wonder in the last 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.600
 time rather on his career than 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.570
 has somehow concentrated actor 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.180
 Nmmn is a part of him, even if that 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.570
 his wife not at all 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.160
 is 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.050
 The world needs a moment now 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.640
 actually more than ever before but 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.440
 even the maxim seems to be his 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.600
 to have inherited supernatural powers 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.570
 and she surpasses the talents of her 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.030
 Father still many times 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.369
 this in turn calls the celebration on the plan 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.649
 the month was the one behind maxim 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.690
 are and actually all live easy 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.759
 only want to destroy the world needs 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.549
 a hero who can handle it 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.040
 animal you have to completely new tasks 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.450
 do not actually know that 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.210
 really if what he believed so far 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.830
 really is still true nmmn heard 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.280
 at the moment my absolute favorite 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.750
 series what concerns the fdp and no matter what 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.330
 one now total of the reboot 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.700
 I like to think I just find the series 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.680
 just how the nmmn actually rather and 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.420
 belong to the vertigo label and therefore also 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.280
 previously took place the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.869
 Attention bonus you through the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.030
 reboot have absolutely earned 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.610
 because that's just great stuff and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.180
 yes, now more people you know the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.520
 figurine nmmn was created in 1965 by dave roth and 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.189
 carmine infantino created and so in 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.340
 the 90s then last by grant 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.500
 morrison coined as author but afterwards 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.390
 the figure is just in the first 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.150
 background moved and now it is 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.860
 again my main argument is 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.720
 actually the whole structure of 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.390
 characters and then the material 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.920
 he will put together a story 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.959
 it already has this frame story 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.150
 rocky it is a super bright 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.319
 So history has to be somehow the world 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.689
 be saved but clear 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.439
 is so much more than that 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.090
 maybe nice if you just go 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.879
 Look at the figures you have live 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.590
 then buddy becker just like us 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.469
 have found activists 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.969
 So the past has started 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.189
 even if he is not always superhero 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.349
 costume is the conviction that has 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.930
 also a bit more special and 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.889
 are more sophisticated and he just has one 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.629
 family 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.340
 and you probably know that already from 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.769
 a few flash comics or even from the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.950
 Batman comics that way stories 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.859
 is just more going on than just the hero 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.090
 and his vocation but how is that 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.669
 even if several people in a room 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.230
 stands you picks on there are so 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.329
 very specific tensions in the air 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.010
 and we have just one family 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.709
 a superhero really has a family 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.810
 a woman who is not quite like 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.310
 what else could he do with her 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.379
 Two months later, two children would still be injured 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.109
 you just have maxim and your older one 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.209
 brother cliff and everyone in this family 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.500
 has to somehow with this situation 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.409
 to get along now 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.909
 through the history of nmmn has just 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.799
 maxim actually a little girl who 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:30.209
 actually only one pet wanted and 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:33.000
 suddenly see this in an almost even 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.009
 a gandalf situation so yes she has 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.139
 just know a lot more and much more 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:38.729
 and of course that is for the 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.079
 father again not so easy the 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.680
 actually only protect his daughter 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.259
 want 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.389
 but yes to a danger 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:47.639
 sees the completely new dimension for him 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:50.250
 is also what concerns their spitefulness 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:53.040
 and to your your finality if you 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.329
 wins in the end that's just 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.680
 such a small outlook what was there 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.989
 actually everything is we have this 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.370
 wonderful family dynamics and it is 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.720
 a bit then takes to the orphan 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.150
 adventure shapes 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.069
 yes and there is just more happening 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.719
 more and I just loved that 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.219
 I would not have expected that because I like 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.620
 many accept if not at all 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:15.380
 the screen had where we are right now 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.549
 even with meat was mountains 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.289
 Engelmann is not really for you 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.109
 delicately literate reader so i would 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.090
 maybe not a power reading 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.620
 Girl pushing a lot of her hand 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.020
 The title is really one of those 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.510
 bit in the even and leaf column 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.640
 he 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.200
 it's just I think it's drawing 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.090
 is it crazy because you just notice 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.020
 that reform is going crazy with the 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.510
 anatomy of the human body 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.750
 conflict then go in all 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.570
 to arrange artistic skills so 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.310
 inside out and also somewhere you park 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.200
 another eye and then that's it 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.610
 a lot of meat and crave and 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.020
 Bone and that is not always 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.040
 appetizing and besides, we still have 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.930
 then decay and turn off the comic 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.850
 I was just then so read 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.060
 positively surprised and so enthusiastic 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.290
 about the abundance of substances on the 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.570
 Approach those in the comic 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.670
 inflowing worldviews old 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.840
 myths is very much with life tree and 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.990
 what holds the world together in the innermost 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.670
 to do 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.610
 then just these whole families 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.870
 the drawings are dynamic as well 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.870
 not even that says okay there is 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.280
 graphic drawings are also available 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.960
 maybe even more elaborate 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.970
 colourations but it just has 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.300
 It was just this one 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.040
 mood and as reader the feeling i 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.170
 have that done and that is 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.780
 thoughtful and I really think so 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.760
 good in my personal neff the door 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.880
 ranking is now ending 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.100
 place two there were a few smears 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.970
 because then a crossover with 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:49.030
 announced the swamp thing and that has 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.490
 with me so I have basically nothing 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.380
 against crossover but in the moment has 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.120
 it annoyed me i read the band and 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.070
 then basically I 've already caught it 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.080
 not read yet and i will do it then 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.090
 probably do it once to the 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.710
 crossover should actually come 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.360
 if you have already read it, let us 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.220
 So what's your swamp thing ? 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.170
 give me my tip should I pick myself yes 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.180
 times and when I'm at it to you 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.470
 Tell a man that's up to date 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.430
 then number two he wanted 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.410
 maybe also know what mine 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.090
 current number one is that's the one 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.070
 already this is a series that 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.570
 actually and the vertigo label belongs 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.310
 but now by us for the tour 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.110
 Once again the chance has become one 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.720
 to present a wider audience and 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.720
 completely cope because the series is 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.220
 just awesome why why 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.960
 then explain yourself in one again 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.270
 separate video if the German 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.250
 release date is unfortunately available 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.449
 no real date for it yet 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.860
 but keep it there 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.659
 we want to press this title in 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.330
 Germany have returned to a moment 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:48.669
 the first band hunting costs 16 euro 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.279
 95 in germany contains the first 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:54.039
 Six stitches and is available at 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:55.270
 fannie and my recommendation is looking 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.370
 this will definitely be linked to us 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.509
 the publishing side down in the box there 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.430
 there is still a reading sample 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:02.620
 because you could just look in and 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.110
 WISAG buy my recommendation 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.490
 that was my revier to take if you were the one 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.779
 read tape already then let us 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.099
 in the comments you know how you are 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:12.960
 has fallen until then 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:12.960
 we'll see you will be blocked now
