00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
stay there for long periods of time so

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.979 
stay there for long periods of time so
he's<00:00:27.079> gone<00:00:27.649> a<00:00:27.710> lot<00:00:28.419> yeah<00:00:29.419> I<00:00:29.480> miss<00:00:29.750> some<00:00:29.869> when

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:29.989 
he's gone a lot yeah I miss some when

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.100 
he's gone a lot yeah I miss some when
he's<00:00:30.079> gone<00:00:30.259> I<00:00:31.390> think<00:00:32.390> if<00:00:32.509> we<00:00:32.660> could<00:00:32.840> write<00:00:33.079> a

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
he's gone I think if we could write a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.410 
he's gone I think if we could write a
really<00:00:33.920> big<00:00:34.190> message<00:00:34.610> he<00:00:34.880> would<00:00:34.970> be<00:00:35.030> able<00:00:35.120> to

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
really big message he would be able to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.970 
really big message he would be able to
see<00:00:36.170> it<00:00:36.290> from<00:00:36.470> space<00:00:36.820> he<00:00:38.020> would<00:00:39.020> probably<00:00:39.740> just

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
see it from space he would probably just

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.380 
see it from space he would probably just
grab<00:00:40.250> his<00:00:40.400> camera<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:40.790> take<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.000> picture

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
grab his camera and take a picture

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.890 
grab his camera and take a picture
because<00:00:41.510> he<00:00:41.930> loves<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:42.680> take<00:00:42.830> pictures<00:00:43.900> he

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
because he loves to take pictures he

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.870 
because he loves to take pictures he
would<00:00:45.020> be<00:00:45.170> totally<00:00:45.740> caught<00:00:46.160> off<00:00:46.340> guard<00:00:46.370> if<00:00:46.760> he

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
would be totally caught off guard if he

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.170 
would be totally caught off guard if he
saw<00:00:47.060> a<00:00:47.090> message<00:00:47.330> and<00:00:48.040> it<00:00:49.040> might<00:00:49.190> make<00:00:49.310> him<00:00:49.490> miss

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180
