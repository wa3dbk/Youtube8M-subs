00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.689
 hello people welcome once again good 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.149
 for all of us today we are going to be teaching 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.670
 make a very simple rocket but 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.230
 pretty effective for this we're going to 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.019
 be needing two bottles of 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.720
 plastic we're going to use a cork that 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.949
 we are going to use to cover the bottle 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.949
 paper napkin or toilet paper 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.710
 they can use either of the two 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.960
 we are going to need a little thread 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.929
 tape to paste some tools 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.939
 like scissors cutter cardboard markers 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.820
 with which we are going to give you a bit of 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.550
 way to our rocket and what is going to 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.900
 generate the propulsion of our rocket 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.480
 it's going to be vinegar and baking 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.880
 sodium 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.410
 let's start with the tip of our 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.690
 rocket for this let's take one of 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.809
 the cards we are going to cut a 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.210
 circle and this one we are going to cut by the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.070
 medium but only halfway now 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.110
 we're going to have to create a cone of 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.940
 size of the base of the bottle this 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.250
 way 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.739
 Once the cone is made, we will paste it 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.290
 with tape so that it does not disarm and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.659
 then we 're going to stick it to the base of the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.820
 bottle to make the ailerons we are going to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.430
 cut two rectangles of 10 centimeters 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 by 20 centimeters and now we're going to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.210
 cut diagonally leaving 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.759
 approximately one centimeter of each 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.070
 side let's make 3 cuts as for 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.530
 to be able to incorporate our ailerons to the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.960
 bottle and now let's talk one to 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.650
 each side first for here 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.650
 yes 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.740
 now with a bit of tape we are going to paste 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.229
 the ailerons to the sides of the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.220
 bottle in this way which we have 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.220
 that take shape 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.450
 that's how our rocket would be giving us 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.490
 finished but in this way I do not know 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.369
 holds so now what are we going to 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.780
 Arming is the launch pad for 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.509
 our rocket and for that we're going to use 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.420
 the other bottle to do this we're going 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.340
 to do is measure the height of the bottle 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.679
 how far are the ailerons can 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.800
 be a little further down then we're going to 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.780
 cut the bottle 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.720
 and we have to make sure that the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.780
 cork is touching the base of the other 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.330
 bottle in this way what would be the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.430
 rocket is already finished we have the base 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.890
 of launch we have the rocket but 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.600
 now it would be missing the propulsion of 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.160
 our rocket and for that we can use 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.830
 the bicarbonate and the vinegar 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.680
 We are going to put approximately three fingers 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.720
 of vinegar inside our rocket 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.890
 then let's take the napkin 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.470
 let's put about three tablespoons of 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.150
 baking soda we're going to wrap it 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.150
 and we will give it to the thread 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.770
 the next step would be to place this 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.260
 capsule that we just made with a lot 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.180
 care inside our rocket and 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.450
 then we are going to take the cork and go 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.220
 to leave hanging the sustained capsule 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.220
 with the cut in this way 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.500
 we have all our rocket ready 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.060
 for the ignition if we take it to give 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.770
 turn now the vinegar enters 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.810
 contact with the bicarbonate is going to 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.580
 produce the reaction and it will shoot 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.569
 it's not what we want so now 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.640
 let's go out and we'll try it out 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.439
 we are already here in the square we will see 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.540
 if work is running fairly 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.909
 wind which I think is going to be a 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.620
 problem because the 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.560
 rocket what we have to do now is 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.719
 throw it and make the bicarbonate between 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.000
 in contact with the vinegar and we 're going to 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.790
 move away because where it is going to be produced 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.129
 the chemical reaction and the rocket to 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.129
 start working let's see 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.310
 Y 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.780
 and now it's when we're going to explain 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.000
 what happened here inside the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.030
 rocket so that the emission occurs 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.159
 what we used here was the well-known and 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.530
 as a shy reaction system between the 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.810
 vinegar and baking soda are 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.989
 we did a lot of videos on entering and it's 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.459
 a classic of classics what happens is 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.789
 that when we mix these two elements 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.590
 it starts to create carbon dioxide is a 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.930
 chemical attraction that generates gas 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.020
 carbon and inside the bottle at 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.509
 be the cork begins to exercise 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.669
 pressure starts as to inflate the 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.050
 carbonated gas bottle to the point 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.360
 that he can not take it anymore 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.449
 then at that moment the cork comes out 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.060
 but as the gas is above and the 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.560
 vinegar is down all that expense of 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.120
 be added to be doing pressure 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.039
 start pushing the water down 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.630
 generating a jet that is the one 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:52.570
 also produces propulsion towards 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.570
 up our bicarbonate rocket 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.509
 this method that we use can be done 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.009
 many other ways you can also 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.379
 do with water and with an inflator that is 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.150
 culturally we are going to do it and in the 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.729
 reaction has punishment and it will be many 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.530
 other experiments and remember that if 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.629
 wants to see more videos shows focused 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.629
 on one page for all 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.389
 before recommending you the videos as 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.880
 we always recommend the related ones 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:24.000
 I want to recommend a channel is the channel 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.790
 of Jorge Serra happens to visit the canal 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.320
 de jorge he is a writer who is dedicated 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.150
 also tell stories and go to 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.570
 find all kinds of story genre 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.729
 but mainly I was watching and I 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.479
 It caught a lot of attention that has several 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:41.370
 really grim horror stories 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.979
 so go through your channel and now if 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.960
 also goes through this video that is the 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.240
 invisible substance that extinguishes the fire 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.160
 is a video that we made using this 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.830
 You can visit the same reaction here 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.110
 up and if you can not see also a 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.389
 Naphthalene lamp that also 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.760
 we did generating the same reaction you 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.860
 far down here goes through the videos 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.020
 remember you have all these channels for 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.729
 visit also subscribe give him a like 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.380
 if you liked the video share it 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.760
 help a lot and see you in the 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.360
 next video 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.360
 bye
