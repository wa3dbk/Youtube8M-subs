00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.510
 hello everyone welcome to this new 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.790
 guitar class today 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.429
 we will learn to correctly perform a 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.660
 chord I got and it's very common 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.870
 that when we started playing the guitar 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.280
 it is difficult for us that type of chords is 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.990
 common that when you practice alcores 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.300
 I got the strings do not sound 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 correctly I will make you four simple 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.010
 tips for what solutions to this problem 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.919
 a chair is the transverse placement 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.920
 of the index finger pressing thus two three 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.800
 four five or six strings at the same 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.600
 time the index finger is the main 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.089
 reason why the strings do not sound 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.649
 properly to solve this you 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.980
 I'm going to give a tip 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.809
 the first one comes to you 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.950
 I'm sure many of you touch the nut 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.840
 horizontally with your finger 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.390
 index in horizontal position and is very 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.790
 bad because you will not have going to 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.790
 continue to exert force in vain 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.900
 you're not going to achieve anything now I'm going to 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.900
 paint with this lead 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.540
 I'm going to paint with this down here with 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.540
 What part of the index finger should you touch? 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.210
 nut 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.090
 now I think you see if you can see with 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.840
 this part that is painted is with the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.060
 that you should touch the guides well now the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.329
 second tip 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.640
 let's tilt our elbow slightly 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.399
 inward if slightly not very 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.140
 slightly slightly we tipped it from 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.170
 this way we are going to generate a greater 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.329
 angle to our fingers yes and we're going to 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.409
 to be able to play more comfortably and now 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.869
 let's go to the third step 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.819
 very good to the thumb we're going to 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.790
 place in the middle of the position 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.980
 you can see 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.890
 if the finger has to be in the middle 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.360
 of the position exactly there and in the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.330
 medium 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.640
 of the fingerboard 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.950
 that is in the part of here in the middle 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.689
 exactly have to exert force 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.340
 well they are in the middle of the position going 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.739
 to be that you will exercise the same amount 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.520
 of strength for both the index finger and 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.600
 for these two fingers that are here 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.550
 yes and this way you will have a sound 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.060
 suitable for when you play chords 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.060
 council 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.380
 well and the fourth and last advice is 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.470
 just practice nothing more than that 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.170
 practice again and again that the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.140
 practice will get you perfections 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.450
 in whatever you want in 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.100
 change chords quickly on playing 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.410
 better a chord with the chords with 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.420
 good capo that has been around all 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.000
