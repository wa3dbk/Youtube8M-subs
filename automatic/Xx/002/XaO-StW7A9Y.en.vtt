cars play a major role in our lives but

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.359 
cars play a major role in our lives but
how<00:00:16.750> many<00:00:16.810> of<00:00:17.080> us<00:00:17.289> give<00:00:17.529> a<00:00:17.560> second<00:00:18.070> thought<00:00:18.100> to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
how many of us give a second thought to

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.150 
how many of us give a second thought to
what<00:00:19.210> goes<00:00:19.420> on<00:00:19.630> under<00:00:20.019> the<00:00:20.109> bonnet<00:00:20.350> when<00:00:20.980> we

change<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:45.940> parts<00:02:46.269> I've<00:02:46.390> got<00:02:46.600> one<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.019> really

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
change in parts I've got one is really

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.550 
change in parts I've got one is really
smooth<00:02:47.920> that's<00:02:48.310> if<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:48.940> touch<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:49.660> can<00:02:49.900> it

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
smooth that's if I touch it I can it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.470 
smooth that's if I touch it I can it
just<00:02:50.799> my<00:02:50.920> finger<00:02:51.190> slips<00:02:51.489> over<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.299> other

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
just my finger slips over it the other

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.590 
just my finger slips over it the other
one<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.930> really<00:02:53.489> well<00:02:54.489> it's<00:02:54.640> ridges<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.390> can

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
one is really well it's ridges and I can

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.440 
one is really well it's ridges and I can
actually<00:02:56.200> feel<00:02:57.130> my<00:02:57.160> finger<00:02:57.640> jerking<00:02:58.030> over<00:02:58.299> it

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
I can hear the one on the left is

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.030 
I can hear the one on the left is
basically<00:03:12.700> worn<00:03:13.030> down<00:03:13.330> while<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.590> one<00:03:14.769> on<00:03:14.950> the

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.459 
I'm very pleased with this story I think
it's<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:07.099> good<00:05:07.610> story<00:05:07.939> and<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.629> I<00:05:09.020> think<00:05:09.349> we're

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
it's a good story and and I think we're

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.559 
it's a good story and and I think we're
all<00:05:09.590> very<00:05:09.620> happy<00:05:10.069> here<00:05:10.460> that<00:05:11.120> we've<00:05:11.270> been<00:05:11.449> able

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
all very happy here that we've been able

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.230 
all very happy here that we've been able
to<00:05:11.689> work<00:05:11.749> on<00:05:12.340> technologies<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:13.819> bring<00:05:13.999> these

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
to work on technologies that bring these

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.390 
to work on technologies that bring these
kind<00:05:14.479> of<00:05:14.539> advantages<00:05:15.110> straight<00:05:15.620> away<00:05:15.830> it's

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
kind of advantages straight away it's

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.850 
kind of advantages straight away it's
very<00:05:16.520> rewarding<00:05:16.999> to<00:05:17.569> look<00:05:18.199> at<00:05:18.349> the<00:05:18.439> results

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
very rewarding to look at the results

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.070 
very rewarding to look at the results
that<00:05:18.949> we<00:05:19.069> generate<00:05:19.520> here<00:05:19.789> and<00:05:19.969> realize<00:05:20.779> that

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
that we generate here and realize that

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.100 
that we generate here and realize that
we've<00:05:21.590> created<00:05:21.860> a<00:05:22.279> solution<00:05:22.879> to<00:05:23.539> the<00:05:23.659> problem

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
we've created a solution to the problem

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.850 
we've created a solution to the problem
of<00:05:24.199> abrasive<00:05:25.069> wear<00:05:25.249> in<00:05:26.060> engines<00:05:26.539> all<00:05:27.229> around

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
of abrasive wear in engines all around

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.249 
of abrasive wear in engines all around
the<00:05:27.979> globe<00:05:28.099> and<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:29.120> solution<00:05:29.419> is<00:05:29.659> available

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
the globe and that solution is available

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.790 
the globe and that solution is available
to<00:05:30.710> drivers<00:05:31.129> everywhere

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:06:13.120 

Oh

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130
