00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.039
 years ago some drug addict attacked 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.560

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.200

 I was at that moment in this one in jeans 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.300
 that moment i was in jeans 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.430
 unrest and meow with such pockets 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.310
 I was 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.960

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.950

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.950

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.180
 such a good guy even motors 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.020
 somehow uncle so adult old 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.700
 this is the next thing i'm shorter this 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.890
 at that moment I was very scared he was on 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.470
 we are not lost on us strangling me there everything 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.570
 oh well i was a dinner scoop 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.270
 it is good that I have on such a can 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.370
 I lay it here on the left side of 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.510
 inside pocket you jeans i 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.710
 quietly put his hand there unnoticed 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.810
 took out 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.150
 he prepared not to see it and I think 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.940
 what am I supposed to do 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.190
 Well, you know, God forbid in such 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.810
 situations if you find yourself like another 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.270
 I would have entered my place I do not know someone 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.310
 of course you can use keys with an eye there 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.250
 there is a giant in the balls give forgive me 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.170
 intelligent but I had a can 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.820
 I put my hand into my hands and got out nothing 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.040
 didn't have to do in before that i 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.150
 very much arrow nobody helped no one 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.060
 didn't stand up for me everyone passed by 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.489
 they say it's own skin more expensive here and 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.590
 no one stood up i got like 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.810
 a can in his face spattered very 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.050
 splash darsi seconds two probably him 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.540
 he splashed shorter flew off shorter 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.250
 about this can very good he me 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.960
 saved and this shock he saved me balloon 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.230
 in those years I have some guns myself 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.060
 wasps were not any because in those years 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.640
 their pro probably still not only 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.350
 began to release it is necessary now for me 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.640
 all this is me and a hunter with experience and 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.760
 Here's a spray can is the most 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.010
 the only one in it minus the only 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.870
 minus though many there say that he 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.299
 bad there that 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.799
 yes there is nothing like it should be able to 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.659
 im use the cans to the most 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.450
 reliability is the best of another 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:34.920
 anyway there is no only negative in 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.709
 it is that from the expiration date they write here 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.760
 Here, for example, is good for me until December 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.489
 2012 that is, it turns out he already 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.920
 overdue but i don't like what they 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.659
 expiration date who write them these 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.340
 spray cans in st. petersburg releases 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.069
 I do not like that they have an expiration date 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.079
 write on these from pieces of paper why not 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.180
 I like to explain because this piece of paper 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:59.230
 their post is delivered to the store and 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.299
 correct but is the sellers and the 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.160
 but you are not there they are all alive they are bought 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.859
 these cans sellers 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.000
 they also throw these cans now 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.890
 i'll be back for now 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.959
 filming these same cans they all have 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.859
 can just buy and they are lying 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.019
 and then the expiration date 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.630
 fits and that seems to me for sure they 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.880
 Here are these papers just stick around and such 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.800
 the same new hang up and it turns out spray 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.620
 already overdue and they give him a second life 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.419
 and that's what I personally want to say this is my 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.610
 opinion is personally my opinion I think but 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.520
 very adequate and reasonable and very 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.380
 good opinion do wrong no such 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.510
 shelf life 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.760
 writer on paper but on this thing 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.560
 on plastic here on this burn like 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.330
 fate climate make narva dialect beer 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.060
 drinking on bottles on plastic already 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.789
 where few write on glass looking for 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.500
 I write yes on the label there is an expiration date 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.280
 she's plastic bottled mostly 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.010
 already 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.320
 such a stigma puts already burning out 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.360
 expiration date on beer at some yes on 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.610
 beer puts such a stigma and it's still 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.130
 how is it that beer is still someone's 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.230
 lives saved, and here I would like here is 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.570
 suggest to do the same stamp 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.850
 like on beer here, for example, on chanchanak 1 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.680
 Chaikovsky and already then the shelf life is already 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.360
 no one will see it will erase me 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.310
 nothing there to do with him but me 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.010
 it seems for what it is they do for 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.800
 so that these are the most these sellers but 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.750
 maybe he bought everything who knows it again 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.180
 and tore off and gave a second life 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.830
 these cans but do n't do it like that 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.890
 what the fuck are you the manufacturer himself writes 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.430
 expiration date he has expiration date 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.710
 for example about 2 years if it turns out 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.240
 that he will not be anything for 2 and five 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.370
 years and really 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.169
 that he is two years old that five years is not 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.010
 succumb to nobody listen listen 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.650
 only me 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.300
 that in principle he is five years old 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.580
 workable will be but even 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.690
 four years that's for sure I already checked 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.520
 I know four years myself 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.160
 nothing will happen to him after four or five 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.200
 years already boldly throw away that's all 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.300
 this too you sing new buy and this is not 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.550
 says that he and the new you you 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.800
 the same stick some tear off a piece of paper 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.840
 and hang and you will think new to be 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.180
 even your new can is shorter 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.669
 take there but even let him have a term 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.830
 shelf life 2 years no need to wait 5 years though 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.620
 three years but four years it costs a penny 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.350
 most 160 rubles where you already 300 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.180
 sell but you need to know places you can for 120 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.340
 buy so subscribe to my 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.090
 channel put huskies i hope you this 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.090
