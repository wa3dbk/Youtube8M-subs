large<00:00:25.980> quick<00:00:26.250> cells<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.000> see<00:00:27.240> I've

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
large quick cells as you can see I've

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.600 
large quick cells as you can see I've
done<00:00:28.230> over<00:00:28.710> 50<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> think<00:00:29.939> yeah<00:00:30.750> I've<00:00:30.929> done<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
done over 50 I think yeah I've done it

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.440 
done over 50 I think yeah I've done it
116<00:00:32.610> times<00:00:33.050> so<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> hundred<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.239> say

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
116 times so if you do a hundred and say

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.690 
116 times so if you do a hundred and say
these<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:38.100> cultural<00:00:38.520> fees

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
these all go for these cultural fees

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.270 
these all go for these cultural fees
like<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.850> song<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.360> 4k<00:00:39.960> each<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.410> that's<00:00:40.620> 20<00:00:41.040> k

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
like a song for 4k each so that's 20 k

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.160 
like a song for 4k each so that's 20 k
this<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.120> silver<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> could<00:00:42.780> probably<00:00:42.930> sell<00:00:43.140> for

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
this is silver I could probably sell for

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.290 
this is silver I could probably sell for
2k<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.620> 1<00:00:43.950> 2<00:00:44.100> 3<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.969> 12<00:00:45.360> k<00:00:45.539> plus<00:00:46.940> 16<00:00:47.940> k<00:00:48.120> which

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
2k so 1 2 3 that's 12 k plus 16 k which

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.840 
2k so 1 2 3 that's 12 k plus 16 k which
is<00:00:48.329> 28<00:00:48.809> k<00:00:49.020> minus<00:00:49.680> ten<00:00:50.039> percent<00:00:50.399> which<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.670> like

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
is 28 k minus ten percent which is like

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.939 
is 28 k minus ten percent which is like
i<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.660> know<00:00:51.750> about<00:00:51.960> 26<00:00:52.680> k<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.789> 26<00:00:54.390> time
