here<00:00:14.150> we<00:00:14.270> are<00:00:14.299> with<00:00:14.959> the<00:00:15.350> composter<00:00:16.219> and<00:00:16.580> this

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
here we are with the composter and this

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.650 
here we are with the composter and this
composter<00:00:18.080> is<00:00:18.410> no<00:00:19.190> ordinary<00:00:19.580> combustors<00:00:20.330> be

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
composter is no ordinary combustors be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.560 
composter is no ordinary combustors be
made<00:00:20.900> with<00:00:21.199> a<00:00:21.500> bricks<00:00:22.279> as<00:00:22.519> you<00:00:22.640> can<00:00:22.789> see<00:00:23.000> and

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
made with a bricks as you can see and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.070 
made with a bricks as you can see and
it's<00:00:23.869> made<00:00:24.080> to<00:00:24.230> last<00:00:25.060> but<00:00:26.060> I<00:00:26.390> had<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:26.810> wooden

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
it's made to last but I had a wooden

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.470 
it's made to last but I had a wooden
compost<00:00:27.650> before<00:00:27.830> that<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:28.550> that's<00:00:28.789> fine<00:00:29.119> but

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
compost before that and that's fine but

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.679 
compost before that and that's fine but
obviously<00:00:29.900> after<00:00:30.529> a<00:00:30.560> 10<00:00:30.859> 12<00:00:31.820> years<00:00:31.970> it<00:00:32.360> starts

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
obviously after a 10 12 years it starts

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.750 
obviously after a 10 12 years it starts
to<00:00:32.870> need<00:00:33.830> to<00:00:34.010> be<00:00:34.100> replaced

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
to need to be replaced

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.569 
to need to be replaced
so<00:00:35.330> what<00:00:35.720> I<00:00:35.750> have<00:00:36.020> here<00:00:36.289> is<00:00:36.739> essentially<00:00:37.430> the

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
so what I have here is essentially the

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.110 
so what I have here is essentially the
final<00:00:38.090> home<00:00:38.300> for<00:00:39.200> my<00:00:39.649> organic<00:00:40.129> material<00:00:40.910> from

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
final home for my organic material from

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.450 
final home for my organic material from
the<00:00:41.270> kitchen<00:00:41.690> from<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.020> garden<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:42.649> indeed

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
the kitchen from the garden and indeed

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.299 
the kitchen from the garden and indeed
leaves<00:00:44.329> or<00:00:45.170> indeed<00:00:45.860> any<00:00:46.489> seaweed<00:00:47.300> our<00:00:48.309> organic

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309

leaves or indeed any seaweed our organic
compost<00:00:49.789> that<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:50.090> have<00:00:50.390> managed<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.079> get

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
compost that I have managed to get

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.529 
compost that I have managed to get
wherever<00:00:51.620> I've<00:00:51.829> been<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:52.969> it's<00:00:53.090> mainly<00:00:53.270> from

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
wherever I've been but it's mainly from

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.439 
wherever I've been but it's mainly from
my<00:00:53.690> own<00:00:53.809> garden<00:00:54.170> in<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.190> kitchen<00:00:55.519> and<00:00:55.670> that

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
my own garden in the kitchen and that

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.860 
my own garden in the kitchen and that
has<00:00:56.600> come<00:00:56.899> from<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.789> tumbler<00:00:58.789> to<00:00:59.480> this

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
has come from the tumbler to this

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.889 
has come from the tumbler to this
composter<00:01:00.769> because<00:01:01.309> every<00:01:01.579> time<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:01.910> have

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
composter because every time I have

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.290 
composter because every time I have
waste<00:01:03.559> from<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.800> kitchen<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.790> goes<00:01:04.970> into<00:01:05.150> that

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
waste from the kitchen it goes into that

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.980 
waste from the kitchen it goes into that
tumbler<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.170> gets<00:01:06.410> a<00:01:06.530> roll<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.720> after<00:01:08.720> about

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
tumbler it gets a roll and after about

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.859 
tumbler it gets a roll and after about
six<00:01:09.049> months<00:01:09.909> they<00:01:10.909> guide<00:01:11.090> everything<00:01:11.479> in<00:01:11.600> here

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
six months they guide everything in here

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.649 
six months they guide everything in here
and<00:01:12.380> use<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.920> tumbler<00:01:13.340> contents<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.210> build<00:01:14.509> up

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
and use the tumbler contents to build up

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.660 
and use the tumbler contents to build up
my<00:01:14.780> compost<00:01:15.290> again<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.130> essentially<00:01:16.549> it's

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
my compost again so essentially it's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.330 
my compost again so essentially it's
cooking<00:01:17.150> in<00:01:17.270> here<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.689> slow<00:01:18.080> cooker<00:01:18.619> on<00:01:19.159> the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340

bursting<00:02:15.420> full<00:02:19.470> organic<00:02:20.470> matter<00:02:20.680> really<00:02:20.830> does

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
bursting full organic matter really does

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.550 
bursting full organic matter really does
break<00:02:21.400> down<00:02:21.700> into<00:02:22.150> smaller<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:24.790> been<00:02:25.000> just

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
break down into smaller it's been just

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:36.690 
break down into smaller it's been just
insulating<00:02:26.560> us<00:02:26.680> here<00:02:33.540> ventilation<00:02:35.700> that's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
one thing about compost is it doesn't

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.150 
one thing about compost is it doesn't
need<00:02:38.349> air<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:40.780> was<00:02:40.870> too<00:02:41.049> tight<00:02:41.379> doesn't

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
need air so it was too tight doesn't

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.830 
need air so it was too tight doesn't
really<00:02:42.310> break<00:02:42.610> down<00:02:42.670> properly<00:02:45.629> it's<00:02:46.629> still

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840

time<00:03:04.530> I'll<00:03:05.530> just<00:03:06.720> take<00:03:07.720> some<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.380> front

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
time I'll just take some in the front

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.640 
time I'll just take some in the front
garden

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.460 

now<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.860> wouldn't<00:03:16.040> believe<00:03:16.220> this<00:03:17.530> used<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.740> be

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
now you wouldn't believe this used to be

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.570 
now you wouldn't believe this used to be
looking<00:03:21.470> very<00:03:21.590> differently<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.280> certainly

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
looking very differently it certainly

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:31.380 
looking very differently it certainly
didn't<00:03:22.850> look<00:03:22.940> anything<00:03:23.240> like<00:03:23.420> soil<00:03:24.350> look<00:03:24.770> now

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.160 

that's<00:03:32.390> quite<00:03:32.570> rough<00:03:32.900> composite<00:03:34.930> wood<00:03:35.930> and

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
that's quite rough composite wood and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.640 
that's quite rough composite wood and
that<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.590> but<00:03:36.830> it'll<00:03:37.180> break<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.650> along

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
that in it but it'll break that along

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:49.410 
that in it but it'll break that along
very<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.040> leave<00:03:40.220> it

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.700 

there's<00:03:50.420> no<00:03:50.540> sign<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:51.020> kitchen<00:03:51.350> waste<00:03:51.500> or

anything in here that's completely

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.170 
anything in here that's completely
broken<00:03:53.660> down<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.110> soft<00:03:54.410> stops<00:03:54.770> may<00:03:55.670> be<00:03:55.820> broken

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
broken down the soft stops may be broken

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.030 
broken down the soft stops may be broken
down<00:03:56.300> through<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.720> hard<00:03:58.240> crunchy<00:03:59.240> things

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
down through the hard crunchy things

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.740

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
rhubarb coming up here and we're just at

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.650 
rhubarb coming up here and we're just at
the<00:04:39.050> beginning<00:04:39.169> of<00:04:39.560> February<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:40.460> it's<00:04:41.390> got<00:04:41.630> a

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
the beginning of February so it's got a

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.470 
the beginning of February so it's got a
little<00:04:41.780> bit<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.110> go<00:04:42.260> but<00:04:43.220> as<00:04:43.669> it's<00:04:43.910> starting<00:04:44.360> to

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
little bit to go but as it's starting to

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.290 
little bit to go but as it's starting to
grow<00:04:44.780> I<00:04:45.250> can<00:04:46.250> either<00:04:46.370> leave<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.640> and<00:04:47.000> it'll

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
grow I can either leave it and it'll

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.920 
grow I can either leave it and it'll
come<00:04:47.450> up<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:48.620> have<00:04:48.650> rhubarb<00:04:49.510> March<00:04:50.510> April

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
come up and I have rhubarb March April

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.760 
come up and I have rhubarb March April
May<00:04:51.380> June<00:04:52.750> but<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.780> could<00:04:54.050> also<00:04:54.200> have<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.560> little

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
May June but I could also have a little

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.390 
May June but I could also have a little
earlier<00:04:55.160> if<00:04:55.730> I<00:04:56.110> forces<00:04:57.110> now<00:04:57.830> that's<00:04:58.040> an<00:04:58.190> old

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
earlier if I forces now that's an old

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.480 
earlier if I forces now that's an old
traditional<00:04:59.030> way<00:04:59.240> of<00:04:59.800> bringing<00:05:00.800> on<00:05:01.040> early

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
traditional way of bringing on early

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.340 
traditional way of bringing on early
crops<00:05:01.880> when<00:05:02.270> we<00:05:02.360> didn't<00:05:02.600> have<00:05:02.750> access<00:05:03.020> to

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
crops when we didn't have access to

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.500 
crops when we didn't have access to
imports<00:05:04.040> coming<00:05:04.520> from<00:05:04.640> all<00:05:04.760> around<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:05.120> world

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
imports coming from all around the world

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.260 
imports coming from all around the world
we<00:05:06.320> had<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:06.590> try<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:06.860> fill<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.580> gaps<00:05:07.850> the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
we had to try and fill the gaps the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.550 
we had to try and fill the gaps the
hungry<00:05:08.630> gaps<00:05:08.900> with<00:05:09.380> early<00:05:09.650> crops<00:05:10.720> so<00:05:11.720> one<00:05:12.410> way

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
hungry gaps with early crops so one way

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.940 
hungry gaps with early crops so one way
to<00:05:12.590> is<00:05:13.160> to<00:05:13.340> safely<00:05:13.700> darken<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:14.690> area<00:05:15.140> around

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
to is to safely darken the area around

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.100 
to is to safely darken the area around
it<00:05:16.220> which<00:05:16.700> essentially<00:05:17.150> helped<00:05:17.600> it<00:05:17.720> done<00:05:17.900> by<00:05:18.080> a

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
it which essentially helped it done by a

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.230 
it which essentially helped it done by a
focus<00:05:18.530> just<00:05:19.280> like<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.760> and<00:05:21.850> the<00:05:22.850> winds<00:05:23.030> at

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
focus just like that and the winds at

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.420 
focus just like that and the winds at
the<00:05:23.270> moment<00:05:23.660> will<00:05:24.560> take<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:24.979> book<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:25.160> away

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
the moment will take the book and away

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.780 
the moment will take the book and away
quick<00:05:25.700> enough<00:05:25.940> I<00:05:26.150> didn't<00:05:26.450> hold<00:05:26.570> it<00:05:26.750> down<00:05:27.790> the

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
quick enough I didn't hold it down the

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.580 
quick enough I didn't hold it down the
rhubarb<00:05:29.240> is<00:05:29.390> looking<00:05:29.720> for<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:30.020> light<00:05:30.200> so<00:05:30.470> it's

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
rhubarb is looking for the light so it's

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.290 
rhubarb is looking for the light so it's
gonna<00:05:30.710> continue<00:05:30.950> to<00:05:31.160> grow<00:05:31.370> faster<00:05:32.000> and<00:05:32.120> faster

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
gonna continue to grow faster and faster

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.760 
gonna continue to grow faster and faster
because<00:05:32.660> it<00:05:32.840> doesn't<00:05:33.140> think<00:05:33.229> it's<00:05:33.380> got<00:05:33.530> over

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
because it doesn't think it's got over

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.440 
because it doesn't think it's got over
the<00:05:33.890> soil<00:05:34.070> yet<00:05:34.430> so<00:05:34.940> you're<00:05:35.090> playing<00:05:35.300> a<00:05:35.360> little

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
the soil yet so you're playing a little

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.570 
the soil yet so you're playing a little
trick<00:05:35.750> on<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.110> rhubarb<00:05:36.410> I<00:05:36.620> suppose<00:05:36.950> by

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
trick on the rhubarb I suppose by

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.030 
trick on the rhubarb I suppose by
putting<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:37.970> move<00:05:38.090> it<00:05:38.240> over<00:05:38.300> this<00:05:39.260> was<00:05:39.470> a<00:05:39.680> quite

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
putting to move it over this was a quite

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.430 
putting to move it over this was a quite
a<00:05:40.070> well-developed<00:05:40.669> tech

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
a well-developed tech

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.620 
a well-developed tech
in<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:43.510> 19th<00:05:43.990> century<00:05:44.850> Victorian<00:05:45.850> walled

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.580 
in the 19th century Victorian walled
gardens<00:05:47.230> would<00:05:47.560> have<00:05:47.680> been<00:05:49.350> places<00:05:50.350> you<00:05:50.470> would

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
gardens would have been places you would

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.590 
gardens would have been places you would
have<00:05:50.710> seen<00:05:50.860> this<00:05:51.100> type<00:05:51.580> of<00:05:51.610> construction<00:05:52.270> now

this<00:05:52.810> is<00:05:52.960> not<00:05:53.830> terracotta<00:05:54.520> would<00:05:55.300> be<00:05:55.390> much

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
this is not terracotta would be much

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.080 
this is not terracotta would be much
heavier<00:05:55.810> for<00:05:56.260> terracotta<00:05:56.830> but<00:05:57.760> it's<00:05:57.910> the

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
heavier for terracotta but it's the

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.350 
heavier for terracotta but it's the
design<00:05:58.510> of<00:05:58.750> the<00:05:58.870> old<00:05:58.990> terracotta<00:06:00.360> forcing

how is your rhubarb doing and then you
can<00:06:09.010> take<00:06:09.130> it<00:06:09.280> off<00:06:09.430> and<00:06:09.670> cut<00:06:09.910> it<00:06:10.060> as<00:06:10.210> it<00:06:10.390> comes

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
can take it off and cut it as it comes

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.950 
can take it off and cut it as it comes
up<00:06:10.750> it's<00:06:11.410> a<00:06:11.500> much<00:06:11.680> Pinker<00:06:12.640> lunched<00:06:13.510> kind<00:06:13.840> of

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
up it's a much Pinker lunched kind of

from<00:06:18.430> it<00:06:18.460> no<00:06:19.090> I<00:06:19.390> wouldn't<00:06:19.840> do<00:06:19.930> this<00:06:20.080> every<00:06:20.320> year

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
from it no I wouldn't do this every year

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.590 
from it no I wouldn't do this every year
of<00:06:20.590> course<00:06:20.800> I<00:06:21.070> next<00:06:21.790> year<00:06:22.060> I<00:06:22.090> go<00:06:22.330> to<00:06:22.360> another

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
of course I next year I go to another

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.990 
of course I next year I go to another
crown<00:06:23.050> and<00:06:23.350> let<00:06:23.710> that<00:06:23.830> one<00:06:24.010> recover<00:06:24.400> and<00:06:24.820> the

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
crown and let that one recover and the

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.670 
crown and let that one recover and the
year<00:06:25.090> after<00:06:25.210> that<00:06:25.360> go<00:06:25.630> to<00:06:25.690> another<00:06:25.960> crown<00:06:26.350> and

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
year after that go to another crown and

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.280 
year after that go to another crown and
let<00:06:27.250> those<00:06:27.490> two<00:06:27.550> recover<00:06:28.240> and<00:06:28.510> we<00:06:28.960> do<00:06:29.110> it<00:06:29.230> in

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
let those two recover and we do it in

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.200 
let those two recover and we do it in
rotation<00:06:29.920> but<00:06:30.370> for<00:06:30.520> the<00:06:30.580> moment<00:06:30.790> this<00:06:31.150> year

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210

I'm<00:06:31.480> gonna<00:06:31.630> try<00:06:31.930> forcing<00:06:32.530> this<00:06:32.710> clown<00:06:33.160> here

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
I'm gonna try forcing this clown here

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.290 
I'm gonna try forcing this clown here
and<00:06:34.650> because<00:06:35.650> of<00:06:35.680> the<00:06:35.920> wind<00:06:36.100> and<00:06:36.400> indeed<00:06:36.970> to

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
and because of the wind and indeed to

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.390 
and because of the wind and indeed to
keep<00:06:37.450> it<00:06:37.600> a<00:06:37.660> little<00:06:37.690> warm

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
keep it a little warm

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.270

I've<00:06:39.400> taken<00:06:39.670> the<00:06:39.910> compost<00:06:40.590> some<00:06:41.590> compost<00:06:42.010> from

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
I've taken the compost some compost from

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.880 
I've taken the compost some compost from
my<00:06:42.460> comb<00:06:42.670> faster<00:06:43.150> which<00:06:43.870> is<00:06:43.900> not<00:06:44.260> fully<00:06:44.560> ready

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
my comb faster which is not fully ready

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.070 
my comb faster which is not fully ready
but<00:06:45.220> it's<00:06:45.370> good<00:06:45.730> enough<00:06:46.000> to<00:06:46.450> serve<00:06:46.900> the

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
but it's good enough to serve the

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.290 
but it's good enough to serve the
purpose<00:06:47.500> of<00:06:48.040> essentially<00:06:48.610> acting<00:06:49.000> like
