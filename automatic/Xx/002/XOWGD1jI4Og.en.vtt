00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
so and also I think Raul Albiol is that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
so and also I think Raul Albiol is that
right<00:00:36.660> yeah<00:00:36.930> raúl<00:00:37.170> albiol<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.770> well<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.219> in

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
right yeah raúl albiol as well so in

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
right yeah raúl albiol as well so in
total<00:00:39.000> pretty<00:00:39.629> decent<00:00:40.200> pack<00:00:40.350> probably<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
total pretty decent pack probably the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.010 
total pretty decent pack probably the
best<00:00:40.980> pack<00:00:41.430> I've<00:00:41.579> ever<00:00:41.700> had<00:00:41.910> one<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.899> these

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
best pack I've ever had one of these

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.459 
best pack I've ever had one of these
50,000<00:00:43.710> or<00:00:43.800> rare<00:00:44.010> packs<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.289> definitely<00:00:46.289> made

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
50,000 or rare packs and definitely made

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.810 
50,000 or rare packs and definitely made
my<00:00:46.649> money<00:00:46.829> back<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> probably<00:00:47.550> made<00:00:47.670> me

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
my money back on it probably made me

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.479 
my money back on it probably made me
about<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.300> hundred<00:00:49.020> thousand<00:00:49.829> I'd<00:00:49.950> say<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
about a hundred thousand I'd say on that

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.459 
about a hundred thousand I'd say on that
pack<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.120> probably<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.930> about<00:00:52.170> doubled

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
pack so probably just about doubled

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.369 
pack so probably just about doubled
value<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.730> pack<00:00:53.940> through<00:00:54.809> opening<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
value of the pack through opening that

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.130 
value of the pack through opening that
one<00:00:55.620> now<00:00:56.579> I'd<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.149> say<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.510> yes<00:00:57.960> they

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
one now I'd like to say that yes they

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.450 
one now I'd like to say that yes they
want<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> open<00:00:58.559> release<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.160> Team<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.430> the

defenders<00:01:05.519> into<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> pack<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.600> lot<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
defenders into the pack so a lot of you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.899 
defenders into the pack so a lot of you
watched<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.920> were<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.189> oh<00:01:08.369> you're<00:01:08.729> so

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
watched it and were like oh you're so

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
watched it and were like oh you're so
wrong<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:09.659> guesses<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> stat

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
wrong with your guesses on the stat

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.690 
wrong with your guesses on the stat
increases<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.890> because<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.010> dead<00:01:14.250> Olga

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
increases and because I dead Olga

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.539 
increases and because I dead Olga
probably<00:01:14.970> got<00:01:15.119> fly<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.659> point<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.430> know

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
probably got fly one point but you know

they<00:01:17.700> went<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:17.939> by<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.750> six<00:01:19.110> or<00:01:19.200> seven<00:01:19.350> points

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
they went up by like six or seven points
