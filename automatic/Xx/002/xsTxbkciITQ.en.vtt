curling iron I pull it down instead of
pulling<00:01:50.610> out<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.240> how<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:52.079> those

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
each layer in big sections so none of

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.999 
each layer in big sections so none of
the<00:02:01.920> hair<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:02.490> sticking<00:02:02.909> together

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.130

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
curls because it's gonna be a messy book

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.770 
curls because it's gonna be a messy book
anyway<00:02:22.349> so<00:02:23.310> even<00:02:23.910> doing<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.180> bangs<00:02:24.360> just<00:02:24.660> get

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
anyway so even doing the bangs just get

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.050 
anyway so even doing the bangs just get
the<00:02:24.900> very<00:02:25.080> ends<00:02:26.060> pulling<00:02:27.060> back<00:02:28.940> you'll<00:02:29.940> just

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
the very ends pulling back you'll just

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.240 
the very ends pulling back you'll just
go<00:02:30.239> through<00:02:30.540> like<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:31.019> through<00:02:31.950> your<00:02:31.980> whole

still<00:02:45.540> kind<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.840> clumped<00:02:46.170> together<00:02:46.260> I'll<00:02:47.250> just

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
still kind of clumped together I'll just

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.390 
still kind of clumped together I'll just
lightly<00:02:48.000> mist<00:02:48.799> my<00:02:49.799> hair<00:02:50.010> spray<00:02:50.989> over<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.080> and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
lightly mist my hair spray over it and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.729

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
then just tahsil it with my hands to add

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.729 
then just tahsil it with my hands to add
some<00:02:58.950> body<00:02:59.190> break<00:02:59.819> up<00:02:59.970> those<00:03:00.180> curls<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.590> this

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
some body break up those curls so this

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.930 
some body break up those curls so this
would<00:03:01.890> be<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.099> look<00:03:02.280> if<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.549> didn't<00:03:02.730> want<00:03:02.880> to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
would be the look if you didn't want to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.370 
would be the look if you didn't want to
add<00:03:03.060> extensions<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.049> want<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.260> keep

your<00:03:04.500> hair<00:03:04.650> short<00:03:04.680> um<00:03:05.130> I'd<00:03:05.730> probably<00:03:06.030> tease<00:03:06.330> a

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
your hair short um I'd probably tease a

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.449 
your hair short um I'd probably tease a
couple<00:03:06.750> pieces<00:03:06.930> um<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:08.340> now<00:03:08.459> we're<00:03:08.640> going<00:03:08.760> to

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
couple pieces um but now we're going to

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.340 
couple pieces um but now we're going to
become<00:03:11.459> beautified<00:03:12.000> with<00:03:12.239> these<00:03:12.600> bad<00:03:12.810> boys<00:03:12.989> so

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
become beautified with these bad boys so

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.860 
become beautified with these bad boys so
I<00:03:13.640> always<00:03:14.640> start<00:03:14.880> with<00:03:14.970> my<00:03:15.120> longer<00:03:15.420> pieces<00:03:15.600> in

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
I always start with my longer pieces in

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.520 
I always start with my longer pieces in
the<00:03:15.959> back<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.380> by<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.010> 18s<00:03:17.959> but<00:03:18.959> usually<00:03:19.290> I'll

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
the back I by the 18s but usually I'll

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.650 
the back I by the 18s but usually I'll
make<00:03:19.739> them<00:03:19.890> into<00:03:20.519> like<00:03:20.640> 22<00:03:21.150> s<00:03:21.209> because<00:03:21.540> I'll

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
make them into like 22 s because I'll

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.090 
make them into like 22 s because I'll
just<00:03:21.840> clip<00:03:22.079> them<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.319> little<00:03:22.470> longer<00:03:22.650> so

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
just clip them a little longer so

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.440 
just clip them a little longer so
actually<00:03:23.880> we're<00:03:23.970> going<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.150> do<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.390> today

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
actually we're going to do that today

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.800 
actually we're going to do that today
and<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.459> can<00:03:26.549> improvise<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.030> little<00:03:27.180> so

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
and so you can improvise a little so

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.900 
and so you can improvise a little so
I'll<00:03:28.739> start<00:03:29.130> right<00:03:31.130> back<00:03:32.130> here<00:03:32.489> literally

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910
