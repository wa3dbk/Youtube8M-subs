00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.599
 between the time spent autonomy 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.540
 fuel consumption remaining la 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.400
 average speed below or the handset of 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.720

 always press on aux and enter the 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.489
 usb functionality and it takes a little bit 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.690
 to be recognized in the meantime that 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.129
 we give him time to be known 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.730
 let's go to the navigation part here 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.049
 right 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.540
 we press the nav button to enter 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.340
 in the options and destinations i 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.220
 now I insert you into one 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.040
 random destination among the last ones 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.290
 I have inserted I will show you the calculation 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.150
 of the path that the navigation 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.040
 navigation that is fine possibility 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.260
 there is the possibility of zooming in on 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.690
 map with the wheel here on the right 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.190
 the navigator also indicates the limits 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.660
 of speed and the fixed speed cameras one 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.780
 very convenient function other function 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.139
 this comfortable thanks to the tmc gives us the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.660
 traffic indications and any 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:44.850
 problems with the possibility of avoiding 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.790
 the part of the route incriminated by the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.840
 where there is a problem on setup obviously 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.370
 possibility to select the quality 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.470
 of sound 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.050
 there is also the possibility to modify 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.870
 the veil the volume increase in 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.400
 based on speed the possibility of 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.080
 match the bluetooth phone none 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.090
 bluetooth pairing problem 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.460
 unfortunately it has always been recognized 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.620
 missing vocal input will have to 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.200
 use when we go into the function 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.570
 phone or phone or go 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.180
 on the latest calls or use 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.270
 simply the dial pad 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.370
 the number taken by a navigator who 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.490
 works very well does not give us three 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.690
 route options like others 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.730
 navigators but still the option there 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.410
 gives is always the most in quotes 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.590
 smart the map can be 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.650
 set in 2d or in in 3d it is 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:42.180
 You can also use the zoom 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:45.930
 automatic at the approach of the gods 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.500
 crossings and when we decrease speed 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.660
 I would say that I wanted to make you want to give you two 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.730
 information of two words on the audio 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.770
 bluetooth regarding the part 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.510
 telephone works well feels good 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.520
 practically even at speed 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.220
 highways who listens to us on another 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.670
 part has no problems such as sd where i am 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.800
 resident navigation maps e 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.110
 last button the room button 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.690
 room button that thanks to four 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.490
 cameras placed 2 on the mirrors a 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.360
 anteriorly and a posteriorly makes us 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.610
 see the car as if it were one 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.470
 view from above as you see 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.030
 here our car we are 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.910
 parked we have right levers behind 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.860
 snow here parking and beyond that 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.750
 we have the company to display here 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.870
 what happens before us then 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.220
 we think entering on a non intersection 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.230
 we have right left visibility with 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.940
 this function we can visualize 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.350
 what's happening or when 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.690
 put in reverse view 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.310
 what's happening behind with le 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.120
 parking guidelines that yes 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.820
 move based on how we rotate the 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.729
 steering wheel therefore an excellent functionality 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.710
 which, however, is only present in the version 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.510
 more equipped than this nissan 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.840
 qashqai for andrea engines 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.840
