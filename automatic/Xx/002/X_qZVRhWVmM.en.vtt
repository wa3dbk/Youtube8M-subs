it's<00:00:24.240> got<00:00:24.359> medium<00:00:24.779> flex<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.439> quite<00:00:25.619> easy

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
it's got medium flex so it's quite easy

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.250 
it's got medium flex so it's quite easy
to<00:00:26.010> use<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:26.730> got<00:00:26.849> auto<00:00:27.029> turn<00:00:27.359> rocker<00:00:27.660> so
