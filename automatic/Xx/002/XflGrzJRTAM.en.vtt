00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.029
 yes 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.709
 hey gÃ¼era all you are ibex and today you 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.689
 I bring this video over halo reach a 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.369
 pretty exciting game the truth 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.160
 where they are and quite funny 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.439
 above all you will see because as it progresses 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.020
 the cam play vale is a game of has 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.180
 sniper city me snipers or how weird 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.399
 playing has snipers so yes when 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.960
 has snipers because although there is no 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.760
 Many examples of team is printing 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.120
 the channel is what I play for 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.860
 warm up wait for me to have a bullet 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.559
 ok there is 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.859
 let's keep talking about this 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.780
 vale team snipers is a pretty mode 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.879
 good to warm there's beige that's why 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.629
 it had to hurt quite the truth but 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.140
 good many people when I uploaded the video 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.499
 of the triple voucher of that famous triple 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.370
 the one that went up 23 days ago 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.620
 Many people told me it 's luck 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.960
 if such that if ccoo at the same time has not 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.050
 I uploaded this video to shut their mouths 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.460
 far from it also not to see what 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.530
 that I have uploaded this video has been for 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.960
 what 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.090
 to see some courageous councils 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.430
 this is the best you can do to 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.979
 heat the sniper for what I do 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.560
 is to play yourself and personal to 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.940
 warm up even if you're going to play in my 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.909
 choice that you go to play with m &amp; r 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.740
 What I know is to poke more calories game 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.020
 a pair of team snipers games or 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.250
 three because the truth is that he has sammy 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.830
 Perez is a pretty game mode 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.380
 fun or I love that 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.930
 to have an exam but infinite and not 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.450
 I know I love the truth quite well 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.369
 many people 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.680
 I do not know you will also like this mode of 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.329
 I play as I suppose because one of 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.090
 the possibilities that it offers you is already 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.640
 I say an open and hidden way 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.899
 Equally not camping but in short what 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.600
 I'm saying there are many 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.130
 possibilities of experience we go that 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.500
 is this game mode offers you many 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.990
 possibilities one of them is that no 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.610
 have the possibility to have you always 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.390
 always in your hand does not have to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.390
 take it from the map 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.920
 Maybe someone will take it away from you or not 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.870
 this did not have that problem worth with this 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.000
 game mode because you have infinite 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.739
 you have it all the time in your hand you can 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.950
 make good many you can heat 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.050
 you can train with the nipper all me 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.319
 well, many of you ask me also about 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.090
 my configuration for sensitivity 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.209
 of sight is it always always 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.250
 always carries it in four vouchers or is it 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.560
 I think the best for me the most 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.569
 balanced do not fail too much stress 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.300
 with m &amp; r or not fail none if you 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.700
 you get used to 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.040
 and good with the sniper does not fail either 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.410
 nothing with the sensitivity of 4 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.380
 Sometimes I put it on 3 or something 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.990
 So if I'm not too hot, 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.280
 let's say so to speak but good 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.630
 here a moment of the game that I 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.260
 I quite like you have seen a girl 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.880
 pumba second here already excited and I say 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.600
 well we're going to attack for the triple and 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.030
 they kill me or they hit me a lot 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.040
 I had this going to be three seconds 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.690
 to react because I said my mother no 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.470
 it may be they have stuck a mocho 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.710
 flipa is good 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.260
 what I am going to tell you now is worth the 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.970
 plays for the top many thanks 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.250
 It's worth it for all the moves you have 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.940
 sent the other day I looked at it and there was more 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.960
 of 30 moves, that is, it is not 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.890
 thank you very much and I tell you all 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.470
 the plays and I tell you I'll look to make 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.660
 the top 10 is worth the top 10 is safe 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.060
 what am I going to do with the 10 best 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.890
 plays that you send me, you can still 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.330
 send me the ones if we explore through my channel 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.750
 do or do many videos does not make 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.090
 5 or 4 videos 4 or 5 videos or six videos 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.209
 much that that is the video that does not stop 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.860
 to be able to send the plays to my top 5 and 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.420
 well then if we explore a little bit with 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.580
 my channel then there you will have it and you will see 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.740
 how can you send me the move, not because 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.020
 many people who ask me is a bone 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.080
 that asks me that question always always 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.459
 be here put me in another mocha ya os 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.020
 I say a lot of people make me that 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.820
 question in all the videos in almost 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.920
 everything is that as you can send me I played 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.100
 to know for that I already made the video worth 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.720
 just is more 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.790
 the amount of people that made me those 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.400
 questions so for them I made the video 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.340
 how can you send me plays to my top 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.640
 five is worth remembering that I edit the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.140
 top i will comment it as always 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.280
 I will give a facelift to be worth the 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.840
 top itself is worth going to have some 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.880
 modifications are worth they will jump to the 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.370
 view and good then I hope you like it 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.790
 quite the truth what day I'm going to do 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.400
 the top 5 is worth the top 5 I will 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.010
 On Sunday, I'll try to do it before 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.540
 Saturday is Friday, but it's already 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.460
 I say I want it to fit very well 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.410
 to edit well and all that I have to look 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.010
 me the plays that are not few that are 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.810
 More than 30 more than 40 can be more than 50 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.430
 that there is now I follow you because I already 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.640
 I say when I looked at it was 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.320
 about two or three days ago and I 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.630
 I say and I looked at it there were already thirty something 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.910
 plays I do not know then maybe the number 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.370
 have increased then 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.650
 I see them compare them in value 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.470
 it took a long time and then of course 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.490
 in recording those that 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.710
 which I consider good 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.050
 comment again that I the truth 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.090
 doing the top 5 good lately not 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.460
 but yes I usually confused 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.780
 quite not when commenting on the plays and I 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.570
 it takes time so I have to 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.250
 repeat and repeat and well then that's why 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.830
 good often meets us glued 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.160
 pity he does not read that he could not 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:49.050
 kill me what they attended is worth a 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.899
 mate killed him there I do not know good 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.639
 It is what a little a little plus two 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:57.879
 minutes of gameplay okay I'll tell you 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:01.059
 one last thing and I will not describe 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:02.229
 better I not think we do not think comment 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:05.080
 to comment on the video until the end 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.969
 I also know that I do not have much more 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.589
 what to say or is it just from the top 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:13.389
 by the way apart from the top 5 it 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:15.459
 something happened to me that could be 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.159
 pretty good from halo reach but good 

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:20.259
 everything in due time I will also continue 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.689
 with the series the road to world since a 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:25.119
 many people like good almost everything is 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:27.219
 my psuv suns left obviously but not 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:29.889
 I will continue to do it, because the 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.360
 I want to finish and because lately 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.249
 It has been getting me quite good 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.649
 games with the shotgun and you'll see 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:38.110
 in the series I do not think get me any 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:40.209
 love with that with that weapon is worth 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.490
 impossible I think it's very difficult to 

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:44.110
 less is it sucks shotgun and 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.020
 the connection gives a little does wonders 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.400
 then I do not know what will happen 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.199
 what i am saying 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.390
 what I have come up with the halo reach 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:57.410
 is that although there is still much 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:00.660
 you could play one day with his plan 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.230
 a few games and I could be 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.970
 upload it not 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.610
 I do not know if about youtube or doing 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.260
 streaming is worth that as you see 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.460
