00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
fingers here are grouped together and I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.359 
fingers here are grouped together and I
do<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:41.070> because<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:42.119> stronger<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.650> use

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
do that because it's stronger if you use

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.300

a<00:01:44.400> couple<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.850> fingers<00:01:45.030> together<00:01:46.100> you've<00:01:47.100> got

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
a couple of fingers together you've got

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.100 
a couple of fingers together you've got
the<00:01:47.430> strength<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.939> two<00:01:48.180> fingers<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.869> just

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the strength of two fingers not just

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.510 
the strength of two fingers not just
relying<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:50.330> one<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:52.409> do<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.280> work<00:01:53.490> so

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
relying on one to do do the work so

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.260 
relying on one to do do the work so
that's<00:01:54.330> why<00:01:54.570> my<00:01:54.810> hand<00:01:55.049> looks<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.270> I

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
play a C so we've got G C D G now there

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.820 
play a C so we've got G C D G now there
are<00:02:06.150> other<00:02:06.299> G's<00:02:06.720> as<00:02:06.990> well<00:02:07.200> there's<00:02:07.470> one<00:02:07.650> up

here
which<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.660> basically<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.260> same<00:02:11.500> as<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:12.310> C<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.209> D

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
which is basically the same as a C and D

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.520 
which is basically the same as a C and D
the<00:02:15.069> G<00:02:15.370> my<00:02:16.030> dad<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.450> see<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.319> base

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
the G my dad you see that so the base

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:28.979 
the G my dad you see that so the base
would<00:02:17.769> be<00:02:17.830> here<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:21.310> C<00:02:21.760> D<00:02:22.860> G<00:02:26.940> see<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.150> and

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
would be here then C D G see that and

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.660 
would be here then C D G see that and
that's<00:02:29.470> going<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.739> be<00:02:29.830> handy<00:02:30.160> for<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.519> when
