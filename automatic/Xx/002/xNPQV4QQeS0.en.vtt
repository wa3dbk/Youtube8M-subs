00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
grid 5 by 5 and then it's just a matter

they're<00:01:10.539> overlapping<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.530> in<00:01:11.649> the<00:01:11.740> command

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
they're overlapping so in the command

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.679 
they're overlapping so in the command

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.469 
line I'm going to shift in both the X
and<00:01:14.049> y<00:01:14.320> direction<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.850> number<00:01:16.119> of<00:01:16.210> spaces

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
and y direction the number of spaces

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.380 
and y direction the number of spaces
that<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.560> pattern<00:01:17.859> takes<00:01:18.100> up<00:01:18.340> so<00:01:19.119> I'm<00:01:19.179> going

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
that the pattern takes up so I'm going

that the pattern takes up so I'm going
to<00:01:19.420> shift<00:01:19.659> 4<00:01:19.960> spaces<00:01:20.259> in<00:01:20.649> X<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.630> 4<00:01:22.630> spaces<00:01:23.170> in

to shift 4 spaces in X and 4 spaces in
the<00:01:23.619> Y<00:01:23.770> direction<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.899> then<00:01:25.899> lastly<00:01:26.200> I'll

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
the Y direction and then lastly I'll

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.840

next we need something to penalize so
I'm<00:01:37.359> going<00:01:37.569> to<00:01:37.630> take<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:37.929> surface<00:01:38.170> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
I'm going to take this surface and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.980 
I'm going to take this surface and
create<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.520> panel<00:01:39.819> in<00:01:39.909> grid<00:01:40.119> using<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.539> surface

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
create a panel in grid using the surface

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.440 
domain option and the important part
here<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.170> I<00:01:44.319> want<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.679> use<00:01:45.060> span<00:01:46.060> numbers

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
here is that I want to use span numbers

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.120 
here is that I want to use span numbers
that<00:01:46.569> are<00:01:46.689> divisible<00:01:46.719> by<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.499> same<00:01:47.799> number<00:01:48.100> of

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
that are divisible by the same number of

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.389 
that are divisible by the same number of
spaces<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.389> pattern<00:01:49.689> takes<00:01:49.929> up<00:01:50.219> so<00:01:51.219> for

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
spaces that the pattern takes up so for

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.950 
spaces that the pattern takes up so for
the<00:01:51.460> number<00:01:51.549> of<00:01:51.700> spans<00:01:52.060> in<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.359> U<00:01:52.479> direction

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
the number of spans in the U direction

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.649 
the number of spans in the U direction
I'll<00:01:53.319> use<00:01:53.819> 36<00:01:54.819> and<00:01:55.289> for<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:56.350> number<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.740> spaces

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I'll use 36 and for the number of spaces

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.950 
I'll use 36 and for the number of spaces
in<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.920> V<00:02:00.130> direction<00:02:00.159> I'll<00:02:00.759> use<00:02:01.209> 16

I'll<00:02:29.440> just<00:02:29.770> make<00:02:29.950> faces<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.910> I'll<00:02:37.030> hide<00:02:37.180> this

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
I'll just make faces and I'll hide this

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.910 
I'll just make faces and I'll hide this
surface<00:02:37.720> for<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.930> second<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.620> can<00:02:38.739> see<00:02:38.890> just

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
to use 4 by 4 here as well and then it's

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
a little hard to orient right now so I'm

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.750 
a little hard to orient right now so I'm

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
the center of my camera rotation which

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.039 
the center of my camera rotation which
is<00:03:23.799> going<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.100> make<00:03:24.250> drawing<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.850> lot<00:03:25.630> easier

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
is going to make drawing a lot easier

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.009 
is going to make drawing a lot easier
and<00:03:27.030> then<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.239> matter<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.450> connecting<00:03:28.750> the

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
and then it's a matter of connecting the

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.759 
and then it's a matter of connecting the
points<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:30.370> top<00:03:30.579> layer<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.150> points<00:03:31.780> are

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
points the top layer of points are

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.160 
points the top layer of points are

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
displayed in a red color which makes it

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.530 
displayed in a red color which makes it
a<00:03:35.230> little<00:03:35.320> bit<00:03:35.500> easier<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.280> as<00:03:37.239> soon<00:03:37.390> as<00:03:37.480> you

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
a little bit easier and as soon as you

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.699 
a little bit easier and as soon as you
make<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.690> closed<00:03:37.959> polyline<00:03:40.140> just<00:03:41.140> press<00:03:41.350> Enter

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
make a closed polyline just press Enter

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.610 
make a closed polyline just press Enter
and<00:03:41.890> you'll<00:03:42.400> see<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.640> face<00:03:43.120> shaded<00:03:46.530> takes<00:03:47.530> a

and you'll see that face shaded takes a

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.080 
and you'll see that face shaded takes a
little<00:03:47.769> bit<00:03:47.890> more<00:03:47.950> practice<00:03:48.489> than<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.820> 2d

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
little bit more practice than the 2d

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.069 
little bit more practice than the 2d
variety<00:03:50.190> but<00:03:51.190> if<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:51.370> do<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.549> a<00:03:51.579> few<00:03:51.700> times

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
variety but if you do it a few times

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:58.560 
variety but if you do it a few times
you'll<00:03:53.079> get<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.320> hang<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:56.760> end<00:03:57.760> up<00:03:58.359> in<00:03:58.480> the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
you'll get the hang of it end up in the

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
pattern by the number of spaces so in

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.250 
pattern by the number of spaces so in
this<00:04:21.019> case<00:04:21.230> it's<00:04:21.440> three<00:04:21.530> by<00:04:21.829> three<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:23.260> shift

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
this case it's three by three and shift

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.100 
this case it's three by three and shift
in<00:04:24.440> X&amp;Y<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:26.120> then<00:04:26.240> I'll<00:04:26.330> click<00:04:26.480> on<00:04:26.600> name<00:04:26.810> again

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110

flyout offset points I'm going to take

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.870 
flyout offset points I'm going to take
this<00:05:12.790> grid<00:05:13.790> of<00:05:13.880> points<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:15.190> offset<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.220> using

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
this surface as the direction and then

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.790 
this surface as the direction and then
we<00:05:22.430> can<00:05:22.550> go<00:05:22.669> directly<00:05:23.030> into<00:05:23.260> panel<00:05:24.260> 3d<00:05:24.590> grid

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
we can go directly into panel 3d grid

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.510 
we can go directly into panel 3d grid
and<00:05:25.990> panel<00:05:26.990> 3d<00:05:27.289> grid<00:05:27.530> is<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.770> little<00:05:28.400> bit

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
and panel 3d grid is a little bit

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.580 
and panel 3d grid is a little bit
different<00:05:28.820> than<00:05:28.970> panel<00:05:29.270> 2d<00:05:29.600> grid<00:05:29.810> in<00:05:29.990> that<00:05:30.470> you

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
different than panel 2d grid in that you

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.930 
different than panel 2d grid in that you
should<00:05:30.740> make<00:05:30.919> sure<00:05:30.950> you<00:05:31.370> have<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.789> correct

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
should make sure you have the correct

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.000 
should make sure you have the correct
pattern<00:05:32.360> specified<00:05:33.080> before<00:05:33.650> you<00:05:33.740> start

pattern specified before you start

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.930 
pattern specified before you start
selecting<00:05:34.430> the<00:05:34.940> panelling<00:05:35.360> point<00:05:35.630> grid<00:05:36.940> so

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
selecting the panelling point grid so

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.400 
selecting the panelling point grid so
under<00:05:38.270> pattern<00:05:38.690> you<00:05:38.840> can<00:05:38.960> see<00:05:39.020> all<00:05:39.289> the

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
under pattern you can see all the

very end is test two the one we just

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.159 
very end is test two the one we just
made<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:45.910> likewise<00:05:46.910> you<00:05:47.450> can<00:05:47.630> pick<00:05:47.840> what

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
made and likewise you can pick what

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.350

types of geometry to make and in this

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.540 
types of geometry to make and in this
case<00:05:50.600> I'll<00:05:50.750> just<00:05:50.780> make<00:05:51.139> faces<00:05:51.590> since<00:05:52.370> the

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:43.669 
and then I'll save that and I'll show
you<00:06:41.379> what<00:06:41.589> that<00:06:41.619> looks<00:06:41.949> like

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:43.679 
you what that looks like

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:45.899 
you what that looks like
this<00:06:44.679> is<00:06:44.829> what<00:06:44.979> the<00:06:45.069> txt<00:06:45.339> file<00:06:45.489> looks<00:06:45.759> like

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:45.909 
this is what the txt file looks like

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:48.479 
this is what the txt file looks like
right<00:06:46.119> now<00:06:46.149> and<00:06:46.539> we<00:06:47.259> had<00:06:47.379> only<00:06:47.529> one<00:06:47.679> library

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:48.489 
right now and we had only one library

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:50.789 
right now and we had only one library
pattern<00:06:48.849> saved<00:06:49.360> and<00:06:49.629> that<00:06:50.229> was<00:06:50.349> called<00:06:50.529> test

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:50.799 
pattern saved and that was called test

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:53.159 
pattern saved and that was called test
if<00:06:51.069> we<00:06:51.610> had<00:06:51.789> another<00:06:52.029> one<00:06:52.209> it<00:06:52.419> would<00:06:52.599> be<00:06:52.629> below

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169 
if we had another one it would be below

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.079 
if we had another one it would be below
this<00:06:53.409> also<00:06:53.889> named<00:06:54.369> and<00:06:54.639> it<00:06:54.819> would<00:06:54.909> have<00:06:55.029> a

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.089 
this also named and it would have a

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:58.229 
this also named and it would have a

00:06:58.229 --> 00:06:58.239 
series of connected points as well so

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 
any number of saved library patterns

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:03.569 
any number of saved library patterns

the 3d library patterns and when you

the 3d library patterns and when you

save out a 3d M file all the patterns

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:12.809 
save out a 3d M file all the patterns
will<00:07:11.139> stay<00:07:11.499> in<00:07:11.679> it<00:07:11.829> but<00:07:12.099> if<00:07:12.189> you<00:07:12.279> want<00:07:12.459> to<00:07:12.579> share

will stay in it but if you want to share

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:15.359 
will stay in it but if you want to share
patterns<00:07:13.269> with<00:07:13.689> someone<00:07:14.079> else<00:07:14.229> you<00:07:14.949> can<00:07:14.979> just

00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:15.369 
patterns with someone else you can just

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:17.009 
patterns with someone else you can just
give<00:07:15.729> them<00:07:15.879> the<00:07:15.999> text<00:07:16.269> file<00:07:16.449> and<00:07:16.689> they<00:07:16.839> can

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:17.019 
give them the text file and they can

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:20.459 
give them the text file and they can
load<00:07:17.259> it<00:07:17.409> also<00:07:17.979> through<00:07:18.989> the<00:07:19.989> managed<00:07:20.289> library

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:20.469 
load it also through the managed library

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:23.699 
load it also through the managed library
patterns<00:07:21.009> flyout<00:07:21.399> and<00:07:22.439> they'll<00:07:23.439> just<00:07:23.469> be

patterns flyout and they'll just be

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:26.279

loading<00:07:24.009> that<00:07:24.129> txt<00:07:24.729> file<00:07:24.939> and<00:07:25.269> that<00:07:25.989> is<00:07:26.169> how

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:26.289 
loading that txt file and that is how

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:28.529 
loading that txt file and that is how
