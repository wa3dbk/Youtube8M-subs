history of what works well for them but

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.760 
history of what works well for them but
if<00:05:55.240> teachers<00:05:55.690> are<00:05:55.840> to<00:05:55.930> have<00:05:56.080> that<00:05:56.320> latitude

if teachers are to have that latitude

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.010 
if teachers are to have that latitude
they<00:05:57.610> need<00:05:57.820> to<00:05:57.940> recognize<00:05:58.480> that<00:05:58.780> their

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
they need to recognize that their

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.620 
they need to recognize that their
classroom<00:05:59.680> is<00:05:59.890> idiosyncratic<00:06:00.520> and<00:06:01.300> unique

and<00:06:02.070> therefore<00:06:03.070> they<00:06:03.610> need<00:06:03.760> to<00:06:03.820> teach

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
and therefore they need to teach

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.560 
and therefore they need to teach
students<00:06:04.870> how<00:06:05.050> to<00:06:05.080> meet<00:06:05.380> expectations<00:06:06.570> what
