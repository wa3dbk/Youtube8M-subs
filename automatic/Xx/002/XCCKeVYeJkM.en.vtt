00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.940 
well it's my view and I'm going to be
speaking<00:00:20.779> about<00:00:21.020> this<00:00:21.289> in<00:00:21.440> the<00:00:21.470> conference

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950

tomorrow that the US dollar is headed

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.650 
tomorrow that the US dollar is headed
for<00:00:24.400> hyperinflation<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:25.520> there's<00:00:26.450> one

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
for hyperinflation and there's one

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.810 
for hyperinflation and there's one
predominant<00:00:27.189> characteristic<00:00:28.189> that<00:00:28.220> causes

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
predominant characteristic that causes

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.909 
predominant characteristic that causes
hyperinflation<00:00:29.240> it's<00:00:30.110> not<00:00:30.320> from<00:00:30.619> banks

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
hyperinflation it's not from banks

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.100 
hyperinflation it's not from banks
lending<00:00:31.279> too<00:00:31.490> much<00:00:31.700> it's<00:00:32.270> from<00:00:32.540> government's

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
lending too much it's from government's

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.650 
lending too much it's from government's
spending<00:00:33.559> too<00:00:34.010> much<00:00:34.040> that<00:00:34.790> spending<00:00:35.330> is<00:00:35.480> out

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
spending too much that spending is out

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.080 
spending too much that spending is out
of<00:00:35.720> control<00:00:35.890> they<00:00:36.890> borrow<00:00:37.250> in<00:00:37.489> order<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:37.910> meet

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
of control they borrow in order to meet

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.530 
of control they borrow in order to meet
those<00:00:38.269> spending<00:00:39.340> aspirations<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:41.150> central

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
those spending aspirations the central

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.390 
those spending aspirations the central
bank<00:00:41.570> then<00:00:42.019> then<00:00:42.410> takes<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:42.890> government

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
bank then then takes that government

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.180 
bank then then takes that government
debt<00:00:43.580> and<00:00:43.790> turns<00:00:44.269> it<00:00:44.510> into<00:00:44.600> currency<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:45.890> get

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
debt and turns it into currency you get

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.130 
debt and turns it into currency you get
two<00:00:46.400> types<00:00:46.699> of<00:00:46.910> hyperinflation<00:00:47.239> you<00:00:47.870> have<00:00:48.019> the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
two types of hyperinflation you have the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.889 
two types of hyperinflation you have the
hyperinflation<00:00:48.500> in<00:00:49.070> Germany<00:00:49.879> in<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.000> 1920s

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
hyperinflation in Germany in the 1920s

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.080 
hyperinflation in Germany in the 1920s
and<00:00:51.110> Zimbabwe<00:00:51.739> today<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.579> then<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:52.850> had<00:00:53.000> the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
and Zimbabwe today and then you had the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.959 
and Zimbabwe today and then you had the
hyperinflation<00:00:53.450> in<00:00:54.219> Argentina<00:00:55.219> for<00:00:55.550> example

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
hyperinflation in Argentina for example

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.529 
hyperinflation in Argentina for example
or<00:00:56.090> Brazil<00:00:56.510> in<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:57.110> 1980s<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:57.950> early<00:00:58.010> 1990s

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
or Brazil in the 1980s and early 1990s

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.700 
or Brazil in the 1980s and early 1990s
the<00:00:59.539> difference<00:00:59.960> between<00:01:00.320> those<00:01:00.469> two

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
the difference between those two

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.979 
the difference between those two
hyperinflation<00:01:01.160> Ziz<00:01:01.789> that<00:01:02.000> in<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.719> first

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
hyperinflation Ziz that in the first

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.570 
hyperinflation Ziz that in the first
case<00:01:03.230> it's<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.680> paper<00:01:03.949> currency

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
case it's a paper currency

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.150 
case it's a paper currency
hyperinflation<00:01:05.330> in<00:01:05.509> germany<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.560> zimbabwe

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
hyperinflation in germany and zimbabwe

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.859 
hyperinflation in germany and zimbabwe
because<00:01:07.670> very<00:01:07.910> few<00:01:07.970> people<00:01:08.450> had<00:01:08.630> bank

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
because very few people had bank

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.840 
because very few people had bank
accounts<00:01:09.380> but<00:01:09.830> what<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.100> central<00:01:10.430> bank<00:01:10.610> did

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
accounts but what the central bank did

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.249 
accounts but what the central bank did
is<00:01:11.000> they<00:01:11.149> took<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.479> government<00:01:11.899> debt<00:01:12.080> and

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
is they took the government debt and

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.170 
is they took the government debt and
turned<00:01:12.470> it<00:01:12.649> into<00:01:12.740> paper<00:01:13.100> currency<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:13.880> that

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
turned it into paper currency and that

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.370 
turned it into paper currency and that
paper<00:01:14.390> currency<00:01:14.840> was<00:01:14.990> used<00:01:15.200> by<00:01:15.350> the

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
paper currency was used by the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.469 
paper currency was used by the
government<00:01:15.860> for<00:01:15.890> spending<00:01:16.280> purposes<00:01:16.940> what

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
government for spending purposes what

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.960 
government for spending purposes what
happened<00:01:17.810> in<00:01:17.899> Brazil<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.470> Argentina<00:01:18.970> very

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
happened in Brazil and Argentina very

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.550 
happened in Brazil and Argentina very
little<00:01:20.149> paper<00:01:20.509> currency<00:01:21.050> was<00:01:21.170> used<00:01:21.410> in

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
little paper currency was used in

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.440 
little paper currency was used in
commerce<00:01:21.830> most<00:01:22.280> people<00:01:22.580> had<00:01:22.759> bank<00:01:23.000> accounts

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
commerce most people had bank accounts

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.120 
commerce most people had bank accounts
so<00:01:23.959> what<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.170> central<00:01:24.530> bank<00:01:24.709> did<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.009> they

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
so what the central bank did is they

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.910 
so what the central bank did is they
took<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.690> government<00:01:26.690> debt<00:01:27.020> turned<00:01:27.619> it<00:01:27.770> into

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
took the government debt turned it into

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.580 
took the government debt turned it into
deposit<00:01:28.610> currency<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.840> caused

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
deposit currency and that caused

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.740 
deposit currency and that caused
inflation<00:01:31.190> by<00:01:31.369> putting<00:01:31.759> zeros<00:01:32.149> on<00:01:32.360> your<00:01:32.539> bank

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
inflation by putting zeros on your bank

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.330 
inflation by putting zeros on your bank
account<00:01:33.140> as<00:01:33.289> opposed<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.920> lots<00:01:34.130> of<00:01:34.280> different

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
account as opposed to lots of different

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.730 
account as opposed to lots of different
paper<00:01:34.849> now<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.599> the<00:01:35.690> United<00:01:36.080> States<00:01:36.110> today

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
paper now in the United States today

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.830 
paper now in the United States today
there's<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.369> very<00:01:37.580> sophisticated<00:01:37.840> banking

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
there's a very sophisticated banking

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.749 
there's a very sophisticated banking
system<00:01:39.229> everybody<00:01:39.920> has<00:01:40.069> a<00:01:40.099> bank<00:01:40.399> account

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
system everybody has a bank account

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.639 
system everybody has a bank account
paper<00:01:41.030> currency<00:01:41.509> doesn't<00:01:41.899> count<00:01:42.319> for<00:01:42.440> that

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
paper currency doesn't count for that

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.499 
paper currency doesn't count for that
much<00:01:42.800> transactions<00:01:43.580> so<00:01:44.060> we're<00:01:44.209> going<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.390> have

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
much transactions so we're going to have

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.990 
much transactions so we're going to have
a<00:01:44.539> hyperinflation<00:01:45.319> in<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.590> u.s.<00:01:45.860> much<00:01:46.729> like

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
a hyperinflation in the u.s. much like

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.999 
a hyperinflation in the u.s. much like
what<00:01:47.209> occurred<00:01:47.539> in<00:01:47.720> Argentina<00:01:48.289> back<00:01:48.619> in<00:01:48.830> the

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
what occurred in Argentina back in the

what occurred in Argentina back in the
late<00:01:49.340> 1980s<00:01:50.030> early<00:01:50.179> 1990s<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:51.890> deposit

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
currency hyperinflation not a paper

currency hyperinflation not a paper
currency<00:01:55.190> hyperinflation<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.090> my<00:01:56.690> view<00:01:56.750> is

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:56.989 
currency hyperinflation and my view is

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:58.320 
currency hyperinflation and my view is
is<00:01:57.259> that<00:01:57.410> you're<00:01:57.560> going<00:01:57.679> to<00:01:57.739> start<00:01:58.009> seeing

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
is that you're going to start seeing

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.999 
is that you're going to start seeing
clear<00:01:59.330> signs<00:01:59.660> of<00:01:59.869> hyperinflation<00:02:00.200> by<00:02:00.739> the<00:02:00.800> end

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
clear signs of hyperinflation by the end
