00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 at 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:26.360
 the present moment I would say that it is a 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.660
 little bit of uncertainty not because of 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.809
 classification because I think that the 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.430
 qualified for the world cup are already 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:39.030
 but for what is really Colombia 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.440
 why 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.210
 beyond the results I think that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.129
 football has been 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:57.070
 any question about the real 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.070
 potential of colombia I think what 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:06.790
 there is an important generation that has 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.100
 had a maturity from the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.360
 great scenarios because they are all 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.470
 players who play in the big 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 leagues and they have reached a level of 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.000
 competitiveness given by that 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.590
 confrontation is true because almost everything 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.070
 is 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.070
 competing for something important 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.000
 around them are above 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:39.960
 them there is a coach who has known 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.679
 handle there is a group of managers that 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 they have been able to create the favorable environment 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.810
 so that these players can 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.909
 express yourself but there's no way 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.909
 a continuity in that expression 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.930
 the whole world has got ones 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.590
 important memories that was of 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.890
 Colombia of '94 anticipated that world cup 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.810
 they did we do not know 24 games and 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.230
 we won everything full of global we lost 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.239
 the one that was not 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.030
 and it's not a question that is heritage 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.940
 of Colombia because if you analyzed 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.650
 the turn of a few times maybe I 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.409
 I think the selection of America that 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.650
 better is now left of the selection 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.650
 that Marcelo Bielsa had seemed a 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.180
 candidate stratosphere machine 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.370
 unique to the world and if the first round 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.959
 eliminates it then it was not that they 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.790
 they enlarged it was not that they made him 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.319
 damage to gain but the movements of 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.069
 the players are the ones who determine the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.069
 final results 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.450
 easy that moment said true menotti 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.590
 and I think that avoids any kind 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.340
 of confrontation and discussion from the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.250
 word I think the place well 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.190
 people recognize him 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.990
 simple I've seen that there are matches that 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.270
 you lose and people applaud people 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.260
 he recognized playing the remaining people well and 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.260
 one plays for people 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.840
 And more not so much but Brazil in Brazil 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:40.060
 because I tell you in the background 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.640
 I share an expression that said diego 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.220
 Spain is that champion and you have to 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.870
 respect it 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.900
 but that cup game 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.550
 confederations is played note part wins 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:58.390
 in Spain but the spiritual moment what 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.480
 what was the hymn what is that communion 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.120
 of the town with players whatever 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.810
 take on the role of giving joy to your 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.060
 country 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.410
 together with the individual conditions that 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.739
 has then I gave you gave you a brazil 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.440
 that you have to respect beyond that 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.359
 has a champion technician who is in his 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.130
 I think that we have to respect it more 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.020
 Since as I said something, do not see the 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.419
 team does not appear which team which is 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.419
 the team but it will appear
