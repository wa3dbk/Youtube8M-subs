00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
attacker you have to be comfortable with

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:25.700 
attacker you have to be comfortable with
the<00:00:13.769> ball<00:00:13.950> at<00:00:14.190> your<00:00:14.309> feet<00:00:24.050> first<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.260> all<00:00:25.380> why

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the ball at your feet first of all why

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.679 
the ball at your feet first of all why
do<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:26.279> change<00:00:26.490> direction<00:00:26.939> why<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.480> so

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
do we change direction why is it so

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.810 
do we change direction why is it so
important<00:00:28.199> well<00:00:28.349> usually<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:29.460> change

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
important well usually we change

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.790 
important well usually we change
direction<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.390> keep<00:00:30.990> possession<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> ball

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
direction to keep possession of the ball

or<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.550> get<00:00:32.820> away<00:00:33.030> from<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.600> defender<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.469> if<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
or to get away from a defender so if you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.440 
or to get away from a defender so if you
can<00:00:34.950> change<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.280> direction<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:36.030> only<00:00:36.180> go

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450

all different parts of your boot you're

00:00:49.020 --> 00:01:00.979 
all different parts of your boot you're
going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.289> much<00:00:49.530> harder<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.160> defend<00:00:59.989> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
going to be much harder to defend the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.990 
going to be much harder to defend the
most<00:01:01.230> important<00:01:01.739> part<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.219> turning<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.789> your

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
most important part of turning is your

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
most important part of turning is your
touch<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> ball<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.379> said<00:01:04.619> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
touch on the ball so like I said you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.969 
touch on the ball so like I said you
have<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.549> comfortable<00:01:06.500> inside<00:01:07.500> outside

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
have to be comfortable inside outside

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.100 
have to be comfortable inside outside
that<00:01:08.130> foot<00:01:08.369> bottom<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:08.970> foot<00:01:09.330> there's<00:01:09.900> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that foot bottom of the foot there's so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.450 
that foot bottom of the foot there's so
many<00:01:10.200> different<00:01:10.560> ways<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.710> change<00:01:10.920> direction

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
many different ways to change direction

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.910 
many different ways to change direction
but<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> key<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.720> make<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:13.080> touch<00:01:13.320> away

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
but the key is to make your touch away

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.609 
but the key is to make your touch away
from<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> defender<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.540> play<00:01:15.810> yourself<00:01:15.930> into

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
from the defender to play yourself into

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:27.350 
from the defender to play yourself into
space

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.670 

when<00:01:28.360> I'm<00:01:28.480> turning<00:01:28.660> I<00:01:28.930> want<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.170> keep<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.380> low

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
when I'm turning I want to keep a low

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.920 
when I'm turning I want to keep a low
center<00:01:30.160> of<00:01:30.190> gravity<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:31.060> lower<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.390> am<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.840> the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
center of gravity the lower I am to the

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.290 
center of gravity the lower I am to the
ground<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:33.280> quicker<00:01:33.580> I<00:01:33.700> can<00:01:33.820> move<00:01:34.120> in

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
ground the quicker I can move in

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.880 
ground the quicker I can move in
different<00:01:34.420> directions<00:01:34.630> if<00:01:35.170> I'm<00:01:35.350> up<00:01:35.530> here<00:01:35.740> and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
different directions if I'm up here and

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.060 
different directions if I'm up here and
I'm<00:01:35.950> trying<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.250> turn<00:01:36.430> like<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.740> much

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
I'm trying to turn like this it's much

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.530 
I'm trying to turn like this it's much
harder<00:01:39.310> for<00:01:39.460> me<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.730> get<00:01:40.060> speed<00:01:40.390> and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
harder for me to get speed and

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.680 
harder for me to get speed and
acceleration<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.470> make<00:01:41.950> those<00:01:42.100> sharp<00:01:42.940> quick

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
acceleration and make those sharp quick

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:55.140 
acceleration and make those sharp quick
turns<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.260> cuts<00:01:53.280> next<00:01:54.280> it's<00:01:54.670> about<00:01:54.940> the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
turns and cuts next it's about the

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.270 
turns and cuts next it's about the
quickness<00:01:55.479> that<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:56.050> do<00:01:56.320> these<00:01:56.560> movements<00:01:57.070> is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
quickness that you do these movements is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.060 
quickness that you do these movements is
so<00:01:57.820> important<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.510> always<00:01:58.869> try<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.800> do

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
so important that you always try to do

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.770 
so important that you always try to do
the<00:02:00.220> movement<00:02:00.580> as<00:02:00.700> quickly<00:02:01.000> as<00:02:01.210> possible<00:02:01.690> when

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
the movement as quickly as possible when

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.450 
the movement as quickly as possible when
you're<00:02:01.930> practicing<00:02:02.170> when<00:02:03.100> you're<00:02:03.220> in<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.310> game

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
you're practicing when you're in a game

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.070 
you're practicing when you're in a game
situation<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:04.330> need<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.780> have<00:02:04.960> that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
situation you need to have that

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.960 
situation you need to have that
quickness<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:06.010> order<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.430> get<00:02:06.640> away<00:02:06.790> from

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
quickness in order to get away from

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.000 
quickness in order to get away from
defenders<00:02:07.570> if<00:02:07.900> you're<00:02:08.080> not<00:02:08.260> quick<00:02:08.619> with<00:02:08.890> your

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
defenders if you're not quick with your

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.230 
defenders if you're not quick with your
turns<00:02:09.280> when<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.580> changes<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.000> direction

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
turns when you changes the direction

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.180 
turns when you changes the direction
you're<00:02:11.140> going<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.290> end<00:02:11.440> up<00:02:11.530> having<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.860> be<00:02:12.010> the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
you're going to end up having to be the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.610 
you're going to end up having to be the
same<00:02:12.430> defender<00:02:12.880> over<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.390> over<00:02:13.660> again<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
same defender over and over again so the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.800 
same defender over and over again so the
