00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.640
 moment with normal person was the best 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.489
 book with which I could have finished the 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.870
 2014 and then a cry of love arrives 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.700
 from the center of the world to do the 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.769
