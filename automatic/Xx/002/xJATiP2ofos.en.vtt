based<00:04:58.930> I<00:05:04.080> did<00:05:05.080> think<00:05:05.350> I<00:05:05.560> saw<00:05:05.770> some<00:05:06.070> fit<00:05:06.430> but<00:05:06.669> it

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
based I did think I saw some fit but it

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.689 
based I did think I saw some fit but it
can't<00:05:06.940> be<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.300> 7<00:05:08.199> minutes<00:05:08.470> past<00:05:08.680> 3:00<00:05:09.310> right<00:05:09.870> so

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
can't be is 7 minutes past 3:00 right so

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.950 
can't be is 7 minutes past 3:00 right so
if<00:05:12.699> that<00:05:13.000> guy<00:05:13.240> at<00:05:13.300> security<00:05:14.160> was<00:05:15.160> one<00:05:15.520> of<00:05:15.639> us

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
if that guy at security was one of us

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.590 
if that guy at security was one of us
and<00:05:16.960> wasn't<00:05:17.320> a<00:05:17.380> real<00:05:17.560> security<00:05:17.919> guard<00:05:18.220> and

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
and wasn't a real security guard and

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.870 
and wasn't a real security guard and
your<00:05:19.600> watch<00:05:19.780> was<00:05:19.930> put<00:05:20.169> forward

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
your watch was put forward

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.370 
your watch was put forward
then<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.210> real<00:05:22.419> time<00:05:22.780> would<00:05:22.990> be<00:05:23.110> what's<00:05:23.289> the

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
then the real time would be what's the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.750 
then the real time would be what's the
real<00:05:23.530> time<00:05:23.740> John<00:05:23.979> a<00:05:24.190> 301<00:05:24.669> its<00:05:25.300> 301

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
real time John a 301 its 301

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.280 
real time John a 301 its 301
so<00:05:28.760> we're<00:05:28.940> actually<00:05:29.090> a<00:05:29.270> bit<00:05:29.390> fast<00:05:29.630> so<00:05:29.840> if<00:05:30.110> it<00:05:30.200> is

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
so we're actually a bit fast so if it is

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.390 
so we're actually a bit fast so if it is
301<00:05:31.900> then<00:05:32.900> that's<00:05:33.110> only<00:05:33.470> really<00:05:33.770> one<00:05:34.100> minute
