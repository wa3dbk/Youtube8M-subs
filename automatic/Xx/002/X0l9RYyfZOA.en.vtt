00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.730
 the staff make this video here the video 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.179
 tutorial only to give an aid to the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.490
 staff who have questions on how to 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.250
 changed if upgrade here today 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:22.800
 back only in sindh the ram ram macbook 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:26.369
 and putting there eight gigabytes 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:33.630
 I have already cut packs here but they are 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:35.940
 eight gigs and for this is a process 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.010
 very simple stabilization of a sheet 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.510
 children come out of plastic to 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.440
 pull connector anything but the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.440
 shoot 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.480
 voter types battery and can hold 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.760
 the woman in whom they are a country had 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.270
 in that of single wood also 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.220
 Let's get the screw out of here. 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.770
 that these three screws here are 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.250
 over 30 will fit into these 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.250
 positions 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:41.869
 The proposed shake bring plate 5 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:45.179
 hence you are seeing the sea ​​is winning and 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:50.640
 battery connector I mentioned we 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:52.319
 We'll have to take it up, just get up. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.340
 will forever closing with careful 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:02:00.360
 be careful not to damage a 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.380
 component made nothing by itself and the other 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.380
 takes you there 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:16.270
 right out of the straight stream here 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:20.830
 connected again want then only now 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:28.270
 think 2 little plants out there pull it out 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:33.910
 the two to release to release it already released 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:36.370
 here just pull the other down from the same 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:42.670
 thing today a procedure 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:45.209
 I think the other side is closer to 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.209
 gate 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:09.860
 get out of here a little bit more 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:15.550
 complicated since they listen to know us 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.550
 get away from far away 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:27.290
 what q2 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.290
 try 4 gb each 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.630
 to put on having even angulation 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.780
 here that this memories partition goes 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.410
 fitting an opposition to align 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.220
 get a point here that part of the 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:53.080
 memory 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:59.700
 the connector in place aside one 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:04.650
 dog surprised the other nation here 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.980
 puppy down first ready 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.700
 simple 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:15.130
 save connect now entire battery 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.769
 now it 's just close fortunately it was already 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:22.120
 done well just just close everything 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:25.170
 now boot up to check if it was 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:30.460
 recognized by the computer and I come back 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:35.070
 another to show you how to adopt 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.450
 showing eight twins even all right 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.100
 Good. Let's check here. 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.100
 system has recognized the 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.810
 there were 8 giants installed 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.990
 Thank you until the next cup doubt leave.
