 As you climb National Route 438 from Takamatsu area 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:31.230
 The Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays mountain rate I'm surprised by is lined with Zura' and the cars and the audience

 So arrive before 11:00 of the store opening 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:42.600
 It's a race to wait for the store to open, right? 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.600
 So please be careful when you drive your car 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.520
