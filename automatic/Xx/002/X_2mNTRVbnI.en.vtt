 Well, this is the main page that 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.269
 basically it has everything that you already 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.590
 it comes on the iphone that are messages 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:05.750

 youtube obviously pro also months is 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.289
 useful the time because well well you know what 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.670
 put on and down here I have music 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.799
 mail and safari phone 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.270
 if I only have two of these because I 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.470
 like to do as a little organized 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.960
 laporta of the fund that I have and it is isolated 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.110
 well as a barcode bag and 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.300
 market cake I have shampoo that is 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.550
 obsessed with him 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.800
 jetpack that was also super 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.780
 obsessed with bear games that the truth 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.060
 is that I think I opened it one day 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.800
 time and good bay rays of fg which my 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.830
 brother forced me to download it because 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.980
 they gave him points and I also have keep 6 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.900
 which is like a place where you 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.580
 ask for a password and that's where 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.560
 I keep like the photos I do not want that 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.360
 nobody see because it's typical that they ask you 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.460
 your cell phone and they start to see your photos 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.430
 so then he threw us password and 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.800
 Well then I have a photograph and it's 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.590
 this one I have different as apps for 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.580
 edit photos and take pictures I have this 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.580
 that is hipster I have hits from mari that is 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.790
 an application where it itches if you already 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.950
 it comes out as a super polaroid camera 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.620
 as if it is super 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.989
 to know in this old one and it comes to you like 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.569
 what you are going to take photos you take 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.610
 photo and it goes out with it comes out that is here 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.290
 what is being revealed and those things and 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:49.329
 it tastes common with an effect 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.980
 example as with that effect but and not 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.750
 you can change the effect that photo but 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.030
 that before taking it is when 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.489
 you change the effects then I have tab 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.319
 book that is also equal to this but 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.260
 in this what you know what happens is that 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.970
 the photo is taken as if it were a lens 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.819
 of fish 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.450
 or like everything round here you can 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.540
 watch 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.110
 like a circle and that has no effects 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.410
 I also have what it was that in my life 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.540
 the used that urges collage which is what 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.629
 before I used to do school but I 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.760
 liked more to strain and the two I think that 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.510
 they are free on iTunes appstore then 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.610
 I'm 18 and that's where he edited all my 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.590
 photos if you want me to do as a 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.870
 tutorial as well as how I edit my photos 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.970
 say no in the comments I also have 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.950
 It is running and is what I use to like 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.040
 in the photos it looks like what here white 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.210
 on instagram I also have afterlife that 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.700
 I do not use much 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.260
 pixel express that also not as much as 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.260
 that most the bases like to 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.190
 approve them but the one that I use the most is this and 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.280
 this and then here I have to bear and I do not know 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.660
 how do I pronounce that I do not use that much 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.130
 I only figure although I wish I was going to be 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.230
 with a super pro application for 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.290
 taking pictures now is not worth it 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.060
 I download it and that instagram is a 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.260
 application where you hit him and this one 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.859
 can you this one 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.560
 upload your photos from your library here and 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.300
 I had diligences is like your own case 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.060
 for your cell phone with your photos as of 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.800
 instagram and things like that and then it's 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.020
 obviously you have to pay them in the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.229
 application does not cost but they send you 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.500
 the cover if it costs and you can make it 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.970
 ipad iphone case to whatever you want then 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.070
 I have to bet you that there is no unity 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.530
 what is that I have a lifestyle that is 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.800
