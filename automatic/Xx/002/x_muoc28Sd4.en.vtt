red<00:01:18.689> cross<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.259> your<00:01:19.409> mini-map<00:01:20.930> alright<00:01:22.909> so

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
red cross on your mini-map alright so

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.920 
red cross on your mini-map alright so
let's<00:01:24.090> look<00:01:24.240> at<00:01:24.390> our<00:01:24.450> satellite<00:01:24.659> report<00:01:25.790> and

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
let's look at our satellite report and

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.270 
let's look at our satellite report and
yeah<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.200> there's<00:01:28.650> no<00:01:28.829> energy<00:01:29.250> no

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
yeah you know there's no energy no

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.520 
yeah you know there's no energy no
titanium<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.630> am<00:01:30.810> there's<00:01:31.350> nothing

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
titanium know your am there's nothing

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.170 
titanium know your am there's nothing
here<00:01:32.390> ok<00:01:33.770> detected<00:01:34.770> an<00:01:35.009> explosive<00:01:35.729> type

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
here ok detected an explosive type

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.780 
here ok detected an explosive type
unknown<00:01:36.740> detected<00:01:37.939> unknown<00:01:38.939> organisms<00:01:39.780> mmm

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
unknown detected unknown organisms mmm

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.679 
unknown detected unknown organisms mmm
danger<00:01:42.110> don't<00:01:43.110> know<00:01:43.259> unknown<00:01:43.860> all<00:01:44.399> right

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
danger don't know unknown all right

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.770 
danger don't know unknown all right
weird<00:01:45.710> ok<00:01:46.710> well<00:01:46.950> let's<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> look<00:01:47.630> we<00:01:48.630> can

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
weird ok well let's take a look we can

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.319 
weird ok well let's take a look we can
look<00:01:48.960> over<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.439> at<00:01:49.649> our<00:01:49.770> mini<00:01:49.950> map<00:01:50.329> so

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
look over here at our mini map so

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.240 
look over here at our mini map so
there's<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.600> red<00:01:51.840> flag<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.070> can

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
there's a red flag and you can

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.910 
there's a red flag and you can
mouse-over<00:01:53.869> items<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> mini-map<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.740> kind

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
mouse-over items on the mini-map to kind

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.020 
mouse-over items on the mini-map to kind
of<00:01:55.950> see<00:01:56.100> what's<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.790> also<00:01:56.909> zoom

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
of see what's going on you can also zoom

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.390 
of see what's going on you can also zoom
in<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.659> out

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.220 

so<00:02:03.400> it<00:02:03.610> looks<00:02:03.670> like<00:02:03.820> there's<00:02:04.090> some<00:02:04.150> water<00:02:04.630> and

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
so it looks like there's some water and

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.460 
so it looks like there's some water and
this<00:02:06.420> Canyon<00:02:07.420> or<00:02:07.510> something<00:02:07.900> let's<00:02:08.110> see<00:02:08.350> what

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
this Canyon or something let's see what

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.310 
this Canyon or something let's see what
we<00:02:08.619> can<00:02:08.649> do<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.070> here<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:10.420> go<00:02:10.780> straight<00:02:11.110> towards

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
we can do in here we go straight towards

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.930 
we can do in here we go straight towards
it<00:02:12.300> I'm<00:02:13.300> going<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.510> go<00:02:13.630> right<00:02:13.920> straight

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940
