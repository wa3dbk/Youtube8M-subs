the<00:02:18.330> Pro<00:02:18.510> Bowl<00:02:19.340> in<00:02:20.340> my<00:02:20.459> opinion<00:02:20.879> I<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.629> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
the Pro Bowl in my opinion I like the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.890 
the Pro Bowl in my opinion I like the
concept<00:02:22.080> but<00:02:22.890> again<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.489> Pro<00:02:23.730> Bowl<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.269> also

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
concept but again the Pro Bowl is also

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.559 
concept but again the Pro Bowl is also
dead<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.590> me<00:02:25.769> because<00:02:25.950> who<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:27.239> wants<00:02:27.540> to

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
dead to me because who really wants to

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.670 
dead to me because who really wants to
go<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:27.959> there<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:29.660> play<00:02:30.660> hard<00:02:31.049> doing<00:02:31.470> their

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
go out there and play hard doing their

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.370 
go out there and play hard doing their
offseason<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.489> get<00:02:32.640> injured<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.989> game<00:02:34.200> that

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
offseason and get injured in a game that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.370 
offseason and get injured in a game that
really<00:02:34.530> does<00:02:34.799> not<00:02:34.950> matter<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:36.049> thought<00:02:37.049> and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
really does not matter I thought and

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.380 
really does not matter I thought and
suggested<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.099> maybe<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.549> NFL<00:02:38.940> shall<00:02:39.209> go

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.229 
suggested that maybe the NFL shall go
along<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.900> paths<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.410> doing<00:02:41.239> skills

the Pro Bowl and playing head-to-head
like<00:05:27.760> that<00:05:27.970> I<00:05:28.180> think<00:05:28.450> they'd<00:05:28.570> be<00:05:28.690> kind<00:05:28.900> of<00:05:28.960> fun

like that I think they'd be kind of fun

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.470 
like that I think they'd be kind of fun
I<00:05:29.410> think<00:05:30.070> it<00:05:30.190> also<00:05:30.400> will<00:05:30.640> get<00:05:30.790> born<00:05:31.060> after<00:05:31.450> a

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
I think it also will get born after a

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.260 
I think it also will get born after a
while<00:05:31.750> but<00:05:32.650> it<00:05:32.860> is<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.040> new<00:05:33.310> game<00:05:33.550> mode<00:05:33.790> that<00:05:34.000> bad

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
while but it is a new game mode that bad

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.770 
while but it is a new game mode that bad
you<00:05:34.450> could<00:05:34.690> introduce<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:36.210> Madden<00:05:37.210> whatever

a comment section below let me know what

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.760 
a comment section below let me know what
you<00:05:46.990> all<00:05:47.020> think<00:05:47.680> about<00:05:48.430> that<00:05:49.419> idea<00:05:49.770> having

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
you all think about that idea having

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.440 
you all think about that idea having
something<00:05:51.070> like<00:05:51.220> a<00:05:51.370> draft<00:05:51.790> duels<00:05:52.120> to<00:05:53.050> where

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
something like a draft duels to where

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.210 
something like a draft duels to where
you<00:05:55.450> picked<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.960> players<00:05:56.260> depending<00:05:56.890> on<00:05:57.010> who

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
you picked the players depending on who

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.190 
you picked the players depending on who
make<00:05:57.370> it<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.669> program<00:05:58.090> I<00:05:58.300> don't<00:05:58.870> know<00:05:58.990> how

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
make it to the program I don't know how

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.540 
make it to the program I don't know how
it<00:05:59.590> would<00:05:59.919> work<00:06:00.900> if<00:06:02.010> you're<00:06:03.010> playing<00:06:03.280> a

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
it would work if you're playing a

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.080 
it would work if you're playing a
connected<00:06:04.120> franchise<00:06:04.390> game<00:06:05.550> but<00:06:06.550> i'm<00:06:06.820> pretty

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
connected franchise game but i'm pretty

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.720 
connected franchise game but i'm pretty
sure<00:06:07.240> it's<00:06:07.780> a<00:06:07.930> way<00:06:08.110> that<00:06:08.320> it<00:06:08.470> could<00:06:08.650> work<00:06:09.010> if

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
sure it's a way that it could work if

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.760 
sure it's a way that it could work if
you're<00:06:10.060> playing<00:06:10.419> against<00:06:10.720> your<00:06:10.930> friends<00:06:11.230> and
