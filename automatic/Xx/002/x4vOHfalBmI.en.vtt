 Similarly let's start 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.720
 recently in what is doing the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.640
 Official page of rock star games have 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.890

 we will also have the new sources not 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.000
 this is more than anything the features 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.799
 new that the editor of the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.930
 rockstar but something that surprised me 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.960
 within all this is a text which 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.760
 just like that next month the editor of 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.180
 rockstar finally arrives at playstation 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.210

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.030
 downloadable update for large 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.950
 5 cars and large auto online this 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.540
 update will bring with it new 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.910
 features for the editor 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.150
 rockstar and will be available in all 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.160
 the platforms included the pc too 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.229
 includes new game elements for 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.570
 the free mode of big auto line that 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.390
 we will reveal in the coming weeks and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.430
 As you see it here, it brings something out to me 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.170
 I was surprised not because he first tells us 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.420
 that will finally get to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.060
 playstation 4 and then tells us that to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.820
 xbox one not but it tells us that it's going to come 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.710
 a downloadable update and that that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.380
 update will be and will be available 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.750
 for all platforms then here 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.240
 what we are trying to say is that this 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.979
 of editor mode maybe we just come to 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.110
 come with what you are doing the new 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.000
 generations and the computer but it's going to 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.280
 have a general update for 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 all platforms and maybe in this 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.330
 update has a different name and 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.260
 it is applied to some new cars 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.239
 for 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.549
 the old generation people do not 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.500
 feel sad and a bit discriminated by 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.780
 not be a new generation, I do not believe 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.760
 that if they are going to bring us some things or 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.290
 are going to bring us more things apart from 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.959
 what is an editor mode since there are 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.000
 many people who do not have all this I do not know 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.980
 there are many people who do not have the new 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.690
 generation and well I think they feel 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.190
 a little discriminated against for not having the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.900
 series express kids liked it 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.370

 Share this video with your friends 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.069
 tell me your opinion in the comments I 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.959
 I think that if we are going to bring this new 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.700
 update but probably we 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.920
 bring some vehicles for the people 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.750
 of old generation since something very 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.819
 true of said game is that 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.420
 truly the game is playstation3 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.950
 and from xbox 360 and then they did the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.230
 remastering but the game 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.569
 originally its first-time buyers 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.220
 are the officers were those of old 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.260
 generation then they have to compensate 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.940
 those in some way and not leave them behind 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.409
 so guys I hope you liked it 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.569
