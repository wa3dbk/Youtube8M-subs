00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.299
 now all that is going well I'm 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.900
 around here today to make a video with a 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:16.570
 trick so I sometimes do mostly 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.860
 when the forks by the kind of 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.750
 hairstyle that you are going to do is going to see a 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.270
 little bit that you do not dress and I tell you that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.430
 characteristic brightness that has the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.849
 hairpin that shines kilometers 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.579
 as we said is a little let 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:34.210
 use to do this is very simple or 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.040
 well an eyebrow gel that is already in color 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.590
 brown or a mascara and 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.210
 you have a rum or black program what 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.050
 that you have at hand no matter where in reality 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.440
 we will use too as obvious the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.980
 fork and we will also use a 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.630
 shadow to be able to be of the tone of maxims 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.340
 of our hair is worth using this one 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.230
 I'm going to bring the camera a little closer so that 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.490
 you see it better I see in this 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.200
 hairpin in black you can also 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.560
 use it the same trick on a fork 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.020
 Well, golden without a problem, you see the cold 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.510
 from which I speak that it seems 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.760
 excalibur for then this is what 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.850
 let's try to camouflage a bit to 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.340
 do it the first thing we're going to catch is 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.320
 the mascara I'm going to take the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.600
 mask without taking away the excess this 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.200
 the tip is always worth this is what 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.430
 that I'm going to use to cover all the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.350
 hairpin the area that will be seen if 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.990
 for example is let's say the part that 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.550
 usually see until the end is here 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.960
 Well, I'm going to cover only this part 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.370
 end 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.370
 it serves to worship this well 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.370
 distribute it well that we do not have left 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.800
 a lot of I grumble well now let's put the 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.790
 color of our hair we are going to catch 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.740
 a brush 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.740
 no longer 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.840
 and I'm going to catch the shadow of my tone 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.869
 to take the safe of estepona 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.590
 and it can do to me is to go putting it in the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.940
 tip of the fork was pressing 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.530
 so that the pigment is fixed 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.800
 this is preferable when it is 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.920
 already half dry the mascara that is not dry 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.520
 completely so that it is fixed well and tells me 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.550
 my hair 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.270
 house how is much better disguised 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.000
 the fork with what I just did 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.650
 that just as is the fork and 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 is much more camouflaged and much 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.540
 Well smarter now 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.690
 you know my trick so they do not look 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.190
 so much to camouflage the forks 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.190
 I hope you liked it to serve you 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.930
 if you try it, you tell me and well 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.370
 Any questions you have as always 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.980

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.450

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.110
