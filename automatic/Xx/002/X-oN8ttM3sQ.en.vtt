00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
just one side so let's go ahead and set

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.980 
just one side so let's go ahead and set
that<00:00:24.650> aside<00:00:24.999> and<00:00:25.999> what<00:00:26.539> you're<00:00:26.660> going<00:00:26.810> to<00:00:26.869> be

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
cutting out is two pieces that look like

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.710 
cutting out is two pieces that look like
this

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
this

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.170 
this
and<00:00:29.810> those<00:00:30.109> covering<00:00:30.589> panels<00:00:31.060> you'll<00:00:32.060> be

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
and those covering panels you'll be

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.210 
and those covering panels you'll be
cutting<00:00:32.360> out<00:00:32.570> two<00:00:32.900> of<00:00:33.050> these<00:00:33.200> end<00:00:33.590> covering

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
cutting out two of these end covering

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.850 
cutting out two of these end covering
panels<00:00:34.579> that<00:00:34.760> will<00:00:34.880> go<00:00:35.090> on<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.140> end<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:36.620> cover

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
panels that will go on the end to cover

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.610 
panels that will go on the end to cover
between<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:37.490> two<00:00:37.700> handles<00:00:38.360> at<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:39.200> end<00:00:39.380> and

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
between the two handles at the end and

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.020 
between the two handles at the end and
I'm<00:00:39.680> just<00:00:39.710> going<00:00:39.980> to<00:00:40.040> set<00:00:40.190> those<00:00:40.310> aside<00:00:40.370> and

I'm just going to set those aside and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.360 
I'm just going to set those aside and
then<00:00:41.960> you're<00:00:42.260> going<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.500> cut<00:00:42.680> out<00:00:42.710> six<00:00:43.190> of

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
then you're going to cut out six of

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.980 
then you're going to cut out six of
these<00:00:43.460> milk<00:00:43.760> cartons<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.600> can<00:00:44.720> probably

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
these milk cartons and you can probably

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.750 
these milk cartons and you can probably
see<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.620> dark<00:00:45.890> side<00:00:46.250> a<00:00:46.280> little<00:00:46.430> bit<00:00:46.520> better

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
see the dark side a little bit better

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.610 
see the dark side a little bit better
but<00:00:47.420> they<00:00:47.570> look<00:00:47.720> like<00:00:47.840> this<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:48.290> you'll<00:00:48.440> cut

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
but they look like this so you'll cut

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.700 
but they look like this so you'll cut
out<00:00:48.740> six<00:00:48.980> of<00:00:49.190> these<00:00:49.630> and<00:00:50.630> it's<00:00:51.110> really<00:00:51.410> quite

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
out six of these and it's really quite

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.050 
out six of these and it's really quite

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
and so all of our pieces all of our

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.639 
and so all of our pieces all of our
square<00:01:22.460> marks<00:01:22.819> need<00:01:23.719> to<00:01:23.840> be<00:01:23.990> creased<00:01:24.229> before

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
square marks need to be creased before

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.419 
square marks need to be creased before
we<00:01:24.740> start<00:01:25.009> gluing<00:01:25.369> anything<00:01:27.249> bolt<00:01:28.249> those

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
little tabs back those are the top of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.760 
little tabs back those are the top of
the<00:01:30.469> tote<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:31.009> our<00:01:31.219> milk<00:01:31.429> carton<00:01:31.759> I'm<00:01:31.880> sorry

sure those get creased as well the key
to<00:01:44.569> this<00:01:45.409> project<00:01:45.679> looking<00:01:46.039> great<00:01:46.399> is<00:01:46.609> nice

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
to this project looking great is nice

to this project looking great is nice
crisp<00:01:47.859> folds<00:01:51.609> okay<00:01:52.609> so<00:01:52.909> once<00:01:53.090> everything<00:01:53.479> has

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
crisp folds okay so once everything has

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.029 
crisp folds okay so once everything has
a<00:01:53.689> crease<00:01:54.049> then<00:01:54.380> I'm<00:01:54.469> gonna<00:01:54.560> just<00:01:54.799> lay

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
a crease then I'm gonna just lay

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.879 
a crease then I'm gonna just lay
everything<00:01:55.369> flat<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.329> put<00:01:57.139> some<00:01:57.350> adhesive<00:01:57.799> on

then<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.320> course<00:02:08.560> my<00:02:08.800> glue<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.220> little

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
then of course my glue is a little

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.260 
then of course my glue is a little
fogged<00:02:10.570> up<00:02:10.750> there

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.880 

okay<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:16.330> just<00:02:16.570> fold<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.020> right<00:02:17.320> over<00:02:17.650> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
okay so just fold that right over and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.980 
okay so just fold that right over and
just<00:02:18.100> make<00:02:18.310> sure<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.520> goes<00:02:19.390> down<00:02:19.630> nicely<00:02:21.990> and

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
just make sure that goes down nicely and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.600 
just make sure that goes down nicely and
the<00:02:23.200> paper<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.650> I'm<00:02:23.740> using<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.220> from<00:02:24.250> my

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
the paper that I'm using is from my

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.820 
the paper that I'm using is from my
reflections<00:02:25.210> collection<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.020> it's<00:02:26.590> about<00:02:26.770> a

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
reflections collection that it's about a

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.250 
reflections collection that it's about a
year<00:02:27.160> old<00:02:27.370> now<00:02:27.690> okay<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:28.750> now<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.050> bottom

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
year old now okay so now the bottom

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.420 
year old now okay so now the bottom
piece<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:29.800> here<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.250> fold<00:02:30.430> right<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:30.970> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
piece is here just fold right in and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.620 
piece is here just fold right in and
glue<00:02:35.430> put<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.490> little<00:02:36.670> adhesive<00:02:36.820> right<00:02:37.390> there

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
glue put a little adhesive right there

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.710 
glue put a little adhesive right there
and<00:02:38.440> then<00:02:38.590> just<00:02:38.830> fold<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.550> over<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.270> glue<00:02:40.480> it

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
and then just fold that over and glue it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.010 
and then just fold that over and glue it
down<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.760> basis<00:02:43.240> of<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.810> milk

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
down and that is the basis of the milk

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.350 
down and that is the basis of the milk
carton<00:02:44.340> sometimes<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.490> use<00:02:45.670> like<00:02:45.940> my<00:02:46.090> glue

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
carton sometimes I use like my glue

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.970 
carton sometimes I use like my glue
bottle<00:02:46.690> or<00:02:46.810> something<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.290> kind<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.500> push<00:02:47.709> down

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
bottle or something to kind of push down

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.370 
bottle or something to kind of push down
from<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> inside<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.970> make<00:02:49.150> sure<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:50.050> bottom

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
from the inside to make sure that bottom

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.720 
from the inside to make sure that bottom
it's<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:51.010> nice<00:02:51.190> sleep<00:02:52.060> firm<00:02:52.570> hold<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:54.130> what<00:02:54.700> I

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
it's a nice sleep firm hold so what I

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.290 
it's a nice sleep firm hold so what I
have<00:02:55.350> grabbed<00:02:56.350> too<00:02:56.860> quickly<00:02:57.100> just<00:02:57.400> pin<00:02:58.180> these

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
have grabbed too quickly just pin these

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.960 
have grabbed too quickly just pin these
together<00:02:58.540> are<00:02:58.990> just<00:02:59.560> some<00:02:59.680> little<00:02:59.890> drips<00:03:00.250> have

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
together are just some little drips have

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.540 
together are just some little drips have
really<00:03:01.450> strong<00:03:01.750> clips<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.410> would<00:03:03.070> like<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.400> go

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
really strong clips I would like to go

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.400 
really strong clips I would like to go

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
pins to put on these but I don't have

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.130 
pins to put on these but I don't have
any<00:03:07.180> right<00:03:07.330> now<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.630> I'm<00:03:07.690> just<00:03:07.810> gonna<00:03:07.930> use

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
the milk cartons are in there but you

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.830 
the milk cartons are in there but you
want<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.610> be<00:03:30.730> out<00:03:30.970> here<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.600> when<00:03:31.690> you

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
want it to be out here so that when you

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.320 
want it to be out here so that when you
pull<00:03:32.019> your<00:03:32.050> handle<00:03:32.530> up<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:33.670> on<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> outside

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
pull your handle up it's on the outside

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.210 
pull your handle up it's on the outside
so<00:03:35.230> you're<00:03:35.380> going<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.560> put<00:03:35.739> your<00:03:35.860> covering

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
so you're going to put your covering

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.729 
so you're going to put your covering
panel<00:03:36.580> on<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.820> long<00:03:37.060> rectangle<00:03:37.690> over<00:03:38.410> on<00:03:38.560> this

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
panel on the long rectangle over on this

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.860 
panel on the long rectangle over on this
end<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.370> pay<00:03:40.090> attention<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.720> direction

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
end and pay attention to the direction

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.090 
end and pay attention to the direction
of<00:03:41.530> your<00:03:42.010> pattern<00:03:42.580> paper<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.620> top<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:45.040> the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
of your pattern paper so the top of the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.009 
of your pattern paper so the top of the
pattern<00:03:45.280> would<00:03:45.549> be<00:03:45.670> towards<00:03:46.030> this<00:03:46.209> nice<00:03:46.540> cut

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
pattern would be towards this nice cut

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.890 
pattern would be towards this nice cut
edge<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:48.370> bottom<00:03:49.299> of<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.480> pattern<00:03:49.780> would

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
edge and the bottom of the pattern would

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.449 
edge and the bottom of the pattern would
be<00:03:49.959> towards<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:51.720> perforated<00:03:52.720> edge<00:03:52.870> down

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
be towards the the perforated edge down

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.449 
be towards the the perforated edge down
so<00:03:55.320> go<00:03:56.320> ahead<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.530> pull<00:03:56.739> up<00:03:56.769> all<00:03:56.950> those<00:03:57.160> pieces

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
so go ahead and pull up all those pieces

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.030 
so go ahead and pull up all those pieces
in<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.690> we<00:03:58.810> just<00:03:58.840> need<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.140> glue<00:03:59.500> those<00:03:59.799> glue

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
in and we just need to glue those glue

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.140 
in and we just need to glue those glue
tabs<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.830> then<00:04:06.040> do<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.549> same<00:04:06.760> thing<00:04:06.940> on<00:04:07.030> the

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
tabs and then do the same thing on the

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:15.300 
tabs and then do the same thing on the
other<00:04:07.180> end

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.949 

and<00:04:16.310> then<00:04:16.489> our<00:04:16.610> little<00:04:16.850> milk<00:04:17.030> cartons<00:04:17.510> fit

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
and then our little milk cartons fit

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:26.050 
and then our little milk cartons fit
right<00:04:18.260> inside<00:04:18.500> here<00:04:24.190> okay<00:04:25.190> now<00:04:25.460> all<00:04:25.790> we<00:04:25.910> have

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
right inside here okay now all we have

especially<00:04:38.930> with<00:04:39.050> I'm<00:04:39.200> using<00:04:39.380> this<00:04:39.710> quick<00:04:40.010> dry

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250

okay<00:04:47.960> so<00:04:48.020> just<00:04:48.500> make<00:04:48.680> sure<00:04:48.860> it's<00:04:49.040> close<00:04:49.490> to<00:04:49.670> the

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
okay so just make sure it's close to the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.150 
okay so just make sure it's close to the
edges<00:04:50.200> just<00:04:51.200> don't<00:04:51.410> have<00:04:51.530> any<00:04:51.710> gaps<00:04:54.040> and<00:04:55.040> then

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
edges just don't have any gaps and then

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.470 
edges just don't have any gaps and then
we<00:04:55.340> need<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.610> work<00:04:55.760> kind<00:04:56.000> of<00:04:56.060> quickly<00:04:56.120> because

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
we need to work kind of quickly because

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.770
