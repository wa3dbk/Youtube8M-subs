00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
piece or this somewhere in here was oh

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.740 
piece or this somewhere in here was oh
right<00:00:50.290> there<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:51.839> contacting<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.339> came<00:00:54.519> up

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
right there was contacting as it came up

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.509 
right there was contacting as it came up
this<00:00:55.750> hit<00:00:56.229> this<00:00:57.329> now<00:00:58.329> you<00:00:58.720> can<00:00:58.899> see<00:00:59.519> there's

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
this hit this now you can see there's

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:08.639 
this hit this now you can see there's
just<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:05.379> hair<00:01:05.590> of<00:01:05.770> clearance<00:01:06.220> now<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:08.080> I

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
just a hair of clearance now and I

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:21.150 
just a hair of clearance now and I
adjusted<00:01:09.190> that<00:01:14.610> thickness<00:01:15.610> on<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:19.390> here<00:01:20.160> this

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
adjusted that thickness on up here this

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.430 
adjusted that thickness on up here this
screw<00:01:21.670> holds<00:01:22.119> a<00:01:22.179> clamp<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.630> which<00:01:22.990> holds<00:01:23.320> the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
screw holds a clamp on which holds the

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.330 
screw holds a clamp on which holds the
bar<00:01:24.929> so<00:01:25.929> I<00:01:27.270> undid<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.330> screw<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:30.330> alternately

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
bar so I undid the screw and alternately

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.429 
bar so I undid the screw and alternately
rotated<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.550> adjusted<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:35.340> bar<00:01:36.340> down<00:01:37.439> that

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
rotated and adjusted the bar down that

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.649 
rotated and adjusted the bar down that
also<00:01:38.770> corrected<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.490> alignment<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.540> the

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
also corrected the alignment on the

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.940 
also corrected the alignment on the
needle<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.170> haven't<00:01:41.920> sown<00:01:42.159> with<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.520> yet<00:01:42.700> but

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
needle I haven't sown with it yet but

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.850 
needle I haven't sown with it yet but
that's<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.220> source<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.570> of<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.470> clicking

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
that's the source of the of the clicking

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.709 
that's the source of the of the clicking
now<00:01:48.159> if<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:48.490> listen<00:01:48.820> close<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:52.450> change

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
now if you listen close is I change

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.300 
now if you listen close is I change
direction<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.350> can<00:01:53.500> hear<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> little<00:01:54.070> bit<00:01:54.250> of

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
direction you can hear a little bit of

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.340 
direction you can hear a little bit of
the<00:01:54.460> slop<00:01:54.790> in<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.920> fitting<00:01:57.700> there<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
the slop in the in the fitting there and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.190 
the slop in the in the fitting there and
it<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.430> a<00:02:00.460> little<00:02:00.790> loose<00:02:00.969> if<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.329> if<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.719> shake

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
it is a little loose if you if you shake

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.679 
it is a little loose if you if you shake
it<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:02.829> can<00:02:03.009> you<00:02:03.369> can<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.909> can<00:02:07.090> get<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.390> little

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
it you can you can you can get a little

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.990 
it you can you can you can get a little
movement<00:02:07.840> out<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.640> that's<00:02:09.759> what<00:02:09.970> I

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
movement out of it so that's what I

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.650 
movement out of it so that's what I
thought<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.390> was<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.840> ended<00:02:11.290> up<00:02:12.390> tightening<00:02:13.390> or

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
thought it was I ended up tightening or

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.560 
thought it was I ended up tightening or
loosening<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:14.260> tightening<00:02:14.320> each<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.250> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
loosening and tightening each of the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.479 
loosening and tightening each of the
each<00:02:16.570> of<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.870> screws<00:02:17.340> everywhere<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.370> could

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
each of the screws everywhere I could

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.120 
each of the screws everywhere I could
also<00:02:19.390> was<00:02:19.690> thinking<00:02:19.989> maybe<00:02:20.109> this<00:02:20.530> was<00:02:20.739> was

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
also was thinking maybe this was was

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.030 
also was thinking maybe this was was
hitting<00:02:21.459> up<00:02:21.579> here<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.880> didn't<00:02:22.239> seen<00:02:22.390> wear<00:02:22.630> marks

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
hitting up here I didn't seen wear marks

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.710 
hitting up here I didn't seen wear marks
or<00:02:24.040> if<00:02:24.250> something<00:02:24.579> was<00:02:24.700> hitting<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.150> this

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
or if something was hitting this this

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.620 
or if something was hitting this this
bar<00:02:25.989> here<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:27.070> turns<00:02:27.100> out<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:28.359> is<00:02:28.600> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
bar here but it turns out this is the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.039 
bar here but it turns out this is the
culprit<00:02:28.930> right<00:02:29.230> here<00:02:30.510> contact<00:02:31.510> right<00:02:31.989> there

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
culprit right here contact right there

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.960 
culprit right here contact right there
and<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.579> wanted<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.850> pass<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.120> long<00:02:34.660> because

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
and I wanted to pass this long because

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.680 
and I wanted to pass this long because
almost<00:02:36.970> every<00:02:37.420> video<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.799> I've<00:02:39.130> watched

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
almost every video that I've watched

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.200 
almost every video that I've watched
posted<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:42.160> YouTube<00:02:43.440> as<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.889> noise

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
posted on YouTube as that noise

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.110 
posted on YouTube as that noise
and<00:02:46.330> it's<00:02:46.600> correctable
