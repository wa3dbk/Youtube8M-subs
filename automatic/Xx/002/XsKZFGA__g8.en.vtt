Egan get more experience what happened
last<00:00:19.680> week<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.039> seem<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.730> control<00:00:21.000> for

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
last week you seem to be in control for

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.679 
last week you seem to be in control for
half<00:00:21.359> time<00:00:21.660> yeah<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> think<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.480> don't<00:00:24.480> know<00:00:24.660> I

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
half time yeah I think I don't know I

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.759 
half time yeah I think I don't know I
mean<00:00:24.840> everybody<00:00:25.230> has<00:00:25.470> different<00:00:25.560> opinions

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
mean everybody has different opinions

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.550 
mean everybody has different opinions
but<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:26.670> obviously<00:00:27.420> they're<00:00:28.349> more

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
but I think obviously they're more

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.900 
but I think obviously they're more
physical<00:00:28.890> than<00:00:28.920> us<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.279> second<00:00:29.580> half<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
physical than us in the second half and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.590 
physical than us in the second half and

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
run the breakdown area stuff the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.709 
run the breakdown area stuff the
confrontation<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.840> if<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.800> come<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:35.630> him<00:00:36.630> so
