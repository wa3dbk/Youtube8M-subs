00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
thing that didn't survive the trip home

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.229 
thing that didn't survive the trip home
the<00:00:37.559> strawberry<00:00:37.980> lemonade<00:00:38.370> which<00:00:38.640> turned<00:00:39.090> out

the strawberry lemonade which turned out

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.060 
the strawberry lemonade which turned out
pretty<00:00:39.540> good<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.290> more<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> watered

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
pretty good it was more like a watered

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.729 
pretty good it was more like a watered
lemonade<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:42.270> their<00:00:42.710> strawberries<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
lemonade with their strawberries that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.260 
lemonade with their strawberries that
they<00:00:43.980> put<00:00:44.190> inside<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.550> shakes<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.940> whatnot

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
they put inside the shakes and whatnot

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.240 
they put inside the shakes and whatnot
and<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.960> only<00:00:46.079> problem<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and the only problem with this is the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.619 
and the only problem with this is the
strawberries<00:00:47.700> are<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:47.850> big<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.300> every<00:00:48.450> time

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
strawberries are so big that every time

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
strawberries are so big that every time
you<00:00:48.780> try<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.230> take<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> drink<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.730> just

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
you try and take a drink and I just

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.130 
you try and take a drink and I just
clogs<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> straw<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.840> can't<00:00:52.020> really

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
clogs up the straw and you can't really

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.720 
clogs up the straw and you can't really
drink<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.100> mix<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
drink it so the more you mix it and the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.010 
drink it so the more you mix it and the
more<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> strawberries<00:00:54.600> crushed<00:00:54.809> up

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
more you get the strawberries crushed up

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.170 
more you get the strawberries crushed up
not<00:00:55.590> bad<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> book<00:00:56.219> definitely<00:00:56.579> refreshing

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
not bad for a book definitely refreshing

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.450 
not bad for a book definitely refreshing

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it's like 100 degrees outside but a book

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.250 
it's like 100 degrees outside but a book
doesn't<00:00:59.760> beat<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.690> also<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:01.079> iced

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260

tea<00:01:01.640> now<00:01:02.640> I'm<00:01:02.789> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> do<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.480> left

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
tea now I'm going to do this from left

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.570 
tea now I'm going to do this from left
to<00:01:03.750> right<00:01:03.960> smallest<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.500> biggest<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.979> but

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
to right smallest to biggest here but

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.030 
to right smallest to biggest here but
what<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.510> fiery<00:01:07.320> six-layer

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040

burrito<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.820> course<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.119> got<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
burrito and of course it's got to be a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450 
burrito and of course it's got to be a
six-layer<00:01:10.020> burrito<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.619> taco<00:01:11.189> bow<00:01:11.280> has<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460

we'll<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> similarities<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.040> just

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
we'll get into the similarities in just

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.609 
we'll get into the similarities in just
a<00:01:14.280> moment<00:01:14.549> till<00:01:14.640> they<00:01:14.729> tease<00:01:14.970> fry<00:01:15.210> burrito

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
a moment till they tease fry burrito

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.200 
a moment till they tease fry burrito
never<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.830> go<00:01:16.950> wrong<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.250> those<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
never can go wrong with those and then a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.179 
never can go wrong with those and then a
mini<00:01:18.450> bacon<00:01:18.900> quesadilla<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> said

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
