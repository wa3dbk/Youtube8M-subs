00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
most of the patients but after about a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.149 
most of the patients but after about a
year<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.700> half<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.299> age<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> diagnosis

year and a half of age if the diagnosis
hadn't<00:01:11.460> been<00:01:11.549> made<00:01:11.729> before<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.450> incidence<00:01:13.320> of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
hadn't been made before the incidence of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.200 
hadn't been made before the incidence of
failure<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:14.040> very<00:01:14.310> high<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> was<00:01:15.000> for

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
failure was very high and it was for

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.030 
failure was very high and it was for
that<00:01:15.330> group<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.530> developed<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that group that we developed the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.249 
that group that we developed the
operation<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.450> decided<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.080> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
operation and what we decided to do is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.140 
operation and what we decided to do is
to<00:01:19.470> change<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> direction<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.939> whole

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
to change the direction of the whole

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.120 
to change the direction of the whole
socket<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
socket that is from there to there and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
socket that is from there to there and
the<00:01:23.640> way<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:23.939> accomplished<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the way we accomplished that was to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.560 
the way we accomplished that was to
divide<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.470> bone<00:01:25.650> through<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:27.030> change

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
divide the bone through and then change

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.270 
divide the bone through and then change
the<00:01:27.750> direction<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> soccer<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.890> left<00:01:29.159> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the direction of the soccer this left a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.039 
the direction of the soccer this left a
gap<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.119> took<00:01:30.270> bone<00:01:30.509> from<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> top

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
gap in here we took bone from the top

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.600 
gap in here we took bone from the top
put<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> middle<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.100> wedge<00:01:32.310> shape

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
put it in the middle in a wedge shape

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
put it in the middle in a wedge shape
and<00:01:32.850> put<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.150> pin<00:01:33.450> across<00:01:33.810> sometimes<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.680> use

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and put this pin across sometimes we use

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.730 
and put this pin across sometimes we use
two<00:01:35.070> pins<00:01:35.659> other<00:01:36.659> people<00:01:37.020> called<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> solder

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
two pins other people called the solder

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.609 
two pins other people called the solder
operations<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.909> still<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.750> day<00:01:40.140> about

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
operations but I still to this day about

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.190 
operations but I still to this day about
the<00:01:40.860> anomalies<00:01:41.430> gianna<00:01:41.820> me<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.049> being

the anomalies gianna me we can see being

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
straight in the hip out and you can move

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
straight in the hip out and you can move
it<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.299> way<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.780> move<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> always<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.770> it

doesn't come out it's very stable so six

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
doesn't come out it's very stable so six
weeks<00:01:49.590> later<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.790> child<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.119> get<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.360> and

treatment for joint injuries that I did

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.150 
treatment for joint injuries that I did
very<00:02:33.330> much<00:02:33.360> better<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:34.380> was<00:02:34.530> through<00:02:34.980> the

very much better it was through the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.610 
very much better it was through the
animal<00:02:35.460> research<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:36.060> we<00:02:36.180> learned<00:02:36.420> that

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
animal research that we learned that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.870 
animal research that we learned that
continuous<00:02:37.620> passive<00:02:37.860> motion<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.670> was

continuous passive motion and that was

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.450 
continuous passive motion and that was
the<00:02:39.060> term<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.510> coined<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.460> was

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
the term that we coined for it I was

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.660 
the term that we coined for it I was
safe<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.530> was<00:02:43.620> effective<00:02:44.250> it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
safe and that it was effective it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.540 
safe and that it was effective it
absolutely<00:02:45.480> improved<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.800> rate<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.010> healing

bones does not normally heal or
regenerate<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:35.010> with<00:03:35.520> continuous<00:03:36.030> passive

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
regenerate but with continuous passive

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.990 
regenerate but with continuous passive
motion<00:03:36.510> we've<00:03:37.020> been<00:03:37.200> able<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.700> influence<00:03:38.700> a

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
motion we've been able to influence a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.670 
motion we've been able to influence a
tissue<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.510> normally<00:03:39.930> produces<00:03:40.380> bones

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
tissue that normally produces bones

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.830 
tissue that normally produces bones
called<00:03:41.070> periosteum<00:03:41.550> it<00:03:41.910> covers<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.300> bone<00:03:42.630> and

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
called periosteum it covers the bone and

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.500 
called periosteum it covers the bone and
put<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.739> into<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:44.040> big<00:03:44.370> defect<00:03:44.850> in<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.150> joint

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
put it into a big defect in the joint

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.020 
put it into a big defect in the joint
and<00:03:45.750> with<00:03:46.470> continuous<00:03:46.980> passive<00:03:47.220> motion<00:03:47.489> it

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
and with continuous passive motion it

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.240 
and with continuous passive motion it
actually<00:03:48.390> stimulates<00:03:48.800> that<00:03:49.800> tissue<00:03:50.100> to

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
actually stimulates that tissue to

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.550 
actually stimulates that tissue to
change<00:03:50.670> its<00:03:51.330> whole<00:03:51.660> phenotypic<00:03:52.260> expression

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
change its whole phenotypic expression

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.370 
change its whole phenotypic expression
and<00:03:53.250> produce<00:03:53.720> cartilage<00:03:54.720> rather<00:03:55.019> than<00:03:55.140> bone

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
and produce cartilage rather than bone

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.660 
and produce cartilage rather than bone
and<00:03:55.650> from<00:03:55.800> a<00:03:55.860> scientific<00:03:56.160> point<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.610> view

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
and from a scientific point of view

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.800 
and from a scientific point of view
that's<00:03:56.910> very<00:03:57.150> exciting

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.870
