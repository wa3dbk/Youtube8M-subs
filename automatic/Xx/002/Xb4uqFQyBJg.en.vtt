overlord<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.790> scout<00:01:42.030> clockwise<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.530> he's<00:01:43.710> not

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
overlord to scout clockwise so he's not

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.310

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
going to find not a space I do expect

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.990 
going to find not a space I do expect
rice<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.740> oh<00:01:46.829> my<00:01:46.860> god<00:01:47.070> Gorge<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:47.850> put

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
rice and oh my god Gorge is actually put

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.380 
rice and oh my god Gorge is actually put
down<00:01:48.119> his<00:01:48.210> spawning<00:01:48.600> pool<00:01:48.720> straightaway<00:01:49.170> so

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
down his spawning pool straightaway so

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.590 
down his spawning pool straightaway so
maybe<00:01:51.390> he<00:01:51.540> feels<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.869> rush<00:01:52.079> or<00:01:52.350> maybe<00:01:52.770> he<00:01:53.600> wants

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
maybe he feels a rush or maybe he wants

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.179 
maybe he feels a rush or maybe he wants
to<00:01:54.720> rush<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.350> he's<00:01:55.530> put<00:01:55.740> down<00:01:55.860> his<00:01:55.950> spawning

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
to rush but he's put down his spawning

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.459 
to rush but he's put down his spawning
pool<00:01:56.399> straight<00:01:56.640> away<00:01:56.850> rather<00:01:57.119> than<00:01:57.240> going<00:01:58.200> for

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
pool straight away rather than going for

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.690 
pool straight away rather than going for
the<00:01:58.619> standard<00:01:58.920> three<00:01:59.070> how<00:01:59.189> she<00:01:59.250> build<00:01:59.520> rather

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the standard three how she build rather

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.889 
the standard three how she build rather
than<00:01:59.790> going<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.060> Hashem<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> spawning

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
than going for Hashem for the spawning

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.630 
than going for Hashem for the spawning
pool<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.409> does<00:02:01.619> make<00:02:01.829> cut<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> little<00:02:02.280> bit<00:02:02.549> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
pool it does make cut it a little bit of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.160 
pool it does make cut it a little bit of
sense<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.060> map<00:02:03.240> because<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> bases

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
sense on this map because if the bases

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.200 
sense on this map because if the bases
are<00:02:04.439> close<00:02:04.770> together<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.250> does<00:02:05.430> facilitate<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
are close together it does facilitate a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.990 
are close together it does facilitate a
very<00:02:06.689> fast<00:02:06.990> push<00:02:07.320> from<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.560> turn

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
very fast push from the turn

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.120 
very fast push from the turn
I<00:02:08.030> guess<00:02:08.300> go<00:02:09.140> rush<00:02:09.289> is<00:02:09.440> trying<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.710> avoid<00:02:09.890> that

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
I guess go rush is trying to avoid that

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.920 
I guess go rush is trying to avoid that
but<00:02:10.490> he<00:02:10.610> has<00:02:10.759> put<00:02:10.970> down<00:02:11.180> his<00:02:11.330> spawning<00:02:11.540> pool<00:02:11.780> as

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
but he has put down his spawning pool as

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.900 
but he has put down his spawning pool as
well<00:02:11.960> as<00:02:12.200> his<00:02:12.320> extractor<00:02:12.860> he<00:02:13.250> might<00:02:13.430> maybe<00:02:13.610> be

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
well as his extractor he might maybe be

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.020 
well as his extractor he might maybe be
trying<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.360> go<00:02:14.570> for<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.840> an<00:02:15.650> off<00:02:15.980> kind<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.490> rush

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
trying to go for a an off kind of rush

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.760 
trying to go for a an off kind of rush
but<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.600> fact<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:17.930> girl<00:02:18.170> rush<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.410> actually

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
but the fact that girl rush is actually

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.200 
but the fact that girl rush is actually
sent<00:02:19.010> his<00:02:19.160> drone<00:02:19.460> out<00:02:19.640> suggests<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.120> me<00:02:20.150> that

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
sent his drone out suggests to me that

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.030 
sent his drone out suggests to me that
he<00:02:20.450> wants<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.780> rush<00:02:21.020> he's<00:02:21.470> sending<00:02:21.740> that<00:02:21.830> Joan

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
he wants to rush he's sending that Joan

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.350 
he wants to rush he's sending that Joan
off<00:02:22.160> because<00:02:22.370> he<00:02:22.400> wants<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> find<00:02:22.940> out<00:02:23.090> where

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
off because he wants to find out where

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.670 
off because he wants to find out where
the<00:02:23.450> turn<00:02:23.630> bases<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.200> he<00:02:24.260> said<00:02:24.410> his<00:02:24.530> over

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
the turn bases and he said his over

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the turn bases and he said his over
around<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:24.950> he's<00:02:25.190> going<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.459> find<00:02:25.610> that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
around and he's going to find that

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.040 
around and he's going to find that
generates<00:02:26.150> very<00:02:26.330> quickly<00:02:26.540> by<00:02:26.690> process<00:02:27.020> of

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
generates very quickly by process of

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.810 
generates very quickly by process of
elimination<00:02:27.110> not<00:02:27.980> himself<00:02:28.220> i<00:02:28.459> started<00:02:28.730> his

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
elimination not himself i started his

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.190 
elimination not himself i started his
barracks<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.209> sent<00:02:29.360> an<00:02:29.450> STD<00:02:29.750> out<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.080> he's

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
barracks and sent an STD out and he's

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.390 
barracks and sent an STD out and he's
trying<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.470> find<00:02:30.680> out<00:02:30.770> where<00:02:30.890> go<00:02:31.070> Russia<00:02:31.250> is

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
trying to find out where go Russia is

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.670 
trying to find out where go Russia is
it's<00:02:32.270> pretty<00:02:32.390> sounded<00:02:32.720> scouting<00:02:33.110> by<00:02:33.230> nada<00:02:33.410> I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
it's pretty sounded scouting by nada I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.320 
it's pretty sounded scouting by nada I
suspect<00:02:34.400> nada<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.700> probably<00:02:34.970> going<00:02:35.120> for<00:02:35.300> a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
suspect nada is probably going for a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.060 
suspect nada is probably going for a
standard<00:02:35.540> kind<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.900> one<00:02:36.050> factor<00:02:36.410> into

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
standard kind of one factor into

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.190 
standard kind of one factor into
expansion<00:02:37.550> build<00:02:37.760> but<00:02:38.510> he<00:02:38.600> hasn't<00:02:38.900> taken<00:02:38.959> his

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
expansion build but he hasn't taken his

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.449 
expansion build but he hasn't taken his
gas<00:02:39.380> yet<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:39.740> maybe<00:02:39.860> I'm<00:02:40.040> wrong<00:02:40.160> about<00:02:40.400> that

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
gas yet so maybe I'm wrong about that

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.350 
gas yet so maybe I'm wrong about that
not<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.480> go<00:02:42.230> rush<00:02:42.380> on<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> other<00:02:42.709> hand<00:02:42.920> has<00:02:43.360> put

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
not a go rush on the other hand has put

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.699 
not a go rush on the other hand has put
down<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.540> spawning<00:02:44.870> pool<00:02:45.080> he<00:02:45.260> did<00:02:45.410> not<00:02:45.530> put

down that spawning pool he did not put

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.380 
down that spawning pool he did not put
down<00:02:45.830> a<00:02:45.860> second<00:02:46.160> hatchery<00:02:46.520> so<00:02:46.970> that's<00:02:47.270> very

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
down a second hatchery so that's very

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.090 
down a second hatchery so that's very
interesting<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.959> note<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.290> he<00:02:48.709> has<00:02:48.890> he's

that<00:05:28.430> refinery<00:05:28.820> so<00:05:28.909> he's<00:05:29.030> gonna<00:05:29.120> have

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
that refinery so he's gonna have

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.140 
that refinery so he's gonna have
medicine<00:05:29.599> marine<00:05:29.780> soon<00:05:30.220> gosh<00:05:31.220> even<00:05:31.789> though<00:05:31.940> he

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
medicine marine soon gosh even though he

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.939 
medicine marine soon gosh even though he
did<00:05:32.570> inflict<00:05:32.960> significant<00:05:33.380> damage<00:05:33.620> or<00:05:33.740> not<00:05:33.860> as

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
did inflict significant damage or not as

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.439 
did inflict significant damage or not as
economy<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.370> fact<00:05:34.580> is<00:05:34.729> that<00:05:34.760> he<00:05:34.880> only<00:05:35.090> had<00:05:35.270> one

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
economy the fact is that he only had one

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.210 
economy the fact is that he only had one
hatchery<00:05:35.780> for<00:05:35.960> some<00:05:36.110> time<00:05:36.320> there<00:05:36.560> he<00:05:36.949> was<00:05:37.070> only

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
hatchery for some time there he was only

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.520 
hatchery for some time there he was only
producing<00:05:37.699> zerglings<00:05:38.120> not<00:05:38.300> drones<00:05:39.110> so<00:05:39.470> he

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
producing zerglings not drones so he

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.439 
producing zerglings not drones so he
doesn't<00:05:39.680> have<00:05:39.949> that<00:05:40.039> many<00:05:40.190> Jones<00:05:40.520> so<00:05:40.970> it's

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
doesn't have that many Jones so it's

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.850 
doesn't have that many Jones so it's
actually<00:05:41.780> even<00:05:41.990> though<00:05:42.199> I<00:05:42.260> thought<00:05:42.560> that<00:05:42.740> that

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
actually even though I thought that that

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
actually even though I thought that that
was<00:05:43.010> the<00:05:43.130> case<00:05:43.250> it's<00:05:43.430> actually<00:05:43.520> very<00:05:43.699> very

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
was the case it's actually very very

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.339 
was the case it's actually very very
hard<00:05:44.180> to<00:05:44.300> predict<00:05:44.539> whether<00:05:44.720> or<00:05:44.870> not<00:05:44.960> he<00:05:45.139> has

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
hard to predict whether or not he has

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.500 
hard to predict whether or not he has
actually<00:05:45.800> damaged<00:05:46.099> not<00:05:46.220> as<00:05:46.340> economy<00:05:46.760> enough

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
actually damaged not as economy enough

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.640 
actually damaged not as economy enough
with<00:05:47.599> this<00:05:47.720> rush<00:05:47.870> whether<00:05:48.080> this<00:05:48.229> rush<00:05:48.470> is

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
with this rush whether this rush is

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.170 
with this rush whether this rush is
gonna<00:05:48.860> pay<00:05:49.010> off<00:05:49.039> for<00:05:49.280> him<00:05:49.340> in<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:49.699> long<00:05:49.820> run<00:05:49.880> I

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
gonna pay off for him in the long run I

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.360 
gonna pay off for him in the long run I
do<00:05:50.479> feel<00:05:50.750> that<00:05:50.810> nada<00:05:51.080> has<00:05:51.289> a<00:05:51.530> lot<00:05:51.830> of<00:05:51.860> stds<00:05:52.280> he

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
do feel that nada has a lot of stds he

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.279 
do feel that nada has a lot of stds he
probably<00:05:52.550> has<00:05:52.760> as<00:05:53.090> many<00:05:53.360> if<00:05:53.539> not<00:05:53.570> more<00:05:53.780> stds

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
probably has as many if not more stds

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.260 
probably has as many if not more stds
than<00:05:54.440> go<00:05:54.590> rush<00:05:54.770> and<00:05:55.250> has<00:05:55.400> drones<00:05:55.699> and<00:05:55.909> so

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
than go rush and has drones and so

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.810 
than go rush and has drones and so
therefore<00:05:56.560> definitely<00:05:57.560> not<00:05:58.520> a<00:05:58.550> let's<00:05:58.760> find

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
therefore definitely not a let's find

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.159 
therefore definitely not a let's find

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.180 
himself in a decent position and we
