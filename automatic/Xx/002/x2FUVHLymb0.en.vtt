00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.939
 car 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:14.810
 Today I will talk about how to follow the eyes 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:19.460
 First of all please take a look at Chubu degree here 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:24.940
 Tomatoes that were originally painted and grown with black columns 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:28.480
 Tomatoes with green pillars are grown without sprouting 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:34.960
 How is growth not different 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:37.640
 The black pillar is standing and the shape of the sun is straight and the tip is thick 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.230
 It is getting bigger after 3 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.110
 How about a tomato on which a green pillar stands 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.020
 The stalks are fluttering 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.030
 You have can want many leaves at the bottom 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:56.730
 Even a little smaller 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.300
 If you look at this, it is important that drawing is smart cultivation, though 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.980
 I think it can be seen 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:10.570
 Today we will talk about how do I doing in the wind say if oysters bud 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:14.200
 In divided into three with the artist will talk 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.250
 What is it that I first one eye first place 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.930
 The second is how to sprout at b timing 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.230
 Hmm 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.190
 How should I do it when I say that nails have been delayed for mechanization ? 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.900
 about 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.900
 I will talk about these three 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:41.280
 So what is the car in the first book 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:46.610
 It says a small window comes out leaves next if there is a straight mouth of one 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.659
 It extends diagonally between these pips and leaves 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:55.810
 I call this woman a side eye 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:58.760
 If this is burnt out, it will grow more and more quickly and the tomato will nourish 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:05.070
 I will collect there 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:13.830
 I call it an eye book so that I take this side bud and take it 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:15.730
 So the first purpose is how to find this side bud 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:24.319
 Like this 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:29.270
 Please look for a side bud what is out there with a mouth and a leaf . 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:31.520
 There is a leaf here and there is a mouth in the upper row 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.930
 What is coming out to give up 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:40.090
 I understand that this is also a decision 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.090
 The following is the way in the second 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:49.840
 I will take it by hand if I know the place of the side bud 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:55.920
 When the side buds are about to be jammed by hand 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:03:00.830
 Please pinch with your thumb and forefinger and pull it towards you 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:05.580
 You can easily get it from the root with this 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:13.700
 Let's also shoot the side bud of one more upper stage 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:16.330
 If it is about that size , hold it with your finger and pull it in the same way. 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.330
 I will 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.490
 Then the third 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.830
 I will talk about how to take it when the sprout has grown too much 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.920
 As before 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.930
 I 'm out of the space between my favorite and leaves 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:38.550
 Find a division 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:44.280
 Sometimes the side buds tried to take in hand and increases about this 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.720
 There is a possibility of falling into the stem, so use scissors when it gets too large 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.120
 I will 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.780
 From the root with a pair of scissors 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.780
 Please enter 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.390
 The next bud is a big shot 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:02.630
 Here too 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:07.280
 Find stems and leaves and check that they are coming out from there 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:10.060
 This Wakime that night will look if another 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.500
 The fruit is coming 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.230
 But 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.230
 Please take care of these side eyes 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.350
 In Usami 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.350
 We have seen from the root 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:37.920
 Now would take to write a lot of side shoots directly below 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:43.700
 It was very refreshing compared to before I wrote it 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:51.070
 In the future , it will come out more and more on the deciding side 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:51.070
 Please look for the division coming out between the mouth and the leaf 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:00.070
 Only one over there was actually last 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.070
 I have left my badge eyes 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.270
 In the case of meet again 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.350
 When not telling 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.729
 It is also possible to make only a sentence a strange star and a Japanese history cate 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:16.729
 At that time 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:17.590
 Please choose the woman who waits for the unreasonable use Sakurai of the machine as much as possible 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.340
 And 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.370
 This side- eye is also good 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.889
 Stand up 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.500
 I will make it with a strap and say 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:33.150
 in this way 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.150
 It is said that the use Japan Koshido nurturing is two tailoring
