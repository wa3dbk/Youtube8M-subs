00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.799
 one of Latin America in this video 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.639
 I will work on the classification of 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.970
 bacteria in large positive or gram 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.780
 negative 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.780
 the cell wall 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.230
 mariah 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.490
 in complexity between bacteria and that 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.450
 difference allowed him in the year 1884 to 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.450
 cristian great 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.239
 and develop a staining technique 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.820
 and the same 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.260
 and allowed him to classify and allows us 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.610
 currently classify the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.100
 bacteria in two large groups 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.570
 either great positive 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.570
 or negative gram 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.030
 and this division is based on the fact 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.159
 that given the differences in 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.020
 structure and composition of the wall 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.030
 cellular bacteria are taken from 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.409
 different color when using the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.619
 grain staining technique 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:19.609
 let's see what this technique consists of 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.609
 let's see in detail the procedure 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.480
 the stain if one would have to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.340
 classifying it is differential attention 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.340
 as we saw in previous videos 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.210
 a smear or spread fixed to the heat 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:45.100
 with the dye called crystal violet 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.200
 then the spread is washed with water and 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.360
 it is treated successively with another 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.360
 coloring called lugo 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.750
 then a coloring agent is applied 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.380
 and in this case it's going to be alcohol and 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.380
 acetone 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.400
 and finally a dye with contrast 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.400
 contrast dye 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.709
 as is the case with saffron inah 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.709
 gram positive bacteria 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.959
 here we will see in particular how it looks 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.950
 at the microscopic level and the large 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.069
 great positives are going to retain the crystal 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.500
 violet look here the elongated ones in a 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.560
 violet color and therefore they are going to 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.689
 see that intense violet color 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.359
 while the big ones lose that 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:49.120
 violet color with decolorizing agent 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.410
 and take a reddish tint by effect 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.750
 of saffron inah 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.690
 the cell wall of this type of 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.210
 bacteria is thinner than those of 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.910
 great positive and also the composition 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.790
 of the bacteria cell wall 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.710
 Gram-negative not only contain 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.750
 glycan peptides but also a 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.930
 external layer with a high percentage of 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.700
 lipids let's see a scheme here are 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.060
 named some differences that is 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.270
 let's see color differences in 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.770
 this case red in this case blue a 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.150
 difference of wall composition 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.220
 cellular makes it react in a way 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.600
 different with the color with the 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.600
 coloring procedure 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.650
 and now let's see schematically how it 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.650
 come 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.020
 these bacteria look at the location of 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.090
 scourge 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.420
 look at the composition of the membrane 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.430
 external of the cell wall notice that 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.550
 you just see the layers of lipids that 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.280
 we mentioned new and then good to 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.890
 from the cytoplasm the composition is 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.610
 similar but outside of it 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.330
 the composition then differs by title 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.330
 of summary 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.750
 the differences between these bacteria is 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.480
 the great positive is going to dye 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.290
 violet are going to be sensitive to the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.359
 antibiotics and if they are treated with 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.950
 degrading enzymes departing glycans 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.680
 they can originate a proto dish 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.050
 in the case of good farms are going to 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.970
 be looking at a microscope at a 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.000
 once that technique is practiced in 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.120
 reddish color composition of the wall 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.290
 cellular is made up of 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.050
 peptidoglycan and lipids and if the 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.360
 bacteria present polar flagella is 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.300
 say a scourge on a pole are going to 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.819
 belong to the group of farms 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.650
 If this type of bacteria are treated 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.540
 with party degrading enzymes 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.330
 american are going to originate 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.480
 a spherical dish and that from the point of 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.250
 osmotic view the spherical dish is a 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.760
 structure less fragile than proto 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.760
 plate 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.860
 educational I recommend the following 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.860
 videos so you can keep learning
