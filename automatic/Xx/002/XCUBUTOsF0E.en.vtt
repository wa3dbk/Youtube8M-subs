00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.220
 110 120 need to be pretty rich 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.410
 to afford to buy one of 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.410
 new iPhones September 19 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.060
 although in 2014 the delay between their 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.980
 global sales and 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.919
 we have only a week of sales start 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.110
 wanting to buy an iphone 6 or 6 plus up 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.570
 September 26 is more than enough 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.210
 in the evening of day x to Moscow to various stores 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.690
 About a thousand iPhones arrived in two 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.750
 options 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.150
 some laid out 120 thousand to 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.920
 in the evening brag to your friends when 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.130
 this official prices at six 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.640
 will be from 32 to 42 thousand for a small 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.860
 six and from 37 to 47 for a big plus 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.110
 choose from three options here 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.510
 such a golden black gray and white 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.790
 casing is curious by the way what are the options 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.159
 Memory also 3 they are 416 64 and 128 gigabytes 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.619
 where are 32 gigs gone? 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.350
 knows maybe then added well and immediately 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.570
 answer the main question iphone 6 plus 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.850
 is it a shovel or not very personally to me 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.770
 it seems that all the same shovel he of course 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.570
 fits in the pocket of men's jeans I 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.140
 calmly sit in the chair going up 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.540
 the stairs 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.430
 but he's really big five and a half 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.530
 inches for my taste too 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.320
 but conditionally small six 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.450
 proved to be very comfortable 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.320
 4.7 inches diagonally fit very 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.540
 compact body 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.190
 the thickness of the gadget is only six point nine 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.659
 tenths of a millimeter 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.940
 of course one hundred twenty nine grams 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.520
 convenience amenities but overall design 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.560
 controversial again for my taste firstly 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.780
 he again became slick with me like 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.900
 earlier but still the five turned out to be 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.130
 sleeker and more these plastic lines in 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.140
 thicker than aluminum case 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.479
 I can not get rid of the association with 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.850
 half - timbered style is somehow not very chaotic 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.190
 It turned out besides the questions causes 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.439
 cameras take off these 8 megapixels 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.450
 still cooler camera even 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.939
 taught how to make time-lapse and slow motion with 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.750
 at 240 frames per second but she 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.789
 bulges out 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.560
 it is clear that otherwise it was just not 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.269
 fit but scratch will be on 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.340
 the last ipod touch was the same 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.709
 history by the way 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.380
 shooting it seems to be unaffected and I now 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.410
 clean at 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.420
 ethics otherwise everything is perfect almost 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.130
 no brakes complete copy of the old 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.960
 iphone is loading from ayklaud 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.030
 and here in your hand the same iphone only 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.090
 with bigger diagonal and more powerful 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.490
 new apple a8 dual-core chipset 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.800
 cyclone processor with a frequency of 1 integer 4 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.700
 tenths gigahertz gigabytes of RAM and 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.800
 graphics power gx60 650 is also 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.020
 separate process im8 which 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.970
 tracks steps and processes other 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.710
 interesting data which then 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.990
 sent to the new health app 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.240
 for example he gets information from 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.040
 barometer that determines how much you 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.250
 passed today flight of stairs 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.780
 still from the innovations nfc chip here it is 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.490
 used exclusively for 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.320
 telephone interactions with billing 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.940
 terminals but for mating with 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.400
 other gadgets are no good 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.140
 this whole thing called apple pay and 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.300
 Apple has even agreed with many 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.160
 shopping and restaurant so already on 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.530
 start this chip is not useless 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.360
 cling to the tube bank card and she 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.900
 there is extremely secure begins to live his 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.120
 life 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.610
 no pins need only attach 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.100
 finger touch ah di which of course is nowhere 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.410
 did not go away really important reservation all this 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.260
 not yet about Russia but about the states all 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.120
 the above applies to iphone 6 plus with 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.860
 the only difference is that he has a diagonal 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.030
 more than five and a half inches and 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.800
 Resolution is not 750 by 1334 a full hd 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.960
 reach for the far corner of the screen 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.300
 certainly problematic so the floor 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.070
 came up with a clever chip double tap on 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.740
 home button shifts all content 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.140
 display down further action or else 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.540
 one double tap returns everything to 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.910
 its circles are generally very comfortable though 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.770
 tab and the processor does not always work 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.840
 The big iPhone is the same but works on 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.880
 higher frequency and battery and 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.540
 Of course there is more where to roam 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.810
 the usual iphone 6 is equipped with a battery on 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.580
 1810 milliampere hour and plus at 2915 not 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.590
 I know how anyone but I have all the gadgets 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.840
 traditionally land very quickly 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.690
 six lasted nearly 10 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.359
 hours but 6 plus all 12 but the most 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.889
 interesting begins naturally with ios 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.659
 8 which is installed in both models 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.430
 default in new operating 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:28.349
 system by double pressing the button 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.810
 home appears not only open 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.330
 programs but frequently called contacts 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.159
 tab removed from the notification center 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.229
 missed but added opportunity 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.210
 display there various widgets 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.499
 applications from pioneers in this area 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.229
 for example sport.ru 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:45.240
 or dropbox finally appeared in ios 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.219
 support for third-party keyboards is true 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.289
 while not very much yes and impression they 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.569
 produce inactive but fact and 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.009
 make me happy and the message has become very similar to 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.870
 Facebook chat is now possible 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.150
 send sound and video true by 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.699
 By default, they are stored in memory only 2 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.139
 minutes if they are not specifically save 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.060
 support appeared in the mail client 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.189
 gestures quick swipe from left to right 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.560
 transfer the letter to the archive and slow 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.990
 opens up such a small menu but 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.909
 gestures by the way, you can customize the spotlight 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.159
 trained to do search not only in the system 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.139
 but also in third-party applications as well 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.639
 Wikipedia in the settings item appeared 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.710
 menu where you can see what 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.749
 applications consume more energy 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.699
 though the system itself does not offer 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:26.550
 close the most voracious for some reason 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.229
 and it would be quite like apple siri 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.419
 now just like google assistant 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.219
 responds to voice command to 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.919
 start a business with an assistant can say 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.539
 in canned food and she will listen to the truth 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.879
 it works for some reason only if 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.330
 the device is connected to the network and its screen 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.819
 switched off 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.159
 strange great useful feature found 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.050
 in the built-in safari browser recognizes 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.789
 on the field sites to fill in the data 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.379
 plastic cards and offers 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.839
 scan card data from 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:54.089
 using the camera is very convenient in theory but 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:55.589
 I have never had a function 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.719
 family access will allow to take under 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.460
 control of buying aytyuns before buying 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:00.629
 applications children will have to seek 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.759
 parental approval 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.770
 without their permission an adult or just 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.129
 expensive software will remain lying in 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.990
 appstore 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.210
 Respectively now to one banking 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.370
 You can map up to six different cards. 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.229
 accounts and devices and icloud drive 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.389
 began to support simultaneous 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.490
 editing documents in the cloud but 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.589
 the main place in the repository is much 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.120
 cheaper for terabyte for example asks 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:23.399
 749 rubles per month 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.469
 cool but still twice as expensive as 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:28.199
 boxing in the morning in general like this 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.649
 apple makes the ecosystem better and better. 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.110
 it is better 

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:33.779
 wanted big screens in iPhones hold 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.129
 lava supporter in with please more 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.800
 places in the cloud for those 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.330
 and back 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.030
 a piece still grab and nafsi with 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.099
 a barometer and a bunch of small buns 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.930
 do not relax think yet about smart 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.940
 watches that appear in the fifteenth year 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.099
 I think it's all well thought out and 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.879
 logical but again personally me not 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:50.889
 scared 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:52.840
 I have it all on android in that 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.569
 or otherwise but with regard to quality 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.050
 performance here apple no match they 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.419
 Well done 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.370
 so you're suspecting you will soon run for 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.889
 new smartphones anyway for 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.639
 six plus still really very big 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.639
 and do not persuade
