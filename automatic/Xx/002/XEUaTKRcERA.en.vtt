00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
the next player gets their turn I would

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.640 
the next player gets their turn I would
assume<00:05:12.630> this<00:05:12.840> is<00:05:12.990> one<00:05:13.139> of<00:05:13.259> the<00:05:13.380> damaged

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
players but this pause can really break

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.920

the<00:05:17.759> flow<00:05:17.940> of<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.120> game<00:05:18.270> which<00:05:18.509> is<00:05:18.539> a<00:05:18.690> shame

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
the flow of the game which is a shame

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.629 
the flow of the game which is a shame
because<00:05:18.990> otherwise<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.800> experience<00:05:20.370> itself

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
because otherwise the experience itself

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.210 
because otherwise the experience itself
is<00:05:20.819> so<00:05:21.000> nicely<00:05:21.360> polished<00:05:21.569> you<00:05:22.530> will<00:05:22.710> see<00:05:22.979> it<00:05:23.099> in
