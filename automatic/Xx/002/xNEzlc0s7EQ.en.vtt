hey<00:00:00.930> everyone<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.500> will<00:00:01.680> from<00:00:01.709> be<00:00:02.129> energy

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hey everyone this is will from be energy

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.510 
hey everyone this is will from be energy
calm<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:03.410> I'm<00:00:04.410> going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.589> show<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.799> another

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
calm and I'm going to show you another

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.700 
calm and I'm going to show you another
way<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.730> benchmark<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:07.080> performance<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.680> your

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
way to benchmark the performance of your

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.780 
way to benchmark the performance of your
machine<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:09.230> I<00:00:10.230> downloaded<00:00:10.740> set<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> bench

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
machine and I downloaded set a bench

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.610 
machine and I downloaded set a bench
which<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.360> can<00:00:12.540> go<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.049> type<00:00:13.170> instead<00:00:13.500> of

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
which you can go and type instead of

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.839 
which you can go and type instead of
entering<00:00:13.740> Google<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.250> actually<00:00:14.490> go<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.670> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
entering Google and actually go to the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.880 
entering Google and actually go to the
website<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:15.540> it's<00:00:15.690> Maison<00:00:16.139> comm<00:00:16.619> or.org<00:00:18.890> or

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
website like it's Maison comm or.org or

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.790 
website like it's Maison comm or.org or
max<00:00:20.100> Ansari<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.960> then<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.170> run<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.470> comes

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
max Ansari and then you can run it comes

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.689 
max Ansari and then you can run it comes
in<00:00:22.920> 32-bit<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.640> 64-bit<00:00:23.699> versions<00:00:25.699> it's

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
in 32-bit and 64-bit versions it's

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.589 
in 32-bit and 64-bit versions it's
essentially<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> benchmark<00:00:27.779> built<00:00:28.050> inside<00:00:28.410> of

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
essentially a benchmark built inside of

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.110 
essentially a benchmark built inside of
their<00:00:31.369> 4d<00:00:32.399> software<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:33.300> they<00:00:33.480> use<00:00:33.660> for

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
their 4d software which they use for

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.700 
their 4d software which they use for
through<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.300> 3d<00:00:36.600> modeling<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.140> think<00:00:37.380> could<00:00:37.680> be

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
through not 3d modeling I think could be

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.889 
through not 3d modeling I think could be
wrong<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.149> basically<00:00:42.270> benchmark

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
wrong but so you can basically benchmark

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.360 
wrong but so you can basically benchmark
your<00:00:42.989> CPU<00:00:43.379> or<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.800> benchmark<00:00:44.100> your

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
your CPU or you can benchmark your

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.029 
your CPU or you can benchmark your
OpenGL<00:00:44.850> implementation<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.739> here

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
OpenGL implementation you can see here

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.229 
OpenGL implementation you can see here
that<00:00:47.539> where<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> highest<00:00:50.090> benchmarks<00:00:51.090> are

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that where the highest benchmarks are

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.069 
that where the highest benchmarks are
currently<00:00:51.780> being<00:00:51.989> found<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.420> your

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.720 

that's<00:00:58.079> actually<00:00:58.350> my<00:00:58.440> CP<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:58.949> there<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.219> 860

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that's actually my CP right there is 860

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.070 
that's actually my CP right there is 860
and<00:01:00.260> there<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:03.199> 960<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> there's<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
and there is the 960 and there's the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.399 
and there is the 960 and there's the
magny-cours<00:01:08.330> dual<00:01:09.330> processor<00:01:09.930> Opteron

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
magny-cours dual processor Opteron

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.820 
magny-cours dual processor Opteron
system<00:01:10.799> which<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> pair<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:12.170> 6-4<00:01:13.170> Opterons

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
system which is a pair of 6-4 Opterons

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.780 
system which is a pair of 6-4 Opterons
so<00:01:14.330> that's<00:01:15.330> pretty<00:01:15.570> DS<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.080> then<00:01:16.680> there's<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
so that's pretty DS and then there's the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760 
so that's pretty DS and then there's the
server<00:01:18.030> chips<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.200> eight<00:01:19.320> core<00:01:19.560> 16

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
server chips the the eight core 16

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.429 
server chips the the eight core 16
thread<00:01:20.189> server<00:01:20.490> chips<00:01:21.229> through<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
thread server chips through that is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.630 
thread server chips through that is
either<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.520> pair<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.990> dual<00:01:24.990> cores

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
either that or it's a pair of dual cores

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.010 
either that or it's a pair of dual cores
so<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.700> OpenGL<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.659> your<00:01:31.619> fire<00:01:31.829> pro

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
so and for OpenGL we have your fire pro

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.380 
so and for OpenGL we have your fire pro
you<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.079> they're<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.860> fire<00:01:35.040> GL<00:01:35.369> card<00:01:35.640> them

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you know they're the fire GL card them

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.960 
you know they're the fire GL card them
that's<00:01:36.960> off<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> mini<00:01:37.380> horse<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.579> intel<00:01:38.850> one

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that's off the mini horse the intel one

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.859 
that's off the mini horse the intel one
had<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> Quadro<00:01:39.509> FX<00:01:39.810> 5800<00:01:41.450> that's<00:01:42.450> actually

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
had a Quadro FX 5800 that's actually

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.200 
had a Quadro FX 5800 that's actually
that<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.610> machine<00:01:44.610> there's<00:01:44.970> actually

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that that machine there's actually

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.639 
that that machine there's actually
something<00:01:45.509> very<00:01:45.780> similar<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> what<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.500> at

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
something very similar to what I have at

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.969 
something very similar to what I have at
home

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.350 

you're<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.130> some<00:01:50.310> different<00:01:50.399> ones<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:50.970> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you're just some different ones here so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.100 
you're just some different ones here so
anyhow<00:01:51.630> let's<00:01:52.259> give<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.619> spin

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.040 

and<00:02:00.230> what<00:02:01.010> it's<00:02:01.130> doing<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.580> its<00:02:02.210> rendering<00:02:02.930> the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
and what it's doing is its rendering the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.960 
and what it's doing is its rendering the
scene<00:02:03.260> in<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:04.100> know<00:02:04.190> maxing<00:02:04.580> out<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.730> threads

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
scene in you know maxing out the threads

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.030 
scene in you know maxing out the threads
on<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.270> unit<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:05.720> seeing<00:02:06.410> how<00:02:06.530> fast<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:06.950> lead

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
on the unit and seeing how fast it lead

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.440 
on the unit and seeing how fast it lead
everything<00:02:07.280> done<00:02:07.580> mine's<00:02:07.970> actually<00:02:08.119> gonna<00:02:08.360> be

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
everything done mine's actually gonna be

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.030 
everything done mine's actually gonna be
a<00:02:08.479> little<00:02:08.600> slower<00:02:08.869> because<00:02:09.110> I'm<00:02:09.440> running<00:02:09.800> the

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
a little slower because I'm running the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.650 
a little slower because I'm running the
screen<00:02:10.520> capture<00:02:10.850> software<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.450> I've<00:02:11.510> got

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
screen capture software and I've got

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.570 
screen capture software and I've got
much<00:02:11.810> other<00:02:11.990> stuff<00:02:12.080> running<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:13.280> if<00:02:13.460> you

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
much other stuff running so if you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.430 
much other stuff running so if you
really<00:02:13.850> want<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.060> get<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.210> good<00:02:14.480> test<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.320> this

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
really want to get a good test on this

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.320 
really want to get a good test on this
you're<00:02:15.650> going<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.830> want<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.070> do<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.340> without

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
you're going to want to do it without

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:28.650 
you're going to want to do it without
other<00:02:17.840> programs<00:02:18.260> running<00:02:18.500> in<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> background

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.380 

and<00:02:29.620> what<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:29.860> will<00:02:29.980> let<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.220> do<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.580> set<00:02:31.300> of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
and what this will let you do is set of

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.090 
and what this will let you do is set of
benches<00:02:31.690> used<00:02:31.960> on<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> lot<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.470> the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
benches used on a lot of the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.890 
benches used on a lot of the
benchmarking<00:02:33.640> websites<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.720> if<00:02:34.780> you're

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
benchmarking websites so if you're

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.960 
benchmarking websites so if you're
sitting<00:02:35.050> here<00:02:35.380> going<00:02:35.560> well<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.100> know<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.460> see

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
sitting here going well you know I see

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.670 
sitting here going well you know I see
all<00:02:37.030> these<00:02:37.120> new<00:02:37.300> processors<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.260> which<00:02:38.470> one's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
all these new processors and which one's

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.740 
all these new processors and which one's
better<00:02:38.890> for<00:02:39.010> me<00:02:39.340> or<00:02:39.610> how<00:02:39.910> much<00:02:40.180> better<00:02:40.450> are

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
better for me or how much better are

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.570 
better for me or how much better are
they<00:02:40.900> than<00:02:41.080> mine<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:42.310> will<00:02:42.430> actually

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
they than mine and this will actually

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.840 
they than mine and this will actually
give<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> real<00:02:43.900> number<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.550> can<00:02:45.670> look

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
give you a real number that you can look

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:57.030 
give you a real number that you can look
at

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.460 

I<00:02:57.069> hope<00:02:57.909> it's<00:02:58.090> only<00:02:58.180> one<00:02:58.420> scene<00:02:58.750> boys<00:02:59.260> might<00:02:59.440> be

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
I hope it's only one scene boys might be

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.730 
I hope it's only one scene boys might be
sitting<00:02:59.800> here<00:02:59.890> a<00:02:59.950> while

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.170 

I've<00:03:06.740> personally<00:03:07.250> never<00:03:07.430> actually<00:03:07.850> use<00:03:08.000> this

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
I've personally never actually use this

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.360 
I've personally never actually use this
and<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.450> might<00:03:08.630> take<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:09.500> try<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.920> out<00:03:10.070> on<00:03:10.100> my

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
and I might take it and try it out on my

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.420 
and I might take it and try it out on my
on<00:03:10.970> my<00:03:11.750> home<00:03:11.930> machine<00:03:11.960> and<00:03:12.800> then<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.040> laptop

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
on my home machine and then the laptop

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.580 
on my home machine and then the laptop
to<00:03:13.670> those<00:03:14.210> laptops<00:03:14.750> got<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:15.020> quad<00:03:15.290> core<00:03:15.530> and

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
to those laptops got a quad core and

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.670 
to those laptops got a quad core and
some<00:03:15.830> relatively<00:03:16.370> decent<00:03:17.170> decent<00:03:18.170> hardware

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
some relatively decent decent hardware

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:32.000 
some relatively decent decent hardware
and

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.660 

all<00:03:32.940> right<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:33.629> see<00:03:33.870> other<00:03:34.830> stuff<00:03:35.129> on<00:03:35.250> my<00:03:35.430> on

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
all right as we see other stuff on my on

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.910 
all right as we see other stuff on my on
my<00:03:35.819> machine<00:03:36.170> gotta<00:03:37.170> bring<00:03:37.409> in<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.560> score<00:03:37.739> down

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
my machine gotta bring in the score down

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.710 
my machine gotta bring in the score down
but<00:03:40.310> yeah<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.640> can<00:03:41.730> test<00:03:42.030> against<00:03:42.299> identical

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
but yeah you can test against identical

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.869 
but yeah you can test against identical
systems<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.440> other<00:03:44.010> systems<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:47.790> know

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
systems and other systems and you know

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.640 
systems and other systems and you know
actually<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.599> change<00:03:49.140> like<00:03:49.349> what<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
actually you can change like what the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.259 
actually you can change like what the
what's<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:53.280> details<00:03:53.700> are<00:03:53.910> for<00:03:54.090> each<00:03:54.150> of

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
what's the the details are for each of

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.630 
what's the the details are for each of
these<00:03:54.360> alright<00:03:54.750> let's<00:03:54.930> try<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.110> OpenGL<00:03:58.640> see

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
these alright let's try the OpenGL see

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.280 
these alright let's try the OpenGL see
if<00:03:59.730> it's<00:03:59.849> rendering<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.269> same<00:04:00.450> scene<00:04:00.720> or<00:04:00.840> not

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.479 

assume<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.410> would<00:04:07.560> be<00:04:07.739> just<00:04:08.069> because<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.430> how

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
assume it would be just because of how

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.050 
assume it would be just because of how
this<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:08.760> going

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
this is going

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.960 
this is going
hope<00:04:09.299> different<00:04:09.720> scene<00:04:13.400> different<00:04:14.400> rendering

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
hope different scene different rendering

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:24.560 
hope different scene different rendering
technique<00:04:15.390> everything

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.690 

what<00:04:25.440> if<00:04:25.530> it's<00:04:25.680> actually<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.100> FPS<00:04:26.490> they're

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
what if it's actually the FPS they're

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.190 
what if it's actually the FPS they're
getting<00:04:26.940> on<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.210> is<00:04:27.480> their<00:04:27.720> what<00:04:27.930> they<00:04:28.050> might

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
getting on it is their what they might

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:45.680 
getting on it is their what they might
be<00:04:28.320> measuring<00:04:30.020> looks<00:04:31.020> pretty<00:04:31.260> solid<00:04:31.470> though

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.400 

all<00:04:46.690> righty<00:04:46.930> so<00:04:47.650> as<00:04:48.340> you<00:04:48.460> see<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.730> 4850<00:04:49.300> is<00:04:49.630> the

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
all righty so as you see the 4850 is the

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.040 
all righty so as you see the 4850 is the
older<00:04:50.590> generation<00:04:51.070> card<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:52.330> 4850<00:04:52.780> and

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
older generation card and the 4850 and

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.740 
older generation card and the 4850 and
the<00:04:53.130> 5750<00:04:54.130> are<00:04:54.250> what<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.430> say<00:04:54.550> this<00:04:54.730> is<00:04:54.880> 5770

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
the 5750 are what the say this is 5770

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.780 
the 5750 are what the say this is 5770
so<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:56.620> actually<00:04:57.130> is<00:04:57.220> about<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.550> same

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
so this actually is about the same

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:04.970 
so this actually is about the same
strength<00:04:58.360> as<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:59.050> 4870<00:04:59.920> down<00:05:00.040> here<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:03.000> sorry

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
strength as this 4870 down here so sorry

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.610 
strength as this 4870 down here so sorry
Poulter<00:05:05.980> Intel's<00:05:06.280> Aeons<00:05:09.180> so<00:05:10.180> this<00:05:10.780> is<00:05:11.020> set<00:05:11.590> a

your processor and your graphics card

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.000 
your processor and your graphics card
it's<00:05:16.450> not<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.660> complete<00:05:17.080> benchmark<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.650> graphics

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
it's not a complete benchmark a graphics

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.070 
it's not a complete benchmark a graphics
card<00:05:18.190> because<00:05:18.430> OpenGL<00:05:19.090> implementations<00:05:19.720> tend
