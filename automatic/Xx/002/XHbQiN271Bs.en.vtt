is professional strength and you can see
the<00:01:41.119> little<00:01:41.330> crystals<00:01:41.630> here<00:01:42.080> that<00:01:42.260> got<00:01:42.350> the

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
the little crystals here that got the

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.859 
the little crystals here that got the
bot<00:01:42.619> let<00:01:42.830> me<00:01:42.920> just<00:01:43.159> pop<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:43.580> away<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:44.150> you<00:01:44.720> can

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
wanting and waiting for now on your

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.460 
wanting and waiting for now on your
screen<00:02:17.299> you're<00:02:18.169> going<00:02:18.290> to

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
screen you're going to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.080 
screen you're going to
see<00:02:18.590> how<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:18.800> magic<00:02:19.310> works<00:02:19.520> now<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.790> see<00:02:19.970> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
see how that magic works now you see the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.430 
see how that magic works now you see the
thermicon<00:02:20.480> technology<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:21.050> actually

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
thermicon technology is actually

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.800 
thermicon technology is actually
hovering<00:02:21.740> above<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.190> skin<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:23.090> never<00:02:23.660> even

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
hovering above the skin it never even

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.140 
hovering above the skin it never even
has<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.410> touch<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.100> skin<00:02:25.400> that's<00:02:25.880> how

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
has to touch the skin that's how

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.060 
has to touch the skin that's how
advanced<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.780> technology<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:27.740> we<00:02:27.860> say

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
advanced this technology is so we say

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.040 
advanced this technology is so we say
virtually<00:02:28.280> pain-free<00:02:28.760> all<00:02:29.450> you're<00:02:29.690> feeling

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
virtually pain-free all you're feeling

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.480 
virtually pain-free all you're feeling
is<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.170> little<00:02:30.560> bit<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.770> warmth<00:02:31.100> from<00:02:31.250> that

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
is a little bit of warmth from that

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.510 
is a little bit of warmth from that
thermicon<00:02:32.480> technology<00:02:32.720> but<00:02:33.620> again<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.340> way

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
thermicon technology but again the way

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.640 
thermicon technology but again the way
the<00:02:34.550> technology<00:02:35.270> is<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.930> technology<00:02:36.500> is

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
the technology is the technology is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.130 
the technology is the technology is
recessed<00:02:37.280> into<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.790> machine<00:02:38.210> so<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.870> never

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
recessed into the machine so it never

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.470 
recessed into the machine so it never
ever<00:02:39.530> touches<00:02:40.190> your<00:02:40.400> skin<00:02:40.580> but<00:02:41.000> at<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.240> same

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
ever touches your skin but at the same

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.270 
ever touches your skin but at the same
