now doing some scouting and now putting
a<00:00:46.410> pylon<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.960> this<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> very<00:00:49.410> very

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
a pylon here so this is a very very

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.950 
a pylon here so this is a very very
strange<00:00:50.280> place<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> place<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> pile<00:00:51.809> on

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
strange place to place it on a pile on

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.040 
strange place to place it on a pile on
it<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> more<00:00:52.530> along<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> lines<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:54.059> trying<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
it is more along the lines of trying to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.049 
it is more along the lines of trying to
I<00:00:55.079> guess<00:00:55.199> fake<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:55.980> opponent<00:00:56.520> into<00:00:56.670> thinking

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
I guess fake your opponent into thinking

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
I guess fake your opponent into thinking
that<00:00:57.090> he's<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> proxy<00:00:58.350> gateway<00:00:58.800> so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that he's going for a proxy gateway so

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.459 
that he's going for a proxy gateway so
this<00:00:59.430> one<00:00:59.640> probe<00:01:00.000> down<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.629> milk<00:01:01.199> make

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
this one probe down here milk make

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.460 
this one probe down here milk make
another<00:01:02.160> gateway<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.359> then<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.199> he<00:01:04.290> gets

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
another gateway here and then if he gets

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.870 
another gateway here and then if he gets
a<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.830> gateway<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.309> he's<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.760> now

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
a one gateway if he's going for now

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.270 
a one gateway if he's going for now
going<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> forge<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.290> he's<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:07.680> moving<00:01:07.979> out

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
going for a forge so he's now moving out

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
going for a forge so he's now moving out
with<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> forge<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.210> trying<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.630> uh<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:10.290> guess

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
with a forge and trying to do uh I guess

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.890 
with a forge and trying to do uh I guess
a<00:01:10.680> cannon<00:01:11.189> rush<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
a cannon rush and what you can do as a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.109 
a cannon rush and what you can do as a
Protoss<00:01:13.470> player<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.310> warp<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.880> pile

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
Protoss player is you can warp in a pile

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
Protoss player is you can warp in a pile
on<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.619> work<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
on here and then as you work in the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.249 
on here and then as you work in the
pylon<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:17.520> walk<00:01:17.820> around<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.720> probe

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
pylon then walk around with your probe

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499 
pylon then walk around with your probe
and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.860> get<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> start<00:01:20.729> warping<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.150> cannons

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and then get a start warping in cannons

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
and then get a start warping in cannons
and<00:01:21.630> additional<00:01:22.080> pylons<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.040> see

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and additional pylons here you can see

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.469 
and additional pylons here you can see
that<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.580> probe<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.939> currently<00:01:24.210> walking

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that the probe is currently walking

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.450 
that the probe is currently walking
around<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> map<00:01:25.229> trying<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.920> figure<00:01:26.159> out<00:01:26.220> what

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
around the map trying to figure out what

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.399 
around the map trying to figure out what
exactly<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:27.090> happening<00:01:27.299> inside<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.930> base<00:01:28.080> he

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
exactly is happening inside the base he

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.499 
exactly is happening inside the base he
knows<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.890> something<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.430> definitely<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:30.060> as

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
knows that something is definitely up as

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.450 
knows that something is definitely up as
there<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.079> currently<00:01:31.439> nothing<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.250> at<00:01:32.280> all

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
there is currently nothing here at all

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.510 
there is currently nothing here at all
and<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.509> he's<00:01:34.110> got<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.710> aware<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and now he's got to be aware of the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880 
and now he's got to be aware of the
cheese<00:01:35.790> moving<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.259> probe

here<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.460> exactly<00:01:38.909> sure<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.479> probe

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
here not exactly sure what this probe

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.080 
here not exactly sure what this probe
plans<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.259> doing<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.159> he<00:01:41.310> doesn't<00:01:41.729> he's<00:01:41.909> now

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
plans on doing so he doesn't he's now

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.030 
plans on doing so he doesn't he's now
sitting<00:01:42.450> down<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> double<00:01:43.170> pile<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.590> over<00:01:43.860> here

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
sitting down a double pile on over here

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.190 
sitting down a double pile on over here
so<00:01:44.220> one<00:01:44.579> pile<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:44.939> down<00:01:45.149> second<00:01:45.780> pile<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.079> down

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
so one pile on down second pile on down

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.440 
so one pile on down second pile on down
and<00:01:46.350> he's<00:01:46.439> double<00:01:46.829> pile<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.250> blocking<00:01:47.759> another

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and he's double pile on blocking another

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.840 
and he's double pile on blocking another
Protoss<00:01:49.020> player<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> very<00:01:50.490> common

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
Protoss player this is a very common

Protoss player this is a very common
strategy<00:01:51.450> against<00:01:52.110> zerg<00:01:52.579> but<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
strategy against zerg but this is the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.359 
strategy against zerg but this is the
first<00:01:54.060> time<00:01:54.509> I've<00:01:54.750> ever<00:01:54.780> seen<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.350> against<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
first time I've ever seen this against a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.520 
first time I've ever seen this against a
Protoss<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.270> what<00:01:57.479> what<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.200> end<00:01:58.409> up

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
Protoss so what what is going to end up

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.740 
Protoss so what what is going to end up
happening<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.189> photon<00:02:00.119> cannons<00:02:00.450> will<00:02:00.630> be

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
happening is that photon cannons will be

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.959 
happening is that photon cannons will be

see here if you go back to the game and

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.460 
see here if you go back to the game and
you<00:04:04.160> can<00:04:04.370> see<00:04:04.580> what<00:04:04.790> exactly<00:04:05.360> insolence<00:04:06.170> did<00:04:06.440> I

you can see what exactly insolence did I

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.229 
you can see what exactly insolence did I
need<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.830> proverb<00:04:07.160> perhaps<00:04:07.519> move<00:04:07.790> this<00:04:08.000> and

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
need the proverb perhaps move this and

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.240 
need the proverb perhaps move this and
then<00:04:08.330> actually<00:04:08.630> get<00:04:08.870> back<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.650> point<00:04:10.130> in

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
then actually get back to that point in

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.520 
then actually get back to that point in
the<00:04:10.400> game<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.820> try<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.420> show<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.750> if<00:04:12.110> you<00:04:12.380> guys

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
the game and try to show you if you guys

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.979 
the game and try to show you if you guys
did<00:04:12.769> not<00:04:12.890> catch<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.400> second<00:04:13.820> time<00:04:13.850> so<00:04:14.600> I

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
did not catch it the second time so I

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.500 
did not catch it the second time so I
think<00:04:15.320> it's<00:04:15.680> around<00:04:15.799> here<00:04:16.039> somewhere<00:04:16.310> I<00:04:16.549> got

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
think it's around here somewhere I got

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.360 
think it's around here somewhere I got
plenty<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.870> time<00:04:18.020> in<00:04:18.200> this<00:04:18.289> video<00:04:18.530> okay<00:04:19.130> so<00:04:19.190> you

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
plenty of time in this video okay so you

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.710 
plenty of time in this video okay so you
can<00:04:19.400> see<00:04:19.609> those<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.789> probe<00:04:20.180> down<00:04:20.390> here<00:04:20.630> I'm

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
can see those a probe down here I'm

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.310 
can see those a probe down here I'm
going<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.900> slow<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.140> down

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320
