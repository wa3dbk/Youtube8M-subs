ever seen them their false lashes for a
book<00:04:41.449> can't<00:04:42.319> get<00:04:42.560> much<00:04:42.710> better<00:04:42.770> than<00:04:43.009> that

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:43.189 
book can't get much better than that

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.040 
book can't get much better than that
this<00:04:43.759> one<00:04:43.939> has<00:04:44.060> some<00:04:44.090> lint<00:04:44.509> on<00:04:44.689> it<00:04:44.780> or

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
this one has some lint on it or

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.540 
this one has some lint on it or
something<00:04:45.080> like<00:04:45.439> that<00:04:45.500> it's<00:04:45.830> not<00:04:46.039> part<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.460> the

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
something like that it's not part of the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.450 
something like that it's not part of the
lashes<00:04:46.759> it's<00:04:47.210> just<00:04:47.500> some<00:04:48.500> fuzzies<00:04:49.009> on<00:04:49.189> there<00:04:49.430> i

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
lashes it's just some fuzzies on there i

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.059 
lashes it's just some fuzzies on there i
guess<00:04:49.759> from<00:04:50.090> when<00:04:50.210> they<00:04:50.330> packaged<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:51.069> but

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069

guess from when they packaged it but
there<00:04:52.580> are<00:04:52.639> two<00:04:52.759> different<00:04:53.060> styles<00:04:54.639> this

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
there are two different styles this

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.249

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
one's like a little bit thinner and

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.749 
one's like a little bit thinner and
these<00:05:00.259> are<00:05:00.440> for<00:05:00.620> like<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.860> more<00:05:01.099> volume<00:05:01.610> eyes

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759
