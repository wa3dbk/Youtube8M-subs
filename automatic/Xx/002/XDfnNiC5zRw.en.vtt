depth<00:00:30.149> of<00:00:30.390> your<00:00:30.509> instrument<00:00:30.930> I<00:00:31.140> picked<00:00:31.860> this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
depth of your instrument I picked this

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.610 
depth of your instrument I picked this
up<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.489> four<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.450> try<00:00:33.690> out<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.050> live<00:00:34.260> setting

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
up for four to try out in a live setting

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.950 
up for four to try out in a live setting
and<00:00:34.920> try<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.309> more<00:00:35.489> natural<00:00:36.000> sound<00:00:36.270> up

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and try to get more natural sound up

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.290 
and try to get more natural sound up
close<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.890> know<00:00:37.920> more<00:00:38.220> volume<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.880> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
close and you know more volume of the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360 
close and you know more volume of the
monitors<00:00:39.720> and<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.960> kind<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.200> thing<00:00:40.410> but

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
monitors and that kind of thing but

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.090 
monitors and that kind of thing but
today<00:00:41.670> we're<00:00:41.910> using<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:43.019> record<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.679> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
today we're using it to record with and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
today we're using it to record with and
just<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> try<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.269> how<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.480> might<00:00:45.629> work

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
just to try and see how it might work

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.479 
just to try and see how it might work
out<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.019> the<00:00:46.260> use<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:46.859> instructional

out for the use of these instructional

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.630 
out for the use of these instructional
videos<00:00:48.019> so<00:00:49.019> far<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.530> seems<00:00:49.859> to<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> nice

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
videos so far it seems to have a nice

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.090 
videos so far it seems to have a nice
tight<00:00:50.969> sound<00:00:51.350> real<00:00:52.350> controllable<00:00:52.920> real

tight sound real controllable real

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400 
tight sound real controllable real
natural<00:00:53.339> I've<00:00:54.120> used<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.600> couple<00:00:54.809> times<00:00:55.019> live

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
natural I've used it a couple times live

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.009 
natural I've used it a couple times live
with<00:00:56.249> mixed<00:00:56.670> results<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.179> far<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.749> you<00:00:57.809> know

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
with mixed results so far but you know

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.439 
with mixed results so far but you know
every<00:00:58.499> time<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.800> introduce<00:00:59.339> a<00:00:59.789> condenser<00:01:00.239> mic

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
every time you introduce a condenser mic

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.079 
every time you introduce a condenser mic
into<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.499> live<00:01:01.739> setting<00:01:02.100> you're<00:01:02.489> relying<00:01:02.850> on

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
into a live setting you're relying on

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.330 
into a live setting you're relying on
the<00:01:04.700> the<00:01:05.700> PA<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.840> engineer<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:08.070> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the the PA and the engineer at that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.760 
the the PA and the engineer at that
particular<00:01:08.490> venue<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.260> comfortable<00:01:10.590> with

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
particular venue to be comfortable with

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
particular venue to be comfortable with
with<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.240> able<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.390> work<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> into

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
with it and to be able to work it into

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
with it and to be able to work it into
the<00:01:12.960> mix<00:01:13.259> so<00:01:13.500> I've<00:01:14.040> had<00:01:14.189> good<00:01:14.369> results<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the mix so I've had good results with it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.840 
the mix so I've had good results with it
so<00:01:15.180> far<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.570> I've<00:01:15.720> had<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.500> rough<00:01:17.159> night<00:01:17.189> with

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
so far and I've had a rough night with

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.870 
so far and I've had a rough night with
it<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.210> far<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:19.350> we'll<00:01:19.950> hopefully<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:20.549> get

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
it so far but we'll hopefully go get

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
it so far but we'll hopefully go get
some<00:01:21.090> live<00:01:21.509> footage<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.560> use<00:01:22.829> I'm<00:01:23.520> gonna

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
some live footage of it in use I'm gonna

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.730 
some live footage of it in use I'm gonna
use<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.149> in<00:01:24.210> two<00:01:24.360> applications<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.380> quieter

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
use it in two applications and quieter

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.240 
use it in two applications and quieter
venues<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.579> quieter<00:01:26.880> settings<00:01:27.770> I'll<00:01:28.770> use<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
venues and quieter settings I'll use it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.420 
venues and quieter settings I'll use it
by<00:01:29.369> itself<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:30.590> instrumentally<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> then

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
by itself and instrumentally and then

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.060 
by itself and instrumentally and then
for<00:01:33.090> larger<00:01:33.509> venues<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:34.049> louder<00:01:34.350> venues<00:01:34.860> or

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
for larger venues or louder venues or

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
for larger venues or louder venues or
when<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.430> necessary<00:01:35.640> I'll<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.990> coupled

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
when it's necessary I'll use it coupled

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.990 
when it's necessary I'll use it coupled
