00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
 tar 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.819
 Yup 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.290
 Mori roller shock 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.340
 Minion grand prix 2015 spring so that such words come in perfect 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:33.060
 The speed of the Aichi tournament was shocked 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:37.870
 Capricious Wash &amp; ball section as long as seen in the published video is almost air next 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.260
 It will be a very powerful race running on a compact course in full swing 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.260
 Had 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.670
 Tension look at this high-speed race Agarippanashi 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.450
 The machine for the Shinagawa tournament was completed on Sunday 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.240
 It is this 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:01:00.240
 s 2 chassis Manta Ray mark ii 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:03.360
 The concept of this machine is high revolution motor brake 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.080
 I considered only the limit speed on the slope 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:13.100
 It has become a machine of specification 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:16.820
 The tire diameter is the lowest in my history 22.53 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:23.060
 Remove the Suradan in order to compensate for the small tire diameter 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:27.100
 Digital Curves and Ops Penetration Risk Risks Corners A little faster 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.100
 It is set to run through 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:39.630
 Weight well into the listening hot water 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.630
 I changed the specification to strike the chassis directly instead of hitting the battery mainly 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.780
 Mosh &amp; ooh with whimsical 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.890
 The possibility of deviling is more than this is fancy 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.000
 I can not improve 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.600
 However, in the case of Tokyo only, it is the same as Aichi 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.120
 I expect to be a high speed race 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.730
 Number of store clerks in Tokyo 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:10.780
 800 e 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:17.380
 The reason is that with this number of people, high-speed layout is faster. 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:23.910
 However , company-wide first round course like the Niagara slope of the 2012 Japan Cup 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.910
 Isn't it also possible that there is no wash and ball that you often get out ? 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.940
 Anyway, motor is sprint one choice 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.630
 I cried for lack of speed while trying the same concept 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.600
 Audacity to exceed the results of the Au Grand Prix 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.600
 I think that want cut flying Deiki 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.600
 Thank you for watching this time
