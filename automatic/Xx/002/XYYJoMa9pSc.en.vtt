00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.250
 because in this video you come to teach 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.389
 one of the cars that I got into this 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.619
 it seems that it will seem right here 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.420
 I think it will take nothing to appear 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.980
 so quickly we're going to open it from 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.480
 internet to show you what cars before 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.039
 that you see in real life 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.510
 basically although not in life 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.340
 real because it's a game but it does not matter 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.869
 case in this video I can teach these 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.329
 cars guys the inter or koke t well 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.850
 llama costs 700 thousand dollars that costs 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.140
 a pasture and is then to see if they have 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.520
 a pretty white knight aesthetic and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 as you can see on the side something quite 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.840
 cool and asked to be a pretty car 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.460
 cool this here you have two 150 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.230
 kilometers of maximum speed 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.730
 it's enough to be a classic car it 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.739
 it seems quite the back 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.420
 I think that mainly because 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.760
 it is also a rocket it is effectively a 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.050
 I invent that you and good, well, I also 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.309
 fixed that is this car that is the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.989
 Chinese daddy that looks pretty like that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.699
 they put the one in part 1 of money 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.079
 dirty it was this one so this one did not 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.059
 session the plans and also in a video 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.449
 because it's pretty potato is the typical 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:13.240
 for tato idea 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:13.240
 2 km behind also here you have the 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:20.179
 I already think about the price 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.829
 here you have it is very cool pretty 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.159
 irma reminds me very much one that already 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.170
 but there were uncle and much besides 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.490
 you'll see that there was not once this part of 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.679
 authorization money if on behalf of 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.569
 effectively what we are now and if 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.920
 I do not remember badly, I like it a lot 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.719
 this is the talk with me remember 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.119
 very much uncle not but the back 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.229
 It is different or that seems not and why 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.490
 I stress the same cars I do not understand 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.369
 of iguazÃº is that we are going to see how 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.849
 it works the theme looks like a car 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.140
 pretty pretty pretty smart look 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.000
 in the lateral part has to a 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.619
 kind of line in chrome plan and 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.729
 many of us will already see how it situates in 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.130
 this car because also to order your 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.530
 sixth place of the topic and you see that it is not 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.060
 it can look quite the same so nothing 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.159
 well here we have it to put it already to butt 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.069
 of speed the roof is also something 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.380
 weird because you how to say the 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.970
 sticks holding the roof of the car 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.250
 so to speak they are like coloma 2 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.310
 also if not 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.640
 and we 're really cool it's cool to see 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.460
 let's do butt as well said 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.440
 and the python and you hear the captain I'm 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:29.069
 whistled and that there is as if I had 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.810
 that the return is very good and you have 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.060
 and as the thing existed before they employ 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.980
 like chrome of this statue is like this 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.270
 a little pellet is a pellet car 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.830
 we could say that it is quite low in 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.780
 This type of car is usually a little more 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.790
 the sad one is quite pretty under the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.580
 true but good is very cool 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.020
 sir cars for kids dies or 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.880
 dies with this is very cool very chuli 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.170
 very elegant the truth is that it is the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.290
 word that characterizes it that is 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.239
 pretty elegant and pretty pretty 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.660
 I only really like this kind of 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.060
 cars that we go back I like 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.590
 aesthetically fanatical here I dismiss the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.590
 it's really cool to leave a comment 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.180
 to not lose any gta video 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.480
 online the topic has been list of 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.480
