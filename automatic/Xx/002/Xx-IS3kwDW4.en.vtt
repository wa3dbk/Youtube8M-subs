00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.260
 metal metal 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.420

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.700
 sion is really siona is a 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.979
 photograph of the puppy that died and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.899

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.720
 a little better 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.580
 we take the impression in a 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.410
 very soft clay so as not to injure the 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.540
 little hand of the mascot and then 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.580
 works and melts both in aluminum or 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.950
 in bronze and then it gives something unique to 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.049
 lauro and then this stuffed animal is also 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.879
 an urn like this is designed 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.650
 especially for children because 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.870
 when they see the little box like it does not have 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.579
 a lot of meaning for them is not for 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.049
 play but if it is for they grant a 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.269
 most beautiful souvenir of the pet 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.459
 then this little stuffed animal has 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.470
 the ashes of your real dog and then 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.660
 they are like in his belly we are 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.269
 entering the farewell room this is 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.670
 a very important space and very apart 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.530
 sensitive for all people 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.940
 Tell me something, then come here 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.370
 the people to give him the last goodbye 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.349
 your pet puts the pet in a 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.750
 blanket is wrapped in a blanket to 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.540
 that is good is a little more enjoyable 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.280
 is not so aggressive to look at and that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.050
 same blanket is what they believe 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.030
 cremation is done then yes 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.430
 we recommend to the people what good think 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.959
 even before the pet dies what 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.300
 is what he wants to do so that in that 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.700
 then do not take them by surprise and 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.280
 they can make the decision but 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.870
 previous a little more calm we have 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.540
 Casita urns is also has 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.130
 liked people very much because 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.380
 they feel that remembrance of the little house of 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.020
 the pet we have this kitten urn 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.270

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.769
 a pendant in a necklace quoted this is the 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.350
 special cremation oven for

 Pets reaches around 800 degrees 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.430
 centigrade and the truth do not have 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.230
 conditioning a very subtle way to 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.760
 that the family is calm in the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.160
 time to say goodbye to your pet 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.250

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.100
 relief is one is an estllÃ©s or ceramic 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.330
 after that and also the casting and 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.280
 it looks like grandma with that 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.200
 and can personal can customize 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.450
 the polls in this way this is the 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.700
 sample of a hamster granny in 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.700
 plaster and that's how it would end up with 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.270
 aluminum you can also immortalize 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.270
