00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.920
 that's what we need to go 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.229
 instead of thinking the pro the programmer 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.659

 go through a lot of things 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.920
 that's why we went through a lot of companies in a formal tone to this 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.569
 figure was not very well 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.569
 in an announcement very well this we started to move forward 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:45.430

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.360
 I'm going to buy the project 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.930
 and if there is a historical success these things what we found very difficult 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.750
 but good good workers 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.189

 The company that made division at the time was the company's eighties 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:25.669
 huge sinkhole 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.009
 you go bigger than may your door 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:28.909

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.370
 isep decides to buy 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.110
 terra chan chan had qatar everything was all barbarian 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.270
 those things that happen in companies 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.969
 important and if this one quarter 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.389
 he walked walked way sales 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.650
 and someone decides you have to lower the costs 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.599
 have to throw people 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:49.819
 and they throw us 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.469
 same as the enormous luck 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.469
 that they throw us to the guy who was going to buy the project 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.089
 to struggle 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.520
 he said intimately in oberá 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.300

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.069
 in an ovation supplement in his work 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:07.610
 actually 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.900
 monitor or monitor 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.150
 what we do believe 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.389
 I fear that according to companies 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:13.939
 we have to pass 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.939
 for love I will not make way for the bow towards the market 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.039
 Inti Nicolás do the company that basically means investing 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.830
 works and money m in finishing developing this product of 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.740
 the development of that product that company and we said good we wanted 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.740
 we do not play that good let's see 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.639
 We should both be in Brazil 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:36.530
 I told myself 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.189
 to montevideo 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.189
 then what we did was 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.759
 Breogán was still working on the consulting part 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.249
 and I program or in grape and with 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:49.270
 costs we live minimum miniropera so you have an idea 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.669
 day to day mode what is our situation was 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.750
 I remember there is a political magazine of Uruguay 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.760
 let's say like in every country that leaves once a week but in the 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.810
 salt block montalt magazine and 1 2 dollars and northern masters 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:02.469
 per week 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:06.589
 and my dream was to be able to buy them smoke all week we could not 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.050
 buy the names of luxury bourbon 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.490
 war economy and war tcf 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.219
 and so we were basically the year 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:18.009
 85 apple without a first version in 89 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:20.259
 messi we had 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:25.699
 several years working on development I only develop working for inside 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.300
 for total despair 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.130
 of my family especially my in-laws what was asked while cabins 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:33.939
 and I will give him a hug 

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:36.939
 when he was going to go to work he stopped throwing the east 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.839
 but maybe the good news afterwards was little to enter after 

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:44.999
 continued with the passage of time he realized a progress betoret has 

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:45.790
 bet 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.580
 the site was the insurer 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.740
 to kill him also haiti cirh to that but in that moment of being cap 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.399
 convinced that it was fine via wi-fi 

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:54.629
 it was tenth 

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:55.889
 percent 

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:56.919
 the constant 

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:00.749
 how is it happening vesta conversation in the subway new york 

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:02.460
 to have a presence 

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.169
 in 30 countries 

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:05.520
 we should read 

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:12.550
 let's go if I'm allowed some time and when we can answer that question from 

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.949
 good
