00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.020
 the oldest was the code or me 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.700
 I enjoyed that I found more balanced 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:39.710
 so it was simple as well 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:42.020

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.760

 that I can not remember the right name only 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.689

 deepen a little more competitive only 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.000
 with a week that the guide gives 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.340
 somehow and then I decided to do this 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.460
 law that revokes and accepted today 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.180

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.530
 you discovered our discovered 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.799
 The reason is expensive and the one at the time I was

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:33.319
 more so like things locked afi 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.959
 the blocked appeal and the rules there 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.280
 too enjoy and optical and decided to start 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.129

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.220

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.639
 very 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:58.069
 I never in history but after the doc 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:00.200
 2 guy was the hard fountain 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.450
 now from afar i prefer that i live 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.569
 most noble is kind so you need 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.590
 more wins river and icv even who plays 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.239
 really not 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:14.959
 beauty is with this competitive position is 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.370
 I'm currently slayer and when you need to 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.979
 I did a little of the year, but I did not have 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:26.329
 your favorite weapons there are with 8 and 8 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:30.079
 n eh eh nobel 2 the very short and me 8 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.939
 and yet 94 is the fault for me to use her 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.439
 once in a while because she's appealed the type 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.939
 and it was not even punished will probably go 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.400
 be even more so because 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:40.639
 There's no way you can send a 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.979
 phase in which they cause lack and type and she 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.930
 loves mayor of all bodies so to 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:49.370
 m 16 of code 41 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:53.090
 beauty is how many championships you already 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.669
 won the face before I came in to pay 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.439
 lot of playing no field and 5 seriously 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.139
 and has participated in a club 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:03.049
 championship was the condominium 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:05.870
 Syndic anime thing is he defended 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.780
 so but only seriously so online me 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.590
 I won a news corp championship where 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.989
 Brazil, I think the name there is the 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.250
 place and put the gain was the only 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:21.500
 the time well by the time 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.040
 sensitivity you wear the veil two faces 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.080
 on bel 2 came back using four steps 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.790
 4 to 5 guys I'm varying a lot 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.860
 these two a good is remembering that 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.570
 how competitive does not staff use enough 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.090
 low sensitivity right 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.100
 sure there's no way there's no way you 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.480
 has competed accurately if you are using a 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.860
 Bus sensitivity 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.570
 You're not going to earn much easy money. 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.100
 accessibility with 6min of the girl does not 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.890
 there will be good 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.850
 Now the question here is very good is 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.470
 You sent here and it's a secret. 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:00.890
 I'll tell you later when he has not 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:03.050
 recording annual list right from 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.250
 When is it connected when you're like you? 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.440
 entered it 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.950
 so how did I talk in pond with the 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.290
 that was March 10th in the 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.810
 training and I went through the selective 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:20.020
 I think since 10 May while 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:24.470
 al hour in some sort of equipment 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.890
 phone the phone using the taison alex proya 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:31.280
 wore a top x 41 formerly my 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:34.490
 monitor one minute one lg announce beautiful 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.420
 brand but is a 22-inch monitor and 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.790
 I use a fistel control and help 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.320
 quite the rest each mouth 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.870
 Dude, I'd say what kind it grows like this. 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.820
 no percent the wife makes you 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.680
 will win because of a shock 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.690
 in diesel is very strong the best 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.490
 price for so many people like that 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.110
 but at the end of the day you can do a lot of 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.200
 difference then it's good we're wanting 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.530
 You want to make a difference in the goal. 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.730
 of the work is expensive 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:10.040
 so which is the best beautiful candidate 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.020
 face is expensive 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.510
 the last few championships and 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.120
 had three that became very dark is 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.850
 as soon as it decides that the manufacture and 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.180
 windows would make it no longer the 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.880
 I would make the impact now, and it's more expensive. 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.650
 impact if all went up in most 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.890
 matches even though it is very 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.139
 disputed and then to me is the impact 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:36.430
 was the best team 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:39.150
 The last question here is 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.759
 You play another game, this is how you can. 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:45.129
 before I start in the no 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:46.930
 competitive I played a lot cs 1.6 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:51.219
 professional game every four years 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:53.169
 professionally sex with 6 and today in 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:55.990
 day I'm focusing more competitively and 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:58.300
 Dodô call of duty is still play a little 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.879
 of excess 1.6, but suffers from 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.090
 public match even in that and serbia 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:06.159
 is public server anyway in the 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.310
 truth does not have a brain but it's good to be 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:10.180
 competitive is just the good part for me 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.509
 face 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:18.009
 It 's good to see you helping us there. 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:20.439
 personal interview and I gave the first 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:23.889
 interview will have much more milk going 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:25.629
 who will try with all the 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.250
 h countries 

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:29.860
 so if you liked the video of a 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.240
 favorite book is also happening in the 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:37.870
 Channel Sunday I think all of you 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:39.909
 know the attention anyway and it is 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.199
 That way nothing subscribes to the channel either. 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:43.150
 gave a pass on what goes from the 

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:48.909
 subscription and that's it 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:52.379
 Thank you, and this dynamic 

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:52.379
 Talk, people have more.
