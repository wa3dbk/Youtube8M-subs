00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.180
 Every horse owner is usually 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.160
 tries his horse diversion too 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.019
 offer and for his physical and 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.179
 to provide mental well-being 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.490
 the soil work in the style of the 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.409
 horsemanship relaxes the everyday 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.290
 program and strengthens the emotional 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:20.990
 connection between horse and rider hope 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.880
 Type is actually one in the first place 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.410
 to communicate with the horse 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.420
 maybe you can imagine that way 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.860
 if i have to go to china today and 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.530
 actually has to work somewhere there 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.329
 yes and everyone speaks Chinese with me 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.579
 Nobody can give me the instruction 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.420
 I have to work and so on 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.550
 it's actually our horses 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.380
 Often we demand something from ours 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.540
 horses but they do not understand us 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.760
 horsemanship is actually called the 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.410
 natural handling the natural 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.410
 communication with the horse 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.770
 it plays the right body language 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.780
 a crucial role 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.210
 only who his horse and his gestures 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.620
 understands and this can also interpret 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.870
 work from the ground for both 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.860
 create a relaxed atmosphere for both sides 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.180
 can 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.680
 Im urgent , I want to go here for 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.720
 Just put the horse on mine 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.130
 body signal with running that is, I 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.200
 not easy yet I'm easy 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.340
 I invite the horse to come along 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.020
 and if I appropriate 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.070
 body tension show my school and 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.050
 withdraw then I want that 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.790
 Fed respond also shows pottler the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.700
 would like to stay does not stay with 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.020
 There are a few lessons that one 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.330
 horse through much faster 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.800
 Groundwork as by equestrian help 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.260
 learns while backwarding all the way 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.670
 especially the builder has knots here 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.100
 procedure a certain pressure at the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.110
 nose up and down with his yielding too 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.090
 of course I have to reach as well 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.310
 leader as horsemen or later than 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.180
 rider this pressure like that himself 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.770
 I give in with light pressure and 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.030
 I wake up again 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.890
 horsemanship is made up of some 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.060
 elements together and offers 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.060
 variety possibilities 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.600
 Of course, a few of them are always 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.909
 very important and indeed the control 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.189
 individual body parts on the one hand 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.509
 placement to look at the cross ladies 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.399
 will loose what that is enough, of course 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.020
 Again he is really just a relaxed guy 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.179
 Crossed Bonds suggests that 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.890
 the backhand deeper down turned her 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.540
 achieve greater trade diffraction 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.280
 can and so that the horse over the 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.170
 riding better is another thing 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.870
 feel a certain dominance there 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.269
 to work out and above all, of course 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.000
 even the horse can move there 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.890
 where you would like to have control over 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.010
 horse promotes safety in everyday life 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.239
 more playful and trained 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.940
 empathy is the day 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.250
 rewarded with growing trust 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.780
 work with the rope around with the stick 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.819
 calm and relaxed around the horse 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.799
 just react to this stick too 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.019
 leave to make clear just matter 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.150
 what comes from me optics is if it is one 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.860
 whip is whether it is a knit it is 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.459
 always cool it's always great it does 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.350
 nothing out 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.090
 just to make the horses a bit 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.650
 calmer and easier to get something 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.170
 of course is great because if 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.390
 my horses are in a strict way somehow 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.920
 times have happened with the two 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.370
 namely, do not panic, you know completely 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.730
 exactly 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.650
 everything easy everything is good 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.659
 the mutual trust grows through 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.560
 appropriate exercises and can be steady 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.200
 be strengthened 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.269
 for advanced horsemen is the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.120
 free work a particularly exciting form 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.379
 the soil work 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.060
 The principle is freedom 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.739
 nothing else like the work on 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.019
 Knitting it's just that after 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.640
 the communication is not over the 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.170
 knit can take place so I have 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.400
 no direct line to drive 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.500
 then I have about the actual 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.599
 work on the floor about working with 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.200
 stick to work with a knit 1 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.420
 Developed 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.650
 little trust in my horse and it 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.180
 is but I think the greatest thing you 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.819
 can in the horse world experience 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.620
 trust to the horse and horse especially 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:46.599
 Trust us through well-dosed 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.060
 units of soil work benefit 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.920
 horse and rider alike from the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.989
 harmonic way of communicating 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.190
 horsemanship and the partnership 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.190
 handling the horse
