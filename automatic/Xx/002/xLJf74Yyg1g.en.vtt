00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.299
 hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.680
 video review for des android dotcom 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.910
 a few days ago we introduced you in 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.510
 our blog 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.880
 the solution that samsung had prepared 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.579
 to be able to take out the video signal from 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.130
 our galaxy terminals towards the 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:28.099
 televisions all this was done thanks 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.020
 to the mhl chips and through a 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.900
 connector 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.860
 traditional cable to hdmi output and 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.090
 good standard for the most demanding 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.830
 samsung has also prepared the product 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.710
 we bring you today it is called all 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.260
 share cast jungle and what it allows us 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.650
 is to remove the screen from our terminal 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.559
 to a television wirelessly to 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.809
 through a wifi voucher will allow us 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.210
 take out the full screen not only the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.800
 content from ln to valdés de línea is a 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.680
 standard that can be used with any 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.630
 television that supports this standard but 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.250
 this access takes a step beyond 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.500
 giving us the possibility of taking the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.530
 able to play video games 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.480
 watching videos on youtube browsing with 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.600
 our browser or doing any 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.400
 another activity with the terminal and everything 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.170
 it wirelessly without having 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.510
 cables because the first 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.010
 solution that we presented to you was a bit 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.470
 cumbersome if we wanted to be with the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.040
 phone in the hand is worth it this is the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.030
 box in which it is presented 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.030
 if we open it 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:39.180
 well we will see the content well we see that 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.180
 comes with a hdmi and hdmi cable 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.430
 power adapter because you need 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.180
 of an adapter of an adaptation of 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.579
 current feeds us through hdmi 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.899
 instructions and this as you see 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.590
 and although you see that the box is quite 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.590
 wide the device is not so much 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.170
 this is the device itself 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.700
 it only has an hdmi connection and the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.289
 micro usb connection for the 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.930
 food that does not look very good in the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.660
 video and the reset button that also 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.140
 It serves to 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.090
 connect or pair the devices the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.680
 very simple installation only 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.230
 from the middles hd or television 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.840
 power and automatically the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.910
 appliance will be put into operation well 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.730
 something that they have done well since samsung is 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.280
 that all the new generation of 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.830
 samsung terminals well you notice two or 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.330
 The DS3 are already prepared for 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.810
 use this device and from your own 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.459
 system we can 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.680
 bond and share that signal of 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.920
 video we have used it and we 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.880
 it seems that it is an accessory very very very 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.620
 recommendable 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.290
 since it offers us a great 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.870
 functionality since we not only share 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.720
 multimedia but the full screen and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.670
 doing it wirelessly is 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.640
 great 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.290
 We advise you from here and nothing 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.680
 we keep seeing in the next climb 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.680
 reviews
