00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
now to mix it I'm using organic coconut

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.979 
now to mix it I'm using organic coconut
water<00:00:34.770> along<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.850> little<00:00:36.149> bit<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.420> oil<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
water along with a little bit of oil and

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.920 
water along with a little bit of oil and
I<00:00:37.260> found<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> best<00:00:38.879> way<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.540> mix

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
I found this to be the best way to mix

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.340 
I found this to be the best way to mix
this<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.440> create<00:00:40.710> our<00:00:41.129> strengthening<00:00:41.969> mod<00:00:42.420> my

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this to create our strengthening mod my

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.959 
this to create our strengthening mod my
hair<00:00:43.559> has<00:00:43.710> been<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.190> braids<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
hair has been in this braids for a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.090 
hair has been in this braids for a
couple<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.660> weeks<00:00:45.840> now<00:00:46.079> maybe<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.829> bit

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
couple of weeks now maybe a little bit

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.610 
couple of weeks now maybe a little bit
more<00:00:48.000> than<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.300> week<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
more than a week and it's just that it

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.410 
more than a week and it's just that it
was<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.010> cold<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.610> decided<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> wash

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
was so cold I just decided to wash

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.540 
was so cold I just decided to wash
condition<00:00:51.809> braids<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:53.010> tuck<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.460> away

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
condition braids and just tuck it away

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.420 
condition braids and just tuck it away
and<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.840> how<00:00:54.960> I've<00:00:55.110> been<00:00:55.289> keeping<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
and this is how I've been keeping it and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.760 
and this is how I've been keeping it and
to<00:00:57.270> unravel<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> braids<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.379> try<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> be

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to unravel the braids I try to be

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.770 
to unravel the braids I try to be
careful<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.309> much<00:00:59.489> as<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.760> can<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.420> I'm

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
careful as much as I can because I'm

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.110 
careful as much as I can because I'm
trying<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.230> avoid<00:01:01.379> tangles<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:03.000> do

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
trying to avoid tangles so I just do

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.700 
trying to avoid tangles so I just do
what<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.390> called<00:01:03.629> reverse<00:01:03.960> braiding<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
what it's called reverse braiding and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.980 
what it's called reverse braiding and
that's<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.400> entails<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.060> separating<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
that's that entails just separating the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.140 
that's that entails just separating the
strands<00:01:07.350> by<00:01:07.680> braiding<00:01:08.130> backwards<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
strands by braiding backwards and this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.420 
strands by braiding backwards and this
unravels<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> braid<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.950> lot<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> people

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
unravels the braid and a lot of people

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.710 
unravels the braid and a lot of people
just<00:01:11.460> stick<00:01:11.820> their<00:01:12.000> fingers<00:01:12.360> through<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
just stick their fingers through the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.870 
just stick their fingers through the
braid<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.200> comp<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.189> finally<00:01:14.400> creates

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
braid or a comp and I finally creates

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
braid or a comp and I finally creates
more<00:01:15.060> tangles<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.470> reversed<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
more tangles so I just reversed the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.679 
more tangles so I just reversed the
braids<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.700> able<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.970> pick<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.450> where

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
braids and I'm able to pick up where

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.330 
braids and I'm able to pick up where
there's<00:01:18.930> problems<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.799> resolve<00:01:20.130> them

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
there's problems and resolve them

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.460 
there's problems and resolve them
without<00:01:20.640> snapping<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.509> snagging<00:01:21.990> my<00:01:22.170> hair

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
without snapping and snagging my hair

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.550 
without snapping and snagging my hair
now<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.580> my<00:01:23.880> hair<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.240> grown<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.140> come<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
now as my hair is grown I have come to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
now as my hair is grown I have come to
the<00:01:25.680> discovery<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.270> thick<00:01:27.509> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the discovery that it is not thick it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.080 
the discovery that it is not thick it
all<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> density<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.650> my<00:01:28.829> hair<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.400> rather<00:01:29.790> on

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
all the density of my hair is rather on

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.420 
all the density of my hair is rather on
the<00:01:30.119> fine<00:01:30.479> side<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.680> had<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> moment<00:01:32.369> there

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the fine side and I had a moment there

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.210 
the fine side and I had a moment there
celebrating<00:01:33.060> my<00:01:33.630> hair<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
celebrating my hair and the but to the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.969 
celebrating my hair and the but to the
density<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.970> don't<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.600> thick<00:01:37.110> hair<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.710> even

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
density I don't have thick hair so even

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.859 
density I don't have thick hair so even
though<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.549> see<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:39.299> thick

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
though my for see it's not really thick

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
though my for see it's not really thick
I<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.560> need<00:01:40.829> some<00:01:41.130> when<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.700> only

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
I know I need some when it's only

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.850 
I know I need some when it's only
shrunken<00:01:42.479> State<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.930> looks<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.500> thick<00:01:43.829> but

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
shrunken State it looks really thick but

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.730 
shrunken State it looks really thick but
per<00:01:44.640> square<00:01:44.939> inch<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.720> very<00:01:46.170> few<00:01:46.500> hair

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
per square inch I have very few hair

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
per square inch I have very few hair
strands<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.549> hairs<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> thin<00:01:48.240> side<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
strands so my hairs on the thin side and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.060 
strands so my hairs on the thin side and
this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.899> really<00:01:49.049> important<00:01:49.680> because<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
this is really important because it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.160 
this is really important because it
helps<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.729> selecting<00:01:51.299> which<00:01:51.540> products<00:01:52.049> are

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
helps in selecting which products are

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.469 
helps in selecting which products are
best<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.740> hair<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.210> use<00:01:54.390> a

I go ahead and apply the mud now my head
is<00:02:19.020> divided<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.620> four<00:02:19.890> sections<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.760> I'm

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
is divided in four sections and I'm

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.400 
is divided in four sections and I'm
going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> walk<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.330> these<00:02:21.540> four<00:02:21.780> sections<00:02:22.020> and

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
going to walk in these four sections and

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.590 
going to walk in these four sections and
then<00:02:22.590> divide<00:02:23.070> those<00:02:23.310> subsections<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.330> those

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
then divide those subsections so those

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.140 
then divide those subsections so those
sections<00:02:25.080> into<00:02:25.380> subsections<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.310> I'm<00:02:26.970> going

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
sections into subsections and I'm going

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.090 
sections into subsections and I'm going
to<00:02:27.180> go<00:02:27.330> ahead<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.690> saturate<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.470> strong<00:02:28.920> as

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
to go ahead and saturate that strong as

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.490 
to go ahead and saturate that strong as
much<00:02:29.310> as<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.580> can<00:02:29.880> I'm<00:02:30.150> using<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.870> whole<00:02:31.050> pocket

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
much as I can I'm using a whole pocket

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.320 
much as I can I'm using a whole pocket
of<00:02:31.590> cassia<00:02:31.980> powder<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.460> this<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.700> about<00:02:32.940> 100

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
of cassia powder and this is about 100

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.140 
of cassia powder and this is about 100
grams<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.170> maybe<00:02:34.710> half<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.190> cup<00:02:35.460> which<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.910> think

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
grams and maybe half a cup which I think

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.880 
grams and maybe half a cup which I think
is<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.450> whole<00:02:36.660> container<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.470> coconut

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
is the whole container of the coconut

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.220 
is the whole container of the coconut
water<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.970> reason<00:02:39.240> for<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.450> exercise<00:02:39.960> is

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
water the reason for this exercise is

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.830 
water the reason for this exercise is
that<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:41.010> most<00:02:41.340> people<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.880> always<00:02:42.120> mix<00:02:42.570> my

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
that like most people I always mix my

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.410 
that like most people I always mix my
powders<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.620> mix<00:02:43.830> Brahmi<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.640> Alma<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
powders like I mix Brahmi and Alma and

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.510 
powders like I mix Brahmi and Alma and
henna<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.080> always<00:02:46.470> do<00:02:46.680> some<00:02:46.860> kind<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.160> mixture

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
henna I always do some kind of mixture

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.050 
henna I always do some kind of mixture
but<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.540> wanted<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.960> see<00:02:49.320> how<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.220> individual

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
but I wanted to see how the individual

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.240 
but I wanted to see how the individual
powders<00:02:51.480> feel<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.870> my<00:02:51.900> hair<00:02:52.320> because<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.040> want

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
powders feel on my hair because I want

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.820 
powders feel on my hair because I want
to<00:02:53.310> create<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.640> custom<00:02:53.970> regimen<00:02:54.750> but<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.590> can

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
to create a custom regimen but that can

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.130 
to create a custom regimen but that can
only<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.310> based<00:02:56.520> on<00:02:56.790> how<00:02:57.030> each<00:02:57.330> individual

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
only be based on how each individual

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.890 
only be based on how each individual
powder<00:02:58.470> feels<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.250> my<00:02:59.280> hair<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.120> decided<00:03:00.720> I'm

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
powder feels on my hair so I decided I'm

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.600 
powder feels on my hair so I decided I'm
going<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.080> try<00:03:01.410> all<00:03:01.740> my<00:03:01.950> Indian<00:03:02.280> powders

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
going to try all my Indian powders

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.120 
going to try all my Indian powders
individually<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.540> then<00:03:03.870> decide<00:03:04.860> which

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
individually and then decide which

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.100 
individually and then decide which
combinations<00:03:05.820> are<00:03:06.030> best<00:03:06.330> for<00:03:06.690> my<00:03:06.900> hair

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
combinations are best for my hair

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.220 
combinations are best for my hair
because<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.680> said<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.910> find<00:03:09.810> side

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
because like I said on the find side

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.980 
because like I said on the find side
when<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.130> comes<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.670> density<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.150> hair<00:03:12.450> so

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
when it comes to the density of hair so

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.650 
when it comes to the density of hair so
we're<00:03:13.290> trying<00:03:13.500> one<00:03:13.860> part<00:03:14.160> at<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> time<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:15.120> again

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
we're trying one part at a time so again

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.510 
we're trying one part at a time so again
I<00:03:15.840> saturate<00:03:16.560> my<00:03:16.740> hair<00:03:16.950> as<00:03:17.040> much<00:03:17.220> as<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.460> can

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
I saturate my hair as much as I can

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.360 
I saturate my hair as much as I can
going<00:03:18.000> through<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:19.380> all<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.860> hair<00:03:20.040> strands

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
going through that all the hair strands

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.920 
going through that all the hair strands
and<00:03:20.550> making<00:03:20.820> sure<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.120> every<00:03:21.420> single<00:03:21.720> hair

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
and making sure that every single hair

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.010
