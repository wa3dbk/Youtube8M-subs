 to add then to these hikes 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.010
 with these elements we go to the sauce that goes with our fried hake 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.850
 let's start then 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.330
 we open our beer 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.850
 one part pal beaten the other part zaragoza share country while tacos 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.590

 we are going to prepare the trova shot to drop a bag we put first of all the 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.440
 game that a pulpit has previously said and while leaving 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.460
 let's find a beater cited and I have here 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.000
 we then put flour to prepare this shake a little bit was mixing 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.050
 a density moderately 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.229
 Sticky unctuous so that the sector does not form lumps and is now 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.989
 when he passes gregard 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.829
 the beer a splash of apple beer estimated that makes the beer about 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.209
 the vacuum 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.609
 will help you that the the shake is more has inherited a little more liriano 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.780
 more telling you can get it right with milk but with beer it was very good 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.159
 what we do is the priority of the rough texture and that is hidden or 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.389
 movements very well very firm 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.359
 not very dense and 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:38.399
 We will then be the smoothie here and what we are going to do is salt and pepper 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.659
 look like this 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.659
 pepper on one side 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.189
 we throw around 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.869
 we return to place the jump and pepper on the other side 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.029
 and then we are going to move 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.949
 with a clamp so you do not burn 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.949
 the fish the fire detected in this case hake 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:01.499
 that impregnates wind of the shake if you want later to add a little 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.769
 turmeric object of paprika here 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.699
 that it would not be bad at all and now we are going directly to the goal 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.679
 so wins after haiti 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.979
 in this way 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:17.639
 this cure just a little bit you hit the sides and we move it 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.639
 rise up 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.279
 175 degrees or so 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.859
 the temperature of our oil 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.779
