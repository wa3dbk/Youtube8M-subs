00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello very good this video 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.600
 explain a little the operation that I just 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.750
 to close with a profit of 20 with 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.330
 72 euros 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.650
 stressed that in a binary options it is 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.680
 poor 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.810
 well the operation would have the 127 of 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.939
 the dawn 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.020
 this past morning and from here 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.470
 I just closed now 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.840
 6 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.010
 and well I will explain a bit what is it 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.210
 what have I done that happened to me 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.899
 and here is the night shines here where 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.899
 you see this line 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.930
 I opened it in this area last night 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.030
 let's see why 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.050
 we go to graphics 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.230
 we see this area where the price could not 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.230
 plus 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.500
 then m advanced in this price as 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.000
 the supports are areas are not prices 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.270
 Exactly I myself entered here 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.850
 check this form 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.649
 in this area I took it as if I continued 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.180
 crossing this area would have closed the 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.400
 operation 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.400
 I've been here the price we will 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.520
 and well here I closed it in this area 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.270
 because it was to do from here 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.270
 Firstly 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.270
 we see that here he did as a kind of 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.030
 done also a pullback that for the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.890
 low art 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.770
 then here I endured the operation 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.250
 up here in this candle I got up does 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.280
 recently and well wait for him to cross 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.390
 this if it does not cross it today is 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.170
 closed 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.020
 and that went randomly 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.960
 did quite well and good and here already the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.159
 I closed 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.159
 why not do it here 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.710
 we see this zone of accumulation of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.400
 it is congested 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:24.010
 bibi and well basically this is a 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.840
 past support that creates a resistance 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.470
 and I did not want to risk more since I had 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.470
 here too 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:43.440
 had 20 how much 20.72 euros of profit 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.240
 and good though I do not consider something wrong 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.350
 to be a night sleeping in the 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.350
 bed and have it 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.379
 and good and then that was working 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.000
 so I do not regret having closed 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.000
 the operation 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.950
 and basically this is the operation if 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.510
 the indicator is at best I was before 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.140
 a majority that was looking up the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.430
 perfect shaft 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.250
 and when you have to learn the analysis 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.980
 technical a little bit basically with support 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.550
 resistance because I do not consider myself a 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.550
 guru of 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.650
 and nothing and here we see are they putting 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.480
 stronger 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.480
 this was Friday 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.959
 after 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.900
 broke this zone 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.830
 He is broke 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.830
 and broke this 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:05.950
 the first one that broke this zone 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.950
 and then broke this 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.140
 an indicator to go 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.030
 and well there's a point here that bounced 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.380
 and something curious also so that between 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.380
 the night 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.170
 it was in this gap this age what it does is 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.139
 a little morning people 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.330
 how old is it for low 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.780
 it's the opposite what it does once 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.780
 that is fine 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.040
 buyers to his sister says 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.340
 this is my best prices and on the 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.340
 purchase 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.570
 excess do not take advantage 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.030
 this one that was about to touch that already 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.170
 the price is we have 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.170
 the safest thing 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.590
 what you do downward you can touch 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.590
 this 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.340
 the euro / dollar for today 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.660
 unless you see something very clear 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.050
 and nothing else and here we have 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.169
 the closing operation does 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.199
 and I currently have 70 with 83 open me 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.190
 bill 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.580
 practically the last week of Monday 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.949
 of last week 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.950
 and nothing gives you 25 euros to operate 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:31.010
 in forex 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.170
 and it's just opening the account and 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.350
 validate the phone that is validated from 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.350
 here 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.460
 validate phone you see me does not let me 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.090
 marked because hue and 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.090
 automatically you 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.079
 and the 25 euros do not have to do any 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.449
 series of operations 

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:54.810
 then to remove the truth I still 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.420
 I have not retired 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.600
 from what I 've seen you have to get there 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.790
 at the point of investor we see that here is 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.190
 the approved phone has given me the 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:09.570
 twenty-five euros and until it arrives 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.570
 I guess at 60 points 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.900
 withdraw the money 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.750
 then once for example 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.389
 imagine that it takes 200 euros then if I 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.520
 I want to withdraw the 25 of those that I 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:26.340
 they gave it to me and it will come to me 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.060
 my account 175 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.060
 but good 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:35.389
 and that 's so easy, you're just going to 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.289
 give 500 downloads of this kind of 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.289
 application this platform 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.220
 and nothing 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.560
 and valid the phone I do not know in which country 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.110
 is available or not since I 've seen that 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.320
 there are people that I think peru do not leave 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.270
 or in Bolivia I do not know in any country of those 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.790
 or in some it is I do not know exactly 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:59.440
 I guess I'll inform myself I'll say it but 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:02.800
 but go here in Spain no problem 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.910
 and well, I hope you have a 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.360
 good trading week 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.360
 This other
