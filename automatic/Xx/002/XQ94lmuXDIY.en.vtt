next we're gonna add two eggs I have
sort<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.300> beat<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> fork<00:02:16.290> here<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.740> then

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
sort of beat with a fork here and then

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370 
sort of beat with a fork here and then
you<00:02:17.550> want<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.090> slowly<00:02:18.690> mix<00:02:18.960> everything

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
you want to slowly mix everything

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.530 
you want to slowly mix everything
together<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.850> know<00:02:20.940> everything<00:02:21.300> looks

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
together and now I know everything looks

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.300 
together and now I know everything looks
really<00:02:21.750> wet<00:02:22.050> but<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.560> egg<00:02:22.710> will<00:02:22.890> eventually

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
really wet but the egg will eventually

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.500 
really wet but the egg will eventually
cook<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:23.910> you'll<00:02:24.030> start<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.270> see<00:02:24.360> that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
cook and then you'll start to see that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.970 
cook and then you'll start to see that
because<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> rice<00:02:25.080> will<00:02:25.260> become<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.650> little

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
because the rice will become a little

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.530 
because the rice will become a little
more<00:02:26.100> dry<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.210> good<00:02:27.330> way

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
more dry but in a good way

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.570 
more dry but in a good way
and<00:02:27.780> then<00:02:28.290> later<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.560> you'll<00:02:28.860> your<00:02:29.400> fried

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
and then later on you'll your fried

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.250 
and then later on you'll your fried
Rice's<00:02:29.910> Denzil<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.660> want<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.810> mix<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.140> I
