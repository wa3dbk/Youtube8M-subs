00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.070
 Hello everyone Alexei Radonitsa 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.820
 In this video tutorial I'll show you how 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.250
 to make 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.789
 slowdown video acceleration in sony vegas 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.880
 but this is suitable for any type of video 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.160
 but I will say right away that it is better if you 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.840
 will use without sound because 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.630
 if you will accelerate the same 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.910
 video and video and sound then sound 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.870
 It will turn out very crooked 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.160
 Now I show him how he got 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:50.610
 speed up the sound at about two 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:53.910
 times but that is so he cringes 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.690
 it 's funny now we are actually with you 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.210
 learn how to speed up the video is often 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.300
 I have to do it now and let me 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.030
 I will select a segment we will allow in 30 seconds 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.460
 I will cut off the steel, and that means we are with you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.570
 we know that if you pull this one 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.939
 Thing right, then you have 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.610
 the video will be shortened but if you 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.380
 press the control the key at you 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.759
 the icon will be slightly different there 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.259
 will appear as such a wave point 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.070
 there is such a small wave if you 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.070
 pull 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.049
 the video it will last in time 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.380
 two times less yes that is not 30 seconds 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.020
 and 15 well, or 20 seconds whatever you want but on 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.400
 practice in essence 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.409
 there will be an acceleration 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.280
 video and it will be accelerated 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.450
 video so i am cubes now yes only 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.250
 quality so that it means that you can see that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.840
 i move twice to be lightning not 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.450
 you can see that twice as fast but you can see 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.729
 which is faster and thus can be changed 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.159
 speed as you like, you can absolutely do 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.850
 here is a very fast type of express lecture 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.740
 times three times with your hands back and forth 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.090
 there is an acceleration like this when 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.509
 this if you right click 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.090
 click on drink from here you will see that 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.670
 Now acceleration 4 times 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.920
 This is the maximum acceleration 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.989
 way faster can not be accelerated 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.280
 but there are other options and what about 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.319
 I will not tell you 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.150
 enough of this but if you want more 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.980
 accelerate harder though not presenting 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.500
 Why would you want can 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.230
 burn this video from render and then 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.819
 speed it up again now for 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.040
 to return all normal state 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.709
 the enemy is easiest to drink from 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.440
 here where playback raid to deliver 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.530
 the unit itself and press enter thereby 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.569
 video will become normal in speed 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.180
 besides we can slow down with you 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.970
 video for this you need to hold the key 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.060
 control pull the other way and so 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.579
 most will slow down here now 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.720
 I can see that I even open my mouth 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.730
 So slow 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.430
 no one says his words right now 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.459
 the video is slowed down here there are two nuances 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.560
 you need to know when slowing down 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.019
 speeding up the video you are replacing 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.720
 Frames, that is, for example, I had 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:17.579
 two frames and these two frames went in a row at 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.030
 this when my form speeds up at me 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:25.530
 let's say 25 frames they are compressed well 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.810
 let's say frames should be shown in 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.389
 twice as often but not twice as often 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.180
 Well, because they seem to be here 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:36.180
 video at 25 frames per second and thereby 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.130
 some frames disappear but except 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.440
 disappearing there is there a mixing effect 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.299
 in short, here's an example of doodle video 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.030
 it will be clearer let me now 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.300
 doodle video upload myself that's why 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.630
 doodle video 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.260
 it means that acceleration is not working well 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:57.730
 look when hand 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.710
 runs and draws there is some trace which 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.120
 goes for the hand that is the hand it is not clear 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.580
 she seemed to be seeing double 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.860
 Now you can see it and it â€™s like 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.070
 doubles in the eyes this happens because 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.500
 the fact that there is this very effect of that 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.300
 that frames are mixed and this effect 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.750
 it happens both during acceleration and 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.510
 slowing down now explain in detail not 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.040
 I will why so but what is necessary 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.750
 understand in some cases this 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.280
 looks bad 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.450
 now 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.390
 Sorry here is this hand she is like this 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.230
 bangs and it shows when you look 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.030
 the video is still noticeable here but 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.040
 this is how the acceleration of deceleration occurs 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.040
 use it often 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.490
 but
