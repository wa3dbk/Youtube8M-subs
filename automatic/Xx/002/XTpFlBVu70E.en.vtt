ya see it works only problems were

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.880 
ya see it works only problems were
there's<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> scratch<00:00:39.629> right<00:00:39.899> here<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.680> that

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
there's a scratch right here not that

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.540 
there's a scratch right here not that
noticeable<00:00:41.690> then<00:00:42.690> there<00:00:43.500> was<00:00:45.980> this<00:00:46.980> crack

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
noticeable then there was this crack

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.299 
noticeable then there was this crack
right<00:00:47.579> here

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
right here

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.630 
right here

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.450 

at<00:02:03.100> sabers<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:04.600> basically<00:02:05.439> looks<00:02:05.829> exactly

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
at sabers it basically looks exactly

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.550 
at sabers it basically looks exactly
like<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.600> Lomography<00:02:08.500> action<00:02:08.979> sampler

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
like the Lomography action sampler

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.440 
like the Lomography action sampler
basically<00:02:11.560> act<00:02:11.799> the<00:02:12.010> same<00:02:12.220> way<00:02:12.280> too<00:02:12.489> but<00:02:15.450> I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
basically act the same way too but I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.449 
basically act the same way too but I
need<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.989> get<00:02:17.110> film<00:02:17.410> for<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.680> too<00:02:17.920> which

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
shouldn't be very hard to find because

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.650 
shouldn't be very hard to find because
