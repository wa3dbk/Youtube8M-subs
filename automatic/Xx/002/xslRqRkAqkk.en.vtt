00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
this will spread out nice and what I'll

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.499 
this will spread out nice and what I'll
do<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.189> I'll<00:01:26.280> cure<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.970> board<00:01:27.240> for

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
do is I'll cure this on this board for

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.350 
do is I'll cure this on this board for
maybe<00:01:27.890> two<00:01:28.890> or<00:01:28.920> three<00:01:29.009> days<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.119> what<00:01:30.240> will

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
maybe two or three days and what will

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.109 
maybe two or three days and what will
happen<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.619> skills<00:01:32.070> will<00:01:32.460> actually<00:01:32.880> start

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
happen is the skills will actually start

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.210 
happen is the skills will actually start
to<00:01:33.180> come<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.079> dry<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.890> I'll<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
to come up as they dry so I'll take a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.490 
to come up as they dry so I'll take a
big<00:01:35.549> piece<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.790> tape<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.299> put<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.960> down<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
big piece of tape and put it down and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.920 
big piece of tape and put it down and
peel<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:39.060> duct<00:01:39.270> tape<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> watch<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
peel it up the duct tape and it watch it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.410 
peel it up the duct tape and it watch it
take<00:01:40.229> off<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.710> those<00:01:40.860> extra<00:01:41.130> scales<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.270> then

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
take off all those extra scales so then

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.649 
take off all those extra scales so then
at<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.810> point<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.950> take<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.700> roll

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
at that point I can take this and roll

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.230 
at that point I can take this and roll
it<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> curly<00:01:46.860> q<00:01:47.159> 1<00:01:47.310> itself<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.000> just

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it up like a curly q 1 itself so just

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.539 
it up like a curly q 1 itself so just
roll<00:01:48.479> down<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.040> store<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.520> a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
roll down and then I can store it in a

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
roll down and then I can store it in a
glass<00:01:50.700> jar<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:51.600> long<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.990> want<00:01:52.259> until<00:01:52.470> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
glass jar for as long as I want until I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.679 
glass jar for as long as I want until I
use<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> I'm<00:01:53.130> sure<00:01:53.490> they<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.090> riddle<00:01:54.450> over
