that's<00:00:00.870> right<00:00:01.110> guys<00:00:01.350> we<00:00:01.650> have<00:00:01.829> another<00:00:02.190> update

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
that's right guys we have another update

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.079 
that's right guys we have another update
from<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.149> NCIX<00:00:03.720> pc<00:00:04.230> lab<00:00:04.500> so<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.520> the

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
from the NCIX pc lab so this is the

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.430 
from the NCIX pc lab so this is the
vesta<00:00:06.569> i<00:00:06.720> 7<00:00:07.200> 50<00:00:07.649> 50<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.309> what<00:00:09.150> we've<00:00:09.420> aimed<00:00:10.019> to

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
vesta i 7 50 50 and what we've aimed to

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.249 
vesta i 7 50 50 and what we've aimed to
do<00:00:10.590> with<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.950> particular<00:00:11.610> system<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.259> create

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
do with this particular system is create

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.340 
do with this particular system is create
a<00:00:13.469> flexible<00:00:13.830> platform<00:00:14.400> where<00:00:15.089> users<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.690> for

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
a flexible platform where users can for

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.310 
a flexible platform where users can for
the<00:00:16.560> same<00:00:16.770> price<00:00:17.010> either<00:00:17.430> choose<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.330> g-force

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
the same price either choose a g-force

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.929 
the same price either choose a g-force
solution<00:00:19.859> which<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.160> what<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.460> running

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
solution which is what we have running

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.200 
solution which is what we have running
on<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> bench<00:00:21.359> right<00:00:21.570> now<00:00:21.720> or<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:23.160> radio<00:00:23.880> on

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
on the bench right now or a radio on

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.939 
on the bench right now or a radio on
solution<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.350> going<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.650> available

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
solution so it's going to be available

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.859 
solution so it's going to be available
in<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.340> couple<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.730> different<00:00:27.119> configurations

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
in a couple of different configurations

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.810 
in a couple of different configurations
that<00:00:27.960> are<00:00:28.080> going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.560> priced<00:00:28.859> exactly<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
that are going to be priced exactly the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.020 
that are going to be priced exactly the
same<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.630> basically<00:00:31.410> you're<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> get

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
same so basically you're going to get

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.330 
same so basically you're going to get
all<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.510> configuration<00:00:34.200> plus<00:00:34.950> either

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
all of this configuration plus either

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.770 
all of this configuration plus either
graphic<00:00:35.850> card<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.480> has<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.410> core<00:00:37.950> i7<00:00:38.540> 960<00:00:39.540> so

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
graphic card so it has a core i7 960 so

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.229 
graphic card so it has a core i7 960 so
with<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> recent<00:00:40.260> price<00:00:40.680> drop<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.489> 960

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
with the recent price drop on the 960

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.139 
with the recent price drop on the 960
you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.899> now<00:00:43.020> get<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> 960<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.160> 3.2<00:00:44.820> gigahertz

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
you can now get a 960 at 3.2 gigahertz

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.069 
you can now get a 960 at 3.2 gigahertz
for<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> same<00:00:46.200> price<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.539> 950<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.690> mean

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
for the same price as the 950 I mean

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.779 
for the same price as the 950 I mean
even<00:00:49.200> though<00:00:49.469> both<00:00:49.710> cpus<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.460> been<00:00:50.550> out<00:00:50.670> in

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
even though both cpus have been out in

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.720 
even though both cpus have been out in
the<00:00:50.879> market<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.420> similar<00:00:51.899> time<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.039> 950<00:00:53.640> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the market for a similar time the 950 is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.490 
the market for a similar time the 950 is
not<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> drop<00:00:54.420> any<00:00:54.570> further<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.230> just

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
not going to drop any further it's just

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.080 
not going to drop any further it's just
going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> pretty<00:00:56.039> much<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.430> phased<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
going to pretty much be phased out and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.209 
going to pretty much be phased out and
the<00:00:57.510> 960<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> replacement<00:00:58.980> so

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the 960 is going to be a replacement so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.770 
the 960 is going to be a replacement so
you<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> little<00:00:59.969> bit<00:01:00.090> more<00:01:00.239> value<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.690> your

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
you get a little bit more value for your

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.180 
you get a little bit more value for your
dollar<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.260> way<00:01:01.440> we're<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.160> using

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
dollar that way we're going to be using

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.000 
dollar that way we're going to be using
a<00:01:02.520> cool<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.879> eco<00:01:03.300> liquid<00:01:03.899> cooling<00:01:04.260> kit<00:01:04.500> once<00:01:04.860> we

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
a cool it eco liquid cooling kit once we

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.800 
a cool it eco liquid cooling kit once we
get<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.339> installed<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> real<00:01:06.240> case<00:01:06.540> which

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
get it installed in the real case which

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.740 
get it installed in the real case which
is<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> be<00:01:07.290> an<00:01:07.500> NZXT<00:01:08.369> phantom<00:01:08.750> white

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.260 
is going to be an NZXT phantom white
right<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.460> we're<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.060> have

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
right there so we're going to have

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.359 
right there so we're going to have
liquid<00:01:12.750> cooling<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.380> CPU<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.250> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
liquid cooling on that CPU so if you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.980 
liquid cooling on that CPU so if you
wanted<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.880> some<00:01:15.060> overclocking<00:01:15.299> once<00:01:15.869> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
wanted to do some overclocking once you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.499 
wanted to do some overclocking once you
get<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.259> system<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:17.580> our<00:01:17.880> guest<00:01:18.270> we're

of the things that is necessary for
pushing<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.619> system<00:01:46.950> past<00:01:47.220> its<00:01:47.460> regular<00:01:47.880> limits

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
pushing a system past its regular limits

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.649 
pushing a system past its regular limits
so<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> seasonic<00:01:49.520> 620<00:01:50.520> wat<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
so it's a seasonic 620 wat and as you

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.080 
so it's a seasonic 620 wat and as you
can<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:51.899> from<00:01:52.320> our<00:01:52.619> power<00:01:52.979> meter<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
can see from our power meter here the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.300 
can see from our power meter here the
absolute<00:01:54.630> maximum<00:01:55.320> power<00:01:55.649> draw<00:01:56.070> we've

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
absolute maximum power draw we've

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
absolute maximum power draw we've
managed<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> achieve<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.450> system<00:01:57.659> from

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
managed to achieve with this system from

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.280 
managed to achieve with this system from
the<00:01:58.140> wall<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.880> 391<00:01:59.880> wats<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.570> since<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.140> an

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the wall is 391 wats so since this is an

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.130 
the wall is 391 wats so since this is an
80<00:02:01.500> plus<00:02:01.890> bronze<00:02:01.920> power<00:02:02.790> supply<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.840> means

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
80 plus bronze power supply that means

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.979 
80 plus bronze power supply that means
that<00:02:04.560> we're<00:02:04.890> looking<00:02:05.219> at<00:02:05.340> about<00:02:06.829> about<00:02:07.829> 65

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
that we're looking at about about 65

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.900 
that we're looking at about about 65
vishwas<00:02:09.989> maybe<00:02:10.259> about<00:02:10.440> 70<00:02:10.950> watts<00:02:11.129> less<00:02:11.520> than

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
vishwas maybe about 70 watts less than

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.020 
vishwas maybe about 70 watts less than
this<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.450> terms<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.990> actual<00:02:13.260> power<00:02:13.830> draw<00:02:14.280> from

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
this in terms of actual power draw from

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.000 
this in terms of actual power draw from
the<00:02:15.300> power<00:02:15.480> supply<00:02:15.780> itself<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:16.590> only<00:02:16.740> about

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
the power supply itself so only about

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.680 
the power supply itself so only about
330<00:02:17.760> watts<00:02:18.000> which<00:02:18.180> means<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.450> still<00:02:18.630> have

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
330 watts which means you still have

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.810 
330 watts which means you still have
plenty<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.260> overhead<00:02:19.770> even<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.550> add<00:02:20.670> an

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
plenty of overhead even to add an

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.850 
plenty of overhead even to add an
additional<00:02:21.210> graphics<00:02:21.720> card<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.290> want<00:02:22.560> and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
additional graphics card if you want and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.770 
additional graphics card if you want and
the<00:02:23.310> power<00:02:23.520> supply<00:02:23.880> will<00:02:24.090> operate<00:02:24.480> quite

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
the power supply will operate quite

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.660 
the power supply will operate quite
silently<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.620> can<00:02:25.830> see<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.250> we're

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
silently so you can see here we're

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.880

anyway<00:03:07.110> let's<00:03:07.440> keep<00:03:07.590> talking<00:03:07.740> about<00:03:08.130> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
anyway let's keep talking about the

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
you the overall score at the end so

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.370 
you the overall score at the end so
we're<00:03:12.210> going<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.390> be<00:03:12.570> shipping<00:03:13.140> this

terabyte drive for storage now I realize

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.550 
terabyte drive for storage now I realize
we're<00:03:21.090> not<00:03:21.120> running<00:03:21.390> off<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.600> SSD<00:03:22.140> right<00:03:22.350> now

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
we're not running off the SSD right now

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.560 
we're not running off the SSD right now
but<00:03:23.310> there's<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.610> very<00:03:23.760> good<00:03:23.850> reason<00:03:24.000> for<00:03:24.300> that

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
but there's a very good reason for that

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.170 
but there's a very good reason for that
which<00:03:25.140> I'm<00:03:25.290> not<00:03:25.440> going<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.650> get<00:03:25.740> too<00:03:25.860> far<00:03:26.040> into

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
which I'm not going to get too far into

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.400 
which I'm not going to get too far into
basically<00:03:27.180> crazy<00:03:27.450> Russian<00:03:27.840> didn't<00:03:28.020> bother<00:03:28.170> to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
basically crazy Russian didn't bother to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.340 
basically crazy Russian didn't bother to
install<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.830> OS<00:03:28.920> on<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.310> SSD<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.300> that's<00:03:31.080> okay

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
install the OS on the SSD so that's okay

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.750 
install the OS on the SSD so that's okay

relative<00:03:37.650> performance<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:38.280> these<00:03:38.370> two<00:03:38.610> cards

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
relative performance of these two cards

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.180 
relative performance of these two cards
on<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.240> like<00:03:39.990> test<00:03:40.290> platform<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:40.860> can<00:03:41.010> check

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
on a like test platform you can check

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.310 
on a like test platform you can check
out<00:03:41.310> my<00:03:41.489> video<00:03:41.790> review<00:03:41.850> actually<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.870> gtx

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
out my video review actually the gtx

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.400 
out my video review actually the gtx
560ti<00:03:43.980> where<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.910> cover<00:03:45.300> these<00:03:45.570> two<00:03:45.810> cards<00:03:46.230> as

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
560ti where I cover these two cards as

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.590 
560ti where I cover these two cards as
well<00:03:46.440> as<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.890> 560<00:03:47.430> TI<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.000> variety<00:03:48.209> of

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
well as the 560 TI in a variety of

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.290 
well as the 560 TI in a variety of
modern<00:03:49.200> games<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.860> think<00:03:50.520> when<00:03:50.670> we<00:03:50.850> left<00:03:51.030> off<00:03:51.239> we

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
modern games I think when we left off we

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.090 
modern games I think when we left off we
were<00:03:51.540> just<00:03:51.780> going<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.110> talk<00:03:52.290> about<00:03:52.890> the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
were just going to talk about the

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.340 
were just going to talk about the
performance<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:53.850> why<00:03:54.480> don't<00:03:54.690> we<00:03:54.750> actually

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
performance so why don't we actually

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.040 
performance so why don't we actually
hold<00:03:56.070> off<00:03:56.340> on<00:03:56.640> filming<00:03:57.420> until<00:03:57.600> this<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:58.020> done

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
hold off on filming until this is done

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.350 
hold off on filming until this is done
and<00:03:58.320> we'll<00:03:58.440> show<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.590> guys<00:03:58.830> how<00:03:59.130> this<00:03:59.700> setup

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
and we'll show you guys how this setup

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.280 
and we'll show you guys how this setup
performs<00:04:01.110> in<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:02.250> demanding<00:04:03.030> ever<00:04:03.330> demanding

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
performs in the demanding ever demanding

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.540 
performs in the demanding ever demanding
lost<00:04:04.680> planet<00:04:04.950> 2<00:04:05.280> directx<00:04:05.850> 11<00:04:06.239> game<00:04:07.310> alright<00:04:08.310> so

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
lost planet 2 directx 11 game alright so

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.580 
lost planet 2 directx 11 game alright so
there<00:04:08.730> we<00:04:08.880> go<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.300> ranked<00:04:09.720> be<00:04:09.959> which<00:04:10.290> means

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
there we go we ranked be which means

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.640 
there we go we ranked be which means
that<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:10.920> game<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.370> very<00:04:11.610> playable<00:04:12.300> ok<00:04:13.200> so<00:04:13.260> we

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
that the game is very playable ok so we

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.510 
that the game is very playable ok so we
rarely<00:04:14.130> dip<00:04:14.640> below<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.840> 45<00:04:16.590> frames<00:04:17.160> per

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
rarely dip below the 45 frames per

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.760 
rarely dip below the 45 frames per
second<00:04:17.940> range<00:04:18.239> here<00:04:18.660> actually<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.440> can<00:04:19.590> see

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
second range here actually you can see

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.920 
second range here actually you can see
the<00:04:19.919> average<00:04:20.039> is<00:04:20.310> about<00:04:20.400> 45<00:04:21.000> FPS<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:21.660> as<00:04:21.810> long

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
the average is about 45 FPS so as long

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.480 
the average is about 45 FPS so as long
as<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.200> don't<00:04:22.350> go<00:04:22.500> below<00:04:22.680> 30<00:04:23.100> it's<00:04:23.280> going<00:04:23.430> to

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
as you don't go below 30 it's going to

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
as you don't go below 30 it's going to
be<00:04:23.610> delivering<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:24.120> very

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
be delivering a very

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.880 
be delivering a very
playable<00:04:24.780> experience<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:25.590> is<00:04:25.740> without

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
playable experience and this is without

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.220 
playable experience and this is without
any<00:04:26.420> overclocking<00:04:27.420> in<00:04:27.510> any<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:27.780> these<00:04:27.870> parts

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
any overclocking in any of these parts

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.110 
any overclocking in any of these parts
so<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.560> system<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:28.950> going<00:04:29.010> to<00:04:29.130> ship<00:04:29.310> for<00:04:29.490> 14<00:04:29.850> 99

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
so the system is going to ship for 14 99

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.260 
so the system is going to ship for 14 99
99<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.930> I'll<00:04:31.290> do<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.530> update<00:04:31.800> for<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.070> guys
