00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
pegs right all this peg right here and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.770 
pegs right all this peg right here and
then<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.790> foot<00:02:18.090> rest<00:02:18.299> right<00:02:18.420> here<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:20.629> if<00:02:21.629> I

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
then this foot rest right here and if I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.250 
then this foot rest right here and if I
could<00:02:21.989> get<00:02:22.140> them<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.409> there<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:24.079> there<00:02:25.079> we<00:02:25.200> go

an<00:03:14.310> origami<00:03:14.790> tech<00:03:15.689> gimmick<00:03:16.079> so<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.910> don't<00:03:17.910> know

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
an origami tech gimmick so I don't know

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.559 
an origami tech gimmick so I don't know
it<00:03:18.690> again<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:19.470> one<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.859> things<00:03:20.569> the

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
it again it's one of the things the

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.420 
it again it's one of the things the
toilet<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.680> toy<00:03:22.829> line<00:03:23.040> could<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.310> done

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
toilet that the toy line could have done

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.909 
toilet that the toy line could have done
differently<00:03:23.760> but<00:03:24.000> they<00:03:24.120> didn't<00:03:24.919> gimmick

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
differently but they didn't gimmick

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.369 
differently but they didn't gimmick
why's<00:03:26.180> he<00:03:27.180> has<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.359> little<00:03:27.840> wheel<00:03:28.019> right<00:03:28.349> here

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
why's he has a little wheel right here

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.670 
why's he has a little wheel right here
and<00:03:29.239> this<00:03:30.239> allows<00:03:30.720> his<00:03:30.930> head<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.230> spend<00:03:31.500> when

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
and this allows his head to spend when

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.009 
and this allows his head to spend when
he<00:03:31.769> rolls<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.489> if<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.879> started<00:03:33.449> my<00:03:33.569> here<00:03:33.840> and

he rolls so if you started my here and
we'll<00:03:34.169> roll<00:03:34.379> him<00:03:34.609> his<00:03:35.609> head<00:03:35.879> rolls<00:03:36.150> all<00:03:37.049> over

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
we'll roll him his head rolls all over

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.569 
we'll roll him his head rolls all over

pull<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.700> will<00:04:24.479> handle<00:04:24.870> flips<00:04:25.169> out<00:04:25.349> and<00:04:25.620> you

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
pull that will handle flips out and you

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.570 
pull that will handle flips out and you
go<00:04:26.130> ahead<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.430> put<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.610> in<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.210> Apes<00:04:27.450> sword

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
go ahead and put that in the Apes sword

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.830 
go ahead and put that in the Apes sword
hand<00:04:29.580> right<00:04:30.330> here<00:04:30.659> and<00:04:32.120> there<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.360> have<00:04:33.389> the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
hand right here and there you have the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.159 
hand right here and there you have the
beetle<00:04:34.740> blaster<00:04:35.400> Megazord<00:04:36.349> kinda<00:04:39.169> for

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
beetle blaster Megazord kinda for

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.379 
beetle blaster Megazord kinda for
whatever<00:04:40.409> reason<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.669> whole<00:04:41.909> transformation

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
whatever reason the whole transformation

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.619 
whatever reason the whole transformation
of<00:04:42.779> how<00:04:43.069> the<00:04:44.069> auxiliary<00:04:44.550> swords<00:04:45.150> at<00:04:45.300> least<00:04:45.449> the

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
of how the auxiliary swords at least the

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.730 
of how the auxiliary swords at least the
first<00:04:46.080> three<00:04:47.120> combined<00:04:48.120> is<00:04:48.479> isn't<00:04:49.229> exactly

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
first three combined is isn't exactly

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.459 
first three combined is isn't exactly
show<00:04:50.069> accurate<00:04:50.689> for<00:04:51.689> whatever<00:04:51.960> reason<00:04:52.349> they

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
show accurate for whatever reason they

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.559 
show accurate for whatever reason they
decided<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:53.069> change<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.580> transformation<00:04:54.360> I

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
decided to change the transformation I

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:55.879 
decided to change the transformation I
mean<00:04:55.319> not<00:04:55.469> that<00:04:55.499> the<00:04:55.710> original

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
mean not that the original

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.709 
mean not that the original
transformations<00:04:56.729> are<00:04:56.849> any<00:04:56.969> better<00:04:57.240> because

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
transformations are any better because

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.249 
transformations are any better because
this<00:04:58.409> used<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.740> be<00:04:58.949> just<00:04:59.639> a<00:04:59.819> backpack<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.479> the

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
this used to be just a backpack on the

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.659 
this used to be just a backpack on the
back<00:05:01.409> of<00:05:01.529> the<00:05:01.590> Megazord<00:05:02.039> then<00:05:02.310> they<00:05:02.639> changed

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
back of the Megazord then they changed

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.820 
back of the Megazord then they changed
it<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> shield<00:05:03.569> which<00:05:04.229> is<00:05:04.259> something<00:05:04.650> the

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
it to a shield which is something the

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.249 
it to a shield which is something the
sword<00:05:05.009> didn't<00:05:05.279> come<00:05:05.430> with<00:05:05.610> because<00:05:06.029> you<00:05:06.870> know

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
sword didn't come with because you know

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.649 
sword didn't come with because you know
it<00:05:07.560> does<00:05:07.919> or<00:05:08.370> Megazord<00:05:09.090> didn't<00:05:09.270> come<00:05:09.389> with<00:05:09.509> its

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
it does or Megazord didn't come with its

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:15.529 
it does or Megazord didn't come with its
shield<00:05:09.900> so<00:05:10.229> it's<00:05:11.960> it's<00:05:12.960> alright<00:05:13.469> it's<00:05:14.090> um<00:05:15.090> it's

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
shield so it's it's alright it's um it's

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.110 
shield so it's it's alright it's um it's
just<00:05:16.439> different<00:05:16.800> I<00:05:17.069> kind<00:05:17.340> of<00:05:17.400> wish<00:05:17.639> they<00:05:17.909> would

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
just different I kind of wish they would

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.890 
just different I kind of wish they would
have<00:05:18.500> allowed<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.919> to<00:05:20.250> be<00:05:20.969> transform<00:05:21.539> in<00:05:21.689> both

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
have allowed it to be transform in both

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.969 
have allowed it to be transform in both
ways<00:05:22.219> because<00:05:23.240> if<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.719> shield's<00:05:25.080> idea<00:05:25.469> is<00:05:25.589> ok

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
ways because if the shield's idea is ok

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.369 
ways because if the shield's idea is ok
but<00:05:26.789> it<00:05:26.969> just<00:05:27.120> bugs<00:05:27.389> me<00:05:27.539> that<00:05:27.659> we<00:05:28.080> don't<00:05:28.169> have<00:05:28.349> a

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
but it just bugs me that we don't have a

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.950 
but it just bugs me that we don't have a
show<00:05:28.680> accurate<00:05:28.889> transformation<00:05:29.879> I<00:05:30.120> mean<00:05:30.719> the

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
show accurate transformation I mean the

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.779 
show accurate transformation I mean the
closest<00:05:31.319> we<00:05:31.439> can<00:05:31.560> get<00:05:31.770> Anna<00:05:32.339> closest<00:05:32.639> i've

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
closest we can get Anna closest i've

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.589 
closest we can get Anna closest i've
tried<00:05:33.029> is<00:05:33.409> ok<00:05:34.409> you<00:05:34.469> can<00:05:34.860> yank<00:05:35.219> the<00:05:35.759> feed<00:05:36.419> off

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
tried is ok you can yank the feed off

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.480 
tried is ok you can yank the feed off
this<00:05:37.110> is<00:05:37.229> for<00:05:37.409> the<00:05:37.680> transformation<00:05:38.069> for<00:05:38.460> the

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
this is for the transformation for the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.089 
this is for the transformation for the
battle<00:05:38.759> when<00:05:38.879> later<00:05:39.349> you<00:05:40.349> just<00:05:40.379> get<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.860> and

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
battle when later you just get that and

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.939 
battle when later you just get that and
fold<00:05:41.520> this<00:05:41.639> in<00:05:42.349> and<00:05:43.349> you<00:05:43.469> can<00:05:43.589> go<00:05:43.740> ahead<00:05:43.830> and

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
fold this in and you can go ahead and

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.329 
fold this in and you can go ahead and
plot<00:05:44.279> plug<00:05:44.639> it<00:05:44.789> right<00:05:44.819> here<00:05:45.770> there<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:46.949> go<00:05:47.099> and

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:47.339 
plot plug it right here there you go and

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.670 
plot plug it right here there you go and
like<00:05:47.819> that's<00:05:48.539> pretty<00:05:48.899> much<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.020> closest<00:05:49.649> you

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
like that's pretty much the closest you

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.490 
like that's pretty much the closest you
can<00:05:49.949> get<00:05:50.129> i<00:05:50.419> seen<00:05:51.419> people<00:05:51.750> they<00:05:51.899> got<00:05:52.139> in<00:05:52.259> like

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
can get i seen people they got in like

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.730 
can get i seen people they got in like
little<00:05:52.800> elastic<00:05:53.189> bands<00:05:53.879> and<00:05:54.469> they've<00:05:55.469> done

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
little elastic bands and they've done

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.850 
little elastic bands and they've done
they've<00:05:56.219> a<00:05:56.389> needle<00:05:57.389> got<00:05:57.659> you<00:05:58.229> know<00:05:58.349> Qaeda<00:05:58.589> to

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
they've a needle got you know Qaeda to

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.040 
they've a needle got you know Qaeda to
the<00:05:58.889> side<00:05:59.370> of<00:05:59.399> the<00:05:59.759> sword<00:06:00.029> so<00:06:00.389> that<00:06:00.629> way<00:06:00.750> could

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
the side of the sword so that way could

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.749 
the side of the sword so that way could
get<00:06:01.169> a<00:06:01.199> show<00:06:01.529> accurate<00:06:02.060> look<00:06:03.060> and<00:06:04.580> you<00:06:05.580> know<00:06:05.729> I

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
get a show accurate look and you know I

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.170 
get a show accurate look and you know I
that's<00:06:06.689> that's<00:06:07.139> cool<00:06:07.409> but<00:06:07.620> I<00:06:07.800> wish<00:06:08.069> people<00:06:08.460> i

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
of these you know different ways in

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.189 
of these you know different ways in
order<00:06:14.610> to<00:06:14.969> come<00:06:15.419> up<00:06:15.449> with<00:06:15.569> something<00:06:15.870> that's

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
order to come up with something that's

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.290 
order to come up with something that's
show<00:06:16.500> accurate<00:06:16.740> i<00:06:17.219> wish<00:06:17.580> they<00:06:17.969> would<00:06:18.210> have

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
just you know made it show accurate so

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.610 
just you know made it show accurate so
it<00:06:21.240> really<00:06:21.449> bugs<00:06:21.779> me<00:06:21.899> um<00:06:23.899> so<00:06:24.899> yeah<00:06:26.599> so<00:06:27.599> let<00:06:28.589> me

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
Ord is if you're not getting any of the

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.019 
Ord is if you're not getting any of the
other<00:06:43.620> Zords<00:06:44.620> and<00:06:46.949> what<00:06:47.949> I<00:06:47.979> like<00:06:48.249> I<00:06:48.580> mean<00:06:48.789> if

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:49.029 
other Zords and what I like I mean if

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:51.809 
other Zords and what I like I mean if
you're<00:06:49.360> just<00:06:49.509> getting<00:06:49.749> one<00:06:50.460> auxiliary<00:06:51.460> sword

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
you're just getting one auxiliary sword

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:54.510 
you're just getting one auxiliary sword
for<00:06:52.089> the<00:06:52.240> samurai<00:06:52.449> Megazord<00:06:53.039> this<00:06:54.039> isn't<00:06:54.400> the

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
for the samurai Megazord this isn't the

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.390 
for the samurai Megazord this isn't the
one<00:06:54.669> to<00:06:54.819> get<00:06:55.029> because<00:06:56.020> they<00:06:56.319> can't<00:06:57.039> get<00:06:57.159> a<00:06:57.189> show

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
one to get because they can't get a show

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.450 
one to get because they can't get a show
accurate<00:06:57.610> transformation<00:06:58.330> with<00:06:58.479> it<00:06:59.430> but<00:07:00.430> I

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
accurate transformation with it but I

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.339 
accurate transformation with it but I
mean<00:07:00.759> it's<00:07:00.999> good<00:07:01.240> for<00:07:01.689> like<00:07:01.900> the<00:07:02.080> end<00:07:02.229> result

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349 
mean it's good for like the end result

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:05.459 
mean it's good for like the end result
when<00:07:02.919> the<00:07:03.610> gigazord<00:07:03.999> is<00:07:04.210> formed<00:07:04.509> because<00:07:04.719> it

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:05.469 
when the gigazord is formed because it

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:08.159 
when the gigazord is formed because it
does<00:07:05.740> you<00:07:06.159> know<00:07:06.300> transform<00:07:07.300> semi<00:07:07.749> correctly

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
does you know transform semi correctly

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.029 
does you know transform semi correctly
for<00:07:08.770> that<00:07:08.889> so<00:07:10.439> yeah<00:07:11.439> it's<00:07:11.620> not<00:07:11.740> really<00:07:11.770> worth

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 
for that so yeah it's not really worth

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:13.589 
for that so yeah it's not really worth
unless<00:07:12.370> you're<00:07:12.520> collecting<00:07:12.879> the<00:07:13.029> whole<00:07:13.210> Zord
