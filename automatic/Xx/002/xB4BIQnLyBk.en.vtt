00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
of it now the second do you see this

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.970 
of it now the second do you see this
thing<00:01:55.510> turn<00:01:55.780> blue<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.620> meat<00:01:56.770> starts

you<00:01:58.720> turn<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:58.960> on<00:01:59.280> you<00:02:00.280> press<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.490> again<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:00.970> it

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
you turn it on you press it again and it

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.590 
you turn it on you press it again and it
goes<00:02:01.180> from<00:02:01.270> standby<00:02:01.720> which<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.200> sort<00:02:02.410> of<00:02:02.470> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
goes from standby which is sort of a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.290 
goes from standby which is sort of a
amber<00:02:04.600> colored<00:02:04.900> light<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:09.000> that's<00:02:10.000> about<00:02:10.149> the

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
amber colored light and that's about the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.170 
amber colored light and that's about the
extent<00:02:10.540> its<00:02:10.720> operation<00:02:11.730> hold<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.820> down<00:02:12.910> again

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
extent its operation hold it down again

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.390 
extent its operation hold it down again
to<00:02:13.330> turn<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.600> off<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:16.270> pretty<00:02:16.450> simple<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
to turn it off it's pretty simple the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.890 
to turn it off it's pretty simple the
fact<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.910> turns<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.330> automatically

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
fact that it turns on automatically

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.630 
fact that it turns on automatically
starts<00:02:20.290> recording<00:02:20.680> video<00:02:21.010> could<00:02:21.370> be<00:02:21.430> a
