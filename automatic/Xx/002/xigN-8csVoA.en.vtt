00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hi how are we all going to be 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.980
 studying the word or the meaning 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.040
 rather of certain words that are not 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.889
 very understandable to 10 and we read the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.109
 bible and we do not know the meaning 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.310
 so it is very important that we know 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.109
 what it means for a better understanding 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.880
 this time we are going to talk about the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.080
 words and of 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.210
 Orion 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.429
 and the bear 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.110
 which are mentioned in the job book 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:41.250
 in chapter 9 and verse 9 job 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:46.170
 chapter 9 verse 9 and says well 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.720
 he made the bear in gold and the Pleiades and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.300
 the secret places of the south then 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.880
 let's first study what they are 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.449
 the Pleiades and then we go with what 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.500
 which is the obvious and the word dares well 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.590
 Pleiades 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.860
 or refers to a brilliant grouping 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.070
 of six or seven stars are six or 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.110
 seven stars that are visible and these 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.780
 are located in what is the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.210
 Taurus constellation the name is 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.500
 traces the seven daughters of eagle and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.130
 play or in Greek mythology 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.510
 the adjective plenary suggests fullness 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.840
 what means fullness 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.659
 of the constellation and then the verb that 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.789
 it's leo 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:43.640
 means navigate leo navigate jobs 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:49.530
 as fullness and employment as the truth 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.869
 to the constellation for navigation 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.479
 now we go with the meaning of the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.270
 ossa or the big bear as well as 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.450
 knows and also some jigsaws 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.020
 prefer to call him the lion is a 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.570
 then you have been identified 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.800
 as the star that indicates greatness 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.590
 sovereign of God and that goes beyond the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.510
 human understanding now we go with the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.330
 constellation of orion this constellation 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.630
 It is named after a Greek hunter 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:29.269
 this was a giant that according to the myth 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.269
 was tied and was placed in the heavens 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.300
 it is likely that it is or 38-31 mentions 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.850
 about this myth 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.290
 God is usually described as 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.780
 creator of the orion constellation is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:52.930
 mentioned in several passages in the form of 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:56.300
 9 that we already read it also in masters 58 and 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.600
 means star 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.090
 Isaiah chapter 13 verse 10 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.120
 and I said to heaven whereby the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.320
 stars of heaven and their constellations will not 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.770
 will give their light and the sun will darken to 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.410
 be born 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.600
 and the moon will not give its support 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.840
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.840
