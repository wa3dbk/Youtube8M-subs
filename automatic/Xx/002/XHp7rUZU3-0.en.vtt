okay so what we're going to do here
today<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.580> show<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.610> bit<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.940> lesson<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.420> how

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
today is show a bit of a lesson on how

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.910 
today is show a bit of a lesson on how
to<00:00:10.320> attack<00:00:10.740> them<00:00:10.950> series<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.580> multiple<00:00:12.059> ledges

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
to attack them series of multiple ledges

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.169 
to attack them series of multiple ledges
the<00:00:13.920> first<00:00:14.190> thing<00:00:14.370> we're<00:00:14.519> going<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.820> discuss

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
the first thing we're going to discuss

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.180 
the first thing we're going to discuss
before<00:00:15.389> we<00:00:15.570> actually<00:00:15.870> get<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.350> tackling<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
before we actually get to tackling the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.939 
before we actually get to tackling the
obstacle<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.570> bike<00:00:18.840> setup<00:00:19.140> which<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.710> key

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
obstacle is the bike setup which is key

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.990 
obstacle is the bike setup which is key
it's<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.550> you're<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> be

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
it's just that you're going to be

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.730 
it's just that you're going to be
working<00:00:21.180> against<00:00:21.930> yourself<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.710> don't

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
working against yourself if you don't

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.920 
working against yourself if you don't
set<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.130> bike<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.519> properly<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> dual

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
set the bike up properly so on a dual

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.689 
set the bike up properly so on a dual
suspension<00:00:25.140> bike<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.980> make<00:00:26.160> sure<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.430> your

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
suspension bike just make sure that your

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.540 
suspension bike just make sure that your
sag<00:00:26.910> set<00:00:27.269> correctly<00:00:27.810> front<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.500> rear<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
sag set correctly front and rear and the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.510 
sag set correctly front and rear and the
other<00:00:29.699> key<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.179> traction<00:00:30.810> especially<00:00:30.929> on

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
other key to traction especially on

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.970 
other key to traction especially on
steps<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.969> his<00:00:33.600> tire<00:00:33.870> pressure<00:00:34.200> too

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
steps like this his tire pressure too

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.080 
steps like this his tire pressure too
hard<00:00:35.280> you're<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:35.940> any

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
hard you're not going to get any

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.430 
hard you're not going to get any
traction<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.660> you're<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> spin

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
traction and you're just going to spin

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
traction and you're just going to spin
too<00:00:38.010> soft<00:00:38.370> you're<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.730> hit<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
too soft you're going to hit it with a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
too soft you're going to hit it with a
bit<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.239> speed<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.690> you'll<00:00:39.809> probably<00:00:39.960> end<00:00:40.290> up

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
bit of speed and you'll probably end up

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.940 
bit of speed and you'll probably end up
pinch<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.980> lighting<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.250> tire<00:00:42.469> okay<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.530> now

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
pinch of lighting the tire okay so now

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.560 
pinch of lighting the tire okay so now
we're<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> pick<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> line<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.030> that'll

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
we're going to pick a line and that'll

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.750 
we're going to pick a line and that'll
vary<00:00:45.600> depending<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.500> experience<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
vary depending on your experience so you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.860 
vary depending on your experience so you
might<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.030> at<00:00:48.120> first<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.539> you're<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> beginner

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
might be at first if you're a beginner

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450 
might be at first if you're a beginner
you're<00:00:49.200> looking<00:00:49.500> solely<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.129> easiest

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you're looking solely for the easiest

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.889 
you're looking solely for the easiest
line<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.300> someone<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> bit<00:00:51.840> more

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
line for someone with a bit more

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.660 
line for someone with a bit more
expertise<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:53.100> you're<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.489> for

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
expertise then you're going to look for

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.000 
expertise then you're going to look for
something<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.000> more<00:00:54.120> challenging<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.680> now

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
something a bit more challenging and now

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.670 
something a bit more challenging and now
the<00:00:56.309> next<00:00:56.460> key<00:00:56.809> component<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.960> gear<00:00:58.320> selection

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the next key component is gear selection

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
the next key component is gear selection
because<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.760> don't<00:00:59.940> want<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.180> changing

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
because you don't want to be changing

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.119 
because you don't want to be changing
gears<00:01:00.840> half<00:01:01.109> way<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> ledge<00:01:01.800> or<00:01:02.010> in

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
gears half way up the ledge or in

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.860 
gears half way up the ledge or in
between<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.820> primary<00:01:03.390> focus<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
between because your primary focus is

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230 
between because your primary focus is
getting<00:01:04.049> over<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.500> next<00:01:04.739> ledge<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> what

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
getting over that next ledge so what

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.580 
getting over that next ledge so what
we're<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.900> once<00:01:07.260> you've<00:01:07.380> picked

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
we're going to do is once you've picked

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
we're going to do is once you've picked
a<00:01:07.740> gear<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.760> next<00:01:09.060> main<00:01:09.210> factor<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.930> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
a gear the next main factor that you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
a gear the next main factor that you
need<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> focus<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.070> commitment<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
need to focus on is commitment and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.429 
need to focus on is commitment and
having<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> bit<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.390> momentum<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:13.229> always

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
having a bit of momentum it's always

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.260 
having a bit of momentum it's always
going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.740> easy<00:01:14.010> if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.700> attack<00:01:14.970> something

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
going to be easy if you attack something

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.969 
going to be easy if you attack something
with<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:15.570> bit<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.810> speed<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.500> scary<00:01:16.770> is

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
with a little bit of speed it's scary is

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.859 
with a little bit of speed it's scary is
at<00:01:17.130> my<00:01:17.310> first<00:01:17.670> sound<00:01:18.000> you're<00:01:18.659> actually

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
at my first sound you're actually

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.960 
at my first sound you're actually
halfway<00:01:19.409> up<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.590> obstacle<00:01:20.159> before<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.880> even

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
halfway up the obstacle before you even

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.990 
halfway up the obstacle before you even
realize<00:01:21.650> once<00:01:22.650> you've<00:01:22.799> done<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.400> you're

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
realize once you've done that as you're

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.390 
realize once you've done that as you're
approaching<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.570> obstacle<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.890> balance<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
approaching the obstacle your balance on

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.070 
approaching the obstacle your balance on
the<00:01:26.490> bike<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.060> important<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.900> might

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the bike is very important so you might

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.749 
the bike is very important so you might
lean<00:01:28.409> back<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> little<00:01:28.799> bit<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.250> lift<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> front

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
lean back a little bit to lift the front

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.670 
lean back a little bit to lift the front
wheel<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.780> lightens<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.200> front<00:01:31.500> end

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
wheel up so it lightens the front end

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.560 
wheel up so it lightens the front end
and<00:01:31.829> it'll<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.579> over<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> first<00:01:33.180> part<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and it'll get over the first part of the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.179 
and it'll get over the first part of the
obstacle<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.500> you're<00:01:34.650> moving<00:01:34.979> your<00:01:35.070> body

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
obstacle then you're moving your body

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.190 
obstacle then you're moving your body
weight<00:01:35.490> forward<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> bike<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> center

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
weight forward on the bike in the center

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600 
weight forward on the bike in the center
of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> bike<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.009> will<00:01:38.189> give<00:01:38.520> you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
of the bike and that will give you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.060 
of the bike and that will give you
traction<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.360> rear<00:01:39.689> end<00:01:39.960> without<00:01:40.409> too<00:01:40.799> far

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
traction in the rear end without too far

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
traction in the rear end without too far
forward<00:01:41.340> you'll<00:01:41.579> lose<00:01:41.790> traction<00:01:42.090> too<00:01:42.570> far

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
forward you'll lose traction too far

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.260 
forward you'll lose traction too far
back<00:01:43.049> you'll<00:01:43.710> go<00:01:43.829> back<00:01:44.009> off<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> bike<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.149> it's

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
back you'll go back off the bike so it's

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.660 
back you'll go back off the bike so it's
always<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> fine<00:01:45.840> line<00:01:46.079> there<00:01:46.340> that's<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.520> it's

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
always a fine line there that's so it's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
always a fine line there that's so it's
important<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.630> practice<00:01:49.140> each

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
important that you are practice each

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
important that you are practice each
ledge<00:01:49.619> before<00:01:49.920> moving<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> next<00:01:51.030> one

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
ledge before moving on to the next one

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.730 
ledge before moving on to the next one
and<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.840> before<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.590> you've

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and then before you know it you've

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.410 
and then before you know it you've
cleaned<00:01:53.070> all<00:01:53.280> three<00:01:53.610> ledges<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.180> case

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
cleaned all three ledges in this case

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.319 
cleaned all three ledges in this case
and<00:01:54.720> also<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.770> might<00:01:55.950> add<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.579> end<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:57.000> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and also I might add at the end if you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.929 
and also I might add at the end if you
don't<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.590> last<00:01:58.770> ledge<00:01:59.070> say<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.670> you're

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
don't make the last ledge say and you're

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
don't make the last ledge say and you're
getting<00:02:00.060> tired<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:00.689> fatigued<00:02:01.020> just

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
getting tired and you're fatigued just

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.499 
getting tired and you're fatigued just
leave<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.070> come<00:02:02.460> back<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.790> another<00:02:03.240> day<00:02:03.450> you

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
leave it come back to another day you

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.969 
leave it come back to another day you
know<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:03.990> already<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> first<00:02:04.740> two

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
know you can already do the first two

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.190 
know you can already do the first two
you<00:02:05.880> have<00:02:06.060> fresh<00:02:06.299> legs<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.810> probably<00:02:07.020> go

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you have fresh legs and you probably go

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.069 
you have fresh legs and you probably go
straight<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.649> all<00:02:07.799> through
