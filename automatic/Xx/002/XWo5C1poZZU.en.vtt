00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Welcome friends and we will learn to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.210
 make these nice fong paddles that 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.179
 they will serve you for baby memories 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.800
 showers cards etc for everything 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.900
 that you want if what you want is 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.820
 decorate that have to do with babies like that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.160
 is that if you like to stay see how it 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.320
 do and remember visit our page 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.109
 ideas kenita dotcom we will occupy 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.960
 strips in two colors or in three and it's 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.570
 that you prefer so pink white and blue 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.359
 if you want to put a third color was a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.520
 Foami three color silicone gun 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.380
 that already come in sheets we are going to occupy 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.020
 also some diamond glues 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.690
 also something to mark a rule 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.510
 some sticks we will start by marking 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 a line that measures one centimeter of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.239
 wide and let's cut a blue one 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.910
 white one rose and another white one to make 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.649
 the pallets we already have our tubs 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.050
 Now the next thing we will do is 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.210
 stick our two strips with a little 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.280
 of silicone and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.350
 here we wait a little bit for it to cool and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.970
 now we will start to roll up this 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.190
 form list we try to go pressing and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.650
 tightening all our palette well 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.049
 now for example here we have seen that 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.060
 we have a spare part, we are going to cut with 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.460
 our scissors and let's put some 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.640
 more hot silicone here in this 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.270
 part so you can paste and from this 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.420
 side too 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.689
 in this way we have the center now 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.789
 with one of our chopsticks we are going to 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.439
 paste it here let's wait for it to happen 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.659
 a little bit to make the bow 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.280
 example of this gel I am white helmsman 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.369
 the only thing I have to do is to fold 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.920
 a little bit my ribbon put a small 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.259
 silicon drop list and do the same 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.140
 from the other I put more silicone and short 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.229
 the excesses of the ribbon now we paste it 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.209
 to the palette for enough and what 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.429
 we paste here now the following will be 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.300
 put some diamond glue 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:00.360
 around the palette 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.850
 and with the help of a toothpick or something 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.130
 you have even care you can spread 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.770
 the diamond to make it look more 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.260
 I have it here colorful and so 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.060
 all background palettes are made if 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.170

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.170
