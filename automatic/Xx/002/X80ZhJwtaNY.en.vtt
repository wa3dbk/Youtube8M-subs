rated<00:01:37.490> PG<00:01:43.450> looking<00:01:44.450> for<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.720> runtime

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.010 

I<00:01:54.350> don't<00:01:54.740> think<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.070> has<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.490> runtime<00:01:56.270> on<00:01:56.660> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
I don't think it has the runtime on the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.050 
I don't think it has the runtime on the
slipcover<00:01:57.620> here<00:01:59.680> maybe<00:02:00.680> inside<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:01.910> let's

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
slipcover here maybe inside so let's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:28.330 
slipcover here maybe inside so let's
open<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.480> up<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.090> runtime<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:27.070> 96<00:02:28.070> minutes

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
open it up so the runtime is 96 minutes

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:46.420 
open it up so the runtime is 96 minutes
and<00:02:28.990> it's<00:02:29.990> region<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.770> only<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:46.100> again<00:02:46.310> if

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
and it's region a only so again if

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.010 
and it's region a only so again if
