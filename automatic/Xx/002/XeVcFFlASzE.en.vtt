00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.389
 well I remember it very well the first 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.300
 time that game against Barcelona was in the 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.520
 bernabÃ©u won 3-0 with a goal of 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.470
 Roberto Carlos I think at minute 3 or 4 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.780
 those gives much more tranquility about 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.400
 everything to me because I was 18 and the 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.710
 first he wrote a classic of this type 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.340
 good with the ending with the joy of the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.140
 obviously people 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.580
 you do not always have the luck to play 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.420
 your first classic and make a result 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.800
 so bulky with such a marker 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.650
 important with such an important game and 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.650
 on top of being able to collaborate with two goals 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.250
 I think it's the match that everything 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.980
 player wants to play that during the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.360
 week it seems to me that there is no more 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.340
 championship that like that the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.740
 competition that is 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.840
 in that game where everything is played and 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.820
 then you realize that when it ends 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.870
 they are three more points in the competition 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.820
 domestic or if it is another competition 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.160
 you can go a little more hurt the good 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.350
 I think this when especially you 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.150
 I think that now that I can 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.700
 dispute not 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.320
 maybe you do not give so much of the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.620
 importance that you have and when you're 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.840
 outside 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.780
 when you are in another team you live that the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.730
 country is paralyzed that only serves during 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.650
 that weekend even weeks 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.670
 previous there is only one match in which 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.670
 the people are pending 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.160
 It's complicated because you're here 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.290
 Only with the team alone are you 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.640
 with Real Madrid but it's not the fans 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.510
 that has always the berke of duke are 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.180
 85 thousand people and nice that of 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.060
 somehow if you manage to win is like 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.080
 that you have won against everything and as I have 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.120
 had also some positive result 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.910
 always there because the truth that yes 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.570
 I like to play always between Barcelona and 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.570
 to be able to win in his field 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.270
 Well maybe when you get the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.430
 victory gives you one more plus confidence 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.800
 to win your maximum rival of all the 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.800
 life and over doing it at home in your 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.870
 field before his people because I think he is 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.870
 much much more satisfying 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.129
 it depends I'm not very used to seeing 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.299
 from the stands the truth but good is 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.930
 also suffers from peers 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.569
 superior also by the hobby 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.439
 I like to see it in the first person 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.439
 say on the pitch 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.650
 well then try to take advantage of 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.959
 opportunities that nervousness leaves 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.400
 outside that I do not think beyond what 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.260
 can be every action 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.239
 but from other ways no matter how much 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.780
 say you have to get into the skin too 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.849
 of the kid and understand that moment 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.220
 well the truth that I never liked 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.840
 well give lots of advice but I 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.360
 I would simply tell you what what 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.980
 they have always told me not what I want 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.200
 improve every day that every day when 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.000
 go to training think what is 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.000
 the day to improve something 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.700
 and respect and support as much as possible 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.139
 I believe that it has not touched me and to be 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.139
 parents but commented that soon 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.610
 good i will support you i will like it i will like it 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.110
 that one day tell me what you want 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.550
 dedicate himself to football he wants to enjoy 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.880
 of that sport because it 's wonderful and 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.160
 this all my life I'd like 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.120
 was forward but if you decide the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.120
 I will support the goalie 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.680
 well I'm staying with the day I started 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.940
 because it is what makes this and today 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.980
 then I'll take the first cup 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.050
 I won with Real Madrid I think a 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.960
 so we have to keep the 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.140
 achievement of the world cup especially in 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.940
 our country 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.040
 a month before getting it was 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.040
 unthinkable that we could do it
