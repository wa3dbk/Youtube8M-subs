gonna be showing you how to do a bout
maybe<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.370> level<00:00:06.089> 4<00:00:06.660> trick<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:08.010> called<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
maybe a level 4 trick it is called the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.400 
maybe a level 4 trick it is called the
dive<00:00:08.790> cartwheel<00:00:09.380> okay<00:00:10.400> so<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:12.240> know<00:00:12.990> three

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
dive cartwheel okay so to know three

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.140 
dive cartwheel okay so to know three
most<00:00:13.620> important<00:00:14.190> bags<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.639> need<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.000> be

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
most important bags that you need to be

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.180 
most important bags that you need to be
able<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.599> before<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:16.080> attempt<00:00:16.619> any<00:00:16.740> type

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
able to do before you attempt any type

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.240 
able to do before you attempt any type
of<00:00:17.220> dive<00:00:17.910> cartwheel<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:19.170> need<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.770> able<00:00:20.070> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
of dive cartwheel you need to be able to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.130 
of dive cartwheel you need to be able to
do<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.789> at<00:00:21.150> least<00:00:21.420> solid<00:00:22.020> handstand<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:27.689> second

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
do a at least solid handstand the second

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.480 
do a at least solid handstand the second
thing<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.410> need<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.800> able<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.460> is

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
thing you need to be able to do which is

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.179 
thing you need to be able to do which is
probably<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.090> most<00:00:30.330> important<00:00:30.900> thing<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
probably the most important thing is a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.860 
probably the most important thing is a
cartwheel<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:37.879> third<00:00:38.879> most<00:00:39.180> important<00:00:39.690> thing

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
cartwheel the third most important thing

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.690 
cartwheel the third most important thing
that<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.230> need<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:41.070> able<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.370> do<00:00:41.550> before

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that you need to do be able to do before

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.639 
that you need to do be able to do before
you<00:00:42.090> attempt<00:00:42.540> any<00:00:42.629> type<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> dive<00:00:43.379> cartwheel

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
you attempt any type of dive cartwheel

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.260 
you attempt any type of dive cartwheel
is<00:00:44.660> probably<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.309> running<00:00:47.309> cartwheel<00:00:47.910> which

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
is probably a running cartwheel which

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:59.090 
is probably a running cartwheel which
would<00:00:48.719> probably<00:00:49.140> look<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:58.100> basically

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
would probably look like this basically

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.619 
would probably look like this basically
that's<00:00:59.340> what<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> dive<00:00:59.940> cartwheel<00:01:00.180> looks

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that's what the dive cartwheel looks

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.470 
that's what the dive cartwheel looks
like<00:01:00.840> except<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.710> hands<00:01:02.489> aren't<00:01:02.850> gonna<00:01:03.149> be

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
like except your hands aren't gonna be

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.080 
like except your hands aren't gonna be
on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.290> ground<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.070> long<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.729> normal

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
on the ground for as long as a normal

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.500 
on the ground for as long as a normal
cartwheel<00:01:06.479> would<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.530> basically<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.549> will

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
cartwheel would be so basically it will

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:20.319 
cartwheel would be so basically it will
high<00:01:10.049> dive<00:01:10.320> cartwheel<00:01:10.590> will<00:01:10.979> look<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.310> this

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.179 

okay<00:01:21.329> so<00:01:21.990> basically<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.979> dive

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
okay so basically what the dive

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:45.219 
okay so basically what the dive
cartwheel<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:40.549> basically<00:01:41.549> kind<00:01:42.149> of<00:01:42.299> like

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.539 

Tiffany's<00:01:46.229> gonna<00:01:46.380> try<00:01:46.679> to<00:01:46.740> show<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.189> slow

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
Tiffany's gonna try to show you a slow

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.690 
Tiffany's gonna try to show you a slow
down<00:01:47.850> dive<00:01:48.479> cartwheel<00:01:48.720> okay<00:01:49.679> so<00:01:50.369> basically

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
down dive cartwheel okay so basically

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.059 
down dive cartwheel okay so basically
it's<00:01:51.360> gonna<00:01:51.509> I'm<00:01:51.869> gonna<00:01:52.110> show<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> how<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> do

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
it's gonna I'm gonna show you how to do

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.899 
it's gonna I'm gonna show you how to do
a<00:01:53.100> standing<00:01:53.700> one<00:01:53.909> cuz<00:01:54.179> that's<00:01:54.420> kind<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
a standing one cuz that's kind of like a

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.100 
a standing one cuz that's kind of like a
standing<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> probably<00:01:57.420> wouldn't<00:01:57.869> try<00:01:58.080> to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
standing one I probably wouldn't try to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.249 
standing one I probably wouldn't try to
do<00:01:58.439> off<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.159> bat<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.750> right<00:02:00.750> whenever<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
do off the bat like right whenever you

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.960 
do off the bat like right whenever you
watch<00:02:01.470> this<00:02:01.679> video<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.069> probably<00:02:02.459> wouldn't<00:02:02.819> go

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
watch this video I probably wouldn't go

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.969 
watch this video I probably wouldn't go
outside<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.479> try<00:02:03.599> it<00:02:03.720> right<00:02:03.929> away<00:02:03.990> unless<00:02:04.679> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
outside and try it right away unless you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.100 
outside and try it right away unless you
know<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.549> you're<00:02:05.700> doing<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.299> would<00:02:06.840> probably

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
know what you're doing I would probably

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
know what you're doing I would probably
try<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.470> do<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.799> running<00:02:08.099> one<00:02:08.250> first<00:02:08.549> because<00:02:08.910> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
try to do it running one first because a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.059 
try to do it running one first because a
standing<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:10.080> using<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.619> lot<00:02:10.860> more

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
standing one is just using a lot more

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.780 
standing one is just using a lot more
momentum<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.569> here<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.860> standing<00:02:14.519> dive

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
momentum so here is a standing dive

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.400 
momentum so here is a standing dive
cartwheel<00:02:19.760> okay<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.390> basically<00:02:21.660> all<00:02:22.230> you're

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
cartwheel okay so basically all you're

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.110 
cartwheel okay so basically all you're
doing<00:02:22.709> kind<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.280> an<00:02:23.400> aerial<00:02:23.820> you're

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
doing kind of like an aerial you're

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.280 
doing kind of like an aerial you're
swinging<00:02:24.870> your<00:02:24.900> arms<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:26.280> get<00:02:26.489> more<00:02:26.820> momentum

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
swinging your arms to get more momentum

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.020 
swinging your arms to get more momentum
what<00:02:28.290> probably<00:02:28.709> might<00:02:29.070> help<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.609> a<00:02:29.670> little

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
what probably might help you a little

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.340 
what probably might help you a little
bit<00:02:30.150> more<00:02:30.359> as<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.720> hold<00:02:30.959> under<00:02:31.230> your

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
bit more as if you hold under your

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.650 
bit more as if you hold under your
straps<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:32.640> if<00:02:32.819> you're<00:02:33.000> wearing<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.329> tank<00:02:33.540> top

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
straps like if you're wearing a tank top

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.840 
straps like if you're wearing a tank top
or<00:02:33.989> just<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.260> shirt<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:35.100> hold<00:02:35.459> on<00:02:35.609> to<00:02:35.760> your

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
or just a shirt you can hold on to your

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.780 
or just a shirt you can hold on to your
like<00:02:36.060> your<00:02:36.630> shirt<00:02:37.170> or<00:02:37.560> your<00:02:37.620> bra<00:02:38.040> straps<00:02:38.430> and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
like your shirt or your bra straps and

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.880 
like your shirt or your bra straps and
you're<00:02:39.390> basically<00:02:39.810> just<00:02:40.170> holding<00:02:40.500> on<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.739> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
you're basically just holding on to the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.580 
you're basically just holding on to the
head<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.549> it'll<00:02:42.060> be<00:02:42.180> easier<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.630> release<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
head but it'll be easier to release and

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
whenever you touch the ground and you

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.370 
whenever you touch the ground and you
keep<00:04:55.550> them<00:04:55.640> like<00:04:55.850> that<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.390> don't<00:04:56.960> want<00:04:57.260> to

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
keep them like that you don't want to

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.530 
keep them like that you don't want to
bend<00:04:57.590> drops<00:04:57.890> the<00:04:58.070> entire<00:04:58.460> time<00:04:58.940> they're<00:04:59.360> like

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
bend drops the entire time they're like

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.590 
bend drops the entire time they're like
right<00:05:00.500> after<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:00.950> dive<00:05:01.310> into<00:05:01.669> it<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.300> you<00:05:02.419> go

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
right after you dive into it and you go

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.690 
right after you dive into it and you go
into<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:03.169> you<00:05:03.650> don't<00:05:03.680> want<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.070> have<00:05:04.280> your<00:05:04.460> arms

bent<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.120> entire<00:05:05.479> time<00:05:05.840> because<00:05:06.440> as<00:05:06.830> your

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
bent the entire time because as your

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.990 
bent the entire time because as your

arms as much as I do in a normal
cartwheel<00:06:20.940> okay<00:06:21.940> so<00:06:22.000> as<00:06:22.570> you<00:06:22.600> could<00:06:22.930> see

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
cartwheel okay so as you could see

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.410 
cartwheel okay so as you could see
Nicole<00:06:23.530> she<00:06:24.220> still<00:06:24.490> bends<00:06:24.790> her<00:06:24.940> arms<00:06:25.240> whenever

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420

she is going into it because she's still
gotta<00:06:27.940> get<00:06:28.180> used<00:06:28.360> to<00:06:28.710> jumping<00:06:29.710> into<00:06:29.950> it<00:06:30.220> but

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
gotta get used to jumping into it but

fall so basically what I do which is a
really<00:06:35.620> good<00:06:35.890> technique<00:06:36.130> to<00:06:36.520> do<00:06:36.670> is<00:06:36.970> whenever

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
really good technique to do is whenever

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.410 
really good technique to do is whenever
you're<00:06:38.050> in<00:06:38.170> your<00:06:38.350> cartwheel<00:06:38.910> bring<00:06:39.910> your<00:06:40.120> arms
