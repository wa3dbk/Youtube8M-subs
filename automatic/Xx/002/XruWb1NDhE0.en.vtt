 that the other two videos the only thing 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.010
 you have to do is download the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.070
 emulator that makes from the application 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.690
 black smart or download the one from the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.760
 page that I've always been leaving 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.130
 to download free apps for 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.660
 your android this I will also leave you 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.170
 the page to download the 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.910
 games for nintendo 64 and good as 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.040
 can you realize it reacts very well not 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.950
 there is no problem they have the triggers 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.570
 both the z and the r the buttons 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.480
 nintendo classics 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.180
 this is the joystick and buttons 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.190
 address how can you tell is 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.560
 one of the best emulators I do not know the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.209
 guide is awesome that a tablet of 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.710
 this guy can run certain 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.290
 emulators 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.680
 and good as you can see we can activate 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.240
 everything everything we grab this is a 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.400
 application which I highly recommend as 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.360
 if you do not find any game then 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.910
 some that remind you of nito 64 then 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.980
 you can entertain yourself much more how you 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.790
 installs good will come out 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.790
 this 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.030
 the only thing you have to do as you 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.620
 I say is to enter the black application 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.730
 smart and write what is 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.730
 in 64 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.810
 today the termination is for android 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.670
 and how can you tell is the first 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.220
 option is a red control for nintendo 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.599
 let's click and it will be installed by me 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.980
 I already have installed there is no 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.989
 program you do not have to add any 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.500
 bios or nothing you just install it and you 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.239
 will be the nitro 64 icon for the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.670
 games you also have to make a 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.280
 folder either in your micro sd or in the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.739
 hard disk of your tablet this I have 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.170
 signed yesterday to see what I have either 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.129
 in micro sd or on my hard drive I did 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.349
 a folder called rom 64 here 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.910
 we are going to give a click and how can you 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.250

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.530
 is Tony Hawk and Mario Karl 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.230
 Once you've done that, there 's what 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.300
 you have to do is a folder inside 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.420
 from your micro sd to give it a name that you 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.709
 you remember that they are 64 games 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.590
 download the games put them to that 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.170
 folder enter your microsd memory and 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.209
 that will be all if you do it from your disk 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.209
 hard the same you do a folder in the 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.500
 hard drive introduces games and takes 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:12.170

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.430
 computer and games will be left this 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.370
 once we have this we are going to 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.959
 click on the emulator if it does not work 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.410

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.680
