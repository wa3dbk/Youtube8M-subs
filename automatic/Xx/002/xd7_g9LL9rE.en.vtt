lift<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.079> right<00:01:58.140> off<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.619> got<00:01:58.829> pins<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
lift it right off it's got pins on the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.300 
lift it right off it's got pins on the
end<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> fall<00:02:00.780> board<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.979> sit<00:02:02.159> in

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
end of the fall board that just sit in

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.940 
end of the fall board that just sit in
slots<00:02:02.729> at<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> end<00:02:03.390> fall<00:02:04.229> board<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> fall

slots at the end fall board to the fall

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.130 
slots at the end fall board to the fall
board<00:02:05.159> hinges<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
board hinges so what you can do is you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.300 
board hinges so what you can do is you
can<00:02:07.259> just

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
can just

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.210 
can just
angle<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.970> down<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.750> then<00:02:09.899> lift<00:02:10.649> up<00:02:10.890> like

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
angle it down here and then lift up like

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.570 
angle it down here and then lift up like
that<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.850> it'll<00:02:12.480> slide<00:02:12.930> right<00:02:12.959> out<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.310> like

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
that and it'll slide right out so like

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.130 
that and it'll slide right out so like

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
as I believe Baldwin and also the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.130 
as I believe Baldwin and also the
Steinway<00:03:25.590> pianos<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:27.209> take<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.660> key<00:03:27.840> slip

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
Steinway pianos you take the key slip

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.100 
Steinway pianos you take the key slip
off<00:03:28.320> first<00:03:29.030> once<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.150> got<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.450> key<00:03:30.630> slip<00:03:30.900> off

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
off first once you got the key slip off

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.340 
off first once you got the key slip off
then<00:03:31.860> you're<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.220> want<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.989> loosen<00:03:33.989> the

experience<00:06:08.560> and<00:06:08.800> I've<00:06:08.889> done<00:06:09.070> it<00:06:09.099> once<00:06:09.789> or

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
experience and I've done it once or

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.310 
experience and I've done it once or
twice<00:06:10.080> okay<00:06:11.080> but<00:06:11.760> what<00:06:12.760> you'll<00:06:12.940> do<00:06:13.120> is<00:06:13.320> from

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
twice okay but what you'll do is from

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.950 
twice okay but what you'll do is from
the<00:06:14.440> sides<00:06:14.770> here

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
the sides here

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.330 
the sides here
is<00:06:16.080> just<00:06:16.350> kind<00:06:16.500> of<00:06:17.569> work<00:06:18.569> it<00:06:18.720> out<00:06:19.100> you<00:06:20.100> came

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
is just kind of work it out you came

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.920 
is just kind of work it out you came
again<00:06:20.610> making<00:06:20.970> sure<00:06:21.150> that<00:06:21.509> none<00:06:21.720> of<00:06:21.750> those

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
again making sure that none of those

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.379 
again making sure that none of those
hammers<00:06:22.350> are<00:06:22.500> raised<00:06:22.680> up<00:06:23.060> okay<00:06:24.060> and<00:06:24.210> once

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
hammers are raised up okay and once

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.909 
hammers are raised up okay and once
you've<00:06:24.569> pulled<00:06:24.930> it<00:06:25.310> and<00:06:26.310> just<00:06:26.690> pull<00:06:27.690> it<00:06:27.810> and<00:06:28.050> in

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
you've pulled it and just pull it and in

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.680 
you've pulled it and just pull it and in
there<00:06:29.460> you've<00:06:29.580> got<00:06:29.759> the<00:06:29.910> whole<00:06:31.340> keys<00:06:32.690> keyframe

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
there you've got the whole keys keyframe

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.740 
there you've got the whole keys keyframe
and<00:06:34.069> action<00:06:35.069> stack<00:06:35.400> okay<00:06:35.849> there<00:06:36.090> this<00:06:36.270> action

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
and action stack okay there this action

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.860 
and action stack okay there this action
stack<00:06:37.080> right<00:06:37.349> here<00:06:37.590> is<00:06:37.740> as<00:06:38.310> attached<00:06:38.870> with

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
stack right here is as attached with

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.730 
stack right here is as attached with
these<00:06:40.520> action<00:06:41.520> brackets<00:06:42.349> sometimes<00:06:43.349> there's

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
these action brackets sometimes there's

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.930 
these action brackets sometimes there's
five<00:06:44.400> sometimes<00:06:45.389> there's<00:06:45.720> four<00:06:46.370> but<00:06:47.370> once

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
five sometimes there's four but once

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.659 
five sometimes there's four but once
you've<00:06:48.120> got<00:06:48.300> that<00:06:48.509> out<00:06:48.720> you<00:06:49.620> can<00:06:49.650> you<00:06:50.310> can<00:06:50.460> take

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
you've got that out you can you can take

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.159 
you've got that out you can you can take
the<00:06:50.820> action<00:06:51.120> stack<00:06:51.419> off<00:06:51.690> and<00:06:51.960> you've<00:06:52.050> got

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
the action stack off and you've got

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:54.020 
the action stack off and you've got
access<00:06:52.560> to<00:06:52.620> the<00:06:52.979> to<00:06:53.400> be<00:06:53.490> able<00:06:53.550> to<00:06:53.669> take<00:06:53.880> the

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
access to the to be able to take the

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.279 
access to the to be able to take the
keys<00:06:54.300> off<00:06:55.580> so<00:06:56.580> that's<00:06:56.849> that's<00:06:57.509> basically<00:06:57.720> the

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
keys off so that's that's basically the

00:06:58.289 --> 00:06:59.719 
keys off so that's that's basically the
way<00:06:58.320> to<00:06:58.440> put<00:06:58.919> it<00:06:59.009> back<00:06:59.099> in<00:06:59.280> now<00:06:59.460> when<00:06:59.610> you<00:06:59.699> are

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
way to put it back in now when you are

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.909 
way to put it back in now when you are
to<00:07:00.180> take<00:07:00.330> it<00:07:00.509> out<00:07:00.630> when<00:07:01.349> you<00:07:01.440> go<00:07:01.560> to<00:07:01.620> put<00:07:01.830> it

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
to take it out when you go to put it

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.339 
to take it out when you go to put it
back<00:07:02.039> in<00:07:02.310> again<00:07:02.580> making<00:07:03.360> sure<00:07:03.750> none<00:07:04.110> of<00:07:04.139> your

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:04.349 
back in again making sure none of your

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.920 
back in again making sure none of your
hammers<00:07:04.770> are<00:07:05.099> are<00:07:05.849> raised<00:07:06.150> up<00:07:06.419> at<00:07:06.570> all<00:07:06.720> or

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
hammers are are raised up at all or

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.920 
hammers are are raised up at all or
anything<00:07:07.110> you<00:07:07.889> can<00:07:07.949> put<00:07:08.280> that<00:07:08.599> put<00:07:09.599> that<00:07:09.630> in

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.930 
anything you can put that put that in

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.710 
anything you can put that put that in
and<00:07:10.289> I<00:07:10.349> usually<00:07:10.500> put<00:07:10.909> the<00:07:11.909> right<00:07:12.150> side<00:07:12.509> in<00:07:12.690> a

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 
and I usually put the right side in a

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.620 
and I usually put the right side in a
little<00:07:13.020> bit<00:07:13.110> because<00:07:13.440> usually<00:07:14.220> on<00:07:14.639> on<00:07:14.909> this

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
little bit because usually on on this

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.899 
little bit because usually on on this
side<00:07:15.870> there's<00:07:16.229> a<00:07:16.289> shifter<00:07:16.770> spring<00:07:17.099> inside<00:07:17.729> the

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:17.909 
side there's a shifter spring inside the

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:21.520 
side there's a shifter spring inside the
action<00:07:18.240> cavity<00:07:18.750> so<00:07:18.990> you've<00:07:19.139> got<00:07:19.289> to<00:07:19.440> get<00:07:19.530> it

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530 
action cavity so you've got to get it

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.740 
action cavity so you've got to get it
inside<00:07:22.530> that<00:07:23.099> action<00:07:23.550> that<00:07:23.729> action<00:07:23.970> shifter

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
inside that action that action shifter

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.129 
inside that action that action shifter
spring<00:07:25.880> and<00:07:26.880> there's<00:07:27.210> gonna<00:07:27.360> be<00:07:27.419> some<00:07:27.659> tension

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 
spring and there's gonna be some tension

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.350 
spring and there's gonna be some tension
but<00:07:28.259> if<00:07:28.409> you<00:07:28.500> push<00:07:28.710> it<00:07:28.860> back<00:07:29.009> in<00:07:29.250> you<00:07:30.120> do<00:07:30.240> the

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
but if you push it back in you do the

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.709 
but if you push it back in you do the
same<00:07:30.539> thing<00:07:30.870> in<00:07:31.320> putting<00:07:31.740> the<00:07:31.949> the<00:07:32.550> fall<00:07:33.449> board

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:33.719 
same thing in putting the the fall board

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:36.529 
same thing in putting the the fall board
back<00:07:33.900> in<00:07:34.139> you<00:07:34.289> put<00:07:34.500> those<00:07:34.680> blocks<00:07:35.150> on<00:07:36.150> to<00:07:36.419> the

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:36.539 
back in you put those blocks on to the

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.570 
back in you put those blocks on to the
end<00:07:36.659> of<00:07:36.810> them<00:07:37.080> onto<00:07:37.349> the<00:07:38.039> end<00:07:38.159> of<00:07:38.219> the<00:07:38.340> fall

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 
end of them onto the end of the fall

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.600 
end of them onto the end of the fall
