00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
them I just recently started using this

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.940 
them I just recently started using this
method<00:04:08.110> but<00:04:08.230> i'm<00:04:08.350> actually<00:04:08.470> already<00:04:08.710> made

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
method but i'm actually already made

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.550 
method but i'm actually already made
about<00:04:09.100> 10<00:04:09.400> mil<00:04:09.610> off<00:04:09.850> using<00:04:10.630> this<00:04:10.780> method<00:04:11.170> so<00:04:11.380> it

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
about 10 mil off using this method so it

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.060 
about 10 mil off using this method so it
really<00:04:11.740> is<00:04:11.830> quite<00:04:11.950> profitable<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:13.360> i<00:04:13.660> suggest

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
really is quite profitable and i suggest

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.410 
really is quite profitable and i suggest
using<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.390> yourself<00:04:17.160> ok<00:04:18.160> ok<00:04:18.760> guys<00:04:19.210> it<00:04:19.390> looks

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420
