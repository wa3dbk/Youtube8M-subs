slide it into that slot and the correct

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.740 
slide it into that slot and the correct
orientation<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.820> foam<00:05:11.090> actually<00:05:11.600> goes

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
orientation the foam actually goes

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.370 
orientation the foam actually goes
towards<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.170> filters<00:05:12.590> and<00:05:13.300> then<00:05:14.300> clip<00:05:15.260> it

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
towards the filters and then clip it

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:23.140 
towards the filters and then clip it
into<00:05:15.500> place<00:05:16.720> can<00:05:17.720> move<00:05:17.840> my<00:05:18.020> light<00:05:21.340> then<00:05:22.340> to

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
into place can move my light then to

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.630 
into place can move my light then to
reinstall<00:05:23.900> these<00:05:24.670> clips<00:05:25.840> one-handed<00:05:27.640> now

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
reinstall these clips one-handed now

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.490 
reinstall these clips one-handed now
when<00:05:28.850> they<00:05:28.940> go<00:05:29.090> through<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.990> back<00:05:30.230> like<00:05:30.470> that

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
when they go through the back like that

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.730 
when they go through the back like that
and<00:05:31.450> then<00:05:32.450> you<00:05:32.720> can<00:05:32.870> almost<00:05:33.200> just<00:05:33.500> let<00:05:33.650> them

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
and then you can almost just let them

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.410 
and then you can almost just let them
hang<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.370> then<00:05:35.120> they<00:05:35.330> clip<00:05:35.630> into<00:05:36.080> place<00:05:36.110> I

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.460 

don't<00:05:41.420> think<00:05:41.600> I<00:05:41.660> quite<00:05:41.720> got<00:05:42.050> that<00:05:42.080> in<00:05:42.320> there

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
don't think I quite got that in there

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.810 
don't think I quite got that in there
correctly<00:05:42.620> that's<00:05:43.610> in<00:05:44.380> farther<00:05:45.580> now<00:05:46.580> I'll<00:05:46.670> do

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
correctly that's in farther now I'll do

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.090 
correctly that's in farther now I'll do
that<00:05:46.940> same<00:05:47.210> thing<00:05:47.290> there<00:05:48.290> you<00:05:48.380> go<00:05:48.500> now<00:05:49.040> the

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
that same thing there you go now the

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.880 
that same thing there you go now the
glove<00:05:49.340> box<00:05:49.460> is<00:05:49.670> going<00:05:49.790> to<00:05:50.380> open<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.560> floor<00:05:51.740> is

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
glove box is going to open the floor is

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.960 
glove box is going to open the floor is
properly<00:05:52.550> same<00:05:53.300> with<00:05:53.420> the<00:05:53.510> other<00:05:53.630> side<00:05:54.970> stick

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
properly same with the other side stick

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.880 
properly same with the other side stick
this<00:05:56.150> side<00:05:56.420> in<00:05:56.600> first<00:05:56.900> sort<00:05:57.320> of<00:05:57.470> flows<00:05:57.680> the

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
this side in first sort of flows the

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.830 
this side in first sort of flows the
glove<00:05:58.040> box<00:05:58.220> a<00:05:58.430> little<00:05:58.520> bit<00:05:59.710> insert<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:01.370> end

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
glove box a little bit insert the end

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.150 
glove box a little bit insert the end
this<00:06:02.840> is<00:06:03.020> a<00:06:03.050> lot<00:06:03.230> easier<00:06:03.260> when<00:06:03.770> you<00:06:03.830> have<00:06:03.980> two

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
this is a lot easier when you have two

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.800 
this is a lot easier when you have two
hands<00:06:04.870> okay<00:06:05.870> so<00:06:06.500> it's<00:06:06.830> inserted<00:06:07.540> and<00:06:08.540> I'm<00:06:08.630> just

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
hands okay so it's inserted and I'm just

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.450 
hands okay so it's inserted and I'm just
going<00:06:08.960> to<00:06:08.990> let<00:06:09.110> it<00:06:09.230> the<00:06:09.620> glove<00:06:09.860> box<00:06:10.010> laying<00:06:10.310> on

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
going to let it the glove box laying on

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.730 
going to let it the glove box laying on
a<00:06:10.490> pull<00:06:10.730> it<00:06:10.820> into<00:06:11.000> place<00:06:11.240> and<00:06:13.450> I'll<00:06:14.450> just<00:06:14.740> push

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
a pull it into place and I'll just push

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.810 
a pull it into place and I'll just push
the<00:06:15.860> clips<00:06:16.070> in<00:06:16.280> and<00:06:16.970> we're<00:06:17.180> done<00:06:17.330> on<00:06:18.520> this<00:06:19.520> trim

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
the clips in and we're done on this trim

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.760 
the clips in and we're done on this trim
level<00:06:20.090> you<00:06:20.240> don't<00:06:20.420> get<00:06:20.570> a<00:06:20.960> glove<00:06:21.140> box<00:06:21.380> stampers

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
level you don't get a glove box stampers

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.470 
level you don't get a glove box stampers
so<00:06:22.010> not<00:06:22.550> to<00:06:22.670> worry<00:06:22.700> about<00:06:22.910> that

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
so not to worry about that

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.350 
so not to worry about that
close<00:06:24.140> it<00:06:24.290> up<00:06:24.350> you're<00:06:24.950> all<00:06:25.040> set<00:06:25.310> Kevin<00:06:26.270> air

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
close it up you're all set Kevin air

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.700 
close it up you're all set Kevin air

help<00:06:38.310> prevent<00:06:38.490> mold<00:06:39.210> on<00:06:39.360> the<00:06:39.480> evaporator

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.560 
help prevent mold on the evaporator
before<00:06:40.860> the<00:06:40.980> days<00:06:41.130> of<00:06:41.340> cabin<00:06:41.820> air<00:06:41.940> filters<00:06:42.360> we

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
before the days of cabin air filters we

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.950 
before the days of cabin air filters we
used<00:06:42.720> to<00:06:42.810> have<00:06:42.960> like<00:06:43.200> stinky<00:06:43.770> HVAC<00:06:44.190> systems

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
used to have like stinky HVAC systems

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.540 
used to have like stinky HVAC systems
particularly<00:06:45.960> in<00:06:46.140> humid<00:06:46.440> areas<00:06:46.740> because<00:06:47.160> mold

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
particularly in humid areas because mold

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.810 
particularly in humid areas because mold
would<00:06:47.760> grow<00:06:48.030> on<00:06:48.330> the<00:06:48.900> evaporator<00:06:49.170> itself<00:06:49.890> much

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
would grow on the evaporator itself much

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.670 
would grow on the evaporator itself much
less<00:06:51.090> so<00:06:51.300> with<00:06:51.450> these<00:06:51.600> cabin<00:06:51.960> air<00:06:52.080> filters<00:06:52.440> I

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
less so with these cabin air filters I

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.350 
less so with these cabin air filters I
don't<00:06:53.130> really<00:06:53.370> have<00:06:53.640> problems<00:06:54.120> with

don't really have problems with
evaporator<00:06:54.870> odor<00:06:55.170> like<00:06:55.320> I<00:06:55.470> used<00:06:55.650> to<00:06:55.830> which

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
evaporator odor like I used to which

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.040 
evaporator odor like I used to which
used<00:06:56.730> to<00:06:56.820> require<00:06:57.150> removing<00:06:57.540> the<00:06:57.600> evaporator

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
used to require removing the evaporator

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.150 
used to require removing the evaporator
cleaning<00:06:58.380> it<00:06:58.440> with<00:06:58.470> soap<00:06:58.710> and<00:06:58.800> water<00:06:58.980> and

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
cleaning it with soap and water and

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.460 
cleaning it with soap and water and
putting<00:06:59.340> it<00:06:59.460> back<00:06:59.580> in<00:06:59.870> some<00:07:00.870> companies<00:07:01.290> came

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
putting it back in some companies came

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.020 
putting it back in some companies came
up<00:07:01.680> with<00:07:01.860> this<00:07:01.950> nice<00:07:02.130> little<00:07:02.190> spray<00:07:02.670> stuff<00:07:02.880> you

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
up with this nice little spray stuff you

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.250 
up with this nice little spray stuff you
could<00:07:03.150> spray<00:07:03.360> in<00:07:03.390> the<00:07:03.540> vents<00:07:03.840> that<00:07:03.990> would<00:07:04.140> help

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
could spray in the vents that would help

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.380 
could spray in the vents that would help
eliminate<00:07:04.620> the<00:07:04.890> odor<00:07:05.040> but<00:07:05.640> it<00:07:06.090> wouldn't<00:07:06.330> go

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.390 
eliminate the odor but it wouldn't go

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.050 
eliminate the odor but it wouldn't go
away<00:07:06.450> forever<00:07:06.840> kind<00:07:07.620> of<00:07:07.740> have<00:07:07.890> to<00:07:08.010> retreat<00:07:08.790> but

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
away forever kind of have to retreat but

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.030 
away forever kind of have to retreat but
anyway<00:07:09.390> I<00:07:09.630> hope<00:07:10.080> this<00:07:10.260> information<00:07:10.410> was
