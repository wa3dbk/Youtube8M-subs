00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.769
 June against the u23 of a MSV Duisburg 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.769
 pursuit duel between bulls and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.800
 zebras could well be that again 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.220
 akw and right at the start an excitement 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 a throw to msv scorer lakic the field 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.320
 and rolls and rolls almost until 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.349
 highway the question has markus heppke him 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.510
 met here or not we can 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.460
 Do not judge the protests 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.500
 but within limits of the referee 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.290
 stood well and his decision 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.370
 clearly eleven meters for the msv does not want 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.539
 put himself turned 1 0 for the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.000
 guests after nine minutes 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:51.300
 june so cold caught the team 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.399
 first has her effort and comes 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.690
 mainly about standards in game 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:02.550
 markus heppke the addiction daniel boldt 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.220
 but the msv still without problems 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.710
 the hosts of their best occupation yes 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.020
 far away but runny and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.320
 fiercely strong and here with her 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.869
 first chance to be shot by tim 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.590
 the corner of barra and then the ball 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.650
 in goal 1 1 after 20 minutes but who has 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 this colleague achieves this goal 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.310
 activate and in the middle can be 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.560
 kaymer congratulate us for good reason 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.250
 see here the header of the spießbürgers 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.710
 Goralski conquers his own 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.899
 goalkeeper a self-same the unlucky person 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.090
 maik goralski the msv captain the lot 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.759
 now completely open 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.670
 the sv he never gets so beautiful again 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.630
 means over the fight to better and better 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.050
 game 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.410
 Here is an example of the wide ball of 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.729
 kahn direction trienenjost and then is 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.580
 be it again 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.550
 he sits down well in the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.310
 sixteen and then in the last second 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.140
 saves goralski to the corner coach 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.300
 schorsch mewes he really can 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.270
 be satisfied after the early residue 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.880
 and the next attack again 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.110
 over left this time over the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.190
 strong kevin true 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.620
 and there is silk tim seidel 2 to 1 after 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.190
 in half an hour 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:31.510
 the game is shot and earned in the 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.580
 flight msv goalkeeper lenz beaten 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.010
 on the other side gets tim 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.989
 hardly anything to do with this 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.140
 exception shortly before the break twice 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.099
 try it immediately cares for the citizens 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.739
 no question 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.640
 june makes the best advertising with a lot of heart 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.610
 for themselves 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.680
 the second half msv-trainer wölpper 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.840
 clearly expects an increase of 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.550
 his team and how does it look then 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:02.750
 from the eye not bad play area ok 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.750
 a lot of ball possession but pointed said 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.290
 pretty breadless art 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.520
 then at the end of the action 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.360
 Fixes no effort at all 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.670
 for soft knees stands compact and 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.300
 counters as here after the almost from 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.510
 Trienenjost's profit was about to have a hair 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.209
 who scores the 3 2 1 and the same 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.720
 next attempt with friends that makes 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.600
 the good the back to kevin barra for 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.870
 substitutes allouche but good 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.090
 held by lance no question june the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.920
 third hit much closer than 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.610
 duisburg in the second free kick again 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.600
 baarer and confusion in the 16 we see 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.300
 no matter what happens lenz fistes the 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.480
 ball on the back of dragovic and 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.810
 then it's in the banker 's with the over 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.420
 ball but without consequences 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.540
 then trainer mewes kevin barra brings 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.610
 field of hero much applause he 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.459
 was one of the strongest of his 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.890
 Team still a last corner for 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.890
 Duisburg a header somehow 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.380
 indicative of what will become the final result 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.390
 two to one for he never 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.130
 the team has convinced and can 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.380
 self-confident to the next 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.180
 key game after fischeln drive yes 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.410
 a huge compliment of the team so 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.990
 the entire squad what they are today 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.490
 have delivered was already sensational 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.470
 even though we are in the single after ten 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.210
 defeats by an eleven-meter have 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.490
 we played some of the cards though 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.530
 we came back then 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.289
 Cupid saw the good character of 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.729
 team is and have second half time 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.740
 the anxious Pingel played to 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.270
 right handed but without a chance and 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.000
 we only had three hundred percent 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.840
 so he is well deserved and that 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.630
 we have double-digit points 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.850
 finally the team spirit is just there 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.070
 about everything and you can such a player 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.950
 You can only have a team spirit 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.690
 win and 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.230
 yes and then of course the 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.000
 get rid of basic virtues like fighting and 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.860
 scratching bite everything possible 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.620
 and then you win even tight games 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:14.590
 It always belongs to passion and will 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.870
 believe all these attributes are part of it 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.050
 and I did not see it that way 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.870
 and that's why the crew has to 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.050
 please also the accusation that it can 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.650
 not ok but congratulations 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.840
 height 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.110
 They have us after the after 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.890
 residue showed how to work together 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.660
 Opponents fought and as long as we did that 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.060
 Do not implement the same in football 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.060
 we believe we have four or five 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.650
 young people who have started 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.760
 professionals are going to want that too 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.800
 train partially 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.540
 you have to be clear 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.150
 difference see as I said only 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.210
 abilities are not enough we are 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.120
 still undefeated and we are 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.830
 not the hunted I say but one 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.830
 must be able to beat us first
