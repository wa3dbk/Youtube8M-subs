00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
front crawl as we call it there's really

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.570 
front crawl as we call it there's really
some<00:00:27.840> very<00:00:27.869> basic<00:00:28.529> simple<00:00:28.800> things<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.369> can

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
some very basic simple things you can

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.550 
some very basic simple things you can
work<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.539> first<00:00:30.779> thing<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.199> your<00:00:31.349> body

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
work on the first thing is your body

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.979 
work on the first thing is your body
position<00:00:31.880> what<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.000> need<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
position what you need really is you

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.810 
position what you need really is you
need<00:00:34.140> your<00:00:34.260> body<00:00:34.440> position<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.280> flat<00:00:35.579> as

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
need your body position to be as flat as

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.690 
need your body position to be as flat as
possible<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.380> good<00:00:37.860> way<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.070> doing<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
possible so a good way of doing that is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.299 
possible so a good way of doing that is
to<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.000> push<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> glide<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.739> used<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to just push and glide and get used to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.639 
to just push and glide and get used to
that<00:00:41.460> position<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.899> introduce<00:00:43.050> your

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that position and then to introduce your

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.130 
that position and then to introduce your
kick<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.210> eventually<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.809> hold

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
kick and eventually you can do that hold

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.380 
kick and eventually you can do that hold
in<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.410> kick<00:00:46.649> board<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> nice<00:00:48.360> flat

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
in a kick board so you get a nice flat

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.229 
in a kick board so you get a nice flat
body<00:00:49.050> position<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.460> develop<00:00:50.879> your<00:00:51.000> leg

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
body position and you develop your leg

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.630 
body position and you develop your leg
kick<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.440> second<00:00:52.890> thing<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.190> would<00:00:53.340> say<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
kick the second thing I would say to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.389 
kick the second thing I would say to
work<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.449> breathe<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.050> right<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.129> one

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
work on is you breathe in right and one

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.790 
work on is you breathe in right and one
of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> best<00:00:56.879> drills<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.539> breathing<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
of the best drills for breathing is to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.670 
of the best drills for breathing is to
do<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.280> call<00:00:59.489> single<00:00:59.969> arm<00:01:00.329> freestyle<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
do what we call single arm freestyle so

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.969 
do what we call single arm freestyle so
you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:02.160> hold<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.229> kickboard<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.409> front<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you can hold a kickboard in front and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.219 
you can hold a kickboard in front and
you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.519> turn<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.270> head<00:01:06.330> slowly<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
you can turn your head slowly to the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.340 
you can turn your head slowly to the
side<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> freestyle<00:01:08.970> stroke<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.780> just

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
side and do a freestyle stroke and just

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.039 
side and do a freestyle stroke and just
work<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.130> lifting<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.909> head<00:01:12.060> rushing

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
work on not lifting your head rushing

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.859 
work on not lifting your head rushing
your<00:01:13.170> breathing<00:01:13.650> doing<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> nice<00:01:14.580> smooth<00:01:15.360> turn

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
your breathing doing a nice smooth turn

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.350 
your breathing doing a nice smooth turn
and<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.680> try<00:01:17.009> once<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and then try once you can do that and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480 
and then try once you can do that and
you've<00:01:18.479> mastered<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> integrate

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you've mastered that just to integrate

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.499 
you've mastered that just to integrate
that<00:01:20.700> slowly<00:01:21.200> into<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.350> full<00:01:22.560> stroke<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
that slowly into your full stroke and

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.580 
that slowly into your full stroke and
probably<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> last<00:01:24.840> thing<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.229> would<00:01:25.409> suggest

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
probably the last thing I would suggest

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.770 
probably the last thing I would suggest
is<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> work<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.520> how<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.729> bring<00:01:27.090> your<00:01:27.270> elbows

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
is to work on how you bring your elbows

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.840 
is to work on how you bring your elbows
over<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> water<00:01:28.530> because<00:01:29.369> lots<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> people

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
over the water because lots of people

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
over the water because lots of people
who<00:01:30.270> don't<00:01:30.540> swim<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:30.869> often<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.530> freestyle

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
who don't swim very often on freestyle

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.670 
who don't swim very often on freestyle
just<00:01:32.430> thrash<00:01:32.759> around<00:01:33.150> over<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> surface<00:01:34.110> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
just thrash around over the surface you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.530 
just thrash around over the surface you
watch<00:01:34.890> all<00:01:35.130> top<00:01:35.400> swimmers<00:01:35.820> they<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.119> lot<00:01:36.390> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
watch all top swimmers they do a lot of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.590 
watch all top swimmers they do a lot of
work<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:37.020> lifting<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:38.189> higher<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.420> back

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
work on lifting up very higher the back

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.719 
work on lifting up very higher the back
of<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> stroke<00:01:40.229> keeping<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> hand<00:01:41.100> loose<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
of the stroke keeping the hand loose and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.960 
of the stroke keeping the hand loose and
just<00:01:42.420> bring<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.170> arms<00:01:43.619> slowly<00:01:44.250> over<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
just bring in the arms slowly over the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.139 
just bring in the arms slowly over the
water<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:46.049> good<00:01:47.009> equipment<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.670> use<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
water so good equipment to use with that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.870 
water so good equipment to use with that
proper<00:01:48.750> pair<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.079> fins<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.799> their<00:01:50.250> flippers

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
proper pair of fins on their flippers

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.999 
proper pair of fins on their flippers
that<00:01:51.450> gives<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> bit<00:01:51.960> more<00:01:51.990> stability<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
that gives you a bit more stability and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.789 
that gives you a bit more stability and
just<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.610> lots<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.119> easy<00:01:54.360> swimming<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.470> very

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
just do lots of easy swimming with very

into your full stroke over a period of
time

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.190 

what<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.399> need<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.610> some<00:02:09.000> control<00:02:09.660> over<00:02:10.110> your

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
what you need is some control over your

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.820 
what you need is some control over your
training<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.950> need<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.340> monitor<00:02:11.690> exactly

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
training so you need to monitor exactly

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.650 
training so you need to monitor exactly
what<00:02:13.830> you're<00:02:14.010> doing<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.430> pool<00:02:14.640> keep<00:02:15.420> some

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
what you're doing in the pool keep some

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.750 
what you're doing in the pool keep some
records<00:02:16.140> well<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.740> top<00:02:16.950> swimmers<00:02:17.310> do<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.610> they

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
records well the top swimmers do is they

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.050 
records well the top swimmers do is they
keep<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.060> log<00:02:18.270> book<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:19.050> if<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.320> swim<00:02:20.060> 800

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
keep a log book so if you swim 800

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.020 
keep a log book so if you swim 800
meters<00:02:21.590> in<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.770> first<00:02:23.010> three<00:02:23.340> or<00:02:23.370> four<00:02:23.550> weeks

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
meters in the first three or four weeks

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.930 
meters in the first three or four weeks
obviously<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.320> good<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.740> know<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.760> can

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
obviously it's good to know that you can

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.750 
obviously it's good to know that you can
stretch<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.330> up<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.750> say<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> thousand<00:02:28.620> meters

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
stretch it up to say a thousand meters

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.220 
stretch it up to say a thousand meters
try<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.910> sort<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.210> look<00:02:30.420> at<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.690> interval<00:02:31.140> of

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
try and sort of look at the interval of

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.500 
try and sort of look at the interval of
rest<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.250> eventually<00:02:33.090> start<00:02:33.390> to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
rest you have and eventually start to

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.020 
rest you have and eventually start to
time<00:02:33.960> your<00:02:34.320> swims<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.950> then<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.580> can<00:02:35.760> start

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
time your swims and then you can start

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.260 
time your swims and then you can start
to<00:02:36.240> work<00:02:36.420> with<00:02:36.480> those<00:02:36.930> three<00:02:37.290> variables<00:02:38.270> good

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
to work with those three variables good

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.300 
to work with those three variables good

really need to vary what you're doing in
the<00:03:05.520> pool<00:03:05.730> obviously<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.230> vary<00:03:07.470> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
the pool obviously you can vary the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.290 
the pool obviously you can vary the
distance<00:03:08.160> as<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.490> swim<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.150> know

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
distance as you swim and you can know

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.350 
distance as you swim and you can know
the<00:03:09.570> speeds<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.230> swim<00:03:10.530> but<00:03:11.160> also

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
a lot that allows you to do different

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.229 
a lot that allows you to do different
types<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.170> sessions<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.370> can<00:03:17.700> do<00:03:17.910> kicks

snorkel the type that goes over your

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.820 
snorkel the type that goes over your
head<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.690> integrate<00:03:36.989> all<00:03:37.500> those

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
head and you can integrate all those

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.130 
head and you can integrate all those
different<00:03:38.489> pieces<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.299> equipment<00:03:39.630> within

different pieces of equipment within
your<00:03:40.410> training<00:03:40.860> sets<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.820> little<00:03:42.030> bit<00:03:42.239> of

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
your training sets so a little bit of

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.120 
your training sets so a little bit of
sort<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.690> careful<00:03:43.170> thought<00:03:43.440> before<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.890> go<00:03:44.070> to

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
sort of careful thought before you go to

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.970 
sort of careful thought before you go to
the<00:03:44.280> pool<00:03:44.519> each<00:03:44.790> day<00:03:45.090> say<00:03:46.049> okay<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.470> know<00:03:46.650> what

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
the pool each day say okay I know what

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.009 
the pool each day say okay I know what
sort<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.310> distance<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:47.910> want<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.209> do<00:03:48.360> but<00:03:48.870> how

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
sort of distance I want to do but how

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.860 
sort of distance I want to do but how
can<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.290> make<00:03:49.500> this<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.799> bit<00:03:50.100> more<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:51.030> bit<00:03:51.510> more

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
can I make this a bit more a bit more

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.020 
can I make this a bit more a bit more
variety<00:03:52.019> today<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.769> bit<00:03:53.010> more<00:03:53.190> challenging<00:03:53.880> and
