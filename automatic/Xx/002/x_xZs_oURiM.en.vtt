00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.690
 communication that has dog 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 how did you come up with the idea it's not 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.299
 a project that he born like that it's a 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.680
 real serious business 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.850
 they say you're young and that can 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.409
 sound like that but no it's very 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.400
 seriously you thought about it 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.200
 three or four years before launching 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.210
 this business is very serious 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.380
 it was a project that was important to me 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.330
 for years I have created a that 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.409
 with an old best friend so 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.999

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.289
 rather commercial I was developers 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.879
 from there we started to see 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.629
 that there was an opportunity we created 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.110
 this enterprise 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.310

 projects that are daily 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.920
 different we can end up doing 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.810
 the website of a bakery like 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.760
 we can go to a big industrialist 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.900
 and here it is very varied we can 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.640
 find with the helmet on the head 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.170
 how do you learn the job of 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.430
 business leader does not learn to 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.380
 school can not be learned in high school 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.090
 not all learns to learn everything on 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.840
 the pile we end up 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.310
 we find ourselves alone in managing his box and 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.930
 we end up with a need 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.670
 to hire one goes to the employment pole and 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.459
 we try to gather all the 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.230
 information all the rules at the level 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.959
 legislative is plenty to know 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.220
 we are very happy very much accompanied by 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.670
 the councilors at the chamber level 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.700
 of commerce for example and 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.320
 he was there who are there for that the 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.610
 advice for those who do not start 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.840
 does not launch anyhow on a 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.670
 head whipping around a discussion 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.140
 it is really necessary to mature the project 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.660
 before you start, you have to mature 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.520
 the project well think and especially 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.710
 find an innovative concept because I 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.360
 think that today if we ride a 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.680
 project that already exist or that has not 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.200
 an originality 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.940
 it does not really shock him 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.040
 it's not a seller you have to find a 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.840
 seller argument then nexus was pulling 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.980
