 Hello 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:13.270
 in this chapter we will talk about the basketball 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.700
 step or launch is a skill with 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.490
 phase of flight in which minimum three 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.250
 bases drive a flyer up 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.490
 and they receive it back in position 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.220
 cradle is legal from level 2 when it 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:33.290
 makes only height at level 3 with maximum 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:38.270
 a trick and level 4 with maximum 2 tricks 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.570
 in level 5 with maximum 4 tricks and in 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.430
 level 6 with rotations 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 preparation, the bases are located 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.829
 front and near with separate legs and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.680
 bent back straight arms 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.440
 stretched and hands in basket grip or 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.199
 basket la flyers rests on the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.089
 shoulders of the bases places one foot on 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.730
 the grip of the basketball and the other 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.720
 stays on the floor keeps your back 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.880
 straight and look to the front the sport grabs 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.920
 the flyer waist 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.590
 momentum starts with a small 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.320
 downward movement of the bases in 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.110
 which the player supports his weight on the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.110
 basket continues with a movement toward 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.750
 up during which the flyer supports the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.510
 second foot on the grip helping 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.940
 of his arms to climb the espanyol 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.100
 attends the fly or waist and for 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.400
 the end of the impulse must have its 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.530
 hands under the basket once the flyer 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.990
 be up you should have your back straight 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.300
 the tail above the level of the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.570
 knees and the weight on the tips of 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.030
 the feet finally the group returns to 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.610
 go down and between all they drive to the flyer 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.710
 upwards as they jump and extend 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.250
 your arms 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.040
 flight phase while the bases jump 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.619
 the flyer must stand up to it 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.810
 speed that drive it letting rise 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.360
 as high as possible and keep the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.239
 stance to the end when starting to 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.310
 descend you must pass the arms to 'the and 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.069
 lie down lightly to reach 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.230
 cradle position the bases must 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.569

 layer contact again with the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.520
 bases and the spark should start at 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.770
 slow down using the force of 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.530
 arms and legs to cushion the 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.620
 weight the bases must locate their arms 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.530
 in back and legs and the spar under 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.810
 the arms of the flyer the flyer should 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.540
 Keep your legs closed and slow down 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.450
 from the shoulders of your bases mistakes 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.050
 common bases too far with 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.030

 basketball and lowering the tail too much 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.470
 mismatch between the bases and the flyer to 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.780
 moment to launch 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.280
 bases that do not complete the extension of 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.470
 the arms 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.380
 flyer that does not achieve the extension of 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.180
 body not maintain eye contact with 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.849
 the beach during execution 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.959
 bases that move away from the launch and not 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.959
 receive the flyer 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.820
 Y

 i 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.069
 yes 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.230
 extensions 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.230
 yes 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.890
 what if
