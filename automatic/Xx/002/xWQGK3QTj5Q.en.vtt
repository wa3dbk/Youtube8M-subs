00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
opposite side of the ball for my whole

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.660 
opposite side of the ball for my whole
career<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.880> women's<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.340> making<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.460> good

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
career in women's and making a good

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.249 
career in women's and making a good
clean<00:01:50.939> tackle<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.079> best

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
clean tackle it's one of the best

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
clean tackle it's one of the best
feelings<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> world<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.549> couldn't

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
feelings in the world so I couldn't

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.209 
feelings in the world so I couldn't
agree<00:01:54.180> more<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.020> might<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.649> really

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
agree more you know might be really

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.069 
agree more you know might be really
honestly<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.790> only<00:01:56.820> ones<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.360> hurt<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.869> bad

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
honestly the only ones that hurt of bad

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
honestly the only ones that hurt of bad
tactics<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.770> bad<00:01:59.070> form<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.610> gets<00:01:59.790> hurt

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
tactics it's bad form that gets hurt

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.670 
tactics it's bad form that gets hurt
it's<00:02:00.180> not<00:02:00.240> good<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:00.570> Jen<00:02:01.290> that's<00:02:01.469> why<00:02:01.619> you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it's not good for Jen that's why you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440 
it's not good for Jen that's why you
were<00:02:01.950> talking<00:02:02.310> about<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.579> flag<00:02:02.790> thing<00:02:03.090> yeah

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
were talking about the flag thing yeah

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.569 
were talking about the flag thing yeah
and<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.750> don't<00:02:03.810> actually<00:02:04.170> agree<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.950> don't<00:02:05.070> agree

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and I don't actually agree I don't agree

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.410 
and I don't actually agree I don't agree
with<00:02:07.069> teaching<00:02:08.069> our<00:02:08.190> kids<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.759> tackle<00:02:09.209> well

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
with teaching our kids to tackle well

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.270 
with teaching our kids to tackle well
later<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.530> that's<00:02:10.709> all<00:02:10.830> you're<00:02:10.979> gonna<00:02:11.069> do

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
later because that's all you're gonna do

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.070 
later because that's all you're gonna do
by<00:02:11.459> putting<00:02:11.610> them<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:11.970> flag<00:02:12.209> first

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
by putting them in flag first

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.740 
by putting them in flag first
think<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.410> should<00:02:13.770> teach<00:02:14.610> them<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.420> really

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
think you should teach them to really

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.450 
think you should teach them to really
tackle<00:02:15.960> which<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.470> like<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> rugby<00:02:16.890> tackle<00:02:17.190> so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
tackle which is like a rugby tackle so

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.800 
tackle which is like a rugby tackle so
you're<00:02:17.700> taking<00:02:17.940> your<00:02:18.060> head<00:02:18.270> out<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
you're taking your head out of the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.450 
you're taking your head out of the
equation<00:02:19.320> when<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.860> learn<00:02:19.980> how<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.220> tackle

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
equation when you learn how to tackle

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.070 
equation when you learn how to tackle
with<00:02:20.640> no<00:02:20.820> pads<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.240> no<00:02:21.300> helmet<00:02:21.630> like<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.870> did

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
with no pads and no helmet like I did

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.900 
with no pads and no helmet like I did
you<00:02:22.530> certainly<00:02:22.980> think<00:02:23.220> about<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.760> much

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
you certainly think about it in a much

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.700 
you certainly think about it in a much
different<00:02:24.120> way<00:02:24.330> when<00:02:24.930> they<00:02:25.020> gave<00:02:25.170> me<00:02:25.290> pads<00:02:25.530> and

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
different way when they gave me pads and

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.280 
different way when they gave me pads and
a<00:02:25.770> helmet<00:02:25.800> after<00:02:26.220> playing<00:02:26.430> rugby<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.290> was

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
a helmet after playing rugby I was

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.870 
a helmet after playing rugby I was
smarter<00:02:28.710> about<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.160> still<00:02:29.400> don't<00:02:29.550> lose<00:02:29.700> my

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
smarter about it I still don't lose my

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.270 
smarter about it I still don't lose my
use<00:02:30.270> my<00:02:30.450> head<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.810> tackles<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:31.590> if<00:02:31.920> people

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
use my head in tackles and if if people

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.560 
use my head in tackles and if if people
watch<00:02:32.430> my<00:02:32.670> game<00:02:32.730> film<00:02:33.120> they're<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:33.390> oh<00:02:33.510> you
