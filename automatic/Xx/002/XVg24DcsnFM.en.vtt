00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
on here we have another mod showcase and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.759 
on here we have another mod showcase and
today<00:00:12.750> we're<00:00:12.900> checking<00:00:13.049> out<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.500> solar

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
today we're checking out the solar

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.129 
today we're checking out the solar
apocalypse<00:00:13.920> mod<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.880> basically<00:00:15.780> what<00:00:15.990> this

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
apocalypse mod and basically what this

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.689 
apocalypse mod and basically what this
mod<00:00:16.320> does<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.100> makes<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.490> surface

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
mod does is it makes the surface

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.300 
mod does is it makes the surface
completely<00:00:18.439> inhabitable<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.710> that's<00:00:20.160> not

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
completely inhabitable and that's not

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.410 
completely inhabitable and that's not
the<00:00:20.460> reason<00:00:20.609> we're<00:00:20.850> actually<00:00:20.939> standing<00:00:21.330> on

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the reason we're actually standing on

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.670 
the reason we're actually standing on
this<00:00:21.570> platform<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.230> can<00:00:22.350> get<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> good

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
this platform it's so we can get a good

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.920 
this platform it's so we can get a good
look<00:00:22.740> later<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.519> when<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> actually<00:00:24.119> start<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
look later on when I actually start the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.620 
look later on when I actually start the
mod<00:00:25.080> off<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.060> yeah<00:00:27.060> but<00:00:27.240> we're<00:00:27.359> gonna<00:00:27.570> look

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
mod off and yeah but we're gonna look

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.150 
mod off and yeah but we're gonna look
through<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> crafting<00:00:28.199> recipes<00:00:28.529> first<00:00:28.769> okay

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
through the crafting recipes first okay

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.060 
through the crafting recipes first okay
okay<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.060> first<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:30.900> Pandavas<00:00:31.650> chests

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
okay so first up we have Pandavas chests

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.979 
okay so first up we have Pandavas chests
now<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.460> bin<00:00:32.669> causes<00:00:33.090> nothing<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:33.840> problems

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
now this bin causes nothing but problems

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.860 
now this bin causes nothing but problems
this<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.350> what<00:00:34.559> starts<00:00:34.980> everything<00:00:35.250> off<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
this is what starts everything off and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.330 
this is what starts everything off and
funny<00:00:36.870> enough<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.260> say<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.860> causes<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> lot<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
funny enough I say it causes a lot of

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.160 
funny enough I say it causes a lot of
problems<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.790> does<00:00:39.090> my<00:00:39.210> girlfriend<00:00:39.300> she<00:00:40.050> goes

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
problems so does my girlfriend she goes

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.049 
problems so does my girlfriend she goes
by<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.379> name<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.590> Pandora<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.129> minecraft<00:00:41.550> but

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
by the name of Pandora on minecraft but

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.440 
by the name of Pandora on minecraft but
anyway<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.800> craft<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.219> by<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.640> using<00:00:44.820> oak

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
anyway you craft this by just using oak

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.540 
anyway you craft this by just using oak
wood<00:00:45.899> birch<00:00:46.289> wood<00:00:46.590> any<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.160> wood<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.430> do

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
wood birch wood any kind of wood all do

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
wood birch wood any kind of wood all do
in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.660> normal<00:00:49.020> pattern<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.559> would<00:00:49.710> use

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
in the normal pattern that you would use

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.119 
in the normal pattern that you would use
logs<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.600> make<00:00:51.629> sorry<00:00:52.260> planks<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.800> make<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
logs to make sorry planks to make a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.540 
logs to make sorry planks to make a
normal<00:00:53.370> chest<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.449> that's<00:00:54.840> how<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
normal chest so that's how you do that

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.819 
normal chest so that's how you do that
then<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.840> where<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.050> your<00:00:58.140> obsidian

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
then we have where we have your obsidian

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.160 
then we have where we have your obsidian
glass<00:00:59.070> which<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> made<00:00:59.910> by<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.719> square<00:01:00.989> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
glass which is made by just a square of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.799 
glass which is made by just a square of
glass<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.559> obsidian<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> middle<00:01:02.809> then

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
glass with obsidian in the middle then

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.070 
glass with obsidian in the middle then
we<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.019> reinforced<00:01:04.619> glass<00:01:04.700> which<00:01:05.700> is

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
we have reinforced glass which is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
we have reinforced glass which is
obsidian<00:01:07.080> glass<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.560> never<00:01:07.950> quartz<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
obsidian glass with never quartz and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.910 
obsidian glass with never quartz and
then<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.420> never<00:01:10.020> glass<00:01:10.320> which<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
then we have never glass which is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.580 
then we have never glass which is
reinforced<00:01:11.700> glass<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> middle<00:01:12.170> for<00:01:13.170> never

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
reinforced glass in the middle for never

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.670 
reinforced glass in the middle for never
quartz<00:01:14.040> free<00:01:14.640> obsidian<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.990> make<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
quartz free obsidian and that make you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.440 
quartz free obsidian and that make you
never<00:01:17.070> glass<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.580> each<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.060> these<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
never glass now each one of these is a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.260 
never glass now each one of these is a
different<00:01:18.780> tier<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:20.220> Citian<00:01:21.090> glass

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
different tier so you have Citian glass

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.570 
different tier so you have Citian glass
which<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.049> lowest<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.560> reinforced<00:01:23.490> glass

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
which is the lowest one reinforced glass

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.240 
which is the lowest one reinforced glass
and<00:01:24.140> never<00:01:25.140> glass<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> future

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
and never glass because in the future

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.280 
and never glass because in the future
these<00:01:26.610> Plus<00:01:26.939> these<00:01:27.509> pieces<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.900> glass<00:01:28.049> will

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
these Plus these pieces of glass will

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.850 
these Plus these pieces of glass will
deteriorate

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
deteriorate

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.399 
deteriorate
apparently<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> presume<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.119> will<00:01:30.299> go<00:01:30.509> this

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
apparently so I presume it will go this

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.730 
apparently so I presume it will go this
is<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> weakest<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
is the weakest then this then this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.270 
is the weakest then this then this
anyway<00:01:34.770> well<00:01:35.460> yeah<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.799> Sun<00:01:37.799> sensor

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
anyway well yeah we have the Sun sensor

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.770 
anyway well yeah we have the Sun sensor
which<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.490> supposed<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.119> detect<00:01:39.390> when<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.110> is

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
which is supposed to detect when it is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.410 
which is supposed to detect when it is
like<00:01:42.780> nighttime<00:01:43.020> outside<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:43.770> daytime<00:01:44.420> which

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
like nighttime outside or daytime which

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.359 
like nighttime outside or daytime which
when<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> mod<00:01:46.979> actually<00:01:47.220> does

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
when you see what the mod actually does

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
when you see what the mod actually does
will<00:01:47.640> actually<00:01:47.909> make<00:01:48.060> sense<00:01:48.270> anyway<00:01:49.200> let's

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
will actually make sense anyway let's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.020 
will actually make sense anyway let's
start<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.710> mod<00:01:49.860> off<00:01:50.009> we'll<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.729> go<00:01:50.850> take

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
start the mod off we'll just go take

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.940 
start the mod off we'll just go take
this<00:01:51.149> one<00:01:51.360> from<00:01:51.540> here

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
this one from here

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
this one from here
I've<00:01:53.220> got<00:01:53.399> pigs<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> bit<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.930> an

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I've got pigs here to do a bit of an

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
apparently each stage takes a normal

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.100 
apparently each stage takes a normal
minecraft<00:02:11.700> day<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> complete<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:12.930> are

what stage you're on so but we want to
advance<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:34.290> stage<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:35.100> stage<00:02:35.250> zero<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.540> puck

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
advance the stage one stage zero so puck

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.270 
advance the stage one stage zero so puck
plus<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.940> are<00:02:42.060> now<00:02:42.210> on<00:02:42.420> stage<00:02:42.780> one<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.470> as

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
plus that we are now on stage one and as

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.220 
plus that we are now on stage one and as
you<00:02:44.460> can<00:02:44.550> see<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.940> can<00:02:45.090> see<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.570> grass

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
you can see you can see the grass

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.930 
you can see you can see the grass
turning<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.920> dirt<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.950> or<00:02:49.950> basically<00:02:50.520> all<00:02:50.730> the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
turning to dirt and or basically all the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.280 
turning to dirt and or basically all the
grass<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.360> they're<00:02:51.510> gonna<00:02:51.630> disappear<00:02:52.080> now

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
grass is they're gonna disappear now

grass is they're gonna disappear now
outs<00:02:52.530> apart<00:02:52.830> from<00:02:52.950> those<00:02:53.100> protecting<00:02:53.700> them

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
outs apart from those protecting them

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.270 
outs apart from those protecting them
the<00:02:53.970> trees<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.420> stuff<00:02:55.100> actually<00:02:56.100> is

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the trees and stuff actually is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.040 
the trees and stuff actually is
something<00:02:56.580> pretty<00:02:56.940> pretty<00:02:57.870> quickly<00:02:58.170> actually

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
something pretty pretty quickly actually

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.840 
something pretty pretty quickly actually
so<00:03:01.050> all<00:03:01.440> these<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.890> trees<00:03:02.100> all<00:03:02.280> should

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
so all these on the trees all should

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.080 
so all these on the trees all should
stay<00:03:03.270> around<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:04.500> not<00:03:04.860> for<00:03:05.190> long<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.880> that's

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
stay around but not for long so that's

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.700 
stay around but not for long so that's
stage<00:03:06.510> one<00:03:08.150> let's<00:03:09.150> get<00:03:09.300> up<00:03:09.450> here<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.930> we'll

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
stage one let's get up here and we'll

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.370 
stage one let's get up here and we'll
start<00:03:11.070> off<00:03:11.310> stage<00:03:13.760> two

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
start off stage two

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.960 
start off stage two
okay<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.680> stage<00:03:17.160> two<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.760> as<00:03:17.910> you

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970

even would actually is getting catching

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.270 
even would actually is getting catching
on<00:03:34.830> fire

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
on fire

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.449 
on fire
Oh<00:03:35.310> goddamn<00:03:36.209> even<00:03:36.510> god<00:03:37.290> damn<00:03:37.530> everything's

is actually a couple of glitches with
this<00:03:44.820> particular<00:03:45.390> mod<00:03:45.810> at<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.290> moment<00:03:46.560> but

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
this particular mod at the moment but

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.490 
this particular mod at the moment but
they<00:03:46.740> are<00:03:46.920> going<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.130> be<00:03:47.250> fixed<00:03:47.550> in<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.880> next

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
they are going to be fixed in the next

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.170 
they are going to be fixed in the next
version<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.890> let<00:03:50.310> me<00:03:50.430> see<00:03:50.610> what<00:03:50.820> happens<00:03:51.090> when

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
version and let me see what happens when

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.090 
version and let me see what happens when
I<00:03:51.209> go<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:51.390> game-mode<00:03:52.020> 0<00:03:53.810> now<00:03:55.070> technically<00:03:56.070> I

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
I go to game-mode 0 now technically I

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.220 
I go to game-mode 0 now technically I
should<00:03:57.000> die<00:03:57.990> but<00:03:58.709> as<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.190> can<00:03:59.340> see<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.990> glitch

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
should die but as you can see the glitch

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.220 
should die but as you can see the glitch
is<00:04:01.470> stopping<00:04:01.770> me<00:04:01.890> from<00:04:02.010> actually<00:04:02.490> dying<00:04:03.390> but

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
is stopping me from actually dying but

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.780 
is stopping me from actually dying but
the<00:04:04.410> next<00:04:04.620> version<00:04:04.920> of<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.070> mod<00:04:05.280> should<00:04:05.520> fix

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
the next version of this mod should fix

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.310 
the next version of this mod should fix
it<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.780> should<00:04:07.020> be<00:04:07.140> all<00:04:07.470> cool<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:09.320> but

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
it and it should be all cool and but

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.660 
it and it should be all cool and but
basically<00:04:10.590> what<00:04:10.800> this<00:04:10.890> body<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.190> supposed<00:04:11.489> to

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
basically what this body is supposed to

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.000 
basically what this body is supposed to
do<00:04:11.820> is<00:04:12.060> force<00:04:12.570> you<00:04:12.840> on<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.350> ground<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:13.980> that

right now but as I said in the future it

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.589

should<00:04:57.069> look<00:04:57.250> pretty<00:04:57.280> cool<00:04:58.110> but<00:04:59.110> anyway

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599
