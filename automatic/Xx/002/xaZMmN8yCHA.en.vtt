00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.320
 welcome we are geek elements and today 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.750
 we will be playing new hairston 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.720
 Card blizzard game based on 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.519
 world of warcraft we're going specifically 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.639
 to be seeing how the 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.530
 cards and how the decks are assembled since 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.350
 you have them and you open the packages 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.539
 we started opening the games and we 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.419
 we go directly to the store 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.820
 I chose to buy 15 packages for 19 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:35.149
 dollars we put you buy we put the 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.629
 password and it is assumed that at least 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:42.110
 One card per package will be rare or 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.210
 better epic or legendary me there we see 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.370
 that they just gave me a card 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.310
 legendary for participating in the beta 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.220
 test 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.430
 in theory when you finish treat all the 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.920
 cards are going to be deleted except that 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.610
 we open the first package we carry 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.730
 watching pure shit and a champions of 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.460
 paladin that I do not love but good the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.040
 second pack for the shit was flying 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.510
 by this they call x 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.960
 is the most willing package for a 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.960
 epic 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.490
 we keep opening letters 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.320
 ok hunter nothing good clubs can 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.830
 disenchant and create letters that you 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830
 interest in 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.040
 a rare 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.630
 more hunter whores it seems that you are going to have 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.630
 to play together 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.920
 I would like to play warlock but have not seen 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.920
 more than a single letter 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.220
 magnificent a legendary of all the 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.260
 classes wrong but that are going to have to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.130
 erase when the btt ends this will be a 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.330
 very good letter I also left 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.270
 enough cards that are for all 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.290
 the classes that are very well many of 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.020
 crisis many paladin who roe 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.490
 an interesting drug has only come out 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.799
 one I believe 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.200
 accelerate and this very much so that it does not 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:15.980
 I made lazy another epic of hunter 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.230
 and they are over as they see this is 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.569
 fun to buy them and start to see what 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.290
 is what you have 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.889
 with after you start creating your hands 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.650
 also there on the right side of is the 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:33.139
 number 5 with a blue bottle that 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.900
 it means that I can be disenchanted 5 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:39.100
 letters and when disenchanting 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.500
 I can generate some that I want 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.440
 this in the next video we will see how 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.960
 as arming will decks there are 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.350
 seeing in our legendary card that 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.350
 not out 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.739
 Well, I hope you have served 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.930
 from a little introduction of this 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.550
 new game of blizzard me the truth 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.410
 I had never played a card game 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:06.050
 type magic this this seems like 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.330
 a more simplified way to play a 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.610
 game of those but the truth is very 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.890
 fun see you in the next video
