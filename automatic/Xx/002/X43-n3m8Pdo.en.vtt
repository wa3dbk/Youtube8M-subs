00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.520
 hello we are going with a new recipe that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.039
 based on a single idea put in brine 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.020
 the chicken before doing it with this 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.970
 we will get the chicken to be more 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.220
 juicy you know that sometimes chicken 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.080
 roasted is something dry especially the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.360
 breast with the brine we try 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.580
 avoid it for it we are going to dissolve the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.190
 salt in the water this blumenthal says that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 the best proportion is that there is 6% of 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.780
 salt for each liter of water the amount 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.610
 of water will depend on the container that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.010
 you are using since the objective 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.110
 is to cover the chicken once we have the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.780
 measure taken we dissolve the salt in the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.400
 water with the help of rods 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 we introduce the chicken we press for 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.050
 that it submerges well and we're going to leave it 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.420
 in the refrigerator a minimum of 6 hours passed 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.870
 that time we removed it and we drained the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.870
 Water 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.600
 ah 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.690
 we dry them with the help of a napkin 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.690
 of paper 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.430
 Salt pepper is not necessary because it has 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.430
 been in brine 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.729
 oregano 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.540
 and now you could spray it with oil 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.340
 olive put it together 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.130
 I'm going to use lard 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.500
 Iberian 'which gives a special touch 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.540
 try to make sure it's well smeared all 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.360
 parts also looks great without 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.070
 introduce butter between the skin and 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.330
 chicken meat for that you have to be 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.330
 a little more skillful 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.210
 and now you can put the garrison 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.899
 I'm just going to put a couple of 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.899
 chopped onions 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.000
 and a dram of vermouth 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.610
 ah 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.100
 inside a couple of cloves of garlic 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.100
 crushed and two bay leaves 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.650
 and we can put it in the oven 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.470
 if you have a program of these air 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.080
 so you leave it at 160 degrees a couple of 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.240
 180 degrees 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.870
 out there half an hour and 45 with heat alone 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.870
 on the bottom 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.150
 and this is already good I hope that I have 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.150
 liked a hug until then
