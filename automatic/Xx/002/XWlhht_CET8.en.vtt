00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello everyone we find ourselves for 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.770
 a video cooking we will make small 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.210
 Easter eggs 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:17.520
 so I'm trying mill here's it 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:19.560
 and we will need a tablet of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.670
 milk chocolate from a tablet of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.760
 white chocolate vanilla aroma of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.070
 condensed milk was needed 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.539
 of arms there and that's really 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.730
 optional I want to give 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.680
 really a little hint of coconut in 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.809
 done inside my show that good 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.730
 here I am going to do kinds of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.140
 chocobo so we'll start all of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.410
 then we will melt in the microwave 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.750
 milk chocolate and we will put in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.989
 inside the molds and do it well 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.600
 frozen in the freezer for ten 10 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.820
 small minutes while the chocolate 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920
 is in the freezer you are going to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.120
 to occupy white chocolate so we will 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.730
 melt in the microwave 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.920
 once the white chocolate is melted 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.510
 you're going to put the equivalent of a 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.320
 tablespoon of condensed milk 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:13.170
 you're going to put teaspoon of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.520
 coconut cream so a tablespoon 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:24.270
 and you will put 50 g of praslin 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.689
 and a teaspoon of aromas of 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.750
 valves 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.450
 it will make all the difference so here 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.299
 we mix everything and we will fill our 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.200
 little ones we will then place at 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.540
 freezer 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.000
 so here are some mussels and you 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.689
 go heat up just do it a 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.310
 saucepan and you will pass small 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.189
 stuff like that deep down so that the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.220
 chocolate do a little bit but 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.470
 really slightly spent here for the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.470
 stick together 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.150
 for you 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.510
 and that's the result of my little shocks 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.750
 at the right corner we will go to the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.580
 tasting 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.610
 so I crunched I find that taste 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.220
 is very much like the real shocks to 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.989
 good I hope this video will have you 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.930
 it is very easy to achieve 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.340
 and then we meet again 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.209
 again for an upcoming video 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.209
 big bing ciao
