00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
to understand that what we try to build

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.240 
to understand that what we try to build
from<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.260> cinematics<00:00:42.769> that<00:00:42.980> become

navigation to combat to you know range

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.119 
navigation to combat to you know range
combat<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.870> from<00:00:51.019> range<00:00:51.230> come<00:00:51.440> back<00:00:51.620> to<00:00:51.769> melee

and back into cinematic that that is
this<00:00:54.589> this<00:00:55.070> this<00:00:55.610> mix<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.570> all<00:00:56.750> these<00:00:56.870> things

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
this this this mix of all these things

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.869 
this this this mix of all these things
that<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.289> beats<00:00:57.500> that<00:00:57.710> we<00:00:57.860> do<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:58.610> all<00:00:58.730> of<00:00:58.850> that

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
that the beats that we do to all of that

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.060 
that the beats that we do to all of that
and<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.480> pacing<00:00:59.840> of<00:00:59.930> it<00:01:00.110> that<00:01:00.559> really<00:01:00.770> is<00:01:01.010> the

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
and the pacing of it that really is the

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.389 
and the pacing of it that really is the
game<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:03.140> that's<00:01:03.829> what<00:01:04.100> we<00:01:04.190> try<00:01:04.369> to

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
game and and and that's what we try to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.370 
game and and and that's what we try to
do<00:01:04.610> differently<00:01:05.059> with<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.509> a<00:01:05.690> third<00:01:05.990> person

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
do differently with the a third person

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.930 
do differently with the a third person
shooter<00:01:06.649> mechanics<00:01:07.369> than<00:01:07.550> what<00:01:07.759> you<00:01:07.850> would

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
shooter mechanics than what you would

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:19.730 
shooter mechanics than what you would
normally<00:01:08.060> expect<00:01:08.300> with<00:01:08.690> another<00:01:08.899> one

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.200

on about more than a millennia ago

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.360 
on about more than a millennia ago
there's<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.170> there's<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.590> split<00:01:44.800> in<00:01:44.980> humanity

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
there's a there's a split in humanity

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.920 
there's a there's a split in humanity
that<00:01:45.490> happens<00:01:45.820> between<00:01:45.970> humans<00:01:46.870> and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
that happens between humans and

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.290 
that happens between humans and
half-breeds<00:01:47.320> humans<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.490> what<00:01:48.940> becomes

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
half-breeds humans and what becomes

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.160 
half-breeds humans and what becomes
half-breeds<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.110> they<00:01:50.560> go<00:01:50.800> on<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:52.480> wage

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
half-breeds and they go on to to wage

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.140 
half-breeds and they go on to to wage
war<00:01:53.470> against<00:01:53.710> humans<00:01:54.070> mainly<00:01:54.640> before<00:01:54.940> the

war against humans mainly before the

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.370 
war against humans mainly before the
same<00:01:55.300> reasons<00:01:55.600> that<00:01:55.630> everybody<00:01:56.050> does<00:01:56.260> you

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
same reasons that everybody does you

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.440 
same reasons that everybody does you
know<00:01:56.500> when<00:01:56.890> there's<00:01:57.250> war<00:01:57.460> it's<00:01:57.970> either<00:01:58.150> for

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
know when there's war it's either for

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.420 
know when there's war it's either for
control<00:01:58.780> dominion<00:01:59.260> supremacy<00:02:00.120> survival<00:02:01.350> and

control dominion supremacy survival and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.030 
control dominion supremacy survival and
in<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:03.550> case<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:04.060> survival<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.870> war<00:02:05.320> takes<00:02:05.830> on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
in this case the survival a war takes on

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.470 
in this case the survival a war takes on
the<00:02:06.130> role<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.310> becoming<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:07.060> know<00:02:07.090> trying<00:02:07.390> to

the role of becoming you know trying to

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.930 
the role of becoming you know trying to
take<00:02:07.600> dominion<00:02:07.960> over<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.230> other<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:09.369> it

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
take dominion over the other and it it

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.370 
take dominion over the other and it it
blows<00:02:10.390> out<00:02:10.510> it<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.750> an<00:02:10.840> all-out<00:02:11.020> war<00:02:11.350> between

depending<00:03:43.160> on<00:03:43.400> who<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:43.760> take<00:03:43.910> on<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.330> the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
depending on who you take on the the

depending on who you take on the the
thing<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.290> we<00:03:45.380> wanted<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.680> do<00:03:45.800> is<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:46.040> make

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
thing that we wanted to do is to make

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.430 
thing that we wanted to do is to make
sure<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.400> all<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:46.640> these<00:03:46.820> gameplay

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
sure that all of these gameplay

sure that all of these gameplay
mechanics<00:03:48.440> actually<00:03:48.710> fit<00:03:49.460> into<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.840> hero's

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
mechanics actually fit into the hero's

throughout<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:54.320> although<00:03:54.530> there<00:03:55.070> will<00:03:55.160> be

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
throughout so although there will be

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.070 
throughout so although there will be
different<00:03:55.459> mechanics<00:03:56.030> use<00:03:56.690> for<00:03:56.959> different

different mechanics use for different

different mechanics use for different
ones<00:03:57.410> sometimes<00:03:58.130> we<00:03:58.459> do<00:03:58.640> need<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.910> mix<00:03:59.090> them<00:03:59.300> to

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
ones sometimes we do need to mix them to

ones sometimes we do need to mix them to
make<00:03:59.660> sure<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.080> know<00:04:00.200> there<00:04:00.500> are

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
make sure that you know there are

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
certain made a mechanics that might work

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.720 
certain made a mechanics that might work
even<00:04:02.300> for<00:04:02.830> fighting<00:04:03.830> humans<00:04:04.190> that<00:04:04.430> would<00:04:04.580> work

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
even for fighting humans that would work

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.010 
even for fighting humans that would work

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
better for fighting half bridge but you

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.290
