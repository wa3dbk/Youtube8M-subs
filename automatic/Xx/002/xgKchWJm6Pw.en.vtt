explain it now I know why it's just

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.220 
explain it now I know why it's just
something

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
something

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.599 
something
the<00:03:40.230> competition<00:03:40.769> was<00:03:40.829> fantastic<00:03:41.489> in

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
the competition was fantastic in

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.610 
the competition was fantastic in
particular<00:03:41.849> today's<00:03:42.299> cal<00:03:42.659> south<00:03:42.930> but<00:03:43.230> he<00:03:43.319> saw

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
particular today's cal south but he saw

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.050 
particular today's cal south but he saw
the<00:03:43.680> amount<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.010> pressure<00:03:44.189> that<00:03:44.340> they<00:03:44.579> put<00:03:45.030> on

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
the amount of pressure that they put on

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.970 
the amount of pressure that they put on
us<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.480> think<00:03:45.930> we<00:03:45.989> played<00:03:46.200> very<00:03:46.230> well<00:03:46.620> early<00:03:46.680> on

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
us I think we played very well early on

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.940 
us I think we played very well early on
it<00:03:47.819> was<00:03:47.939> a<00:03:48.060> great<00:03:48.420> goal<00:03:48.659> and<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.379> think<00:03:49.590> after<00:03:49.680> we

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
it was a great goal and I think after we

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.250 
it was a great goal and I think after we
scored<00:03:50.129> we<00:03:50.549> got<00:03:50.939> a<00:03:50.969> bit<00:03:51.180> frantic<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.870> think

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
scored we got a bit frantic I think

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.080 
scored we got a bit frantic I think
overall<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.709> team<00:03:52.890> can<00:03:53.099> play<00:03:53.250> better<00:03:53.489> our

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
overall the team can play better our

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.789 
overall the team can play better our
team<00:03:54.769> however<00:03:56.329> they<00:03:57.329> just<00:03:57.540> show<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.079> resilience

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
team however they just show a resilience

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.800 
team however they just show a resilience
and<00:03:59.159> did<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.790> things<00:04:00.000> they<00:04:00.120> needed<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.510> do<00:04:00.629> to

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
and did the things they needed to do to

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.599 
and did the things they needed to do to
prevent<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.319> cal<00:04:01.650> south<00:04:01.859> for<00:04:02.099> put<00:04:02.280> one<00:04:02.400> in<00:04:02.519> the

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
prevent the cal south for put one in the

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.089 
prevent the cal south for put one in the
back<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.909> the<00:04:02.969> net<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.829> there<00:04:04.829> was<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.950> lot<00:04:05.010> of

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
back of the net and there was a lot of

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.280 
back of the net and there was a lot of
pressure<00:04:05.430> on<00:04:05.549> us<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:06.150> we<00:04:06.840> may<00:04:06.959> have<00:04:07.049> caused

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
pressure on us and we may have caused

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.229 
pressure on us and we may have caused
some<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.739> but<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:08.730> look<00:04:08.939> at<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.090> whole
