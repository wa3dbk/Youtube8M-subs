 import substitution on our shelves 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.759

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:34.370

 Alexander Alexander Trufanov's greenhouse 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.590
 for four years now 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.500
 he took up her growing hand singing 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.070
 with onion radish salad then decided a couple 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:58.710
 and berries do near Moscow state farm ate 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:03.149
 I ordered a box with seedlings sent to me 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:08.729
 one hundred twenty five pieces of them survived 20 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.310
 pieces and so now for 4 years how do I own 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.320
 sotok and distributed now says 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.659
 Alexander strawberry though is but for now 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.360
 not as sweet as it should be 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.610
 April sun is not enough for her 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.729
 so that it grows better and more heat 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.200
 received alexander even decided gradually 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.170
 abandon the usual beds for all 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.850
 which grows strawberries 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.950
 it smells very tasty to 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.549
 strawberries got more light which means 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.530
 it is better 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.420
 grew and was not just such here 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.700
 beautiful red but also 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.680
 delicious Alexander grows and and here in 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.140
 Such columns earlier for this he 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.079
 used these Chinese pots 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.240
 then learned how to make pots 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.200
 independently from here so dense 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.090
 plastic film 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.430
 this is not the last innovation 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.439
 alexandra trufanova four years ago 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.110
 when he took up strawberries he decided to grow 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.299
 her in environmentally friendly conditions without 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.759
 pesticide and herbicide use 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.230
 engaged in the so-called organic 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.660
 farming has been saying in america for a long time 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.870
 Is it to fertilize the earth started 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.710
 Californian worms they attach to the soil 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:18.640
 structure from u respectively fertilize and 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:23.740
 and the seedlings are very much earlier 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.520
 on worms that is russia begin early 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.950
 bears fruit 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.050
 Alexander's greenhouse works all year round 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.210
 heat is maintained due to thermo 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.370
 a blanket and a heat gun true 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.740
 heating is expensive for example 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.900
 only the day the work of the gun costs 700 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.880
 rubles to at least somehow recoup the costs 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.620
 on the production of Alexander tries 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.260
 greenhouse area used by 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.260
 the maximum here right here I did the shelves 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.250
 to use rationally area 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.740
 greenhouses and planted accordingly 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.520
 strawberries while she is going to bear fruit 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.740
 the radish will be ready next 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.020
 salad ready nevertheless to recoup the costs 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.030
 completely still not working 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.340
 strawberries have not yet grown to large 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.230
 volumes but onions radish salad despite 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.030
 on the fact that they are grown in environmentally friendly 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.430
 conditions not particularly popular 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.440
 enjoyed too people used to 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.959
 Alexander says to Chinese vegetables 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.300
 stores don't break through there vegetables from 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.730
 under heaven all flooded Alexander 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.180
 worries that of strawberries can also 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.180
 turn out 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.250
 Alexander recognized until greenhouse and 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.950
 strawberry is more of a hobby for him 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:45.500
 but throwing it trufanov is not going to 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:49.390
 this is not business this is a lifestyle in the future 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.110
 all the same, I hope that the products will be 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:59.090
 in demand and people will come here 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:01.820
 Still, all natural for people 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.390
 grown strawberries are nothing 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.730
 inferior 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.440
 imported and Alexander believes someday 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.930
 his organic strawberries 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.620
 Amur people try and be proud to 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.570
