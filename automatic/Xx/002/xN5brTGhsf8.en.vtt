 how short I'm going to leave the link 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.479
 Direct of the video you are already creating 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.040
 for this collaboration and that of your channel 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.600
 and without more to say if you want 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.990
 know how to recreate this makeup for 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.840
 the night you know, keep seeing 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.360
 applying a pre-base for the eyes this 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.220
 comes from mac is the colombianito 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.080
 on the pipe line 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.000
 dries too fast as you can see 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.610
 so they have to blur a very 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.570
 quick from there we're going to apply the color 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.030
 orange soda from the line of shadows of 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.860
 Anna knows herself religious and once 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.040
 we have diffused that warmth we are going to 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.010
 apply the cyan color to this we have 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.110
 been applying a little bit up 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.650
 the oceans basin do not use no 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.290
 up with forgiveness like the o in zone and 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.580
 we will blend very well what already 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.320
 then let's go back with the skewer 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.330
 that we apply it in soda to 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.810
 blur their two colors and do not miss 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.670
 the color and you know girls when we go 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.670
 to work with dark colors have 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.070
 to blur from one color to one color or 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.890
 it is not intended to blur until the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.440
 last the colors that is simply the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.000
 Vanilla color directly from the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.220
 stay we will not use to give us 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.480
 a little bit of light in the pretty of the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.430
 eyebrow we blur it and apply the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.020
 money the black also comes from 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.019
 religious anastasia all salvation 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.430
 I really like her 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.859
 too black but how 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.530
 in the other co I think the test is what 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:28.150
 it helped a lot with these shadows like this 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.670
 that I'm going to have to use another one for pre 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.469
 base for a tutorial to see that 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.930
 do the tests now are networks 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.780
 primary that is the base because if I 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.280
 has happened before with this pre base to go 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.170
 let's combine very well take your time 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.909
 as I tell you why work with euros 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.099
 easier here I am adding a 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.500
 little bit more of cyan color to so 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.530
 help determine the black color because 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.090
 you know it's not very difficult to blur 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.389
 I want is to make sure I'm using some 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.769
 are from Murcia and others where it was going to 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:00.340
 shortly and then leave the link of the 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.870
 brushes these vicissitudes or I was going to do 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.329
 this often very much at the time 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.329
 to blur the black is from the I say sorry 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.980
 is mobile is the line flowers and 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.290
 Take your time as with working with 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.359
 euros and what would not have to get now 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.950
 very are a base that has no protector 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.159
 solar because how are we going to go out at night 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.810
 they do not want to get white out of their face like this 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.549
 that I use this that comes from making 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.709
 up forever and the truth 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.049
 this base is a light cover 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.970
 not concrete this base is perfect 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.830
 as 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.370
 does not have sunscreen so to the 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.920
 time to take white photos if you have 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.660
 and acne problems and that is not 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.000
 I will work very well to the mind 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.390
 you take corrector before putting on 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.660
 base and we blend very well you know that 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.160
 my profession 1080 say that he lives her as 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.840
 who and he gets to this procedure 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.460
 here I am applying a little bit of 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.370
 correct concealer that is being 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.360
 of sea is the web colon in the color that 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.730
 in that 20 and like I'm going to blur 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.550
 with the jury planner I will use the part 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.410
 it has as piquito to 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.959
 between well in the lacrimal area and everything 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.410
 those data where I think the proofreader and 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.750
 I correct dark circles and whatnot so 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.790
 that also here take your time to 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.370
 that they do not have left if I put very pasteloso 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.950
 and once we have applied the 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.780
 corrector I will teach using this 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.120
 contour of anastasia and has been the 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.980
 I'm going to banana and vanilla 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.200
 mix the two and that's what I 'm going to use 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.200
 to seal my concealer 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.450
 and as you can see does not look cheesy 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.860
 when he put these two products together 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.470
 It always leaves me like a very 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.390
 nice from there we're going to apply a pencil 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.920
 black does not have to be this you 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.050
 they can be the black you want 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.660
 because we all carve with the shadow 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.940
 black so that it does not move us we seal 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.330
 the pencil and we're also going to apply the 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.320
 black shadow abajito on the eyelashes 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.770
 because that's what the 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.380
 more dramatic and smoked finish like this 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.970
 that apply the color black and hence the 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.870
 black color and we will be blurring 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.710
 with the color 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.990
 annasia rihanna as I say so 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.960
 that blur this very well what comes 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.430
 being solivary and seriously girls 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.440
 I recommend a lot the night is of its 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.600
 olive and morphing that are my 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.570
 you already know that those are 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.460
 all the time already there we are going to apply 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.110
 this color is called metal that 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.720
 it's also nastassja's too 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.190
 written glitter and I loved to put it 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.260
 narrate the animal because it gives 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.380
 a lot of light as a touch 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.870
 this makeup has been better for me 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.410
 applying the illuminator that has been 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.940
 pop art that is the name 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.750
 illumination spa that gives me a little bit of 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.550
 light and cloud to my face call bronze 100 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.170
 I was erased but now I'm going 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.160
 to teach more or less as of what 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.010
 bronze 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.440
 simply bronze there are all 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.950
 different is something very light is not the 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.530
 environment for constant programmatic something 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.360
 What I'm going to do is contour my 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.640
 nose because when you leave 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.310
 night and take to take pictures do not want 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.910
 that the nose disappear photos like this 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.340
 that 's a good sign for it to come out 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.200
 the analyze the photos have to be the 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.100
 outline of the separate analysis that we have 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.460
 finished father maris and how can 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.220
 look a little bit sharper and now if 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.410
 my nose already there we will be applying 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.000
 the labial and this has been the 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.620
 labials poured from the room 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.940
 color spring hollywood
