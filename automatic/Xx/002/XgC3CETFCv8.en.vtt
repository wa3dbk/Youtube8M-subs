differences<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.609> selections<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.270> do

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
differences in selections that we do

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.900 
differences in selections that we do
have<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.840> checking<00:00:22.140> voltage<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:23.519> start<00:00:23.760> off

have for checking voltage to start off

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.460 
have for checking voltage to start off
though<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> couple<00:00:25.320> different

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
though we have a couple different

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.950 
though we have a couple different
selections<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:27.090> multimeter<00:00:27.510> typically

you'll see V AC or V DC V AC is voltage

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
you'll see V AC or V DC V AC is voltage
obviously<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.149> alternating<00:00:33.809> current

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
obviously but it's alternating current

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440 
obviously but it's alternating current
and<00:00:34.550> alternating<00:00:35.550> current<00:00:35.940> you're<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.390> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and alternating current you're going to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330

be using and I know I'm skipping over
quite<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> few<00:00:55.500> there<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.800> V<00:00:56.670> DC<00:00:56.850> 20<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.410> have

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
quite a few there is V DC 20 so we have

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.529 
quite a few there is V DC 20 so we have
up<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.770> 20<00:00:59.250> volts<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.850> could<00:01:00.030> check<00:01:00.300> with

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
up to 20 volts that we could check with

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.569 
up to 20 volts that we could check with

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
current and on the multimeter you'll see

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.730 
current and on the multimeter you'll see
two<00:01:06.270> test<00:01:06.570> probes<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.170> negative<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
two test probes we have negative and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.830 
two test probes we have negative and
pause<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:08.670> let<00:01:08.880> me<00:01:08.970> guys<00:01:09.119> let<00:01:09.600> me<00:01:09.659> tell

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
pause and now let me guys let me tell

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.960 
pause and now let me guys let me tell
you<00:01:09.900> guys<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.320> doesn't<00:01:10.890> matter<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.640> reverse

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
you guys it doesn't matter if we reverse

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.609 
you guys it doesn't matter if we reverse
these<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:13.110> quick<00:01:13.400> little<00:01:14.600> show<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.659> how<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
these and a quick little show you how it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
these and a quick little show you how it
works<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.670> were<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> type<00:01:17.970> check<00:01:18.390> voltage

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
works so if I were to type check voltage

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.749 
works so if I were to type check voltage
of<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.080> battery<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.590> example<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.130> should<00:01:20.640> be

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
of this battery for example I should be

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.130 
of this battery for example I should be
getting<00:01:21.000> 12<00:01:21.299> volts<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:21.840> gonna<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.049> ahead

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
getting 12 volts so I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.249 
getting 12 volts so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:22.229> attach<00:01:22.500> my<00:01:22.710> test<00:01:23.040> probe<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.490> ground<00:01:24.259> my

hey<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:48.240> got<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> test<00:01:48.659> probes<00:01:48.899> reversed

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
hey we got the test probes reversed

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.800 
hey we got the test probes reversed
which<00:01:50.130> means<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.939> wire<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.479> actually

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
which means this wire is actually

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.319 
which means this wire is actually
positive<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.590> wire<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.920> actually<00:01:53.189> ground<00:01:53.430> so

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
positive this wire is actually ground so

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.450 
positive this wire is actually ground so
quick<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.899> easy<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.409> there<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:56.399> we

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
quick little easy right there now we

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.639 
quick little easy right there now we
have<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> second<00:01:57.360> meter<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:57.899> it's

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
have a second meter here which it's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.080 
have a second meter here which it's
actually<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.950> fluke<00:01:59.219> meter<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.579> don't<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.939> it

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
actually a fluke meter I don't like it

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.700 
actually a fluke meter I don't like it
as<00:02:00.180> much<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> ideal<00:02:01.020> meter<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.500> honest

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
as much as the ideal meter to be honest

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.870 
as much as the ideal meter to be honest
with<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.130> ones<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> bunch<00:02:02.759> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
with you I like ones with a bunch of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.789 
with you I like ones with a bunch of
different<00:02:03.119> settings<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:04.439> one's<00:02:04.649> very

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
different settings but this one's very

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.059 
different settings but this one's very
basic<00:02:05.310> very<00:02:05.850> very<00:02:06.149> basic<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.500> V<00:02:07.829> with

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
basic very very basic here we see V with

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.990 
basic very very basic here we see V with
a<00:02:08.099> little<00:02:08.280> wavy<00:02:08.429> line<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.879> means

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
a little wavy line that means

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.430 
a little wavy line that means
alternating<00:02:09.629> current<00:02:09.959> because<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.229> going

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
alternating current because it's going

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.800 
alternating current because it's going
up<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.739> down<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.790> we<00:02:11.879> have<00:02:12.000> V<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.510> straight

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
up and down then we have V with straight

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.550 
up and down then we have V with straight
line<00:02:12.989> which<00:02:13.349> is

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
line which is

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.260 
line which is
basically<00:02:13.739> direct-current<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.060> same<00:02:15.239> thing

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
basically direct-current so same thing

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.990 
basically direct-current so same thing
with<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.660> fluke<00:02:16.020> meter<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.849> can<00:02:17.849> actually

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
with this fluke meter I can actually

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.110 
with this fluke meter I can actually
test<00:02:18.330> voltage<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:21.680> see<00:02:22.680> I'm<00:02:23.459> getting<00:02:23.880> twelve

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
test voltage and see I'm getting twelve

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.809 
test voltage and see I'm getting twelve
point<00:02:24.360> six<00:02:24.540> two<00:02:24.810> volts<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.190> reversed<00:02:26.580> I

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
point six two volts and if I reversed I

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.220 
point six two volts and if I reversed I
would<00:02:26.940> get<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> same<00:02:27.420> reading<00:02:27.810> as<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.050> did<00:02:28.200> on

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
would get the same reading as I did on

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.380 
would get the same reading as I did on
the<00:02:28.380> ideal<00:02:28.770> meter<00:02:29.040> showing<00:02:29.700> me<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.849> negative

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
the ideal meter showing me a negative
