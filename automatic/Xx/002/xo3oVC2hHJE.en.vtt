00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
well I don't know like I guess we come

well I don't know like I guess we come
in<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> lot<00:00:48.120> more<00:00:48.180> prepared<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.989> feel<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
in a lot more prepared I feel like the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.040 
in a lot more prepared I feel like the
other<00:00:49.500> teams<00:00:49.710> really<00:00:49.920> aren't<00:00:50.660> picking<00:00:51.660> good

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
other teams really aren't picking good

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.010 
other teams really aren't picking good
champs<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.820> lot<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> time<00:00:54.180> they're<00:00:54.989> not

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
champs a lot of the time they're not

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.060 
champs a lot of the time they're not
banning<00:00:55.410> correct<00:00:55.649> jams<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:56.010> well<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:57.020> mean

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
banning correct jams as well but I mean

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.750 
banning correct jams as well but I mean
maybe<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.460> good<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.670> this

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
maybe we're just really good in this

champion<00:01:05.280> selectors<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.060> component

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
champion selectors that just a component

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.270 
champion selectors that just a component
of<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:07.229> definitely<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.830> component

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
of it that's definitely just a component

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.190 
of it that's definitely just a component
of<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.030> seems<00:01:09.510> significant<00:01:10.080> right

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
of it but it it seems significant right

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840 
of it but it it seems significant right
now<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.770> least<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.010> these<00:01:11.340> first<00:01:11.460> few<00:01:11.670> games

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
now at least in these first few games

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
now at least in these first few games
we'll<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.450> if<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> continues<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.110> lot<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
we'll see if it continues a lot of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.929 
we'll see if it continues a lot of
people<00:01:13.890> are<00:01:14.100> looking<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> team<00:01:14.700> fights

seen<00:01:21.240> specifically<00:01:22.110> Korea<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.090> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
seen specifically Korea you know do you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.520 
seen specifically Korea you know do you
think<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> guys<00:01:24.840> look<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.259> Korea

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
think do you guys look at Korea

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.020 
think do you guys look at Korea
specifically<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.220> inspiration<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> has

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
specifically for inspiration and it has

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
specifically for inspiration and it has
a<00:01:27.060> sort<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> coincidence<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.140> play

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
a sort of a coincidence that your play

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.590 
a sort of a coincidence that your play
style<00:01:28.799> coincides<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.369> theirs<00:01:29.640> well<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> think

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
style coincides with theirs well I think

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
style coincides with theirs well I think
the<00:01:30.840> team<00:01:31.049> fighting<00:01:31.259> thing<00:01:31.470> first<00:01:31.829> start

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the team fighting thing first start

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.800 
the team fighting thing first start
happened<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.520> curse<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.509> were<00:01:33.630> kind

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
happened with curse because we were kind

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
happened with curse because we were kind
of<00:01:33.840> getting<00:01:33.960> destroyed<00:01:34.890> early<00:01:35.189> game<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.670> i

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
of getting destroyed early game but i

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.069 
of getting destroyed early game but i

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
predictions but do you are you pretty

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.339

confident<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.810> guys<00:03:33.900> are<00:03:33.959> gonna<00:03:34.049> be<00:03:34.139> able<00:03:34.199> to

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
confident you guys are gonna be able to

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.449 
confident you guys are gonna be able to
finish<00:03:34.470> top<00:03:34.739> two<00:03:34.889> in<00:03:34.919> the<00:03:35.069> season<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:37.459> think

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
finish top two in the season I think

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.680 
finish top two in the season I think
it'll<00:03:38.579> get<00:03:38.730> harder<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.150> season<00:03:39.449> goes<00:03:39.540> on

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
it'll get harder as the season goes on

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.059 
it'll get harder as the season goes on
because<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.079> think<00:03:40.139> other<00:03:40.590> teams<00:03:40.799> are<00:03:40.859> going<00:03:41.010> to

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
because I think other teams are going to

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.119 
because I think other teams are going to
get<00:03:41.159> job<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.459> know<00:03:41.549> like<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> lot<00:03:41.879> of<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.269> like<00:03:42.449> a

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
get job I know like a lot of the like a

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.500 
get job I know like a lot of the like a
lot<00:03:44.129> of<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.280> big<00:03:44.400> teams<00:03:44.549> went<00:03:44.819> on<00:03:44.909> long<00:03:45.150> breaks

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
lot of the big teams went on long breaks

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.569 
lot of the big teams went on long breaks
before<00:03:45.840> like<00:03:46.229> between<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.859> seasons<00:03:47.159> which<00:03:47.459> is

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
before like between the seasons which is

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.949 
before like between the seasons which is
hurting<00:03:47.819> them<00:03:47.909> right<00:03:48.000> now<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.810> think

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
hurting them right now so I think

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.449 
hurting them right now so I think
they'll<00:03:49.169> start<00:03:49.530> catching<00:03:49.650> up<00:03:49.889> I<00:03:50.069> think

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
they'll start catching up I think

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.670 
they'll start catching up I think
they're<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:50.760> kind<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.090> at<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.079> bad<00:03:52.290> spot<00:03:52.620> right

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
they're just kind of at a bad spot right

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.129 
they're just kind of at a bad spot right
now<00:03:53.090> do<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.180> think<00:03:54.359> that<00:03:54.479> the<00:03:54.629> way<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.049> you

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
now do you think that the way that you

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.680 
now do you think that the way that you
guys<00:03:55.260> play<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.949> and<00:03:56.129> just<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.239> fact<00:03:57.269> that<00:03:57.540> you

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
guys play and and just the fact that you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.080 
guys play and and just the fact that you
guys<00:03:57.810> are<00:03:57.989> sort<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.500> bringing<00:03:58.799> in<00:03:58.889> more<00:03:59.579> Asian

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090
