is<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.480> brand<00:00:28.230> new<00:00:28.349> physics

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
is that we have a brand new physics

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.490 
is that we have a brand new physics
engine<00:00:29.039> working<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:30.480> you're<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> be

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
noticing how it's much more close to the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.970 
noticing how it's much more close to the
Genesis<00:00:34.890> games<00:00:35.130> than<00:00:35.430> episode<00:00:35.910> 1<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.530> so

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
Genesis games than episode 1 was and so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
that we obviously have a co-op feature

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.290 
that we obviously have a co-op feature
so<00:00:43.160> you're<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.460> able<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.730> play<00:00:44.879> with

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
so you're going to be able to play with

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.520 
so you're going to be able to play with
your<00:00:45.390> friends<00:00:45.539> over<00:00:46.379> Bluetooth<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.640> then<00:00:48.530> one

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
of you will play a sonic when you'll

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.930 
of you will play a sonic when you'll
play<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:50.789> tails<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:52.039> we<00:00:53.039> also<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:53.489> brand<00:00:53.850> new

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
play as tails and we also got brand new

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.939 
play as tails and we also got brand new
co-op<00:00:54.239> moves<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:55.020> collaborative<00:00:55.530> moose<00:00:55.800> is

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
co-op moves or collaborative moose is

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.439 
co-op moves or collaborative moose is
what<00:00:56.070> we're<00:00:56.190> calling<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.579> with<00:00:57.000> Sonic<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
what we're calling it with Sonic and

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.729 
what we're calling it with Sonic and
Tails<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.250> originally<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.520> Sonic<00:01:00.030> 1<00:01:00.059> 2<00:01:00.690> 3<00:01:00.739> Sonic

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
Tails so originally in Sonic 1 2 3 Sonic

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.860 
Tails so originally in Sonic 1 2 3 Sonic
and<00:01:01.890> Knuckles<00:01:01.920> tails<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.420> interaction

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and Knuckles tails and the interaction

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.240 
and Knuckles tails and the interaction
with<00:01:03.989> Sonic<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.680> limited<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
with Sonic was really limited to the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.190 
with Sonic was really limited to the
fact<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.580> tails<00:01:06.180> could<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.540> pick<00:01:06.720> sonic<00:01:07.049> up

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
fact that tails could just pick sonic up

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.630 
fact that tails could just pick sonic up
and<00:01:07.409> sort<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.710> move<00:01:07.890> them<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.159> higher<00:01:08.310> ledge

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and sort of move them to a higher ledge

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.480 
and sort of move them to a higher ledge
and<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.930> kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.260> figured<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.650> how

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and this one we kind of figured out how

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.580 
and this one we kind of figured out how
do<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.790> make<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.600> bigger<00:01:13.110> how<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.439> make

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
do we make that bigger how do we make

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.740 
do we make that bigger how do we make
that<00:01:13.619> better<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.250> evolve<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.880> what

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that better how do we evolve it and what

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.660 
that better how do we evolve it and what
we<00:01:15.840> came<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.409> was<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.920> sort<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> yin-yang

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
we came up with was a sort of yin-yang

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
we came up with was a sort of yin-yang
combination<00:01:18.570> roll<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> very<00:01:19.740> powerful

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
combination roll that is a very powerful

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.730 
combination roll that is a very powerful
attack<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> ground<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.479> badniks<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.619> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
attack on the ground so badniks that you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.080 
attack on the ground so badniks that you
would<00:01:22.890> take<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.189> three<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.549> four<00:01:23.729> hits<00:01:23.909> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
would take you three or four hits to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.910 
would take you three or four hits to
destroy<00:01:24.420> will<00:01:24.659> now<00:01:24.750> take<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.350> example<00:01:25.439> 1

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
destroy will now take you for example 1

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.060 
destroy will now take you for example 1
and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.909> tails<00:01:27.420> now<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:28.470> grab<00:01:28.680> sonic

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and then tails now can grab sonic

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.580 
and then tails now can grab sonic
underwater<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.390> actually<00:01:30.540> move<00:01:31.350> him

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
underwater and you can actually move him

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
underwater and you can actually move him
kind<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> submarine<00:01:32.310> using<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> tails

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
kind of like a submarine using the tails

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.969 
kind of like a submarine using the tails
to<00:01:33.630> propel<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.049> underwater<00:01:34.350> which<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.799> really

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
to propel you underwater which is really

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.340 
to propel you underwater which is really
cool<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.520> definitely<00:01:36.090> we've<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.810> lab<00:01:37.020> we've

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
cool so definitely we've a lab we've

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.380 
cool so definitely we've a lab we've
expanded<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.220> evolved<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> collaborative

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
expanded and evolved the collaborative

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.240 
expanded and evolved the collaborative
moves<00:01:39.630> between<00:01:39.810> Sonic<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.380> Tails<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.890> of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
moves between Sonic and Tails and of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
moves between Sonic and Tails and of
course<00:01:41.280> we've<00:01:42.119> got<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> brand<00:01:42.570> new<00:01:42.600> physics

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
course we've got a brand new physics

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.889 
course we've got a brand new physics
engine<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.560> graphic<00:01:43.920> engine<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.659> about

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
engine and graphic engine so what about

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.080 
engine and graphic engine so what about
episode<00:01:46.500> 2<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.920> different<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.430> episode<00:01:47.880> one

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
episode 2 is different from episode one

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.910 
episode 2 is different from episode one
did<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.630> listen<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> player<00:01:49.140> feedback<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
did you listen to player feedback and

did you listen to player feedback and
things<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:51.000> absolutely<00:01:51.540> listen<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
things like that we absolutely listen to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.810 
things like that we absolutely listen to
player<00:01:52.320> feedback<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:53.100> super<00:01:53.460> critical

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
player feedback that was super critical

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.240 
player feedback that was super critical
in<00:01:53.939> US<00:01:54.060> making<00:01:54.270> episode<00:01:54.780> 2<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:56.040> can't

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250

course<00:02:11.340> was<00:02:11.520> physics<00:02:11.910> fans<00:02:12.390> always<00:02:12.629> wanted

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
course was physics fans always wanted

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.309 
course was physics fans always wanted
like

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
like

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.080 
like
I<00:02:13.349> wanted<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.859> know<00:02:13.980> more<00:02:14.159> Genesis<00:02:14.909> style

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I wanted you know more Genesis style

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.640 
I wanted you know more Genesis style
physics<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.689> well<00:02:16.079> we<00:02:16.200> can't<00:02:16.439> do<00:02:16.530> an

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
physics and well we can't do an

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.860 
physics and well we can't do an
apples-to-apples<00:02:17.150> physics<00:02:18.150> engine<00:02:18.510> we

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
apples-to-apples physics engine we

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.420 
apples-to-apples physics engine we
certainly<00:02:19.290> are<00:02:19.469> taking<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.859> massive<00:02:20.099> step

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
certainly are taking a massive step

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.699 
certainly are taking a massive step
forward<00:02:20.909> getting<00:02:21.450> closer<00:02:21.719> there<00:02:21.989> so<00:02:22.200> fan

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
forward getting closer there so fan

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.890 
forward getting closer there so fan
feedback<00:02:22.889> was<00:02:23.310> absolutely<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> must<00:02:24.060> we've

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
feedback was absolutely a must we've

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.300 
feedback was absolutely a must we've
definitely<00:02:25.109> got<00:02:25.409> some<00:02:25.560> unannounced<00:02:25.829> features

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
definitely got some unannounced features

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.890 
definitely got some unannounced features
that<00:02:26.459> are<00:02:26.579> also<00:02:26.760> big<00:02:27.209> part<00:02:27.480> due<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.629> fan

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
that are also big part due to fan

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.289 
that are also big part due to fan
feedback<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:29.549> on<00:02:29.670> top<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:29.909> that<00:02:30.060> of

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
feedback and then on top of that of

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.640 
feedback and then on top of that of
course<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:30.840> ability<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.260> play<00:02:31.439> co-op

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
course is the ability to play co-op

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.979 
course is the ability to play co-op
which<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.730> great<00:02:33.060> especially<00:02:33.299> like<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.900> you
