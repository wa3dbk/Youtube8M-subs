00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
is a fish lap and here's the idea

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.870 
is a fish lap and here's the idea
fish<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.350> swim<00:00:34.500> from<00:00:34.890> step<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.340> step<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> get

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
up the ladder and get up past the dam do

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.990 
up the ladder and get up past the dam do
you<00:00:37.649> see<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.800> saying<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.160> see<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:38.640> fish

chemicals<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> water

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
chemicals get in the water

do<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:05.430> dam<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> job<00:01:06.090> altogether<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
do they dam the job altogether so the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.240 
do they dam the job altogether so the
salmon<00:01:07.110> can't<00:01:07.409> swim<00:01:07.619> fast<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.130> what

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
salmon can't swim fast and you know what

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.340 
salmon can't swim fast and you know what
else<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.880> person<00:01:09.360> brilliant<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
else it's not one person brilliant and

to<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.020> no<00:01:16.229> salmon<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.310> I'm

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
to that no salmon you know what I'm

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.520 
to that no salmon you know what I'm
saying<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:18.000> humans<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.750> changed<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
saying because humans have changed the

environment now fish fish could adapt it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.320 
environment now fish fish could adapt it
could<00:01:22.229> evolve<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.280> take<00:01:23.400> millions<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
could evolve but would take millions and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
could evolve but would take millions and
millions<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.990> years<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:25.890> gonna<00:01:26.070> happen

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
millions of years it's not gonna happen
