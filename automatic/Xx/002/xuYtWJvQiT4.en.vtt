00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
be shot so this is the reason I've got

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
be shot so this is the reason I've got
the<00:01:07.290> class<00:01:07.740> set<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.250> way<00:01:08.430> claymores

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the class set up this way claymores

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.570 
the class set up this way claymores
because<00:01:09.479> sometimes<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.350> will<00:01:10.830> post<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.430> in

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
because sometimes I will post up in

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.000 
because sometimes I will post up in
specific<00:01:12.000> locations<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.830> my

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
specific locations and I like to have my

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.490 
specific locations and I like to have my
back<00:01:14.189> covered<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.869> work<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.350> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
back covered don't really work all that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.899 
back covered don't really work all that
well<00:01:16.560> because<00:01:17.009> there<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.310> something<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.820> can

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
well because there is something you can

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.370 
well because there is something you can
use<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.299> game<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.689> allows<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.170> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
use in this game that allows you to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.010 
use in this game that allows you to
slowly<00:01:20.189> detonate<00:01:20.880> those<00:01:21.090> claymores<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
slowly detonate those claymores and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.960 
slowly detonate those claymores and
bouncing<00:01:22.770> Betties<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.460> basically<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.880> can

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
bouncing Betties so basically you can

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.249 
bouncing Betties so basically you can
get<00:01:24.090> away<00:01:24.150> from<00:01:24.299> them<00:01:24.509> before<00:01:24.630> triggering

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
get away from them before triggering

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.260 
get away from them before triggering
them<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.280> I've<00:01:26.369> gotten<00:01:26.580> killed<00:01:26.759> quite<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> few

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
them so I've gotten killed quite a few

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.510 
them so I've gotten killed quite a few
times<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.500> concussion<00:01:29.220> grenades

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
times that way but concussion grenades

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.560 
times that way but concussion grenades
shouldn't<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> flash<00:01:30.210> grenade

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570

you I like to run the pp90m1 on this
class<00:03:04.239> and<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.630> reason<00:03:04.870> for<00:03:04.989> that<00:03:05.050> is<00:03:05.320> because

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
class and the reason for that is because

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.040 
class and the reason for that is because
the<00:03:06.840> pp90m1<00:03:08.610> allows<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:10.060> most<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.570> quickest

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
the pp90m1 allows the most and quickest

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.110

mobility<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.040> game<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.610> can<00:03:12.790> run<00:03:13.000> around

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
mobility in the game so I can run around

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.110 
mobility in the game so I can run around

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
setups in the game in my eyes I've kind

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.219 
setups in the game in my eyes I've kind
of<00:05:00.820> taken<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.210> idea<00:05:01.510> from<00:05:01.660> somebody<00:05:01.960> else

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
of taken this idea from somebody else

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.110 
of taken this idea from somebody else
and<00:05:02.470> implemented<00:05:03.160> my<00:05:03.220> own<00:05:03.370> thoughts<00:05:03.669> into<00:05:03.970> it

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
and implemented my own thoughts into it

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.480 
and implemented my own thoughts into it
but<00:05:04.419> again<00:05:04.540> I'd<00:05:04.780> run<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:04.990> pp90m1<00:05:05.680> on<00:05:06.250> this

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
but again I'd run the pp90m1 on this

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.340 
but again I'd run the pp90m1 on this
class<00:05:06.729> because<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.120> mobility<00:05:07.419> you<00:05:07.900> just<00:05:08.110> move

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
class because the mobility you just move

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.210 
class because the mobility you just move
move<00:05:08.650> move<00:05:08.979> I<00:05:09.400> mean<00:05:09.760> it's<00:05:09.940> fast<00:05:10.120> as<00:05:10.330> can<00:05:10.479> be<00:05:10.630> and

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
move move I mean it's fast as can be and

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.680 
move move I mean it's fast as can be and
final<00:05:12.220> stand<00:05:12.520> I<00:05:12.760> don't<00:05:13.210> even<00:05:13.300> mean<00:05:13.479> to<00:05:13.600> be

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
final stand I don't even mean to be

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.940 
final stand I don't even mean to be
running<00:05:13.900> that<00:05:14.139> I<00:05:14.290> just<00:05:14.650> don't<00:05:14.800> really

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
running that I just don't really

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.350
