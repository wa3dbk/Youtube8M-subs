00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
can kind of handle that stuff and you

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.140 
can kind of handle that stuff and you
give<00:03:05.590> him<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.770> pronunciation<00:03:06.400> beforehand

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
from the most basic things you know we

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.230 
from the most basic things you know we
take<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.310> for<00:03:09.430> granted<00:03:09.490> that<00:03:09.790> we<00:03:10.060> know

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
take it for granted that we know

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.240 
take it for granted that we know
everything<00:03:10.540> about<00:03:10.780> all<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.950> elder<00:03:12.220> scrolls

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
everything about all the elder scrolls

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.370 
everything about all the elder scrolls
and<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.670> games<00:03:12.880> that<00:03:13.000> came<00:03:13.240> before<00:03:13.420> from<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
and the games that came before from the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.050 
and the games that came before from the
simplest<00:03:14.770> things<00:03:14.980> like<00:03:15.100> Tamriel<00:03:15.730> but<00:03:15.910> that's

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
simplest things like Tamriel but that's

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.550 
simplest things like Tamriel but that's
a<00:03:16.120> new<00:03:16.240> word<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.570> these<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:17.020> know<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.200> whoever

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
a new word to these you know to whoever

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.890 
a new word to these you know to whoever
were<00:03:17.800> bringing<00:03:18.790> on<00:03:18.940> maybe<00:03:19.390> we<00:03:19.570> haven't<00:03:19.720> had<00:03:19.870> a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
were bringing on maybe we haven't had a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.050 
were bringing on maybe we haven't had a
lot<00:03:20.020> of<00:03:20.080> time<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.380> go<00:03:20.500> over<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.830> with<00:03:20.920> them<00:03:21.130> so

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
lot of time to go over it with them so

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.340 
lot of time to go over it with them so
we'd<00:03:22.240> give<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.660> him<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:22.870> he'd<00:03:22.990> chuckle

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
we'd give it to him and he'd chuckle

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.350 
we'd give it to him and he'd chuckle
about<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.860> then<00:03:24.700> he<00:03:24.820> would<00:03:24.940> do<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.209> and

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
about it and then he would do it and

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.940 
about it and then he would do it and
made<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.570> sound<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.170> he<00:03:26.380> says<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.800> all<00:03:26.890> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
made it sound like he says it all the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.560 
made it sound like he says it all the
time<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.700> main<00:03:27.880> thing<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.120> told<00:03:28.180> him<00:03:28.360> was<00:03:28.450> that

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
time the main thing I told him was that

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.880 
time the main thing I told him was that
it's<00:03:28.810> going<00:03:28.990> to<00:03:29.080> be<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.709> fundamental

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
it's going to be the fundamental

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.860 
it's going to be the fundamental
difference<00:03:30.490> between<00:03:30.820> reading<00:03:31.390> for<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.690> game

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
difference between reading for a game

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.270 
difference between reading for a game
and<00:03:32.050> reading<00:03:32.290> for<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.470> film<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.860> that<00:03:32.890> this<00:03:33.100> is

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
and reading for a film is that this is

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.610 
and reading for a film is that this is
going<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.610> be<00:03:33.730> out<00:03:34.360> of<00:03:34.420> order<00:03:34.750> fundamentally

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
going to be out of order fundamentally

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.110 
going to be out of order fundamentally
you<00:03:35.980> know<00:03:36.070> what<00:03:36.220> did<00:03:36.340> someone<00:03:36.610> respond<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.030> me

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
you know what did someone respond to me

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.710 
you know what did someone respond to me
here<00:03:37.300> well<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.600> depends<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:40.390> kind<00:03:40.660> of

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
here well it depends and so you kind of

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.650 
here well it depends and so you kind of
just<00:03:41.370> throw<00:03:42.370> some<00:03:42.580> of<00:03:42.610> someone<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.209> football<00:03:43.540> in

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
just throw some of someone a football in

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.970 
just throw some of someone a football in
one<00:03:43.810> direction<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.200> they<00:03:44.320> run<00:03:44.500> with<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.800> then

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
one direction and they run with it then

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.530 
one direction and they run with it then
we<00:03:45.250> back<00:03:45.400> up<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.760> we<00:03:45.850> do<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.150> again<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.420> now<00:03:46.510> I

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
we back up and we do it again and now I

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.170 
we back up and we do it again and now I
throw<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.810> this<00:03:46.930> way
