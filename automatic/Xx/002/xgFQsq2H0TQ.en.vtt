00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 What's up, kids, welcome once 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.400
 more to my channel and this time 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.500
 I bring a new tutorial of black ops 2 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.690
 in which I will explain how to do the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.150
 infiniti fed and that would come to be 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.490
 shoot infinitely with any 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.880
 weapon either bolt or without bolt 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.800
 how it is made so easy what there is 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.560
 to take into account before starting 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.480
 explain with that trick shot is that neither 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.500
 see in the click an effect that is explained 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.240
 in next neither kill or be the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.430
 bullets that shoots is from the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.410
 second they will not kill since only 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.410
 we shoot the first one and see it from 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.120
 repeated way that the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.379
 drive it but I'm telling you 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.829
 that in no time the bullets go to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.710
 kill as it is done because there are two ways 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.590
 of doing it depending on the weapons not 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.480
 it differs in case it is frank in case it does not 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.270
 alarm has a different way of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.640
 do the infiniti fairy and what are the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.370
 shotguns some pistols and other weapons 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.989
 that you can try them on what is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.280
 what would come to be in infinity fairy 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.040
 is to shoot and reload at the same time 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.290
 and just when we shoot and recharge 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.390
 we have to cancel the recharge 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.090
 sprinting and re-firing and 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.490
 recharge would be this but at 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.440
 do it very quickly we would enter as in 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.080
 a kind of book and what we would do is 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.150
 repeatedly fire repeatedly 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.850
 bullet would come to be something like that 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.800
 ok and if we do it well then we 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.450
 would shoot a bullet every time 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.130
 we experience what I have in the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.200
 practical too much because in a game 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.310
 complex and not only do not use this type 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.880
 of tricks but if you practice it it is 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.500
 pretty beast the effect that remains is worth 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.730
 and with the sniper he would come to 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.800
 be something similar but one by one 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.410
 different part what is done with the 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.660
 sniper is to shoot and reload 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.580
 the time as with the shotgun but in this 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.369
 occasion instead of sprinting let's go 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.520
 hold down the r1 and the square that 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.050
 just the button to shoot and reload and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.080
 we are going to do double caps repeatedly 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.840
 so that we shoot once the bullet 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.580
 really 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.800
 and every time we do a double tap 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.080
 let's shoot another bullet but not 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.300
 it's going to be real that it's always going to be a 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 ship the effect of the bullet but that as 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.220
 I said earlier this is not going to 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.290
 to kill would be something like that 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.910
 and as you can see, there are four of them left 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.490
 bullets all the time and in no time 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.890
 the expenses to shoot the bullet from 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.550
 it really should be a novel tap and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.500
 shoot without holding down or by 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.720
 example if I'm in the air I make a 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.510
 triple infinity fail 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.510
 and when I want to kill, I really do 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.060
 the double is normal and shot 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.380
 ok I do not understand, I'm going to 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.750
 repeat one more time in case it has not been 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.090
 Of course I do the trick shot and obviously 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.160
 the last bullet of the trick shot fired 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.600
 intentionally towards the enemy but 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.520
 as I said the bullets that fired 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.070
 with the infiniti fed and do not kill are bullets 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.870
 played by saying it somehow and 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.390
 therefore by far know three not 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.280
 what are you going to kill and not be seen here 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.730
 camps then what do you have to do? 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.250
 do 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.990
 the infiniti fail but when we already want 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.500
 shoot the real bullet to kill the 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.830
 enemy 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.500
 we do a normal double tab 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.970
 and shoot and masters what is the real bullet 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.130
 I suppose it will have been clear is 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.880
 pretty easy what is what I'm 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.340
 explaining we are enfinity frei of 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.129
 normal moment 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.730
 and we have ok and good for the shotgun 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.730
 and has said that it is 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.880
 aim or shoot to recharge and 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.200
 Sprint repeatedly and each time 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.709
 we finished a sprint because it would come to be 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.569
 reload and shoot again then 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.400
 things that you have to take into account when 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.890
 we have the right to be king we make the report 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.230
 different this we will do with r1 and 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.910
 square and if you play clau as the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.130
 most people are not going to be able to 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.080
 give r 1 to the square and the triangle 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.670
 both 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.950
 you can keep it pressed but you can not 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.470
 do it belt apps then how do you do it 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.290
 this in two ways or to reverse the hand 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.880
 left and the mobile to the right or 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.160
 if you do not do what I do that would be 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.299
 play extreme close and have your finger 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.030
 cancel the penultimate on the r1 the finger 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.040
 index in the square and with the finger 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.620
 heart we would do the repeated 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.100
 the repeated 90 pge 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.440
 then let go of the r1 and the square 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.310
 we would do a normal double and shoot 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.080
 We use the bullet to say it some way and 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.150
 nothing kids the infiniti fairy is this 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.370
 for people who like to read what 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.979
 it's just trick shot complex is a hoot 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.199
 since he is very very handsome to me 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.580
 I personally do not like the complex 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.889
 but I 'm telling you, you do not have to play 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.500
 complex to do these types of clicks 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:58.540
 you can shoot once here make a 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.540
 couple of infinity faces 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.630
 and kill that you do not have to do it 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.160
 very removed simply with shooting two 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.169
 Sometimes instead of one, it can be very 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.639
 handsome the trick shot and nothing kids 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.050
 effect was this I hope that I have 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.729
 liked the video to like 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.300
 subscribe and see you in the next 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.300
 goodbye
