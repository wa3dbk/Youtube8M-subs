00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.899
 hello people the doctor car a super 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.580
 call you that has a pickup truck 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:15.400
 with good intercooler you can have a 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.140
 lover of this public 10 20 30 years a 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.060
 do this but suddenly you can 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.279
 need our tip that tip is this 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.439
 I do not care what he's going to do 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.599
 a thermal exchange will give an overview on 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.329
 marketing if you notice here 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.340
 you have a flow of air that comes in here 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.760
 by car hood 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.250
 the portal that water entrance there it comes 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.820
 brings here product of enticing enter 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.220
 here passing through the inter how to make a 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.590
 thermal input of the engine 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.230
 try to perform 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.199
 well and targas tona your friends who 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.750
 to do already made of everything became the bank already 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.730
 was part of how the king already end of the devil 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.720
 Look at who you are if you come with 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.239
 paper clips here and hit here 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.340
 the fillets acquisition closed is difficult 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.890
 you agree that the neighboring fillets only 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.899
 for the passage of air to make the exchange 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.119
 here 80% is doubled the air does not 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.220
 can pass and make the thermal exchange 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.920
 so you have a disability in the 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.020
 performance in the car of the whole 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.119
 diesel engine with intercooler 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.330
 You take a paper clip and it comes 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.420
 chartering here or coming here 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.600
 the passage of air so you can have a 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.600
 heat exchange and take advantage of the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.959
 the intercooler of your exhaust 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.800
 now this tip also goes for the radiator 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.380
 of the car too 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.840
 Do you have a radiator here? 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.610
 entering here he will start to make the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.310
 thermal exchange in the radiator here too 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.120
 It looks cooler than the radiator that goes 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.240
 play 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.060
 the coldest water promoter make the exchange 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.060
 thermal and aaron schock radiator too 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.060
 The insect picks up these things in the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.750
 front and is also threatening these 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.760
 little passages here รณ novo minho 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.410
 You come with cris here too that goes 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.200
 is going to hit 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.410
 you come here oh you see and it opens 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.260
 one by one until the air got beautiful 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.480
 run the thermal and 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.730
 lower the temperature of the air that has passed 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.810
 here has a turbo're all a part that 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 gets hot as hell 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.730
 so to enter here, there is an exchange 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.010
 reduce the temperature of the air and 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.260
 Air enters here a machine temperature of 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.460
 combustion engine with pressure on 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.090
 and everything else 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.670
 remembering a paper clip do not need 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.440
 more than that for you, correct one 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.020
 one and get back to have exchange flow 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.640
 Thermal good but on the bus left more 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.260
 three tips you have fun here I go 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.400
 invite you met the total site

 advanced or lay tab intercooler 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.120
 with the paper clip and has little 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.700
 technical and returns to perform 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.650
 Your your pickup truck there and back. 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.650
 I tried nice consumption, it's good too. 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.610
 It's simple and simple, there are three tips for 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.740
 you 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.740
