00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it directly to a computer and use it as

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.750 
it directly to a computer and use it as
a<00:00:48.329> USB<00:00:48.719> Drive<00:00:48.989> instead<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.860> an<00:00:49.950> ass<00:00:50.160> should<00:00:50.700> you

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
maybe you can tell me what country those

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.770 
maybe you can tell me what country those
are<00:03:50.910> for<00:03:51.150> if<00:03:51.600> you're<00:03:51.870> watching<00:03:52.050> this<00:03:52.350> video

alright<00:03:54.780> here<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.590> network<00:03:55.890> space<00:03:56.130> -<00:03:56.460> so

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
alright here is the network space - so

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.190 
alright here is the network space - so
you<00:03:56.790> can<00:03:56.970> see<00:03:57.150> clearly<00:03:57.420> right<00:03:57.540> here<00:03:57.930> there's<00:03:58.140> a

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
you can see clearly right here there's a

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.910 
you can see clearly right here there's a
PCB<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.270> connected<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.300> all<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:01.170> your<00:04:01.440> inputs

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
PCB and connected to all of your inputs

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.160 
PCB and connected to all of your inputs
and<00:04:02.130> outputs<00:04:02.520> oh<00:04:02.730> there's<00:04:03.630> your<00:04:03.780> Gigabit

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
and outputs oh there's your Gigabit

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.920 
and outputs oh there's your Gigabit
Ethernet<00:04:04.290> there's<00:04:04.830> your<00:04:04.980> USB<00:04:05.250> 2.0<00:04:06.060> there's<00:04:06.780> a

will do the obligatory finger shot here
so<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:41.870> can<00:04:42.050> see<00:04:42.260> just<00:04:42.590> how<00:04:42.740> shiny<00:04:43.220> it<00:04:43.460> is

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
so you can see just how shiny it is

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.510 
so you can see just how shiny it is
it<00:04:44.510> is<00:04:44.780> very<00:04:45.440> square<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.160> very<00:04:46.820> black<00:04:48.520> well

it is very square and very black well

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.070 
it is very square and very black well
not<00:04:49.670> really<00:04:49.790> square<00:04:50.360> it's<00:04:50.630> more<00:04:50.870> of<00:04:50.960> a

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
not really square it's more of a

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.900 
not really square it's more of a
rectangular<00:04:52.010> prism

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
rectangular prism

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.990 
rectangular prism
so<00:04:53.690> you've<00:04:53.900> caught<00:04:54.140> me<00:04:54.260> on<00:04:54.380> like<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.800> holiday<00:04:55.430> so

so you've caught me on like a holiday so

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.240 
so you've caught me on like a holiday so
my<00:04:56.180> hair<00:04:56.390> is<00:04:56.420> like<00:04:56.900> Messier<00:04:57.530> than<00:04:57.710> usual<00:04:58.100> even

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
my hair is like Messier than usual even

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.390 
my hair is like Messier than usual even
and<00:04:58.990> here<00:04:59.990> at<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.200> front<00:05:00.410> we<00:05:00.620> find<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:01.010> USB

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
and here at the front we find the USB

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.920 
and here at the front we find the USB
port<00:05:01.670> which<00:05:01.790> we<00:05:01.940> can<00:05:02.090> use<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.420> plug<00:05:02.600> in<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.810> USB

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
port which we can use to plug in a USB

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.810 
port which we can use to plug in a USB
thumb<00:05:03.500> drive<00:05:03.740> a<00:05:03.770> printer<00:05:04.340> because<00:05:04.580> it<00:05:04.700> does

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
thumb drive a printer because it does

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.120 
thumb drive a printer because it does
act<00:05:05.060> as<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.240> print<00:05:05.540> server<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.680> then<00:05:06.890> on<00:05:07.010> the

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
act as a print server and then on the

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.880 
act as a print server and then on the
other<00:05:07.160> side<00:05:07.340> we<00:05:07.760> find<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.270> Lissy<00:05:08.810> branding<00:05:09.500> so

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
other side we find the Lissy branding so

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.920 
other side we find the Lissy branding so
I<00:05:10.130> guess<00:05:10.670> we<00:05:10.820> might<00:05:10.940> as<00:05:11.060> well<00:05:11.150> do<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.360> quick<00:05:11.630> test

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
I guess we might as well do a quick test

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.810 
I guess we might as well do a quick test
with<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:12.170> to<00:05:12.500> find<00:05:12.770> out<00:05:12.920> if<00:05:13.040> their<00:05:13.220> claims<00:05:13.460> of

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
with it to find out if their claims of

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.110 
with it to find out if their claims of
65<00:05:14.750> megabytes<00:05:15.470> per<00:05:15.620> second<00:05:16.100> are<00:05:16.310> true<00:05:16.760> or

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
and other than that that's all there is

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.340 
and other than that that's all there is
to<00:05:19.910> really<00:05:20.090> say<00:05:20.360> about<00:05:20.630> the<00:05:20.780> network<00:05:21.110> space

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
to really say about the network space

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.620 
to really say about the network space
too
