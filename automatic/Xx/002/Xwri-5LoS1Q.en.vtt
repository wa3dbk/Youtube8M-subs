that one particular SCV no not going out

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to the SUV for a little bit for some

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
to the SUV for a little bit for some
strange<00:01:26.130> reason<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.670> I'll<00:01:27.090> simply<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
strange reason and I'll simply just

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.109 
strange reason and I'll simply just
walking<00:01:28.110> around<00:01:28.200> along<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> backside<00:01:29.119> also

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
walking around along the backside also

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.350 
walking around along the backside also
we<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> gas<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.950> quite<00:01:32.310> yet<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.180> it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
we do not see a gas just quite yet so it

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.210 
we do not see a gas just quite yet so it
looks<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.750> though<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.200> may<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.590> very<00:01:34.890> fast

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
looks as though it may be a very fast

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.280 
looks as though it may be a very fast
expansion<00:01:35.729> attempt<00:01:36.270> or<00:01:36.570> perhaps<00:01:36.810> mass

expansion attempt or perhaps mass

going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.269> be<00:03:21.419> into<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.750> Twilight<00:03:22.169> Council

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
going to be into a Twilight Council

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.610 
going to be into a Twilight Council
alright<00:03:23.699> so<00:03:23.879> this<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.449> a<00:03:24.659> very<00:03:25.229> very

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
alright so this is a very very

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.949 
alright so this is a very very
interesting<00:03:25.979> build<00:03:26.400> by<00:03:26.579> shouty<00:03:26.879> he's<00:03:27.449> hiding

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
interesting build by shouty he's hiding

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.379 
interesting build by shouty he's hiding
a<00:03:28.079> Twilight<00:03:28.560> Council<00:03:28.949> over<00:03:29.250> here<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:30.000> blink

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
a Twilight Council over here so blink

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.080 
a Twilight Council over here so blink
stalkers<00:03:30.750> maybe<00:03:31.379> in<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:32.069> future<00:03:32.250> also

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
stalkers maybe in the future also

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.119 
stalkers maybe in the future also
another<00:03:33.389> way<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:33.900> can<00:03:34.139> really<00:03:34.769> utilize

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
another way that you can really utilize

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.520 
another way that you can really utilize
the<00:03:35.760> blink<00:03:35.970> stalkers<00:03:36.180> instead<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.079> trying<00:03:37.440> to

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
the blink stalkers instead of trying to

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.439 
the blink stalkers instead of trying to
use<00:03:37.799> observers<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.609> get<00:03:39.090> some<00:03:39.269> early

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
use observers is get some early

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.869 
use observers is get some early
centuries<00:03:39.780> which<00:03:40.229> centuries<00:03:41.069> do<00:03:41.250> our<00:03:41.699> very

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
centuries which centuries do our very

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.250 
centuries which centuries do our very
very<00:03:42.000> cost<00:03:42.419> effective<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:42.959> then<00:03:43.139> the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
very cost effective and then the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.259 
very cost effective and then the
hallucination<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.459> hallucination<00:03:45.120> is

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
hallucination the hallucination is

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.360 
hallucination the hallucination is
essentially<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.079> same<00:03:46.349> amount<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.889> gas<00:03:47.099> out

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
essentially the same amount of gas out

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.830 
essentially the same amount of gas out
of<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.519> observer<00:03:47.849> without<00:03:48.180> having<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:48.659> build

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
of the observer without having to build

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.479 
of the observer without having to build
a<00:03:48.989> robotics<00:03:49.409> facility<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.040> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
a robotics facility and the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.280 
a robotics facility and the
hallucination<00:03:51.239> allows<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.810> blink<00:03:52.049> up

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
hallucination allows you to blink up

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.050 
hallucination allows you to blink up
onto<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.709> high<00:03:52.889> ground<00:03:53.069> as<00:03:53.280> well<00:03:53.549> in<00:03:53.790> addition

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
religiously and he has no idea what his

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.700 
religiously and he has no idea what his
opponent<00:04:42.570> is<00:04:42.660> going<00:04:42.870> for<00:04:43.110> he<00:04:43.230> doesn't<00:04:43.590> know<00:04:43.680> he

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
opponent is going for he doesn't know he

opponent is going for he doesn't know he
does<00:04:44.010> know<00:04:44.160> about<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.520> expansion<00:04:44.850> over<00:04:45.300> here

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
does know about the expansion over here

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.040 
does know about the expansion over here
so<00:04:46.320> this<00:04:46.470> is<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.710> dark<00:04:47.160> shrine<00:04:47.580> on<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.480> three<00:04:48.780> gate

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
so this is a dark shrine on a three gate

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.760 
so this is a dark shrine on a three gate
dark<00:04:49.770> shrine<00:04:50.390> wow<00:04:51.390> this<00:04:51.600> is<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.290> don't<00:04:52.560> even

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
dark shrine wow this is the I don't even

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.500 
dark shrine wow this is the I don't even
know<00:04:52.920> what<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.070> call<00:04:53.130> this<00:04:53.400> build<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.820> Dark

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
know what to call this build a Dark

Templar pressure three gate expansion

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.660 
Templar pressure three gate expansion
would<00:04:58.590> probably<00:04:58.920> be<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.160> best<00:04:59.190> way<00:04:59.610> to

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
would probably be the best way to

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.250 
would probably be the best way to
describe<00:04:59.970> as<00:05:00.240> we<00:05:00.360> are<00:05:00.420> now<00:05:00.540> finally<00:05:01.050> going

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
describe as we are now finally going

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.600 
describe as we are now finally going
into<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.470> factory<00:05:01.950> but<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.220> is<00:05:02.310> going<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.520> be

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
into a factory but that is going to be

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.580 
into a factory but that is going to be
very<00:05:02.640> very<00:05:03.300> late<00:05:03.600> in<00:05:03.900> order<00:05:04.200> to<00:05:04.290> get<00:05:04.410> any

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
very very late in order to get any

after<00:05:56.850> fcv<00:05:57.360> all<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.960> suvs<00:05:58.380> are<00:05:58.410> surrounding

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
after fcv all the suvs are surrounding

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.580 
after fcv all the suvs are surrounding
this<00:05:59.400> over<00:05:59.700> here<00:06:00.060> so<00:06:00.420> by<00:06:00.570> surrounding<00:06:00.960> it<00:06:01.320> he's

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
this over here so by surrounding it he's

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.920 
this over here so by surrounding it he's
going<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:01.830> be<00:06:01.980> minimizing<00:06:02.460> any<00:06:03.210> surface<00:06:03.720> area

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
going to be minimizing any surface area

now<00:06:04.050> the<00:06:04.110> missile<00:06:04.440> turret<00:06:04.680> is<00:06:04.800> up<00:06:05.100> so<00:06:05.310> this

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
now the missile turret is up so this

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.950 
now the missile turret is up so this
