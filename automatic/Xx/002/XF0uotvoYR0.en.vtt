00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
know you can go as low as a point for

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.430 
know you can go as low as a point for
maybe<00:02:21.250> per<00:02:22.250> pound<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:23.030> your<00:02:23.840> hundred<00:02:24.140> pounds

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
maybe per pound so your hundred pounds

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.400 
maybe per pound so your hundred pounds
for<00:02:24.710> example<00:02:25.130> 40<00:02:25.490> grams<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:26.170> don't<00:02:27.170> like<00:02:27.380> that
