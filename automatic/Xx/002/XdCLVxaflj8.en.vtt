00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
from the resin first and then just a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.330 
from the resin first and then just a
letter<00:00:53.760> fiberglass<00:00:54.210> now<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.070> had

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
letter fiberglass now this one had

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.819 
letter fiberglass now this one had
internal<00:00:56.879> magnet<00:00:57.300> clasps<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.350> both

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
internal magnet clasps which have both

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.439 
internal magnet clasps which have both
been<00:00:59.100> broken<00:00:59.460> off<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.850> point

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
been broken off at this point

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.170

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the mannequin hit out of the way alright

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.530 
the mannequin hit out of the way alright
so<00:01:12.680> as<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.070> tell<00:01:14.250> from<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.520> inside<00:01:14.909> there

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
so as you can tell from the inside there

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.010 
so as you can tell from the inside there
is<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.770> thick<00:01:17.490> layer<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.020> fiberglass

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
is a really thick layer of fiberglass

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.469 
is a really thick layer of fiberglass
and<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.759> actually<00:01:20.850> see<00:01:21.119> some<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.330> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and you can actually see some of that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.870 
and you can actually see some of that
resin<00:01:21.840> underneath<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.070> there<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.729> some

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
resin underneath and there are some

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
resin underneath and there are some
areas<00:01:24.090> where<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.570> clasp<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.960> where<00:01:25.170> he

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
areas where the clasp is where he

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.499 
areas where the clasp is where he
actually<00:01:25.799> put<00:01:26.070> extra<00:01:26.790> layer<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> fiberglass

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
actually put extra layer of fiberglass

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.920 
actually put extra layer of fiberglass
I<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:28.430> but<00:01:29.430> overall<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.240> very<00:01:30.420> smooth

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
I think but overall it's not very smooth

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.310 
I think but overall it's not very smooth
as<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.110> hinge

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
as you can see and the the hinge

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.569 
as you can see and the the hinge
actually<00:01:34.650> came<00:01:34.799> out<00:01:34.890> anyways<00:01:35.220> even<00:01:35.400> though

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
actually came out anyways even though

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.280 
actually came out anyways even though
there's<00:01:35.759> there's<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> huge<00:01:36.450> layer<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:37.020> resin

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
there's there's a huge layer of resin

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.990 
there's there's a huge layer of resin
there<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.619> still<00:01:37.860> came<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.220> had<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> super<00:01:38.909> glue

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
there it still came out had a super glue

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.679 
there it still came out had a super glue
it<00:01:39.119> back<00:01:39.350> now<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:41.119> bought<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.299> from<00:01:42.420> someone

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it back now I bought this from someone

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.580 
it back now I bought this from someone
else<00:01:42.899> who<00:01:42.990> said<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.320> bought<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.530> from

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
else who said they bought it from

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.740 
else who said they bought it from
someone<00:01:43.860> else<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750

someone else so I don't know if the
repairs<00:01:46.229> done<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.890> helmet<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.880> can

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
repairs done to this helmet but you can

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.420 
repairs done to this helmet but you can
actually<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.710> that<00:01:49.710> piece<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.100> stuff<00:01:50.280> right

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
actually see that piece of stuff right

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.969 
actually see that piece of stuff right
there<00:01:50.579> which<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.850> bondo<00:01:51.439> they<00:01:52.439> actually<00:01:52.799> used

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
there which is bondo they actually used

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.580 
there which is bondo they actually used
bondo<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.509> don't<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.720> gap-filling<00:01:55.229> or

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
bondo for I don't know gap-filling or

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.920 
bondo for I don't know gap-filling or
whatever<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.820> did<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.299> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
whatever it is that they did and to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.899 
whatever it is that they did and to
install<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> magnets<00:01:58.920> as<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.670> right

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
install the magnets as you can see right

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.170 
install the magnets as you can see right
there<00:02:01.189> now<00:02:02.189> that's<00:02:02.490> probably<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:03.030> caused

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
there now that's probably what caused

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.569 
there now that's probably what caused
everything<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.600> break<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.409> break<00:02:04.590> off<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.070> he

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
everything to break to break off and he

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.399 
everything to break to break off and he
can<00:02:05.759> tell<00:02:05.909> he's<00:02:06.060> actually<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.509> layers<00:02:07.079> I

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
can tell he's actually in layers I

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.809 
can tell he's actually in layers I
actually<00:02:07.619> had<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> go<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.220> superglue<00:02:08.670> these

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
actually had to go and superglue these

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.249 
actually had to go and superglue these
back<00:02:09.000> together<00:02:09.149> cuz<00:02:09.599> they<00:02:09.720> were<00:02:09.780> coming<00:02:10.140> off

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
back together cuz they were coming off

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.800 
back together cuz they were coming off
as<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.920> tell<00:02:11.190> right<00:02:11.849> here

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
as you can tell right here

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.170 
as you can tell right here
it's<00:02:13.020> actually<00:02:13.350> still<00:02:13.560> kind<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.770> soft<00:02:14.180> there

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
it's actually still kind of soft there

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.150 
it's actually still kind of soft there
are<00:02:15.360> pockets<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.290> I'm<00:02:16.560> talking<00:02:16.770> about<00:02:16.800> huge

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
are pockets and I'm talking about huge

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.300 
are pockets and I'm talking about huge
pockets<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.390> between<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> layers<00:02:19.740> now<00:02:20.100> that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
pockets and between the layers now that

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.590 
pockets and between the layers now that
shouldn't<00:02:20.490> happen<00:02:20.700> because<00:02:21.030> that's<00:02:21.420> what's

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
shouldn't happen because that's what's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.140 
shouldn't happen because that's what's
causing<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.050> break<00:02:22.550> now<00:02:23.550> overall<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
causing it to break now overall the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.120 
causing it to break now overall the
helmet<00:02:24.450> pretty<00:02:24.900> heavy<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.470> pretty<00:02:25.800> sturdy

helmet pretty heavy it's pretty sturdy

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.030 
helmet pretty heavy it's pretty sturdy
and<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.550> fits<00:02:26.819> pretty<00:02:27.480> well<00:02:27.830> looking<00:02:28.830> at<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and it fits pretty well looking at the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.800 
and it fits pretty well looking at the
edging<00:02:29.430> though<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.880> see<00:02:30.090> how<00:02:30.239> messed<00:02:30.600> up

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
edging though you can see how messed up

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.050 
edging though you can see how messed up
that<00:02:31.020> aging<00:02:31.319> is<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:32.310> looks<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.730> somebody

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
that aging is it looks like somebody

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.140 
that aging is it looks like somebody
puked<00:02:33.810> into<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.590> bucket<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.250> know<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.430> make

puked into the bucket you know to make
the<00:02:36.300> mold<00:02:37.459> these<00:02:38.459> things<00:02:38.760> here<00:02:39.060> same<00:02:39.480> thing

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
the mold these things here same thing

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.680 
the mold these things here same thing
made<00:02:39.900> out<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:40.230> resin<00:02:41.010> or<00:02:41.520> just<00:02:42.180> straight<00:02:42.420> resin

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
made out of resin or just straight resin

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.940 
made out of resin or just straight resin
I<00:02:42.750> don't<00:02:42.870> even<00:02:42.959> see<00:02:43.140> any<00:02:43.200> fiberglass<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.830> there

and if there is it's probably just a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.350 
and if there is it's probably just a
little<00:02:46.769> bit<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.920> fiberglass<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:47.700> flirtin

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
white line that goes through the back of

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.390 
white line that goes through the back of
the<00:03:36.900> helmet<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.350> actually<00:03:37.709> does<00:03:37.829> not<00:03:37.980> appear

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
the helmet that actually does not appear

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.270

so<00:03:44.010> whoever<00:03:44.400> painted<00:03:44.579> is<00:03:44.850> not<00:03:45.209> very<00:03:45.420> accurate

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
so whoever painted is not very accurate

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.819 
so whoever painted is not very accurate
not<00:03:46.590> very<00:03:46.890> detailed<00:03:47.760> it's<00:03:47.910> kind<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.060> sloppy

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
not very detailed it's kind of sloppy

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.990 
not very detailed it's kind of sloppy
