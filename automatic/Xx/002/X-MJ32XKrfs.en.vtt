00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
twelve one 12-volt back here you can't

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.009 
twelve one 12-volt back here you can't
see<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.819> cuz<00:04:11.970> it's<00:04:12.120> dark<00:04:14.840> storage<00:04:15.840> storage

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019

probably a microwave yeah he's got the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.980 
probably a microwave yeah he's got the
electrical<00:04:24.990> system<00:04:25.260> back<00:04:25.410> there<00:04:29.810> alright<00:04:30.810> so

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
electrical system back there alright so

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.970 
electrical system back there alright so
this<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.260> an<00:04:31.380> evolution

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.710 

I<00:04:35.420> do<00:04:36.420> like<00:04:36.720> this<00:04:36.960> style<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:38.180> flooring<00:04:39.180> nice

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
easy to clean so this is a quick look at

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.590 
easy to clean so this is a quick look at
a<00:04:48.080> 2015<00:04:49.080> freight<00:04:49.500> liner<00:04:49.970> evolution<00:04:50.970> I'm<00:04:51.330> going

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
a 2015 freight liner evolution I'm going

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.620 
a 2015 freight liner evolution I'm going
about<00:04:51.870> 150<00:04:52.770> miles<00:04:52.980> no<00:04:53.970> biggie

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
about 150 miles no biggie
