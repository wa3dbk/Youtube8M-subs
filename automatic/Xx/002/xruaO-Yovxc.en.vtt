to get the reward clear and I'm gonna be
showing<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.350> easiest<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.070> fastest

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
showing you the easiest and fastest

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.040 
showing you the easiest and fastest
possible<00:00:23.760> way<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.570> think<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.900> do<00:00:24.960> this

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
possible way to do so I think I do this

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.320 
possible way to do so I think I do this
one<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.529> about<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.800> minute<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.490> half<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.939> think

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
one in about a minute and a half I think

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.240 
one in about a minute and a half I think
that's<00:00:27.449> pretty<00:00:27.630> quick<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.080> pretty<00:00:28.890> much<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that's pretty quick and pretty much the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.950 
that's pretty quick and pretty much the
goal<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.849> destroy<00:00:30.359> all<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.630> these

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
goal is to just destroy all of these

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.840 
goal is to just destroy all of these
bombs<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.560> will<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.949> turn<00:00:31.980> destroy<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
bombs which will in turn destroy the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.240 
bombs which will in turn destroy the
stage<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.530> eventually<00:00:34.530> there'll<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.770> no<00:00:35.040> more

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
stage and eventually there'll be no more

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.530 
stage and eventually there'll be no more
stage<00:00:35.520> left<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.850> you'll<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.120> left<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
stage left and you'll be left with the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.900 
stage left and you'll be left with the
Omega<00:00:36.809> version<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:38.010> when<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.340> clear

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
Omega version and that's when you clear

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.459 
Omega version and that's when you clear
the<00:00:39.030> stage<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.050> want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.379> is

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the stage and so what you want to do is

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.840 
the stage and so what you want to do is
be<00:00:40.590> hitting<00:00:40.829> these<00:00:40.950> bombs<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.370> forward<00:00:41.670> smash

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
be hitting these bombs of forward smash

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.060 
be hitting these bombs of forward smash
up<00:00:42.239> smash<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.870> forward<00:00:43.350> air<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.920> those

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
up smash and forward air because those

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.770 
up smash and forward air because those
three<00:00:44.340> moves<00:00:44.520> will<00:00:44.700> take<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> bombs<00:00:45.239> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
three moves will take out the bombs in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.139 
three moves will take out the bombs in
one<00:00:46.020> hit<00:00:46.289> any<00:00:46.590> other<00:00:46.860> move<00:00:47.039> down<00:00:47.610> smash<00:00:47.879> you're

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
one hit any other move down smash you're

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.490 
one hit any other move down smash you're
gonna<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> charge<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.989> little<00:00:49.379> bit

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
gonna have to charge for a little bit

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.319 
gonna have to charge for a little bit
longer<00:00:49.770> than<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.730> playing<00:00:51.149> down

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
longer than just you know playing down

bomb<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.930> couple<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.590> walls<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.070> then<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> bomb

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
bomb a couple of walls and then a bomb

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.560 
bomb a couple of walls and then a bomb
on<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> other<00:00:59.699> side

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
on the other side

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.420 
on the other side
the<00:01:00.870> first<00:01:01.079> bomb<00:01:01.350> will<00:01:01.559> set<00:01:01.739> off<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.280> other

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the first bomb will set off the other

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.860 
the first bomb will set off the other
bomb<00:01:02.640> once<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.030> gets<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> other<00:01:03.629> side<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
bomb once it gets to the other side of

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.119 
bomb once it gets to the other side of
the<00:01:03.989> wall<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.350> don't<00:01:04.500> need<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.890> running

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the wall so you don't need to be running

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.590 
the wall so you don't need to be running
and<00:01:05.339> trying<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.850> hit<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> other<00:01:06.150> bomb<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.570> well

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and trying to hit the other bomb as well

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
and trying to hit the other bomb as well
that<00:01:06.990> first<00:01:07.260> bomb<00:01:07.439> will<00:01:07.590> set<00:01:07.770> off<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.040> second

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that first bomb will set off that second

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.550 
that first bomb will set off that second
bomb<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.689> also<00:01:09.869> don't<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
bomb and you also don't really have to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.960 
bomb and you also don't really have to
worry<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.100> these<00:01:11.159> Wario's<00:01:11.640> gets<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
worry if one of these Wario's gets a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
worry if one of these Wario's gets a
hammer<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.390> well<00:01:12.630> they're<00:01:12.840> pretty<00:01:12.990> easy<00:01:13.229> to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
hammer as well they're pretty easy to

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350 
hammer as well they're pretty easy to
dodge<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.830> mean<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.310> stage<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> quite<00:01:14.850> big<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
dodge I mean this stage is quite big and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
dodge I mean this stage is quite big and
you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.960> actually<00:01:16.170> kind<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.619> lure<00:01:16.799> them<00:01:17.009> into

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you can actually kind of lure them into

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
you can actually kind of lure them into
the<00:01:17.310> bombs<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:18.000> explode<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the bombs and have them explode the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
the bombs and have them explode the
bombs<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> hammer<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
bombs with the hammer for you if one of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.289 
bombs with the hammer for you if one of
them<00:01:20.520> does<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> hammer

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
them does get the hammer

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.570 
them does get the hammer
it's<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.100> big<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.400> deal

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it's it's it's not that big of a deal

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.219 
it's it's it's not that big of a deal
like<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.150> said<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.630> these<00:01:24.720> bombs<00:01:24.960> could

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
like I said one of these bombs could

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.630 
like I said one of these bombs could
explode<00:01:25.619> them<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.920> kill<00:01:26.100> them<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.400> off<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
explode them and kill them right off the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.679 
explode them and kill them right off the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
stage with a hammer because obviously

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you can't jump and recover when you have

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.819 
you can't jump and recover when you have
it<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.290> bring<00:01:31.740> them

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
it and you can just kind of bring them

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.990 
it and you can just kind of bring them
into<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> bombs<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.520> was<00:01:32.700> doing<00:01:32.880> with

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
into the bombs like I was doing with

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.030 
into the bombs like I was doing with
that<00:01:33.150> warrior<00:01:33.390> there<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.680> keep<00:01:34.890> going

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that warrior there so as you keep going

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.380 
that warrior there so as you keep going
through<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.460> kind<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.850> keep<00:01:36.000> dodging

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
through you just kind of keep dodging

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
through you just kind of keep dodging
these<00:01:36.479> Wario's<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.079> only<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.439> 5%<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.159> haven't

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
these Wario's I only have 5% I haven't

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.920 
these Wario's I only have 5% I haven't
even<00:01:38.549> been<00:01:38.790> fighting<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> Warriors<00:01:39.540> at<00:01:39.659> all

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
even been fighting the Warriors at all

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
even been fighting the Warriors at all
you<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.409> don't<00:01:40.680> need<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.520> need<00:01:41.670> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
you really don't need to all you need to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.969 
you really don't need to all you need to
do<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:41.970> hit<00:01:42.360> these<00:01:42.479> bombs<00:01:42.750> over<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> over<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
do is hit these bombs over and over and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.590 
do is hit these bombs over and over and
over<00:01:44.250> again<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.970> think<00:01:45.180> there's<00:01:45.360> maybe

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
over again and I think there's maybe

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.420 
over again and I think there's maybe
about<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.079> 30<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.680> 40<00:01:46.710> until<00:01:47.310> they're

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
about like 30 or 40 until they're

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.039 
about like 30 or 40 until they're
finally<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:47.850> gone<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.329> don't<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> seems

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
finally all gone I don't know it seems

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.660 
finally all gone I don't know it seems
like<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.229> lot<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:50.280> there's<00:01:50.430> only<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
like a lot but I think there's only a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
like a lot but I think there's only a
couple<00:01:50.700> left<00:01:50.939> by<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.570> point<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> tell

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
couple left by this point you can tell

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.960 
couple left by this point you can tell
by<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.500> stage<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> back<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.820> kind<00:01:53.939> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
by the stage in the back it kind of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.760 
by the stage in the back it kind of
looks<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.180> an<00:01:54.360> empty<00:01:54.659> apartment<00:01:55.110> building

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
looks like an empty apartment building

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.499 
looks like an empty apartment building
you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:55.979> under<00:01:56.310> construction<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.360> is

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you know under construction and this is

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.030 
you know under construction and this is
definitely<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> last<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.469> right<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
definitely the last one right there and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.520 
definitely the last one right there and
you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
you

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.649 
you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
so the final green beam has fallen to

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.600 
so the final green beam has fallen to
the<00:02:01.750> ground<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.380> is<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:03.100> minute<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:03.490> a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
the ground and that is it a minute and a

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.160 
the ground and that is it a minute and a
half<00:02:03.729> clear<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.299> that<00:02:04.659> is<00:02:04.810> how<00:02:04.900> you<00:02:04.960> do

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
half clear and that is how you do

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.890 
half clear and that is how you do
