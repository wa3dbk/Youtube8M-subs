tips video series we're doing a cap kit
right<00:00:16.620> now<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.310> monitor<00:00:17.640> chasis<00:00:18.150> and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
right now on this monitor chasis and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.710 
right now on this monitor chasis and
we've<00:00:19.440> already<00:00:19.680> found<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.700> couple<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.180> bad<00:00:21.360> caps

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
we've already found a couple of bad caps

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.960 
we've already found a couple of bad caps
how<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.860> know<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.010> we're<00:00:23.250> bad<00:00:23.400> when<00:00:23.939> we

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
how do we know that we're bad when we

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.240 
how do we know that we're bad when we
check<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.360> with<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.510> es<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.350> meter<00:00:25.619> from<00:00:26.010> that

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
check in with a es or meter from that

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.890 
check in with a es or meter from that
electronics<00:00:27.290> that<00:00:28.310> electronics<00:00:29.900> mad

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
electronics that electronics mad

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.069 
electronics that electronics mad
electronics<00:00:31.470> comm<00:00:31.829> this<00:00:32.460> was<00:00:32.669> about<00:00:33.030> $50<00:00:33.840> so

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
electronics comm this was about $50 so

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.590 
electronics comm this was about $50 so
that's<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.470> not<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> real<00:00:35.280> high<00:00:35.400> dollar<00:00:36.329> tool

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that's not a not a real high dollar tool

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.550 
that's not a not a real high dollar tool
they're<00:00:36.780> better<00:00:36.989> ones

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
they're better ones

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.229 
they're better ones
there's<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.910> will<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> job

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
there's but this one will do the job

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.389 
there's but this one will do the job
just<00:00:39.690> finding<00:00:40.200> check<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.680> circuit<00:00:41.100> which

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
just finding check in circuit which

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.220 
just finding check in circuit which
comes<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.910> very<00:00:42.060> handy<00:00:42.380> it's<00:00:43.380> a<00:00:43.470> lot<00:00:43.590> faster

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
comes in very handy it's a lot faster

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.600 
comes in very handy it's a lot faster
like<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> said<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.650> found<00:00:46.800> two<00:00:47.010> cats<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.430> were

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
like I said we found two cats that were

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.230 
like I said we found two cats that were
bad<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.920> from<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.040> heat<00:00:50.220> all<00:00:50.700> these<00:00:50.910> what

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
bad and from the heat all these what

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.540 
bad and from the heat all these what
they<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.600> they<00:00:51.690> drive<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.410> no<00:00:52.620> thang<00:00:53.190> value

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
they do is they drive and no thang value

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.110 
they do is they drive and no thang value
and<00:00:53.700> go<00:00:53.790> back<00:00:54.470> alright<00:00:55.470> so<00:00:55.550> we<00:00:56.550> took<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> old

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and go back alright so we took the old

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.060 
and go back alright so we took the old
caps<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.750> D<00:00:57.960> solder<00:00:58.260> them<00:00:58.590> use<00:00:58.890> some

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
caps we D solder them use some

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.430 
caps we D solder them use some
desoldering<00:00:59.550> braid<00:00:59.610> and<00:01:00.540> we<00:01:00.870> pull<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.290> old

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
desoldering braid and we pull the old

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.160 
desoldering braid and we pull the old
caps<00:01:01.740> out<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.700> tested<00:01:03.360> them<00:01:03.450> in<00:01:03.600> circuit<00:01:04.049> then

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
caps out we tested them in circuit then

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.870 
caps out we tested them in circuit then
we<00:01:04.199> took<00:01:04.379> them<00:01:04.500> out<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.890> also<00:01:05.159> test<00:01:05.549> them<00:01:05.790> out

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
we took them out and also test them out

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.450 
we took them out and also test them out
of<00:01:06.060> circuit<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:07.080> guys<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.530> bad<00:01:07.710> we're

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
of circuit these guys are bad we're

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.090 
of circuit these guys are bad we're
ready<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> put<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.990> there's<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.770> numbers

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
ready to put in now there's some numbers

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.890 
ready to put in now there's some numbers
and<00:01:11.430> letters<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.970> stuff<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.420> here

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and letters and stuff on here

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.110 
and letters and stuff on here
what<00:01:13.320> are<00:01:13.409> those<00:01:13.530> mean<00:01:13.799> what<00:01:14.040> well<00:01:15.000> when

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
what are those mean what well when

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.120 
what are those mean what well when
you're<00:01:15.240> replacing<00:01:15.480> a<00:01:15.780> cap<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.470> first<00:01:16.740> number

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you're replacing a cap the first number

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.790 
you're replacing a cap the first number
is<00:01:17.880> usually<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.960> voltage<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.530> could<00:01:19.680> be

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
is usually the voltage it could be

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.920 
is usually the voltage it could be
backwards<00:01:20.250> you'll<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> B<00:01:21.480> after<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
backwards you'll have a B after the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
backwards you'll have a B after the
number<00:01:22.230> that's<00:01:22.470> your<00:01:22.710> voltage<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.760> can<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
number that's your voltage you can you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.550 
number that's your voltage you can you
always<00:01:24.480> want<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.750> replace<00:01:25.050> with<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> same

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
always want to replace with the same

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
always want to replace with the same
voltage<00:01:25.800> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.729> voltage<00:01:27.060> which

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
voltage you can go up in voltage which

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.899 
voltage you can go up in voltage which
you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.450> never<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.750> down<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.080> focus<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.790> next

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
you can never go down in focus the next

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.310 
you can never go down in focus the next
number<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.300> gonna<00:01:30.510> have<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> UF<00:01:31.050> and<00:01:31.200> that's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
number is gonna have a UF and that's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.899 
number is gonna have a UF and that's
gonna<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.590> micro<00:01:31.950> farad<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.670> needs

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
gonna be your micro farad and that needs

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.149 
gonna be your micro farad and that needs
to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.030> exactly<00:01:33.810> whatever<00:01:33.990> come<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
to be exactly whatever come out and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.640 
to be exactly whatever come out and
substitute<00:01:35.640> anything<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.780> what<00:01:37.440> came

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
substitute anything so what what came

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.090 
substitute anything so what what came
out<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.310> says<00:01:39.350> can<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:40.920> that's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
out of here says can you have so that's

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.510 
out of here says can you have so that's

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.359 
okay so why I'm looking at this and one
of<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.940> legs<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.600> longer<00:02:01.380> than<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:02.040> other<00:02:02.190> one

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
of the legs is longer than the other one

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.480 
of the legs is longer than the other one
why<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.530> well<00:02:04.530> there's<00:02:04.830> polarity<00:02:05.369> on

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
why is that well there's polarity on

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.640 
why is that well there's polarity on
these<00:02:05.670> there's<00:02:05.940> a<00:02:06.030> negative<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> positive

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
these there's a negative and a positive

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.090 
these there's a negative and a positive
and<00:02:07.650> on<00:02:07.860> your

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
and on your

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.280 
and on your
horde<00:02:08.310> you'll<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.210> they'll<00:02:09.840> either<00:02:09.990> have<00:02:10.260> a

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
horde you'll have they'll either have a

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.140 
horde you'll have they'll either have a
+4<00:02:10.770> positive<00:02:11.280> there<00:02:11.520> were<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> lot<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.820> times<00:02:12.030> I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
+4 positive there were a lot of times I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.360 
+4 positive there were a lot of times I
have<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.300> black<00:02:12.570> mark<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> negative<00:02:13.890> you

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
have a black mark for a negative you

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.480 
have a black mark for a negative you
need<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.610> make<00:02:14.790> sure<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:15.420> have<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.720> correct

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
need to make sure you have that correct

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.220 
need to make sure you have that correct
and<00:02:17.490> there<00:02:17.820> are<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> couple<00:02:18.300> arcade<00:02:18.780> boards

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
and there are a couple arcade boards

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.810 
and there are a couple arcade boards
that<00:02:19.500> come<00:02:19.710> from<00:02:19.830> overseas<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.550> different

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
that come from overseas in different

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.790 
that come from overseas in different
places<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.420> do<00:02:21.690> not<00:02:21.870> have<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.410> there<00:02:22.620> so

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
places that do not have it on there so

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.450 
places that do not have it on there so
by<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.580> means<00:02:23.850> keep<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.480> mind<00:02:24.750> which<00:02:25.230> way<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
by all means keep in mind which way the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.070 
by all means keep in mind which way the
negative<00:02:26.940> side<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:27.660> tell<00:02:27.870> the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
negative side and you can tell the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.260 
negative side and you can tell the
negative<00:02:28.440> side<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.860> cap<00:02:29.190> because<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:30.150> will

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
negative side on a cap because it will

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.890 
negative side on a cap because it will
have<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> stripe<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.890> side<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:33.060> remember

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
have a stripe on on the side so remember

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.720 
have a stripe on on the side so remember
which<00:02:34.110> way<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.560> strike<00:02:34.830> was<00:02:35.100> when<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.490> pull

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
which way the strike was when you pull

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.730 
which way the strike was when you pull
it<00:02:35.850> out<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.690> when<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.930> put<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.230> back<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.410> and

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
it out so when you put it back in and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.260 
it out so when you put it back in and
sometimes<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.220> can't<00:02:38.460> read<00:02:38.670> on<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.940> back<00:02:39.060> of

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
sometimes you can't read on the back of

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.440 
sometimes you can't read on the back of
the<00:02:39.330> board<00:02:39.510> dad<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.500> many<00:02:40.680> repairs<00:02:41.100> or<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:41.730> kind

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
the board dad so many repairs or is kind

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.180 
the board dad so many repairs or is kind
of<00:02:42.510> been<00:02:42.630> scraped<00:02:42.960> off<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.470> keep<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.160> mind

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
of been scraped off so keep in mind

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.180 
of been scraped off so keep in mind
which<00:02:44.580> way<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:44.880> but<00:02:45.780> go<00:02:46.020> no<00:02:46.320> cuz<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.740> matters

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
which way you but go no cuz it matters

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.360 
which way you but go no cuz it matters
right<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:47.670> matters<00:02:48.030> greatly<00:02:48.300> if<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.230> replace<00:02:49.560> 50

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
right it matters greatly if I replace 50

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.060 
right it matters greatly if I replace 50
caps<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> monitor<00:02:51.510> chassés<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.290> put<00:02:52.830> one

caps on the monitor chassés and put one

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.640 
caps on the monitor chassés and put one
on<00:02:53.280> backwards<00:02:53.990> you're<00:02:54.990> gonna<00:02:55.080> do<00:02:55.260> more<00:02:55.440> damage

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
on backwards you're gonna do more damage

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.080 
on backwards you're gonna do more damage
than<00:02:55.950> what<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.370> before<00:02:56.640> we<00:02:56.700> started

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
than what you have before we started

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.200 
than what you have before we started
exactly<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.200> take<00:02:58.440> your<00:02:58.590> time<00:02:58.830> make<00:02:59.700> sure<00:02:59.760> you

exactly so take your time make sure you
know<00:03:00.390> which<00:03:00.630> way<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.140> polarity<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.250> I'm<00:03:02.400> sure

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
know which way is polarity and I'm sure

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.390 
know which way is polarity and I'm sure
there's<00:03:02.790> going<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.030> more<00:03:03.330> in<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.540> article

there's going to be more in the article

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.250 
there's going to be more in the article

okay so now we're ready to put it in and
let's<00:03:15.270> see<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.840> board<00:03:16.020> here<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:17.340> has<00:03:17.550> a

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
let's see on the board here it has a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.930 
let's see on the board here it has a
plus<00:03:18.120> towards<00:03:18.870> me<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.520> going<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.790> be

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
plus towards me so that is going to be

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.900 
plus towards me so that is going to be
the<00:03:21.150> shorter<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.960> right

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
the shorter in right

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.790 
the shorter in right
the<00:03:23.910> longer<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.660> longer<00:03:24.990> okay<00:03:25.380> want<00:03:25.740> to

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
the longer in the longer okay want to

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.740 
the longer in the longer okay want to
make<00:03:25.920> sure<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.430> black<00:03:26.640> stripe<00:03:27.030> away<00:03:27.390> from<00:03:27.630> you

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
make sure the black stripe away from you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.800 
make sure the black stripe away from you
the<00:03:28.200> black<00:03:28.500> stripe<00:03:28.860> is<00:03:29.190> away<00:03:29.520> from<00:03:29.760> me<00:03:29.910> so

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the black stripe is away from me so

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.210 
the black stripe is away from me so
we're<00:03:30.990> just<00:03:31.020> going<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.470> stick<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:31.890> through<00:03:31.920> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
we're just going to stick it through the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.180 
we're just going to stick it through the
holes<00:03:32.520> here<00:03:35.240> okay

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
holes here okay

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.850 
holes here okay
now<00:03:38.760> what<00:03:39.350> when<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.410> stick<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.710> through<00:03:40.740> the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
now what when you stick it through the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.740 
now what when you stick it through the
hose<00:03:41.100> you'll<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.460> the<00:03:41.580> leads<00:03:41.820> just<00:03:42.570> pull

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
hose you'll have the leads just pull

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.090 
hose you'll have the leads just pull
them<00:03:42.900> up<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.110> little<00:03:43.230> bit<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.560> bend<00:03:43.770> them<00:03:43.920> out

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
them up a little bit and bend them out

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.830 
them up a little bit and bend them out
that<00:03:44.460> will<00:03:44.580> give<00:03:44.700> tension<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.420> give<00:03:45.570> you<00:03:45.660> time

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
that will give tension and give you time

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.270 
that will give tension and give you time
to<00:03:45.990> solder<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.410> without<00:03:46.650> your<00:03:46.830> cat<00:03:47.010> falling

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
to solder it without your cat falling

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.970 
to solder it without your cat falling
back<00:03:47.550> off<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.000> board<00:03:48.180> right<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:49.470> even<00:03:49.890> if

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
back off the board right so even if

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.410 
back off the board right so even if
you're<00:03:50.160> by<00:03:50.310> yourself<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.910> do<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.180> all<00:03:51.390> the

just bend the legs a little

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.430 
just bend the legs a little
so<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.400> will<00:03:56.760> stay<00:03:56.970> in<00:03:57.180> place<00:03:57.330> right<00:03:57.810> correct

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
so the will stay in place right correct
