00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you're probably thinking maybe I should

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.560

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
listen but after this you could probably

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.859 
listen but after this you could probably
just<00:01:12.720> replay<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.270> watch<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.299> over<00:01:15.600> again

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
just replay it and watch it over again
