within the other set of moons we've

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.080 
within the other set of moons we've
already<00:01:04.320> known<00:01:04.650> about<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.670> seems<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> be

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
already known about and that seems to be

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.700 
already known about and that seems to be
telling<00:01:06.450> us<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> bit<00:01:06.780> about<00:01:06.810> how<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.260> planet

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
telling us a bit about how the planet

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.560 
telling us a bit about how the planet
Pluto<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.189> its<00:01:08.280> satellite<00:01:08.790> care<00:01:09.060> informed

yeah I mean just give us a bit more

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.940 
yeah I mean just give us a bit more
detail<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.659> mean<00:01:12.960> how<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.560> know<00:01:13.799> is

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
detail on that I mean how you know is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.240 
detail on that I mean how you know is
the<00:01:14.040> discovery<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.790> shed<00:01:15.060> new<00:01:15.270> light<00:01:15.750> on

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
the discovery like to shed new light on

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.100 
the discovery like to shed new light on
the<00:01:17.250> Pluto<00:01:17.700> system<00:01:17.729> how<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> formed<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the Pluto system how it is formed and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.740 
the Pluto system how it is formed and
also<00:01:19.470> how<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> evolved<00:01:22.520> that's<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
also how it evolved that's right it it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.450 
also how it evolved that's right it it
appears<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.470> understand<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
appears as we understand it that the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.420 
appears as we understand it that the
planet<00:01:27.270> Pluto<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> got<00:01:28.530> hit<00:01:29.130> by

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
planet Pluto as we know it got hit by

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.160 
planet Pluto as we know it got hit by
something<00:01:29.729> very<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.299> large<00:01:30.570> very<00:01:30.900> very

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
something very very large very very

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.200 
something very very large very very
early<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.560> his<00:01:31.770> history<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.970> what

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
early in his history and that's what

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.030 
early in his history and that's what
basically<00:01:33.600> broke<00:01:33.960> off<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.439> large<00:01:34.740> moon

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
basically broke off this large moon

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.649 
basically broke off this large moon
called<00:01:35.340> taryn<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.970> mentioned<00:01:36.360> earlier

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
called taryn that you mentioned earlier

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.080 
called taryn that you mentioned earlier
at<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.680> same<00:01:37.950> time<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.460> all<00:01:38.640> happened

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
at the same time that that all happened

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.850 
at the same time that that all happened
a<00:01:39.299> large<00:01:39.600> field<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.020> debris<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.799> scattered

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
a large field of debris was scattered

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.520 
a large field of debris was scattered
all<00:01:41.310> around<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.600> debris<00:01:43.290> field

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
all around it and that debris field

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
all around it and that debris field
eventually<00:01:44.100> settled<00:01:44.460> down<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.790> become<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
eventually settled down to become the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.420 
eventually settled down to become the
five<00:01:45.780> moons<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.740> were<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> four<00:01:47.159> remaining

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
five moons that were the four remaining

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.280 
five moons that were the four remaining
moons<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.090> know<00:01:48.240> about<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.750> those<00:01:49.259> are

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
moons that we know about and those are

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.530 
moons that we know about and those are
now<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.770> very<00:01:49.979> very<00:01:50.189> special<00:01:50.460> locations<00:01:51.210> where

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
now in very very special locations where

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.600 
now in very very special locations where
they<00:01:51.869> each<00:01:52.079> fall<00:01:52.470> at<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.740> particular<00:01:53.430> location

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
they each fall at a particular location

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.240 
they each fall at a particular location
that<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.320> multiple<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that is just the right multiple of the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.819 
that is just the right multiple of the
number<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> orbits<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.210> Karen<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.649> at<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
number of orbits of Karen to be at a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.590 
number of orbits of Karen to be at a
very<00:01:59.040> stable<00:01:59.280> location<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.149> each<00:02:00.240> time<00:02:00.420> we

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
very stable location and each time we

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.300 
very stable location and each time we
look<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.930> seem<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.259> finding<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.710> new<00:02:01.890> moon<00:02:02.100> at

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
look we seem to be finding a new moon at

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.609 
look we seem to be finding a new moon at
one<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.579> these<00:02:02.700> stable<00:02:03.090> locations<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:04.500> this

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
one of these stable locations can this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.429 
one of these stable locations can this
latest<00:02:05.280> discovery<00:02:05.790> mark<00:02:06.119> tell<00:02:06.450> us<00:02:06.600> how<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
latest discovery mark tell us how the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.219 
latest discovery mark tell us how the
earth<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.099> our<00:02:08.520> moon<00:02:09.000> was<00:02:09.629> formed<00:02:09.929> because

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
earth and our moon was formed because

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.470 
earth and our moon was formed because
scientists<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:10.890> yourselves<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.700> understand

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
scientists like yourselves I understand

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.520 
scientists like yourselves I understand
believe<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.810> both<00:02:12.989> systems

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
believe that both systems

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.920 
believe that both systems
probably<00:02:13.890> formed<00:02:14.190> from<00:02:14.790> big<00:02:15.150> impacts<00:02:15.540> early

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
probably formed from big impacts early

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.690 
probably formed from big impacts early
in<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.080> history<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.040> solar<00:02:17.220> system<00:02:19.700> yeah

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
in the history of the solar system yeah

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.910 
in the history of the solar system yeah
that's<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.150> pluto<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.170> charon<00:02:22.230> together

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
that's right pluto and charon together

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.650 
that's right pluto and charon together
form<00:02:23.280> what<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.459> basically<00:02:24.030> called<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.330> binary

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
form what is basically called a binary

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.380 
form what is basically called a binary
planet<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.560> two<00:02:25.770> bodies<00:02:26.160> very<00:02:26.850> similar<00:02:27.240> in

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
planet it's two bodies very similar in

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.660 
planet it's two bodies very similar in
size<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.900> orbit<00:02:28.200> around<00:02:28.290> each<00:02:28.620> other<00:02:28.890> well

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
size that orbit around each other well

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.430 
size that orbit around each other well
the<00:02:30.060> mood<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> bit<00:02:30.630> smaller<00:02:30.930> than<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.290> earth

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
the mood is a bit smaller than the earth

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.020 
the mood is a bit smaller than the earth
but<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.010> can<00:02:32.160> almost<00:02:32.310> think<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.910> earth

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
but you can almost think of the earth

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.540 
but you can almost think of the earth
and<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.390> moon<00:02:33.540> also<00:02:33.930> as<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.350> binary<00:02:34.650> planet<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
and the moon also as a binary planet and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.330 
and the moon also as a binary planet and
if<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.330> do<00:02:36.540> then<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.170> realize<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
if you do then you realize that the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.160 
if you do then you realize that the
earth<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.730> moon<00:02:38.910> also<00:02:39.300> formed<00:02:39.900> from<00:02:40.050> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
earth and the moon also formed from a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.140 
earth and the moon also formed from a
very<00:02:40.380> large<00:02:40.650> collision<00:02:41.250> probably<00:02:41.940> something

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
very large collision probably something

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.180 
very large collision probably something
about<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.630> size<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:43.020> Mars<00:02:43.290> hit<00:02:43.620> earth<00:02:43.830> very

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
about the size of Mars hit earth very

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.370 
about the size of Mars hit earth very
early<00:02:44.489> in<00:02:44.520> its<00:02:44.730> history<00:02:44.790> broke<00:02:45.750> off<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.200> moon

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
early in its history broke off the moon

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.090 
early in its history broke off the moon
and<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:47.070> is<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.459> moon<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.880> know<00:02:48.060> today
