if we look down here I'm gonna show you
just<00:00:09.120> kinda<00:00:09.510> how<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.660> cut<00:00:09.960> into<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.349> so<00:00:10.440> I'm

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
just kinda how I cut into it so I'm

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.350 
just kinda how I cut into it so I'm
using<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.860> dremel<00:00:11.190> tool<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.700> don't<00:00:11.940> have<00:00:12.179> to

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
using the dremel tool you don't have to

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.490 
using the dremel tool you don't have to
do<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:12.929> seems<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.259> work<00:00:13.469> pretty

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
do this but this seems to work pretty

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.950 
do this but this seems to work pretty
well<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.730> watch<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.450> kind<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.750> like

well so watch this you just kind of like
do<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> little<00:00:16.260> circle<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:18.330> cut<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
do a little circle here and you cut a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.839 
do a little circle here and you cut a
little<00:00:18.660> tiny<00:00:19.289> hole<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:25.789> now<00:00:26.789> you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
little tiny hole in it like this now you

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.370 
little tiny hole in it like this now you
do<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> hole<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.539> side<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> hole

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
do a hole on this side and you do a hole

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.779 
do a hole on this side and you do a hole
on<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.560> other<00:00:28.680> side<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.400> get<00:00:29.580> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
on the other side and what you get of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.709 
on the other side and what you get of
course<00:00:29.820> did<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.660> get<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.869> egg<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.600> it

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
course did you get this egg so I have it

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.530 
course did you get this egg so I have it
still<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> yolk<00:00:34.410> inside<00:00:34.670> so<00:00:35.670> women<00:00:36.239> use

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
still with the yolk inside so women use

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.720 
still with the yolk inside so women use
is<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.110> skewer<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> skewer<00:00:38.370> pops

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
is a little skewer so the skewer pops

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.420 
is a little skewer so the skewer pops
the<00:00:39.390> yo-yo<00:00:39.719> side<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:41.219> here's

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the yo-yo side like this and now here's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.000 
the yo-yo side like this and now here's
my<00:00:41.489> favorite<00:00:41.640> part<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> whole<00:00:42.450> world<00:00:43.010> not

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
my favorite part in the whole world not

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
my favorite part in the whole world not
yes<00:00:45.440> compelling<00:00:46.879> I<00:00:47.879> know<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.300> you've<00:00:48.450> done

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
yes compelling I know that you've done

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540 
yes compelling I know that you've done
dozens<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.260> these<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.739> program<00:00:50.160> out<00:00:50.370> it

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
dozens of these for this program out it

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.619 
dozens of these for this program out it
goes<00:00:50.760> look<00:00:51.149> at<00:00:51.239> that

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
goes look at that

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.450 
goes look at that
and<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.960> ompletely<00:00:52.350> cleans<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.070> show<00:00:53.250> up

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and that ompletely cleans this show up

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.240 
and that ompletely cleans this show up
I'll<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.510> use<00:00:54.719> them<00:00:54.870> later<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.829> kill<00:00:56.129> all

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
I'll go use them later on and kill all

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
I'll go use them later on and kill all
the<00:00:56.280> bacteria<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:57.059> right

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the bacteria all right

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.330 
the bacteria all right
so<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.680> shell<00:00:58.920> but

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
so now all we have is the shell but

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.670 
so now all we have is the shell but
inside<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.420> want<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.469> need

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
inside is what we really want so we need

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
inside is what we really want so we need
to<00:01:01.770> dissolve<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.280> shell<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.030> vinegar<00:01:03.480> will

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
to dissolve that shell and vinegar will

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.969 
to dissolve that shell and vinegar will
dissolve<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.110> show<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> take<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.799> look

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
dissolve the show so if you take a look

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.109 
dissolve the show so if you take a look
over<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> little<00:01:05.850> science

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
over here I have a little science

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.820 
over here I have a little science
experiment<00:01:06.390> already<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.799> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
experiment already going for you so I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.590 
experiment already going for you so I
took<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.280> egg<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.970> filled<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.330> water

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
took the egg and I filled it with water

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.539 
took the egg and I filled it with water
and<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> dropped<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.010> into<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.280> glass

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and then I dropped it down into a glass

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.850 
and then I dropped it down into a glass
of<00:01:11.850> vinegar<00:01:12.570> okay<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.320> see<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> little

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
of vinegar okay so see the little

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.260 
of vinegar okay so see the little
bubbles<00:01:13.979> kind<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.400> coming<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.760> right<00:01:15.030> now

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
bubbles kind of coming in right now

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
bubbles kind of coming in right now
so<00:01:15.659> those<00:01:15.810> bubbles<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.350> actually<00:01:16.470> dissolving

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so those bubbles are actually dissolving

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.100 
so those bubbles are actually dissolving
the<00:01:17.400> shell<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.970> kind<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.780> starting

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the shell just kind of see it starting

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.450 
the shell just kind of see it starting
to<00:01:19.229> come<00:01:19.409> off<00:01:19.439> right<00:01:19.770> now<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.100> we're<00:01:20.189> trying<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
to come off right now so we're trying to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.760 
to come off right now so we're trying to
get<00:01:20.520> through<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> membrane<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.780> we

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
get through to the membrane right we

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
get through to the membrane right we
want<00:01:22.979> through<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> membrane<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
want through to the membrane and and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.450 
want through to the membrane and and
don't<00:01:25.259> worry<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.680> gonna<00:01:25.799> take<00:01:26.040> right<00:01:26.220> five

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
don't worry it's gonna take right five

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.070 
don't worry it's gonna take right five
six<00:01:26.759> seven<00:01:27.090> days<00:01:27.240> something<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.960> do

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
six seven days something like that to do

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.630 
six seven days something like that to do
we<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.470> let<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.619> sit<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.070> alright<00:01:29.430> just

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
we just let it sit there alright just

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.490 
we just let it sit there alright just
kind<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> let<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.570> sit<00:01:30.659> there<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
kind of let it sit there and do that and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.530 
kind of let it sit there and do that and
when<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.189> done<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> rinse<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> off<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
when you are done and you rinse it off a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.850 
when you are done and you rinse it off a
couple<00:01:33.720> times<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> careful<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> show

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
couple times and careful with the show

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
couple times and careful with the show
you'll<00:01:35.369> never<00:01:35.759> guess<00:01:36.030> what<00:01:36.210> you're<00:01:36.329> gonna

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you'll never guess what you're gonna

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.270 
you'll never guess what you're gonna
have<00:01:36.750> look<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.650> Rick<00:01:38.009> Fairless
