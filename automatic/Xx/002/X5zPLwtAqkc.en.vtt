00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.270 
I wouldn't recommend going all out with
the<00:02:39.150> tissue<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.510> stuff<00:02:40.690> like<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.860> can

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
the tissue and stuff like that you can

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.830 
the tissue and stuff like that you can
get<00:02:42.549> away<00:02:42.670> with<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:43.209> doing<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:45.430> paint

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
get away with just doing the paint

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.630 
get away with just doing the paint
because<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.110> tissue<00:02:47.350> it's<00:02:47.980> not<00:02:48.370> going<00:02:48.579> to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
because the tissue it's not going to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.970 
because the tissue it's not going to
show<00:02:48.880> up<00:02:49.120> but<00:02:50.049> when<00:02:50.260> you're<00:02:50.380> doing<00:02:50.680> something

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
show up but when you're doing something

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.599 
show up but when you're doing something
that's<00:02:51.190> close<00:02:51.730> up<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:53.260> Halloween<00:02:53.829> or<00:02:54.130> if

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
that's close up like Halloween or if

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.180 
that's close up like Halloween or if
you're<00:02:54.850> in<00:02:55.030> smaller<00:02:55.420> auditorium<00:02:56.320> for<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.829> play

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
you're in smaller auditorium for a play

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.259 
you're in smaller auditorium for a play
or<00:02:57.489> whatever<00:02:57.880> then<00:02:59.579> of<00:03:00.579> course<00:03:00.910> they're<00:03:01.150> going

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
or whatever then of course they're going

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.380 
or whatever then of course they're going
to<00:03:01.329> be<00:03:01.390> able<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.750> tell<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.950> detail<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390
