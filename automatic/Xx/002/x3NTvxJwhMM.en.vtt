 He should be percent today 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.869
 to push with the romantic background 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.179
 it can be 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.590
 To make one's own direct purchase too long one's money 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:34.270
 So I take over 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.710

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.410

 The EU has a lot of problems in their relationship 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.290
 there are just so different but not in the good sense not so 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.150
 they would be their supplement 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.540
 and percent of it can make something new interesting 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.540
 Percent No Sebastian Sattler does not say 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.180
 Julia Koschitz weakened clarified defends well, but that is 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.750
 Sprinter with me also determines with percent that her figure is not 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.760
 may suffer 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.760
 So her figure is not her role 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.700
 Felix Hellmann plays Percent Leoben he describes it although I think that he 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.250
 Percent too many people cramming 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.180

 one provided in a Chinese Besançon Patricks 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.580
 the basic idea is good these couples stay together though it actually is 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.510
 does not work at all 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.410
 but the implementation of the film 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.190
 finally found so naive 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.049
 Percent, the two main characters for not largely incomprehensible 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.489
 who else percentage in the turn-em role to what it looked like 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.189
 is more than that of the 1 see the power in my eyes 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.209
 Percent the two protagonists 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.569
 A behavior this summer was especially clear yes and I mean 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.579
 I'm right 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.889
 m complicated exhausting a year ago 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.449
 Percent but it is such a was not there 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.400

 Arms in the cheeks 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.419
 we talk very often directly into the camera 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.199
 and that is not so good for me here 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.359
 I think I would have let her look a bit over 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.399
 a 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:57.279

 have a bit unpleasant flies 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:04.479
 and the film also has quite a lecturer's moments for example 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:08.089
 Scene Butcher explains strange 7 for me well 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:12.009
 therefore expect these moments we are unfortunately rare 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.859
 yes, there are again remove in two out of five stars 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.379
 the film starts on 11 09 2010 in German cinemas 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.519
 Percent age rating no idea 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.870
 As always, more information is available at SAP or I do not have until then 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.499

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.819
 The next time I have no idea what it is, let me surprise you 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.729
