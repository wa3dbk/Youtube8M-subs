last and we're looking at behemoth using
the<00:00:33.040> mtar<00:00:33.430> I<00:00:33.670> go<00:00:33.879> 31<00:00:34.840> in<00:00:34.870> four<00:00:35.530> but<00:00:36.340> I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
the mtar I go 31 in four but I

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.460 
the mtar I go 31 in four but I
absolutely<00:00:36.610> hate<00:00:37.390> this<00:00:37.600> damn<00:00:37.930> map<00:00:38.199> in

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
absolutely hate this damn map in

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.500 
absolutely hate this damn map in
infinity<00:00:38.949> reward<00:00:39.309> was<00:00:39.460> thinking<00:00:39.850> okay<00:00:40.180> they

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
infinity reward was thinking okay they

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.479 
infinity reward was thinking okay they
like<00:00:40.750> small<00:00:41.170> maps<00:00:41.470> let's<00:00:41.800> give<00:00:42.010> them<00:00:42.129> a<00:00:42.250> map<00:00:42.460> so

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
like small maps let's give them a map so

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.729 
like small maps let's give them a map so
small<00:00:43.059> and<00:00:43.239> narrow<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:44.080> I<00:00:44.110> get<00:00:44.350> shot<00:00:44.589> in<00:00:44.710> the

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
small and narrow so I get shot in the

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.829 
small and narrow so I get shot in the
back<00:00:44.980> all<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.430> time<00:00:45.460> but<00:00:46.000> seriously<00:00:46.330> guys<00:00:46.420> I

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
back all the time but seriously guys I

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.720 
back all the time but seriously guys I
think<00:00:47.440> this<00:00:47.470> map<00:00:47.769> has<00:00:47.949> got<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.370> be<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.699> worst

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
think this map has got to be the worst

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.630 
think this map has got to be the worst
one<00:00:49.210> I<00:00:49.449> thought<00:00:49.980> Stonehaven<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.129> seas<00:00:51.370> were

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
one I thought Stonehaven and seas were

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.579 
one I thought Stonehaven and seas were
bad<00:00:51.879> but<00:00:52.180> you<00:00:52.239> know<00:00:52.570> this<00:00:52.750> is<00:00:52.930> beyond<00:00:53.260> terrible

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
bad but you know this is beyond terrible

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.010 
bad but you know this is beyond terrible
people<00:00:53.980> spawn<00:00:54.370> behind<00:00:54.520> you<00:00:54.850> so<00:00:55.059> much<00:00:55.300> it<00:00:55.960> makes

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
people spawn behind you so much it makes

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.990 
people spawn behind you so much it makes
it<00:00:56.320> so<00:00:56.530> difficult<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:57.100> go<00:00:57.280> on<00:00:57.399> a<00:00:57.489> high<00:00:57.640> streak

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
it so difficult to go on a high streak

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.610 
it so difficult to go on a high streak
unless<00:00:58.270> you're<00:00:58.660> playing<00:00:58.840> with<00:00:59.020> a<00:00:59.079> full<00:00:59.320> clan

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
unless you're playing with a full clan

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.860 
unless you're playing with a full clan
and<00:00:59.890> I<00:01:00.219> did<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.489> few<00:01:00.820> many<00:01:01.120> strategies<00:01:01.480> that

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
and I did a few many strategies that

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.389 
and I did a few many strategies that
Iran<00:01:02.199> that<00:01:02.350> helped<00:01:02.620> me<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:02.859> do<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.010> lot<00:01:03.250> better

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
Iran that helped me to do a lot better

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.100 
Iran that helped me to do a lot better
without<00:01:03.640> being<00:01:03.969> shot<00:01:04.270> or<00:01:04.300> knifed<00:01:04.600> in<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.839> back

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
without being shot or knifed in the back

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.410 
without being shot or knifed in the back
and<00:01:05.470> I<00:01:05.950> did<00:01:06.100> find<00:01:06.340> that<00:01:06.520> if<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:06.880> pass<00:01:07.149> through

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
and I did find that if you pass through

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.420 
and I did find that if you pass through
the<00:01:07.690> underpass<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.530> leads<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.070> engine

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
the underpass that leads to the engine

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.730 
the underpass that leads to the engine
room<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.880> can<00:01:10.180> flank<00:01:10.600> pretty<00:01:10.960> easily<00:01:11.259> and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
room you can flank pretty easily and

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.410 
room you can flank pretty easily and
same<00:01:12.280> goes<00:01:12.310> for<00:01:12.759> if<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:12.910> were<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.149> go<00:01:13.240> the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
same goes for if you were to go the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.389 
same goes for if you were to go the
opposite<00:01:13.810> direction<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:14.740> will<00:01:14.920> lead<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.130> the

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
opposite direction it will lead to the

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.340 
opposite direction it will lead to the
enemy<00:01:15.729> spawns<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.539> you<00:01:16.600> can<00:01:16.750> flank<00:01:16.960> as<00:01:17.110> well

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
enemy spawns and you can flank as well

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.889 
enemy spawns and you can flank as well
now<00:01:17.950> i<00:01:17.979> don't<00:01:18.130> know<00:01:18.340> if<00:01:18.460> it's<00:01:18.850> just<00:01:19.000> me<00:01:19.149> but<00:01:19.630> the

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
now i don't know if it's just me but the

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.779 
now i don't know if it's just me but the
logic<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.500> staying<00:01:20.860> on<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.100> outskirts<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.640> the

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
logic of staying on the outskirts of the

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.300 
logic of staying on the outskirts of the
map<00:01:21.970> just<00:01:22.179> wasn't<00:01:22.570> effective<00:01:23.110> because<00:01:23.560> i<00:01:23.979> kept

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
map just wasn't effective because i kept

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.999 
map just wasn't effective because i kept
dying<00:01:24.610> either<00:01:25.000> from<00:01:25.390> behind<00:01:25.750> or<00:01:26.110> above<00:01:26.679> and

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
dying either from behind or above and

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.309 
dying either from behind or above and
other<00:01:27.459> than<00:01:27.759> that<00:01:27.970> i<00:01:28.000> didn't<00:01:28.720> find<00:01:28.959> anything

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
other than that i didn't find anything

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.169 
other than that i didn't find anything
about<00:01:29.709> this<00:01:29.830> map<00:01:30.039> at<00:01:30.190> all<00:01:30.310> fun<00:01:30.550> except<00:01:30.940> for<00:01:30.970> the

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
about this map at all fun except for the

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.760 
about this map at all fun except for the
field<00:01:31.420> order<00:01:31.630> which<00:01:32.229> i<00:01:32.319> showed<00:01:32.530> in<00:01:32.709> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
field order which i showed in the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.859 
field order which i showed in the
beginning<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.490> video<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.090> with<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
beginning of the video that with the

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.600 
beginning of the video that with the
chopper<00:01:35.229> gunner<00:01:35.440> it's<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.920> fun-filled<00:01:36.280> order

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
chopper gunner it's a fun-filled order

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.339 
chopper gunner it's a fun-filled order
because<00:01:36.940> you<00:01:37.539> get<00:01:37.660> to<00:01:37.720> control<00:01:37.899> where<00:01:38.319> the

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:38.349 
because you get to control where the

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.680 
because you get to control where the
chopper<00:01:38.770> goes<00:01:39.009> but<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:39.580> sucks<00:01:39.940> if<00:01:40.179> people<00:01:40.569> are

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
chopper goes but it sucks if people are

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.900 
chopper goes but it sucks if people are
hiding<00:01:40.929> so<00:01:41.410> so<00:01:41.830> for<00:01:42.069> those<00:01:42.190> that<00:01:42.399> did<00:01:42.610> get<00:01:42.789> the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
hiding so so for those that did get the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.219 
hiding so so for those that did get the
map<00:01:43.090> pack<00:01:43.119> what<00:01:43.450> would<00:01:43.569> you<00:01:43.660> rank<00:01:43.929> your

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
map pack what would you rank your

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.050 
map pack what would you rank your
favorite<00:01:44.289> maps<00:01:45.069> in<00:01:45.250> order<00:01:45.489> from<00:01:45.640> best<00:01:45.970> to

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
favorite maps in order from best to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.969 
favorite maps in order from best to
worst<00:01:46.149> now<00:01:46.840> for<00:01:47.020> me<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.259> would<00:01:47.380> be<00:01:47.410> ruins

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
worst now for me it would be ruins

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.279 
worst now for me it would be ruins
collision<00:01:48.670> on<00:01:48.910> earth<00:01:49.090> than<00:01:49.360> behemoth<00:01:49.929> so

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
collision on earth than behemoth so

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.770 
collision on earth than behemoth so
enough<00:01:51.099> about<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.580> map<00:01:51.789> if<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.090> want<00:01:52.599> my
