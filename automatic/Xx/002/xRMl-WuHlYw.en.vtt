00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 my name is khan holstein e book store 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.970
 in hamburg and i introduce you today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.849
 two novelties from the home bosch ago 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.650
 for the first time in 2015 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.290
 used and installed in the wheels 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.080
 on the one hand, that's why you have a system 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.650
 on-board computer for the bosch 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.380
 performance engines come into action 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.279
 and from the summer of 2015 also retrofitted 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.710
 can be used on bosch performance engines 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.369
 they see big mouse cinema big 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.560
 display 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.079
 I show eight different functions 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.210
 times the most important functions that the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.020
 main function in the i the the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.390
 driving speed the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:49.200
 Battery capacity and adjustment 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:52.649
 can press the engine by doing that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.469
 system with small joysticks move the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.329
 at the side on the display as well 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.800
 a so-called remote control 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.020
 that is during the ride that is 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.199
 easy to control 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.750
 on the display I can now from the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.490
 riding function for example in map and 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.000
 then go over the navigation 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.770
 gps station my position is displayed and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 can me through additional apps 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.780
 No matter if I download map material 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.850
 in singapore drive or through the old country 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.640
 or through stuttgart the map material 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.979
 can be read by any app by bosch 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.409
 is offered download bosch has 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.009
 an own website for connect your 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.619
 way 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.049
 There you will find information about the system 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.150
 both as well as the function and the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.689
 information about downloading the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.350
 apps the whole system communicates with 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.869
 the smartphone during the ride one 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.380
 the functions among others 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.470
 text messages I have that 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.680
 Smartphone will get right here 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.560
 Bosnia costs about 300 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.409
 Euro can be retrofitted from summer 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.390
 one of the drawbacks if that as 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.759
 Desire to denote is that the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.479
 GPS signal in the old country and on the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.789
 open track excellent 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.590
 but works in the city in the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.260
 canyons sometimes get the signal gone 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.390
 is and there I would be 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.909
 the gps signal is a bit stronger 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.450
 and a little bit better in the city 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.579
 is working 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.390
 the second important industry novelty in 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:25.640
 This year is the synchronization of the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.709
 automatic circuit of no win ski 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.900
 with the normal budget tuvia 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.370
 on-board computer here you can see how it works 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.890
 Normally it looks like vinci 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.430
 circuit with the display with the rotary 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.769
 handle and in the synchronized 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.109
 version looks like this is here 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.519
 now a brand new from the house blue 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.359
 Label is built by Riese and MÃ¼ller 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.659
 to have 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.690
 as one of the first blue label has the 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:54.500
 new function of bosch and tobias with 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.040
 the automatic no win ski harmony 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.590
 coupled here you can see the display of 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.060
 so called h sync or age sync 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.500
 model in which I kick the frequency 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.389
 I with the automatic circuit 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.730
 would like to drive with the normal bosch 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:14.000
 operate the remote control and then on 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.519
 display as setting see with which 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.329
 Cadence or third frequency I the wheel 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.180
 would like to drive 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.879
 that's all a circuit 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.400
 There is no longer a way around this wheel 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.769
 Now, where does that look like? 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.359
 nuvinci the nuvinci echoes 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.810
 the visible to the display, it is here 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:35.419
 nothing will happen over the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.459
 bosch into via display and the 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.769
 Setting the cadence completely 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.790
 normal about the remote control that is 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.010
 a coupled system as I said 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.810
 syncs between bosch and the 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.250
 new no win ski harmony 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.109
 or the harmony very gentle 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.879
 for one and a half years in use 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.760
 and now about the bosch system 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.859
 coupled also this system you can 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.840
 with us to the test drive very pleasantly 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.449
 Especially for commuters you put 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.430
 just drove by one has 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.859
 No extra sound handles 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.859
 The whole thing is about the bus system 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.859
 synchronize
