00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello to everyone I am bea 'you offend 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 if we find a new spoiler 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.279
 about the future 1.6 the future version of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.299
 minecraft and good to say that yesterday 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.160
 Wednesday I think it was artifact 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.199
 Wednesday of action of lived already also 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.579
 a spoiler was published that made a video 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.689
 about that I hope to leave the video 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.919
 write to touch the one that has not 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.179
 seen up here underneath in the 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.650
 description to do for what you want 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.909
 see and well then I believe him but 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.769
 having today was also published yesterday 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.779
 at 12 o'clock at night now peninsula 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.949
 Spanish more or less coordinates the bond is 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.600
 the stench of minecraft and I did not have time 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.290
 to give it that's why I'm being it and day 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.670
 Thursday 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.110
 but good basically the bonus is 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.420
 thinking about changing the difficulty between 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.890
 game for the future 1.6 but says that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.630
 is doing tests and that may 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.220
 This also does not arrive in time for the 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.200
 1.6 but if I leave a little bit of that 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.790
 would try this change difficulty and good 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.500
 basically the concept that he wants 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.540
 implement bong money is the difficulty 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.250
 regional is to say the difficulty within 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.510
 from an area that changed a little bit of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 difficulty according to the area in which you 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.930
 find and good between more time 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.490
 within a larger area will be difficulty 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.790
 within this area as it is putting a 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.530
 mod 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.450
 with greater strength so to speak greater 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.589
 difficulty and good this basically what 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.329
 What RamÃ³n is referring to is that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.130
 example if you have here your house the 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.080
 house is a fairly busy site 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.400
 between your game because logically the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.470
 house where they keep all your mining 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.060
 your things then around your house 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.980
 when it is night the difficulty of the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.330
 mods will be greater by the simple fact 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.190
 that these modes are going to have greater 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.740
 difficulty killing because you will be 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.210
 better protected are going to have for example 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.800
 enchanted armor and they will be more 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.870
 smart in terms of intelligence 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.730
 artificially that is to say they will see you with greater 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.440
 easily they will attack you from closer 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.950
 well now the secrets you are already 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.870
 they shoot quite well they give you with 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.340
 quite certain but surely with 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.900
 this change that is raising in the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.150
 mont the skeletons are going to be even worse 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.979
 from now, so I guess what 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.450
 worse with the skeletons I think but 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.860
 as you see guys this change what the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.510
 original difficulty is basically that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.369
 the longer you spend in an area 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.930
 the most difficult are the mods that 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.970
 appear and an area that is not very 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.860
 traveled by you because it will appear in mode 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.540
 normal and current will not be so difficult 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.130
 as the busiest areas do not know if 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.810
 I explain myself and well I'm fine in the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.010
 change that you have thought of the world to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.479
 I liked it a lot because this 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.160
 increases survival within the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.260
 game because that way we'll have to pitt 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.640
 equip us in the protection here 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.480
 we'll have to get away pretty well 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.560
 to avoid evils and good I hope that you 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.930
 liked you already know in the description of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.760
 Jarque also explained published yesterday day 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.989
 Wednesday as forgetfulness is always 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.370
 pretty important stockings spoiler 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.840
 I protect the description and good as 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.129
 came in down here that this appears 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.599
 of the regional difficulty between more 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.040
 time passes is a more difficult area of 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.780
 between less time pass is one more area 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.340
 ease to play me has 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.019
 delighted to really comment here 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.700
 Come on it seems it was more guys but that I 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.209
 Like you already know like it's favorites and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.209
 see you in the next video to another 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.209
 goodbye
