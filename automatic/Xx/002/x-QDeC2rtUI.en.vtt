00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.040
 equal to boys and girls I'm blonde here 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.880
 I am with all of you again 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.690
 Welcome to your competed 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:16.490
 minecraft we are in a new trick for 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.570
 version 1.8 point 4 that was supposed 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.680
 that they had fixed with this patch that 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.900
 has left a week ago 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.680
 approximately and is the trick of 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.960
 duplicate any object in the game what 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.809
 more interesting is that we can duplicate 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.429
 without any problem blocks of 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.859
 diamond that is what surely 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:39.199
 wants to duplicate almost all of you there 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.719
 what to say guys that this trick is yes 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.249
 it's a bit easier even than the 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.219
 previous version that was running 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.659
 until 1.83 which you have below in 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.789
 the description in case you want a 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.159
 more exhaustive explanation of this trick 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.510
 or see the first part of this trick and 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.499
 you know if you guys that are new to you 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.999
 you can subscribe not to get lost 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:57.739
 no update of this kind of 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.420
 tricks then you give it down to the 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.300
 hand up and all that subscribe for 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.680
 what 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.239
 and we go with the boy trick we were the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.000
 trick of duplicating the diamonds that is 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.740
 simple it is a party to 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.630
 better does not come to the first therefore 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.940
 the best one struck a cut of agreement because 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.290
 you have to break a chest like the 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.580
 again so what we need 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.200
 good guys I've put this on 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.000
 obesity so that I do not break all the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.409
 world I've put this pillar here for 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.970
 be able to protect myself a little bit from the 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.290
 explosions see below 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.610
 Okay a chest here and this one 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.200
 dynamite here agree that is 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.460
 stopped we put it here it's worth this no 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.770
 We put it on because I had no more 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.660
 dynamite let dynamite forgive more than 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.369
 this more obsidian but good and 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.560
 we need the object that we go to 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.509
 duplicate in this position it's worth the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.940
 number one position according that 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.280
 position number one and then do it 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.800
 with the rock for example to make the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.960
 example and we give the 1 of good agreement 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.850
 where you have assigned where you have 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.470
 assigned in the inventory the first 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.880
 hollow the inventory and leave the mouse 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.679
 in any position you are worth leaving the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 mouse me that I know for example here gives 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.640
 even if it is here or if it is here the thing is 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.039
 that this moves very fast very fast 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.270
 very fast between the chest and your 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.290
 inventory of agreement must be done 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.850
 very fast 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.580
 I'm going to do it now with the block 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.020
 diamond according to send this block 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.840
 we apply with the mouse from scratch guys is 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.970
 very very very simple you have to give it to 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.230
 the lighter here agree and break the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.590
 confer while we do what I finish 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.420
 to explain 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.160
 It does a little bit like I say there's 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.810
 often leaving us no block 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.610
 it is usually lost if it does not go to the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.120
 first so let's try let's go to 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.120
 see if we put ourselves here this we remove 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.070
 so that it does not bother us and we give it 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.500
 has not left us has not lost the block 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.240
 how are you seeing how much did you recover? 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.800
 it usually stays around here floating and 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.420
 well we can try again all 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.070
 As many times as necessary, there are times 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.450
 it takes a little longer in fact 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.550
 it takes a little longer to do this 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.680
 first step that in the one that in the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.780
 version to have the 1831 82 and 181 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.709
 ok but but the same goes 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.709
 block has left me behind 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.890
 good guys let's see if I get the 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.720
 third the fourth good thing is that 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.060
 I will put the stick a small cut 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.770
 so you can see and not have to do with 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.180
 the process of how I do not agree 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.319
 so come so much once more to see if 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.719
 I leave all and if not then I hope 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.760
 ok it has not come out so well then what 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.379
 resumed the video when I have this 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.760
 first step and so I tell you what is the 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.920
 second step and much easier than the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.150
 previous because in the previous version 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.680
 you had to use that circuit and everything 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.139
 that is not necessary anymore, so it's worth 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.000
 let's keep trying it's worth it what 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.069
 we have guys we have the block with the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.829
 zero as you are seeing we have in the 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.239
 hand a block with a zero here good 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.870
 we taught it not taught it but 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.430
 I'm in version 1.8 points 4 worth what 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.930
 gray up there in agreement is not the bread 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.849
 and I do not have anything antonio active there is neither 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.319
 nothing so if you see put simply 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:48.030
 it was an 8.4 the numbers and well the 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.980
 first part of the trick we have here 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.449
 the block with zero in the previous 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.209
 version of the trick had to open a 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:56.250
 dispenser and put the block but that 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.349
 it does not work anymore so it's much more 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.389
 simple that all that simply 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.310
 we open the inventory we take this 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.139
 block and with right click as if what 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.650
 we were to release fixes fixed to 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.969
 minus 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 totana at minute two 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.340
 diamond blocks that we can 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:14.040
 get with the zero-worth block 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.139
 because they will not be lost in fact if not 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.250
 we put here we can give here here 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.989
 how it keeps growing 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.000
 ta ta ta ta with the right button that 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.620
 if we went to put value, they do not get lost 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.420
 they are not disappears they become infinite 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.360
 backward from agreements set less 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.740
 100 minus 200 minus 30 what you want 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.120
 so it was guys 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.820
 this is the boys trick if you liked 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.130
