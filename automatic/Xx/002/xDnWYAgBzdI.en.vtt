00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 fall soon arrived but already I 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.870
 done with force and proof of it is 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.420
 in the lowering of the thermometers if this 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.400
 sudden cold we add the changes of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.290
 temperature of entering and leaving in the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.049
 sites that yes cold that if heat the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.359
 The result is a cold, although the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.830
 catarro attack us our routine continues 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.720
 and we have to comply with our 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.119
 obligations such as going to work or 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.490
 school but in appear cold we go 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.529
 to be less beautiful because of that today 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.810
 thought about making a video of how to make up 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.059
 the four of us are little hands and a remedy 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.920
 Moisturizing the home to take good care 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.920
 area that is irritated by the cold 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.129
 The first thing we will do is prepare the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.230
 repair balm to apply it by the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.640
 area that suffers most from the cold that 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.590
 It's the nose 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.469
 for the natural balm we have to 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.320
 Mix half a tablespoon of Vaseline with 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.360
 aloe vera natural medium vaseline 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.850
 It has protective properties and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.129
 moisturizers and aloe vera is the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.329
 natural element with more capacity 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.000
 repairmen 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.310
 putting them together we will get a balm that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.430
 will help us both repair and hydrate 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.409
 how to protect the area the balm that 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.780
 we have prepared what we apply for the area 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.310
 irritated and let it work for a few 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.310
 minutes to be absorbed 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.570
 once prepared the balm we go with 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.250
 the makeup this will be different from the one 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.229
 we use normally because what 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.420
 we have to do is disguise the areas 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.780
 most affected by the cold that are 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.440
 those of the nose and eyes for the rest 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.690
 Of the face 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.120
 we take our moisturizer 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.970
 habitual 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.010
 with concealer to conceal 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.500
 we have redness of the area of ​​the nose 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.960
 we will apply it generously for this 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.530
 zone and we will start them by tapping 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.540
 soft of course we will also apply 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.540
 the concealer in the area of ​​dark circles 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.730
 then we go to the base of 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.950
 makeup always remember the tone of 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.230
 our skin and we throw it all over the 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.650
 face and neck so that it remains 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.650
 natural 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.310
 let's fix the makeup by applying 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.010
 the colored powders by the protrusions of 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.090
 the face and we will give a touch of light with the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.090
 pink blusher 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.930
 for the eyes we will shine our 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.690
 look with the illuminator we will apply it 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.910
 for the tear a little because of dark circles and 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.090
 just below the eyebrow to give more 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.090
 depth 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.170
 just as with the corrector what 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.840
 we will apply soft touch 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.250
 on the skin I will not use stripe 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.070
 nor eyeliner because when we are 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.260
 colds the eyes are more watery and 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.330
 you can smudge we go with the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.190
 shadows you can choose the shadows that 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.280
 more you like for the day I prefer 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.500
 by earth tones we will apply first 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.010
 the white with shine from the lacrimal 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.800
 up before the middle of the eye and 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.480
 then with the brown tone we will go from 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.490
 the part where the target ended 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.430
 until the end blurs with 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.320
 little touches to open our eyes 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.550
 we will take off the mascara with 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.550
 Be careful not to overdo 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.650
 finally we will apply the lipstick 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.160
 with which we will be able to give more focus to 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.160
 our makeup 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.460
 I hope the cold does not attack 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.870
 your lives but if so, already 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.610
 we have some tricks for 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.910

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.390
 Remember drink plenty of water cherish 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.760
 a lot of orange juice and that's how we're like 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.640
