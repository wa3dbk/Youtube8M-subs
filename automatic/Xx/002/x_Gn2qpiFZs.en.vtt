joint hooked up to it and we'll just
show<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> what<00:00:46.890> happens<00:00:47.190> inside<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.850> hub<00:00:48.059> as

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
show you what happens inside the hub as

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.790 
show you what happens inside the hub as
we<00:00:48.870> go<00:00:48.989> through<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> various<00:00:49.620> gears<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:51.800> show

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
we go through the various gears and show

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.200 
we go through the various gears and show
you<00:00:52.860> why<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.670> shifter<00:00:53.969> event<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.660> critical

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
you why the shifter event is so critical

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
you why the shifter event is so critical
all<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:59.570> here<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.960> three<00:01:01.859> shift

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
all right so here we have three shift

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
all right so here we have three shift
poles<00:01:03.170> you'll<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.619> action<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
poles you'll see them in action in a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.850 
poles you'll see them in action in a
minute<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.580> when<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> start<00:01:06.119> shifting<00:01:06.860> okay

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
minute here when I start shifting okay

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.830 
minute here when I start shifting okay
so<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:10.369> first<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.700> fifth<00:01:11.909> gear<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.600> shift

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so in the first and fifth gear the shift

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.070 
so in the first and fifth gear the shift
balls<00:01:13.140> are<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.560> fully<00:01:13.920> retracted<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.869> will

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
balls are all fully retracted this will

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.289 
balls are all fully retracted this will
all<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.350> explained<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.890> detail<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.640> video

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
all be explained in detail in the video

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.800 
all be explained in detail in the video
to<00:01:18.659> come<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:20.030> I'll<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.210> show<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:21.600> what

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
to come and I'll just show you now what

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.850 
to come and I'll just show you now what
happens<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.490> run<00:01:23.490> through<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> shifter

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
happens as we run through the shifter

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.340 
happens as we run through the shifter
alright<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.939> watch<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.479> Oder<00:01:27.689> Paul<00:01:28.110> as

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
alright so if you watch the Oder Paul as

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.550 
alright so if you watch the Oder Paul as
we<00:01:28.710> shift<00:01:28.860> first<00:01:29.340> gear<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.990> Oder<00:01:31.200> Paul

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we shift first gear the Oder Paul

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.819 
we shift first gear the Oder Paul
extends<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.200> what's<00:01:34.200> happening<00:01:34.590> there<00:01:34.799> is

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
extends and what's happening there is

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.249 
extends and what's happening there is
that<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.939> engages<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that it actually engages with the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.890 
that it actually engages with the
splines<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> inside<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.329> outer<00:01:39.570> Sun

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
splines on the inside of the outer Sun

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.179 
splines on the inside of the outer Sun
gear<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.380> couples<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.420> axle<00:01:43.189> alright

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
gear and couples it to the axle alright

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.429 
gear and couples it to the axle alright
as<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.490> shift<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.820> second<00:01:45.210> gear<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.990> first<00:01:46.229> gear

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
as we shift a second gear the first gear

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.830 
as we shift a second gear the first gear
paul<00:01:46.680> retracts<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.000> second<00:01:48.390> gear<00:01:48.540> Paul

misalignment of those if it's out of
adjustment<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:38.540> Paul<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:40.610> engages<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.269> Sun

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
adjustment the Paul that engages the Sun

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.910 
adjustment the Paul that engages the Sun
gear<00:02:42.040> will<00:02:43.040> not<00:02:43.220> be<00:02:43.549> fully<00:02:44.480> extended<00:02:45.019> so

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
gear will not be fully extended so

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.039 
gear will not be fully extended so
you'll<00:02:46.069> have<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.370> Paul<00:02:46.580> halfway<00:02:47.480> extended

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
you'll have the Paul halfway extended

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.140 
you'll have the Paul halfway extended
and<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.920> maybe<00:02:49.069> catching<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.819> lip<00:02:50.000> of

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
and just maybe catching on the lip of

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.839 
and just maybe catching on the lip of
the<00:02:50.299> spline<00:02:50.599> rather<00:02:51.530> than<00:02:51.830> fully<00:02:52.250> extended

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
the spline rather than fully extended

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.059 
the spline rather than fully extended
and<00:02:53.000> fully<00:02:53.450> seated<00:02:53.810> in<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.230> spline<00:02:54.500> itself

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.420 

alright<00:02:58.069> so<00:02:58.400> as<00:02:58.610> we<00:02:59.150> shift<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.510> fifth<00:02:59.780> gear

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
alright so as we shift to fifth gear

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.620 
alright so as we shift to fifth gear
remember<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.459> said<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:02.030> Falls<00:03:02.269> are<00:03:02.450> fully

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
remember I said that the Falls are fully

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.589 
remember I said that the Falls are fully
retracted<00:03:02.840> again<00:03:03.440> in<00:03:03.560> fifth<00:03:03.799> gear<00:03:04.450> all<00:03:05.450> right

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
retracted again in fifth gear all right

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.509 
retracted again in fifth gear all right
inside<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.260> driver<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:08.329> clutch<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:09.519> what

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
inside the driver is the clutch and what

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.370 
inside the driver is the clutch and what
happens<00:03:10.850> between<00:03:11.030> fourth<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.720> fifth<00:03:11.900> gear<00:03:12.170> is

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
happens between fourth and fifth gear is

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.729 
happens between fourth and fifth gear is
the<00:03:12.709> fourth<00:03:12.950> gear<00:03:13.190> Paul<00:03:13.459> retracts<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.739> the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
the fourth gear Paul retracts and the

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.180 
the fourth gear Paul retracts and the
clutch<00:03:17.290> moves<00:03:18.290> into<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.709> engaged<00:03:19.069> position

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
clutch moves into the engaged position

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.009 
clutch moves into the engaged position
so<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:20.060> engages<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.340> planetary<00:03:22.340> carrier

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
so that it engages the planetary carrier

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.190 
so that it engages the planetary carrier
alright<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:24.290> just<00:03:24.340> back<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.400> fourth<00:03:25.790> gear<00:03:26.200> all

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
alright so just back to fourth gear all

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.660 
alright so just back to fourth gear all
right<00:03:27.319> just<00:03:27.530> watch<00:03:27.650> carefully<00:03:27.920> inside<00:03:28.489> the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
right just watch carefully inside the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.750 
right just watch carefully inside the
driver<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.329> watches<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.170> clutch<00:03:31.160> advances

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
driver and watches the clutch advances

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.050 
driver and watches the clutch advances
so<00:03:32.420> once<00:03:32.630> again<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:34.459> Paul's<00:03:34.700> are<00:03:34.940> all

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
so once again the Paul's are all

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.840 
so once again the Paul's are all
retracted<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.870> we<00:03:36.829> repeat<00:03:37.160> repeat<00:03:37.760> the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
retracted and we repeat repeat the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.800 
retracted and we repeat repeat the
process<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.709> sixth<00:03:39.709> gear<00:03:40.420> all<00:03:41.420> right<00:03:41.569> the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
process in sixth gear all right the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.780 
process in sixth gear all right the
second<00:03:42.139> gear<00:03:42.290> Paul<00:03:42.500> extends<00:03:43.069> because<00:03:43.670> now

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
second gear Paul extends because now

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.140 
second gear Paul extends because now
we're<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.060> high<00:03:44.209> range<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:45.910> seventh<00:03:46.910> gear

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
we're in high range and seventh gear

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.910 
we're in high range and seventh gear
it's<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.600> third<00:03:47.810> gear<00:03:47.989> Paul<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.590> eighth

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
it's the third gear Paul and eighth

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:57.210 
it's the third gear Paul and eighth
gears<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.430> fourth<00:03:49.670> gear<00:03:49.819> Paul<00:03:54.730> all<00:03:55.730> right<00:03:55.790> so

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
gears the fourth gear Paul all right so

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.870 
gears the fourth gear Paul all right so
anyway<00:03:58.599> stay<00:03:59.599> tuned<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.370> very<00:04:01.370> shortly<00:04:01.670> I'll

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
anyway stay tuned and very shortly I'll

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.059 
anyway stay tuned and very shortly I'll
be<00:04:02.000> uploading<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.599> how<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.349> works<00:04:03.530> video<00:04:03.709> for

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
be uploading the how it works video for

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:12.580 
be uploading the how it works video for
the<00:04:04.160> complete<00:04:04.430> hub

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590
