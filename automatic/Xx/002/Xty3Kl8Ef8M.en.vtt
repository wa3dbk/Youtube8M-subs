00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
that would really show how much the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.010 
that would really show how much the
pallbearer<00:02:05.000> character<00:02:06.000> affected<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
pallbearer character affected the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.080 
pallbearer character affected the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
Undertaker and then you know they could

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.699 
Undertaker and then you know they could
do<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> same<00:02:09.420> thing<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:09.780> Kane<00:02:10.050> maybe<00:02:10.440> when

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
do the same thing with Kane maybe when

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.880
