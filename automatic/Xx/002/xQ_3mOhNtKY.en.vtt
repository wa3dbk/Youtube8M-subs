00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
hey Linda hi

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.810 
hey Linda hi
I<00:02:29.620> think<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.739> true<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.010> any<00:02:31.280> Terry<00:02:31.640> Malick

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
I think it's true that any Terry Malick

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.300 
I think it's true that any Terry Malick
film<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.810> an<00:02:33.080> event<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:33.560> this<00:02:33.709> one<00:02:33.920> even<00:02:34.130> more

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
film is an event but this one even more

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.340 
film is an event but this one even more
so<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.790> guess<00:02:35.090> because<00:02:35.330> it's<00:02:35.690> both<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.080> Terry

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
so I guess because it's both the Terry

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:50.050 
so I guess because it's both the Terry
Malick<00:02:36.620> film<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.190> it's<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.700> film

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:03:05.410 

you

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420
