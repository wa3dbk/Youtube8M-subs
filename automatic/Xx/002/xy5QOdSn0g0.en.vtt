show you how the hitch is installed

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.250 
show you how the hitch is installed
first<00:00:26.970> thing<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.269> need<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.930> go<00:00:28.170> ahead

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
first thing we need to do is go ahead

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.870 
first thing we need to do is go ahead
and<00:00:28.349> remove<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.769> muffler's<00:00:29.189> from<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> car

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
and remove the muffler's from the car

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880

well<00:00:30.240> bolt<00:00:30.480> these<00:00:30.660> fasteners<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.590> here

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
well bolt these fasteners here and here

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.979 
well bolt these fasteners here and here
then<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> slide<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.820> muffler<00:00:33.210> off<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
then we can slide the muffler off the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:51.729 
then we can slide the muffler off the
exhaust<00:00:34.230> brand<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> little<00:00:35.160> bit<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.579> can't

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.020 

it<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:52.860> slide<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.190> backwards<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.730> off<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it will slide it backwards and off to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.930 
it will slide it backwards and off to
hangar<00:00:54.589> the<00:00:55.589> passenger<00:00:55.980> side<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> done<00:00:56.460> go

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
hangar the passenger side is done go

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.920 
hangar the passenger side is done go
ahead<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.120> repeat<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> same<00:00:57.600> thing<00:00:57.780> on

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
ahead and repeat the same thing on

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:09.070 
ahead and repeat the same thing on
driver<00:00:58.199> side

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.240 

the<00:01:10.080> next<00:01:10.320> thing<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.920> these<00:01:11.100> heat

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
the next thing is is that these heat

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.250 
the next thing is is that these heat
shields<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.790> completely<00:01:12.240> removed<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.840> get

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
shields get completely removed and get

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.870 
shields get completely removed and get
replaced<00:01:13.620> by<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:13.860> hitch<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.460> all<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.760> do

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
replaced by the hitch so all we can do

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.560 
replaced by the hitch so all we can do
is<00:01:15.000> drill<00:01:15.300> up<00:01:15.390> these<00:01:15.570> rivets<00:01:20.420> repeat<00:01:21.420> for

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
is drill up these rivets repeat for

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.020 
is drill up these rivets repeat for
driver's<00:01:21.990> side<00:01:22.550> now<00:01:23.550> I've<00:01:23.670> got<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:23.940> ahead

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
driver's side now I've got to go ahead

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.790 
driver's side now I've got to go ahead
and<00:01:24.240> drill<00:01:24.360> an<00:01:24.480> access<00:01:24.870> hole<00:01:25.050> for<00:01:25.320> hardware

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
and drill an access hole for hardware

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.930 
and drill an access hole for hardware
because<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.370> to<00:01:26.430> run<00:01:26.550> our<00:01:26.580> hardware

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
because we have to run our hardware

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.180 
because we have to run our hardware
inside<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.480> frame<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.290> existing<00:01:28.710> holes<00:01:28.950> are

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
inside the frame the existing holes are

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.850 
inside the frame the existing holes are
too<00:01:29.730> small<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> install<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> hardware<00:01:31.350> we're

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
too small to install the hardware we're

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.630 
too small to install the hardware we're
going<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.250> interesting<00:01:32.550> eights

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
going to use the interesting eights

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.790 
going to use the interesting eights
drill<00:01:32.940> bit<00:01:33.120> to<00:01:33.150> drill<00:01:33.300> an<00:01:33.540> access<00:01:33.900> hole<00:01:34.080> now

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
drill bit to drill an access hole now

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.620 
drill bit to drill an access hole now
the<00:01:34.860> instructions<00:01:35.340> say<00:01:35.550> to<00:01:36.090> enlarge<00:01:36.300> this

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the instructions say to enlarge this

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.840 
the instructions say to enlarge this
hole<00:01:36.690> here<00:01:37.350> however<00:01:37.950> way<00:01:38.190> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.520> install

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
hole here however way you can install

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.370 
hole here however way you can install
the<00:01:38.970> hardware<00:01:39.300> but<00:01:39.870> I'd<00:01:39.930> rather<00:01:40.080> leave<00:01:40.350> it

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the hardware but I'd rather leave it

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.410 
the hardware but I'd rather leave it
alone<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.580> make<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> new<00:01:41.970> hole<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.300> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
alone and just make a new hole on the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.270 
alone and just make a new hole on the
end<00:01:42.450> now<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.290> hitch<00:01:43.470> has<00:01:43.619> lots<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.010> chance

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
end now it's so hitch has lots of chance

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:53.060 
end now it's so hitch has lots of chance
of<00:01:44.460> moving<00:01:45.000> around<00:01:51.800> all<00:01:52.800> right<00:01:52.860> before

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
of moving around all right before

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.830 
of moving around all right before
