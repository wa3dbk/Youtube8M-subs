game that really established the fact
that<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.969> know<00:00:15.000> starkillers<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> fugitive

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
that you know starkillers a fugitive

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.439 
that you know starkillers a fugitive
we're<00:00:16.590> building<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.880> same<00:00:18.060> engine

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
we're building this on the same engine

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.300 
we're building this on the same engine
that<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.960> use<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.230> force<00:00:19.830> at<00:00:19.949> least<00:00:20.100> one

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
that we use for force at least one

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.830 
that we use for force at least one
although<00:00:20.910> we've<00:00:21.090> upgraded<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.660> quite

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
although we've upgraded it quite

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.480 
although we've upgraded it quite
significantly<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.650> focused<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.460> know

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
changes the lighting and to the VFX the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.410 
changes the lighting and to the VFX the
number<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.310> units<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.060> screen

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
number of units we can have on screen

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.450 
number of units we can have on screen
but<00:00:27.630> again<00:00:28.140> we're<00:00:28.320> combining<00:00:28.529> three<00:00:29.130> very

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
but again we're combining three very

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.640 
but again we're combining three very
unique<00:00:29.760> technologies<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.840> order<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.410> simulate

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
unique technologies in order to simulate

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.799 
unique technologies in order to simulate
a<00:00:31.859> really<00:00:32.579> interactive<00:00:33.059> environment<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.780> we

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
a really interactive environment so we

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.389 
a really interactive environment so we
have<00:00:33.960> havoc<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.559> our<00:00:34.680> underlying<00:00:34.980> physics

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
have havoc as our underlying physics

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.280 
have havoc as our underlying physics
system<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.329> digital<00:00:36.510> molecular<00:00:37.050> matter

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
system we have digital molecular matter

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.869 
system we have digital molecular matter
which<00:00:37.649> allows<00:00:38.190> us<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.550> things<00:00:38.700> like

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
which allows us do things like

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.549 
which allows us do things like
shattering<00:00:39.420> glass<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.989> then<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.379> have

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
shattering glass and then we have

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.220 
shattering glass and then we have
euphoria<00:00:41.460> which<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.820> biomechanical<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
euphoria which is biomechanical a on and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.139 
euphoria which is biomechanical a on and
lets<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> fling<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> stormtroopers<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.030> we

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
lets you fling the stormtroopers like we

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.150 
lets you fling the stormtroopers like we
just<00:00:45.329> saw<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.660> exactly<00:00:46.110> right<00:00:46.500> there<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
just saw there exactly right there you

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.860 
just saw there exactly right there you
know<00:00:47.250> much<00:00:47.489> more<00:00:47.520> than<00:00:47.760> ragdolls<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.660> pretty

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
know much more than ragdolls it's pretty

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.840 
know much more than ragdolls it's pretty
fantastic<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.980> here<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.430> star

combos<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> number<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
combos and then a number of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.100 
combos and then a number of
stormtroopers<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:33.869> kind<00:01:34.079> of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
stormtroopers so you know kind of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.899 
stormtroopers so you know kind of
picking<00:01:34.470> how<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> attack<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.400> different

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
picking how you attack the different

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.460 
picking how you attack the different
enemies<00:01:36.180> will<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.360> very<00:01:36.630> important<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.290> for

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
enemies will be very important and for

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.469 
enemies will be very important and for
some<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.710> these<00:01:37.799> two<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.280> couldn't<00:01:39.180> help<00:01:39.329> but

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
some of these two I couldn't help but

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.569 
some of these two I couldn't help but
just<00:01:39.689> notice<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> odd<00:01:40.439> these<00:01:40.829> stormtroopers

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
just notice that odd these stormtroopers

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.550 
just notice that odd these stormtroopers
are<00:01:41.700> losing<00:01:42.030> limbs<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.380> one

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
are losing limbs they are so that's one

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.230 
are losing limbs they are so that's one
of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> other<00:01:43.860> upgrades<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.520> force<00:01:44.939> unleashed

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
of the other upgrades to force unleashed

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.149 
of the other upgrades to force unleashed
two<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.290> wanted<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.560> focus<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:47.009> how

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
two is we really wanted to focus on how

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.130 
two is we really wanted to focus on how
do<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.000> lightsaber<00:01:48.420> feel<00:01:48.780> more<00:01:48.990> like

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
do we make the lightsaber feel more like

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.690 
do we make the lightsaber feel more like
a<00:01:49.200> light<00:01:49.439> stable<00:01:49.799> we've<00:01:49.920> always<00:01:50.070> treated<00:01:50.579> it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
a light stable we've always treated it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.730 
a light stable we've always treated it
as<00:01:50.820> another<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.840> your<00:01:51.899> powers<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
as another one of your powers in the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.440 
as another one of your powers in the
force<00:01:52.950> unleashed<00:01:53.130> its<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:53.939> important<00:01:54.329> as

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
force unleashed its just as important as

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
force unleashed its just as important as
lightning<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.140> enforced<00:01:55.890> grip<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.280> force

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
lightning and enforced grip or force

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.880 
lightning and enforced grip or force
repulsed<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.780> wanted<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.170> enhance<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
repulsed but we wanted to enhance it

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.859 
repulsed but we wanted to enhance it
even<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.460> again<00:01:59.700> redesign<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> combo

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
even more so again redesign the combo

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.179 
even more so again redesign the combo
system<00:02:01.079> from<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.409> ground<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.920> take

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
system from the ground up to take

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.050 
system from the ground up to take
advantage<00:02:02.490> of

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
advantage of

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.940 
advantage of
the<00:02:03.240> dual<00:02:03.450> wield<00:02:03.720> but<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.409> also<00:02:04.560> added<00:02:04.799> some

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
Dean lemming to make it feel more like a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.510 
Dean lemming to make it feel more like a
lightsaber<00:02:09.920> always<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> good<00:02:11.099> time<00:02:11.250> when<00:02:11.310> you

other things we focus really heavily on

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.979 
other things we focus really heavily on

two so a little bit more exploration
some<00:02:32.340> more<00:02:32.489> using<00:02:33.180> your<00:02:33.269> force<00:02:33.480> powers<00:02:33.840> for

I<00:03:19.590> did<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.400> just<00:03:20.549> see<00:03:20.700> someone<00:03:21.060> jetpack<00:03:21.840> trooper

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
I did I just see someone jetpack trooper

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.270 
I did I just see someone jetpack trooper
go<00:03:22.260> squirreling<00:03:22.769> off<00:03:22.859> into<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.160> distance

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
go squirreling off into the distance

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.039 
go squirreling off into the distance
that's<00:03:23.670> right<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.569> know<00:03:24.660> we<00:03:24.750> had<00:03:24.870> about<00:03:24.989> a

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
that's right so you know we had about a

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.720 
that's right so you know we had about a
hundred<00:03:25.109> enemies<00:03:25.620> enforcing<00:03:26.130> least<00:03:26.310> one<00:03:26.519> and

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
hundred enemies enforcing least one and

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.099 
hundred enemies enforcing least one and
as<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:26.850> result<00:03:27.030> some<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.540> them<00:03:27.630> felt<00:03:27.870> kind<00:03:28.049> of

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
as a result some of them felt kind of

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.930 
as a result some of them felt kind of
generic<00:03:28.440> or<00:03:28.709> vanilla<00:03:28.950> we've<00:03:29.489> gone<00:03:29.670> down<00:03:29.819> to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
generic or vanilla we've gone down to

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.430 
generic or vanilla we've gone down to
about<00:03:30.030> 25<00:03:30.510> enemies<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.049> they're<00:03:31.200> all

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
about 25 enemies but they're all

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.530 
about 25 enemies but they're all
handcrafted<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.819> be<00:03:32.910> very<00:03:33.090> tactically

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
handcrafted to be very tactically

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.300 
handcrafted to be very tactically
significant<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.380> jump<00:03:34.650> trooper<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.130> one

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
significant and the jump trooper is one

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.710 
significant and the jump trooper is one
that<00:03:35.430> we<00:03:35.489> brought<00:03:35.670> back<00:03:35.910> from<00:03:36.090> force<00:03:36.359> on<00:03:36.540> least

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
that we brought back from force on least

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.699 
that we brought back from force on least
one<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.530> we've<00:03:37.680> completely<00:03:38.040> reinvigorated

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
one but we've completely reinvigorated

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.590 
one but we've completely reinvigorated
added<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:41.220> susceptibility<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:42.239> lightning

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
added that susceptibility to lightning

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.120 
added that susceptibility to lightning
which<00:03:42.780> was<00:03:42.930> there<00:03:43.079> in<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.230> first<00:03:43.470> game<00:03:43.620> we've

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
which was there in the first game we've

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.470 
which was there in the first game we've
really<00:03:44.400> again<00:03:44.609> amped<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:44.940> up<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.180> made<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.450> a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
really again amped it up and made it a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.270 
really again amped it up and made it a
more<00:03:45.989> significant<00:03:46.530> part<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.799> fighting<00:03:47.130> those

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
more significant part of fighting those

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.670 
more significant part of fighting those
guys<00:03:47.540> ampton<00:03:48.540> up<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.780> like<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.170> phrase<00:03:49.410> now<00:03:49.620> it

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
guys ampton up I like that phrase now it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.349 
guys ampton up I like that phrase now it
looks<00:03:49.829> like<00:03:49.950> tactical<00:03:50.730> significance<00:03:51.269> is

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
looks like tactical significance is

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.030 
looks like tactical significance is
coming<00:03:51.569> into<00:03:51.660> play<00:03:51.810> here<00:03:51.900> yeah<00:03:52.650> what<00:03:52.889> just

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
happened so this is our carbon I war

your distance from him he's got a shield
that<00:04:03.510> allows<00:04:03.840> them<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.109> resist<00:04:04.910> various<00:04:05.910> force

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
that allows them to resist various force

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.340 
that allows them to resist various force
powers<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.720> some<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.900> your<00:04:06.989> lightsaber

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
powers and some of your lightsaber

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.530

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
attacks let any of it anymore well right

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.059 
attacks let any of it anymore well right
because<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.870> use<00:04:10.019> force<00:04:10.260> grip<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.650> rip<00:04:10.829> it<00:04:10.950> off

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
because you use force grip to rip it off

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.059 
because you use force grip to rip it off
and<00:04:11.099> then<00:04:11.400> damage<00:04:11.760> him

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
and then damage him

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.130 
and then damage him
now<00:04:12.189> we<00:04:12.730> can<00:04:12.879> actually<00:04:13.060> go<00:04:13.359> in<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:13.599> start

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
now we can actually go in and start

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.319 
now we can actually go in and start
using<00:04:14.379> lightsaber<00:04:14.920> throw<00:04:15.249> and<00:04:15.519> lightning<00:04:15.939> to

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
using lightsaber throw and lightning to

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.580 
using lightsaber throw and lightning to
start<00:04:16.539> doing<00:04:16.780> damage<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.139> him<00:04:17.380> but<00:04:17.500> you're

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
start doing damage to him but you're

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.449 
start doing damage to him but you're
still<00:04:17.739> going<00:04:17.829> to<00:04:17.979> want<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.160> keep<00:04:18.310> your

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
still going to want to keep your

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.279 
still going to want to keep your
distance<00:04:18.639> because<00:04:19.060> ultimately<00:04:19.359> be<00:04:20.079> it<00:04:20.169> too

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
distance because ultimately be it too

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.509 
distance because ultimately be it too
close<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.709> can<00:04:20.859> freeze<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.310> with<00:04:21.430> that

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
close you can freeze you with that

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
exactly right so what we saw there was a

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.120 
exactly right so what we saw there was a
ton<00:05:36.789> of<00:05:36.820> jumping<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.479> forced<00:05:37.720> push<00:05:37.960> for<00:05:38.830> stash

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
ton of jumping and forced push for stash

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.680 
ton of jumping and forced push for stash
and<00:05:39.460> later<00:05:39.669> levels<00:05:39.970> you'll<00:05:40.270> need<00:05:40.389> to<00:05:40.479> fight

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
and later levels you'll need to fight

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.450 
and later levels you'll need to fight
enemies<00:05:40.900> along<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.440> way<00:05:41.560> as<00:05:41.800> well<00:05:42.009> they'll

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
enemies along the way as well they'll

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.089 
enemies along the way as well they'll
get<00:05:42.580> into<00:05:42.759> your<00:05:43.060> into<00:05:43.690> your<00:05:43.720> path<00:05:43.960> so<00:05:44.320> and<00:05:44.979> it

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
get into your into your path so and it

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.980 
get into your into your path so and it
again<00:05:45.550> really<00:05:45.759> emphasizes<00:05:46.570> that<00:05:46.630> fact<00:05:46.930> that

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
again really emphasizes that fact that

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.659 
again really emphasizes that fact that
he's<00:05:47.139> a<00:05:47.169> fugitive<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:47.860> then<00:05:48.190> amps<00:05:48.520> up<00:05:48.639> the

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
he's a fugitive and then amps up the

he's a fugitive and then amps up the
intensity<00:05:49.169> you<00:05:50.169> know<00:05:50.259> for<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.500> period<00:05:50.740> of<00:05:50.889> time

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:52.740 
intensity you know for a period of time
which<00:05:51.580> goes<00:05:51.789> back<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.120> that<00:05:52.240> that<00:05:52.449> point<00:05:52.659> of

which goes back to that that point of

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.839 
which goes back to that that point of
pacing<00:05:53.139> the<00:05:53.259> game<00:05:53.409> so<00:05:54.159> here<00:05:54.310> we<00:05:54.400> are<00:05:54.460> using<00:05:54.550> for
