00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:20.210 

empty<00:00:10.080> living<00:00:11.080> Stoney<00:00:12.660> there's<00:00:13.660> fire<00:00:14.050> mouth

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.830 

like<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.270> got<00:00:21.870> a<00:00:21.900> red<00:00:22.110> terror<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.680> here<00:00:22.860> too

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.640 

there's<00:00:27.840> pretty<00:00:28.110> much<00:00:28.170> my<00:00:28.470> tank<00:00:28.770> I<00:00:30.560> don't<00:00:31.560> know

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
there's pretty much my tank I don't know

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.760 
there's pretty much my tank I don't know
if<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:32.510> 30<00:00:33.510> gallons<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.320> too<00:00:34.500> small

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
if like 30 gallons I know is too small

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.370 
if like 30 gallons I know is too small
for<00:00:34.830> the<00:00:35.190> tiger<00:00:35.430> Oscar<00:00:35.790> eventually<00:00:36.450> give<00:00:37.200> him

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
for the tiger Oscar eventually give him

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.490 
for the tiger Oscar eventually give him
away<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.860> because<00:00:38.870> I'm<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> military

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
away just because I'm in the military

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.560 
away just because I'm in the military
and<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.340> dorms<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.940> can't<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.330> anything

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and the dorms and I can't have anything

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.660 
and the dorms and I can't have anything
bigger<00:00:42.930> than<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:44.100> I've<00:00:44.280> always<00:00:44.430> wanted

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
bigger than this but I've always wanted

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.299 
bigger than this but I've always wanted
a<00:00:44.820> tiger<00:00:45.120> Oscar<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:45.720> I<00:00:45.989> know<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.559> once

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
a tiger Oscar but I know that it's once

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.530 
a tiger Oscar but I know that it's once
it<00:00:47.400> gets<00:00:47.550> big<00:00:47.700> enough<00:00:47.790> only<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.120> take<00:00:48.300> them<00:00:48.450> out

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
it gets big enough only to take them out

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.960 
it gets big enough only to take them out
of<00:00:48.660> there<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.989> I'll<00:00:49.170> probably<00:00:49.379> keep<00:00:49.970> the

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
of there but I'll probably keep the

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.149 
of there but I'll probably keep the
living<00:00:51.270> story<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.780> fire<00:00:51.989> mouth<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.589> bed

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
living story the fire mouth and the bed

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.070 
living story the fire mouth and the bed
tear<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.699> Jack<00:00:53.940> Dempsey<00:00:54.420> I'll<00:00:54.690> probably<00:00:54.900> get

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
tear the Jack Dempsey I'll probably get

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.500 
tear the Jack Dempsey I'll probably get
rid<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> too<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.159> know<00:00:57.030> he'll<00:00:57.360> get

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
rid of too because I know he'll get

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
rid of too because I know he'll get
probably<00:00:57.839> get<00:00:58.019> pretty<00:00:58.170> big<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.800> I'll<00:00:58.920> keep

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
probably get pretty big but I'll keep

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.200 
probably get pretty big but I'll keep
him<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> time<00:00:59.670> being<00:00:59.940> now<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:02.089> think<00:01:03.089> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
him for the time being now I think the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.170 
him for the time being now I think the
red<00:01:03.360> tears<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:04.370> don't<00:01:05.370> know<00:01:05.550> where<00:01:05.729> he's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
red tears I don't know where he's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.550 
red tears I don't know where he's
probably<00:01:06.510> under<00:01:06.630> those<00:01:06.750> rocks<00:01:07.050> or<00:01:07.260> something

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.620

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.570 

mean<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.810> didn't<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.710> don't<00:01:17.430> know

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
mean if they didn't think I don't know

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
mean if they didn't think I don't know
if<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.909> lot<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> clutter<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.600> better<00:01:18.920> yeah

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
if like a lot of clutter is better yeah

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.120 
if like a lot of clutter is better yeah

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I put rocks and to raise the pH level

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.280 
I put rocks and to raise the pH level
and<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:23.460> uh<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.909> put<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.660> wood<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.080> just

anything he's never done that before I

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.660 
anything he's never done that before I
keep<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.260> pretty<00:02:25.410> clean<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.890> know<00:02:26.040> let<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.490> looks

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
keep it pretty clean I know let it looks

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.510 
keep it pretty clean I know let it looks
dirty<00:02:26.880> right<00:02:27.120> now<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:29.040> actually<00:02:29.160> kind<00:02:29.490> of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
dirty right now it's actually kind of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.630 
dirty right now it's actually kind of
hard<00:02:29.700> keeping<00:02:30.270> hands<00:02:30.720> clean<00:02:31.490> this<00:02:32.490> is

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
hard keeping hands clean this is

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.430 
hard keeping hands clean this is
actually<00:02:33.030> after<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> vacuum<00:02:33.840> didn't<00:02:34.170> probably

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
actually after a vacuum didn't probably

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.010 
actually after a vacuum didn't probably
did<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> 30%<00:02:35.760> water<00:02:36.030> change<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:39.840> seems

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
did a 30% water change so it just seems

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.500 
did a 30% water change so it just seems
