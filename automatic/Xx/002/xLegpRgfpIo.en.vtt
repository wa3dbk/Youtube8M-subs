00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.490
 mechanical ventilation with heat recovery unit series rc cars 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.870
 we spend more than 70% of our time within 4 hours 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.199
 therefore it becomes fundamental to pay attention to the quality of the world in 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.199
 we live in 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.589
 controlled mechanical ventilation provides for the exchange of air in winter 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.729
 that in summer without the need to open the windows 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.560
 this system ensures high energy savings 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.470
 eliminating heat dispersion 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.820
 mtv tell me to bellaria 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.110
 it also guarantees flawed tooth extractions and bad smells by pressing the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.569
 illnesses 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:43.569
 from cooling 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.290
 the air is extracted from the premises mediatel the jets of located extractions 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.290
 in visible pipes or placed inside the numbers 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.030
 dead in the central collector where the submission process 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.659
 via atom feed of 36 51 before the entrance to the school desk 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.580
 subsequently the air is conveyed heat recovery activity 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.170
 constituted by an exchange as discharge with two watercraft capable of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.000
 create the two separate things 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.330
 indoor air after giving up its hot temperature in winter price list 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.090
 summer the managers were also conditioned a chimney in place outside 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.090
 building 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.820
 at the same time, fresh gall bladder air is fed in and further pizzerias 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.600
 cellini average efficiency in class c 4 positioned at the entrance of the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 static exchanger 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.100
 the operating principle is based on a dingo airflow intersection 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.030
 the first is the extraction of stale indoor air while the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.100
 second is made up of fresh air taken from the stars 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.340
 unlike temperature it creates condensation which facilitates heat exchange 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.710
 p2p output 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.590
 guaranteeing minimum returns of 50% up to a maximum of 90% 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:18.319
 aspirnova 2000 has provided filtering modules in class f6 f7 night for everyone 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.670
 rigid keys with efficiency up to 95% 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.770
 housed in boxers the easily inspected conferring listen for 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.239
 the maintenance 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.389
 with the new 2000 rch via spin series ventilation system 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.879
 the building adapts to the modern criteria of tomorrow also meet the standards of 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:36.540
 construction 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.580
 with energy certification of buildings in the class to ventilation 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.550
 mechanics controlled by an important contribution to the maintenance of 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.550
 to increase the value of the building in which it is installed 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.829
 a remarkable living comfort
