00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
one plane 1 dimensional planes you know

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.630 
one plane 1 dimensional planes you know
now<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.769> means<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.279> put<00:00:32.430> one

itself and I can cut I can cut a
straight<00:01:13.020> line<00:01:13.700> basically<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.820> any<00:01:15.390> direction

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
straight line basically in any direction

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.749 
straight line basically in any direction
I<00:01:16.170> want<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> cut<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> straight<00:01:16.860> line<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.310> you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
I want to cut a straight line in you

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.550 
I want to cut a straight line in you
know<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> by<00:01:18.180> modifying<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.930> shape<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.439> can

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
know and by modifying this shape I can

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.219 
know and by modifying this shape I can
do<00:01:19.950> multiple<00:01:20.880> multiple<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.659> things<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.110> it

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
do multiple multiple more things with it

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.950 
do multiple multiple more things with it
so<00:01:22.850> typically<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.090> you're<00:01:24.180> cutting<00:01:24.360> tapers

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.330 

they<00:01:27.960> ever<00:01:28.110> take<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:29.130> an

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
they ever take like this or an

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.160 
they ever take like this or an
adjustable<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.150> one's<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.540> adjustable

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
adjustable one this one's not adjustable

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.310 
adjustable one this one's not adjustable
and<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:32.040> limited<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.909> how<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.930> jig<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
and you are limited to how this jig is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.230 
and you are limited to how this jig is
set<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.100> want<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> cut<00:01:35.520> four<00:01:35.790> tapers

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
set up if you want to cut four tapers

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
set up if you want to cut four tapers
you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.570> cut<00:01:36.750> two<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> flat<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:37.770> you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
you can cut two on a flat and then you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.219 
you can cut two on a flat and then you
have<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.220> modify<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.540> make<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.049> work<00:01:40.200> for

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
have to modify it to make it work for

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.380 
have to modify it to make it work for
four<00:01:40.619> sides<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:43.430> with<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> jig<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.210> you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
four sides so with a jig like this you

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.389 
four sides so with a jig like this you
don't<00:01:45.600> need<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.409> simply<00:01:46.439> find

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
don't need to do that you simply find

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.609 
don't need to do that you simply find
your<00:01:47.579> center<00:01:47.820> point<00:01:48.030> measure<00:01:48.899> down<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
your center point measure down the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.990 
your center point measure down the
distance<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.100> your<00:01:50.280> center<00:01:50.520> point<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> where

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
distance from your center point to where

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.600
