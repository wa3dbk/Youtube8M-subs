brief periods of time to do missions and
things<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:36.720> has<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.930> take<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> off<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.040> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
things and then has to take it off so it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.710 
things and then has to take it off so it
doesn't<00:01:38.130> influence<00:01:38.549> him<00:01:38.880> yeah

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
