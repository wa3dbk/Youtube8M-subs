one
then<00:05:07.620> couldn't<00:05:08.690> so<00:05:09.690> after<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:09.960> I'm<00:05:10.170> going<00:05:10.440> to

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
then couldn't so after that I'm going to

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.920 
then couldn't so after that I'm going to
cover<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:11.100> again<00:05:11.520> with<00:05:11.910> this<00:05:12.120> wet<00:05:12.390> cloth<00:05:12.720> and

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
you can see that I have kept this pace

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.650 
you can see that I have kept this pace
because<00:05:16.200> after<00:05:17.130> a<00:05:17.160> few<00:05:17.730> minutes<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:18.480> will

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
because after a few minutes it will

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.610 
because after a few minutes it will
increase<00:05:19.200> again<00:05:19.490> so<00:05:20.490> just<00:05:20.730> cover<00:05:20.970> it<00:05:21.240> and

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
increase again so just cover it and

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
increase again so just cover it and
again<00:05:22.620> leave<00:05:22.770> it<00:05:22.980> for<00:05:23.730> another<00:05:24.000> half<00:05:24.750> an<00:05:24.780> hour

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
again leave it for another half an hour

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.260 
again leave it for another half an hour

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
so occur around 30 minutes you can see

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.000 
so occur around 30 minutes you can see
that<00:05:31.160> they<00:05:32.160> rose<00:05:32.850> and<00:05:33.240> also<00:05:34.230> now<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:34.410> already
