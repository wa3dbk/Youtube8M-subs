wondering if they could still wear these

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.680 
wondering if they could still wear these
looks<00:00:11.429> even<00:00:11.790> if<00:00:11.880> they're<00:00:12.059> not<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.389> grade

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
looks even if they're not in that grade

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.720 
looks even if they're not in that grade
and<00:00:12.900> absolutely<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.769> do<00:00:14.130> not<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.610> be

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
and absolutely you do not have to be

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.580 
and absolutely you do not have to be
that<00:00:14.940> age<00:00:15.120> if<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.809> want<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.049> rock<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.379> look

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
that age if you want to rock this look

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.320 
that age if you want to rock this look
go<00:00:16.890> ahead<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.340> wear<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.550> because<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.180> is

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
go ahead and wear it because this is

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.700 
go ahead and wear it because this is
just<00:00:18.449> personally<00:00:18.900> what<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.289> learn<00:00:19.500> these

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
just personally what I learn these

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.439 
just personally what I learn these
grades<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.430> think<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:20.970> kind<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.270> like

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
grades so I think it's kind of like

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.540 
grades so I think it's kind of like
age-appropriate<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.560> if<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.189> want<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> wear

age-appropriate but if you want to wear

age-appropriate but if you want to wear
