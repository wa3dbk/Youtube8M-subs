00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.700
 Nee important timing- 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.700
 It will be said that the Shizuoka degree will be reached 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.700

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.710
 1 t 2 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.710
 1 together 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.289
 It is the so called team 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.000
 How many matches 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.760
 1 to 0 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.920
 Even at zero 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:40.730
 I can win out so I can say that the flow is good 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:45.730
 Than to feel even looking at the atmosphere of the team feel even doing the game 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.540
 I do not try to be a team straight but as an individual 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.280
 I say I can not do it 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.690
 impression 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.190
 Those who are fighting for position now are better 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.190
 I have no feeling at all 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.450
 Oh dear 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.340
 As soon as why play is not good 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:09.600
 Practice daily with a sense of crisis that you will not be employees soon 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:14.240
 In I think I this opening game and wonder if by the good of being able to 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.130

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.130

 Goal of Nether 's soccer 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.630

 Well each one all attacked all defensive 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.840
 Well basic 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.550
 One person in Paso 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.560
 In soccer while taking a good position 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.190
 I soccer that will advance the game while holding the initiative 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.060
 I'm still in it 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.149
 In the attack surface 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.990
 Tari was to soothe the ball 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.560
 It has been asked to do that and will crucial to 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.560
 I feel 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.209

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:49.390
 t 4 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:54.520
 I heard my age is the most 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.210
 In that sense it is a generation that can not be taken over by the team 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.520
 I'm thinking 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.460
 Before 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.580
 And that kind of good stimulus and the movement of the players usually is I will be key 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.440
 I myself 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.470
 Employees want to receive more than properly 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.830

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.730
 If you win, you have a chance to go above Jubilo. 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.880
 The Nde I think that ride to flow Tteyuu 3-Year History b sensor Natick Deployment 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.540

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.370
 Welcome to Shizuoka 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.080
 Impression that say Naa was supposed to be 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.240
 5'll First It does deaf good defense but so is tomorrow 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.760
 I'm well done and not very concerned 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.950
 At first it is not to know 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.190
 When 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.600
 When still a little more powerful in attack does not come out 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.560
 After all people around me already 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.590
 A tough fight after 2 minutes in point difference 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.830
 Do we need Ika is subtracted after all in order to ease the Shun players 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.640
 In that sense 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.040
 I'm happy to go in 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.310
 It happens to be 3 points by chance 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.950
 It is to a certain powerful attack 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.770
 I'd expect most to me Mon countries dictionary 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.720
 Hmm 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.380
 Speaking of chance rice 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.720
 I can not get into such a position 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.450
 At first look back from there and change 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.389
 The important battle this weekend is 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:24.860
 As we think that one battle to tell the future of sos's position is 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.860
 As you are home, you have to win firmly and stack 3 points 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.919
 To be able to get on straight victory highway in this way 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.919
 I will do my best, so please give me a hot cheer 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.300
