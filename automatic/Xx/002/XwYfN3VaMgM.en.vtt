special<00:01:22.279> prizes<00:01:22.759> into<00:01:23.209> packs<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:23.779> you<00:01:24.229> opened

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:24.529 
special prizes into packs so you opened

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:25.779 
special prizes into packs so you opened
a<00:01:24.590> pack<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:24.979> have<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.159> chance<00:01:25.459> of<00:01:25.700> winning

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
a pack and you have a chance of winning

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.359 
a pack and you have a chance of winning
tickets<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.659> games<00:01:26.990> or<00:01:27.350> sign<00:01:27.619> shirts<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:28.130> think

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
tickets to games or sign shirts I think

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.429 
tickets to games or sign shirts I think
those<00:01:28.490> were<00:01:28.639> the<00:01:28.729> prices<00:01:28.939> that<00:01:29.299> are<00:01:29.329> out<00:01:30.200> last

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
those were the prices that are out last

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.809 
those were the prices that are out last
year<00:01:30.679> so<00:01:30.859> a<00:01:30.889> lot<00:01:31.099> of<00:01:31.130> people<00:01:31.219> thinking<00:01:31.700> is

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
year so a lot of people thinking is

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.429 
year so a lot of people thinking is
something<00:01:31.939> similar<00:01:32.389> to<00:01:32.539> that<00:01:32.659> maybe<00:01:33.349> a

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
something similar to that maybe a

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.319 
something similar to that maybe a
million<00:01:33.829> coins<00:01:34.219> being<00:01:34.549> put<00:01:34.759> into<00:01:34.909> certain

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
million coins being put into certain

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.059 
million coins being put into certain
packed<00:01:35.599> now<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:36.020> don't<00:01:36.439> really<00:01:36.590> understand<00:01:37.009> the

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
packed now I don't really understand the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.379 
packed now I don't really understand the
point<00:01:37.249> of<00:01:37.399> just<00:01:37.670> putting<00:01:37.789> a<00:01:37.939> million<00:01:38.209> coin

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:38.389 
point of just putting a million coin

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.239 
point of just putting a million coin
like<00:01:38.749> unlock<00:01:39.259> into<00:01:39.499> a<00:01:39.529> pack<00:01:39.770> because<00:01:39.979> you

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
like unlock into a pack because you

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:41.649 
like unlock into a pack because you
might<00:01:40.369> as<00:01:40.490> well<00:01:40.549> just<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.060> know<00:01:41.149> open<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.479> pack

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
might as well just you know open a pack

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.389 
might as well just you know open a pack
and<00:01:41.840> get<00:01:41.959> for<00:01:42.170> example<00:01:42.499> run<00:01:42.649> out<00:01:42.770> or<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:42.979> messy

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
and get for example run out or a messy

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.249 
and get for example run out or a messy
because<00:01:43.880> those<00:01:44.149> both<00:01:44.389> worth<00:01:44.689> over<00:01:45.049> a<00:01:45.079> million

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
because those both worth over a million

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.649 
because those both worth over a million
coins<00:01:45.590> but<00:01:45.889> and<00:01:46.189> there<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.209> go<00:01:47.389> there's

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
coins but and there you go there's

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.629 
coins but and there you go there's
another<00:01:47.929> another<00:01:48.709> idea<00:01:49.099> as<00:01:49.249> to<00:01:49.279> what<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.609> is

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:49.639 
another another idea as to what it is

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:51.639 
another another idea as to what it is
and<00:01:50.060> some<00:01:50.719> people<00:01:50.869> were<00:01:51.109> saying<00:01:51.319> that<00:01:51.529> it

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
and some people were saying that it

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.169 
and some people were saying that it
could<00:01:51.859> be<00:01:51.889> some<00:01:52.219> sort<00:01:52.369> of<00:01:52.459> tournament<00:01:52.969> maybe

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
could be some sort of tournament maybe

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.599 
could be some sort of tournament maybe
special<00:01:54.169> entry<00:01:54.499> requirements<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:55.340> have<00:01:55.369> to

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
special entry requirements you have to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.219 
special entry requirements you have to
have<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.759> cut<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.090> team<00:01:56.539> worth<00:01:56.749> over<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.079> million

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
have a cut a team worth over a million

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.899 
have a cut a team worth over a million
coins<00:01:57.529> not<00:01:57.770> really<00:01:57.979> sure<00:01:58.130> how<00:01:58.279> they<00:01:58.459> regulate

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
coins not really sure how they regulate

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.479 
coins not really sure how they regulate
that<00:01:59.319> maybe<00:02:00.319> some<00:02:00.709> people<00:02:01.009> are<00:02:01.130> saying<00:02:01.279> that

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:01.489 
that maybe some people are saying that

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.819 
that maybe some people are saying that
there'll<00:02:01.759> be<00:02:01.789> coin<00:02:02.539> boosts<00:02:02.989> on<00:02:03.169> matches<00:02:03.649> so

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
there'll be coin boosts on matches so

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.039 
there'll be coin boosts on matches so
you'll<00:02:03.979> get<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.219> bigger<00:02:04.759> multiplier<00:02:05.389> for<00:02:05.630> when

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
you'll get a bigger multiplier for when

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.629 
you'll get a bigger multiplier for when
you<00:02:06.139> play<00:02:06.319> a<00:02:06.349> game<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:06.859> get<00:02:07.069> more<00:02:07.219> coins<00:02:07.459> at

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:07.639 
you play a game so you get more coins at

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:09.340 
you play a game so you get more coins at
the<00:02:07.729> end<00:02:07.880> of<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.030> but<00:02:08.570> really<00:02:08.780> no

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
the end of it but really no

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.250 
the end of it but really no
really<00:02:09.740> knows<00:02:09.950> also<00:02:10.820> on<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:10.970> pack<00:02:11.330> front<00:02:11.660> the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
really knows also on that pack front the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.170 
really knows also on that pack front the
idea<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.920> million<00:02:13.370> coins<00:02:13.610> some<00:02:13.880> people

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
idea of the million coins some people

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.670 
idea of the million coins some people
are<00:02:14.300> saying<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.780> similar<00:02:15.230> thing<00:02:15.530> may

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
are saying that a similar thing may

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.290 
are saying that a similar thing may
happen<00:02:15.890> where<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.340> actually<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:17.120> get<00:02:17.270> a

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
happen where you actually you get a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.210 
happen where you actually you get a
token<00:02:17.780> where<00:02:17.930> you'll<00:02:18.050> put<00:02:18.260> into<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.590> draw<00:02:18.980> and

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
token where you'll put into a draw and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.730 
token where you'll put into a draw and
then<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.360> could<00:02:20.570> potentially<00:02:21.290> win<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.590> when

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
then you could potentially win it when

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.350 
then you could potentially win it when
EA<00:02:22.010> do<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.460> draw<00:02:22.670> or<00:02:22.880> something<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.300> that

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
EA do the draw or something like that

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.870 
EA do the draw or something like that
now<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.140> biggest<00:02:24.680> coincident<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.460> that

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
now the biggest coincident is that

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.300 
now the biggest coincident is that
actually<00:02:26.270> xbox<00:02:26.720> live<00:02:26.960> is<00:02:27.260> free<00:02:27.710> this<00:02:27.890> weekend

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
people playing fut as possible because

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.670 
people playing fut as possible because
it<00:02:38.240> is<00:02:38.360> their<00:02:38.570> main<00:02:38.720> moneymaker<00:02:39.260> throughout

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
it is their main moneymaker throughout

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.170 
it is their main moneymaker throughout
the<00:02:39.830> year<00:02:40.010> obviously<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:40.430> will<00:02:40.550> buy<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.760> game

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
the year obviously we will buy the game

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.060 
the year obviously we will buy the game
at<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.420> start<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.780> year<00:02:41.840> but<00:02:42.080> us<00:02:42.770> buying

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
at the start the year but us buying

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.770 
at the start the year but us buying
packs<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.610> just<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:43.910> continue<00:02:44.210> source<00:02:44.630> of

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
packs is just to continue source of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.030 
packs is just to continue source of
income<00:02:44.960> for<00:02:45.200> them<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:45.710> they're<00:02:45.860> probably

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
income for them so they're probably

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.910 
income for them so they're probably
trying<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.460> draw<00:02:47.300> people<00:02:47.330> into<00:02:47.900> fut<00:02:48.590> while

trying to draw people into fut while

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.800 
trying to draw people into fut while
xbox<00:02:49.400> live<00:02:49.580> is<00:02:49.760> free<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.180> running<00:02:50.510> some<00:02:50.690> sort

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
xbox live is free so running some sort

xbox live is free so running some sort
of<00:02:50.900> promotion<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.440> great<00:02:51.680> way<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.890> do<00:02:52.160> that

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
of promotion is a great way to do that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
so that's pretty much my thoughts on it

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.860 
so that's pretty much my thoughts on it
and<00:02:54.890> what<00:02:55.610> do<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.910> guys<00:02:56.090> think<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.510> really<00:02:56.750> are
