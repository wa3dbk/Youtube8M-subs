00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello nice that you want to watch today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.899
 I you all our country 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.340
 updo what show here 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.110
 easy is that you actually 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.480
 just need a few spruce pins 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.150
 have a piece or name at most five think 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.580
 me and he can fall very loosely so there 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.199
 may also come loose that does not matter 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.300
 please don't hold back because i am tall 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.529
 because you have an ideal for it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.180
 shoulder length 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.769
 really a lot shorter but a bit tricky 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.869
 it could be then you have something with it 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.330
 the purple ones need a little more pins 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.399
 that is also fine to do I still have now 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.950
 a remnant curl for history me hair 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.050
 and then you really see the difference between 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.450
 a cheap hair straightener or and set it 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.399
 from qi because no and you see it is this 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.899
 from yesterday and I would really just like that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.350
 can go out the door so that is 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.079
 ideal 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.149
 I definitely notice the difference between those 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.039
 or a cheap hair straightener 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.230
 because you take it once in your hair 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.120
 and there is just curl in it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.500
 there is shine on your hair and it shows 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.030
 sit down too 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.219
 What if I go to bed I do have 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.550
 I 'll just show you trick 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.309
 I take my hair very loosely 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.049
 then i pick it up so i turn it one 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.430
 I make sure I don't film 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.740
 her wife and warm from doing what i do 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.880
 here a pin in this and the cloister 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.830
 pin 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.530
 and then i go to sleep what the benefit 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.930
 that's why you lie on the side and on 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.479
 the back so all the hair we put on top 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.640
 so remains in the curl that way 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.020
 can last much longer with your curls 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.700
 you can imagine if you have the whole 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.280
 very light on night and it gets warm 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.150
 then those curls slowly go flat 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.979
 to become 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.110
 and in this way you look great 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.979
 release the next day and you can hit the street 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.540
 back to where we started it 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.189
 back up 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.020
 and we already do that for a while 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.630
 topside 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.869
 you pick up your hair and what you are going now 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.619
 doing is your doing and backside 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.750
 apply 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.759
 it doesn't have to be too much 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.700
 purely for that on top that it is 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.090
 bulbs and what I just got something 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.550
 starts if you yourself are shorter 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.140
 have hair or do very short low then 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.930
 apply a little more to care 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.909
 just for the firmness 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.909
 I continue to my cross 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.099
 a little up to here about when 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.310
 a pick and then we are ready there too 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.310
 with it 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:36.060
 This goes back to look at eight road you see 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.750
 You can already see that you have those coupons 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.170
 you are going to do 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:49.319
 you take your he here and this one 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 side the pluck and you gonna make it 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.530
 pretty closer and I would be like that 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.109
 just turn around for you to let go 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.810
 see what we are going to do we are going hair 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.579
 like sailing inward when you are 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.739
 shorter hair do you have slanted with 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.659
 a small if you needed I need this 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.579
 part of the tail is completely there 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.680
 in doing that also ensures immediately 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.299
 firmness so it's easy to wear 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.719
 a short hair is actually something 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:19.199
 easier what you do 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:22.470
 I have my hand in between and there 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:24.569
 see around it and I stuff this there 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.310
 just in between 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:33.379
 now you have a loop and that loop i go 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.379
 fasten with sliding pins 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.060
 catch one later and put it there too 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.880
 at 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.830
 You see then you have already done this to you 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.170
 now you do go look at the front 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.070
 and then you see for yourself where it 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.260
 release then you just pick up and that 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.580
 just fix it that doesn't matter 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.860
 how you do that 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.550
 because you're so right away it did 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.550
 still rolling back 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.360
 look to opt for when i'm tired because 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.520
 pick those here 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.790
 that I just put him in that loop 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.790
 stab 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.180
 on top this is going to come loose but find that 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.340
 I am very cool and I am healthy and that 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.590
 do a little more curling because 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.840
 there may therefore be a little looser than you 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.450
 further is a hair band me 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.010
 have a purple one in this case 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.140
 also great fun at h &amp; m 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.730
 headbands so you can look over there 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.950
 you have something whole for little money 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.210
 nice and now again to him too 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.830
 three but in action with free 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.760
 shipment so ideal what I do 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.760
 I put it in 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.610
 till here 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.230
 you just have to take care that one already 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.520
 her 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:03.920
 it is z what you do now 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.920
 puts him back a bit now 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.680
 now so now you have the bottom hair 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.810
 then you are actually going to participate 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.810
 as if you just fold it up 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.260
 active slut fixed again and I know that 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.860
 there is still a bit cluttered 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.389
 that you have something like it is something 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.190
 but that it absolutely was for me 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.350
 I also have to get used to it because I always do 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.490
 from the classic window and 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:50.650
 but this is of course quite a lot 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:59.710
 nice change what you are going to do now 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:06:01.510
 it may be something for what you see 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.400
 I just loose the top layer a bit 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.440
 withheld x price 'a bit of that and 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.120
 little curls withheld 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.740
 if you want to find that yourself then 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.020
 you can of course simply comb it smooth 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.760
 and then you wear it that classic 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.760
 I'll show him to you for a moment 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.690
 see you and as you have just seen 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.430
 are really only a few pins in it 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.039
 because you twist two loops from her 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.660
 one down and one up 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.570
 Then you see that you are very easy and fast 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.910
 ready i just chose the previous one 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.590
 the hair band in between doing that 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.060
 I like it better because your husband is the 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.979
 back does not only see from the front 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.599
 if you find that difficult then you can 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.330
 you just the hair just 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:44.979
 let it run like this and then do it 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.139
 want your neck 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.490
 just as you normally wear but pay attention 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.930
 then be sure that before you go 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.520
 it is better that you already have the hair band 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.190
 so wear the necklace around your neck 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.750
 because you ca n't get over it like that anymore 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.039
 so choose what to do for him here 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.930
 can you next 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:00.310
 you must give him a boost 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.639
 just pick it up and get into it 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.639
 to scroll 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.060
 I'm always working on the latest 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.009
 keeping an eye on trends and me 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.599
 find it very important that I 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.860
 always refresh in the videos that 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:18.330
 you keep making 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.550
 I hope you like this one 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.990
 I think many people get it 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.580
 the power that the braiding so 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.740
 is extremely difficult to be with yourself 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.930
 We are absolutely right in that 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.120
 I also have the real myself for a long time or 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.949
 done before I got the hang of it 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.409
 I hope this way with a haircut 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:34.770
 as this is all of you must 

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:36.689
 succeed 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.490
 and I'm sure it's it 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:41.340
 will be all right 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.110
 add me on twitter in reading room i wonder 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.310
 sit also instagram there you can me 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.620
 also follow 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:50.449
 thanks for looking forward to seeing you 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.449
 and let them come up with new ideas
