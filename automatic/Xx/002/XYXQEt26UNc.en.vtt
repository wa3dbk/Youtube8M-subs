00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.940
 memory glam eclairs and today i am you 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:08.520
 I will tell you how to deal with the problem 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.740
 to fix a problem such as in the us 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:15.990
 13 that is, how to make it so quiet 13 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.200
 didn't fly out in your place you know 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.390
 there are all sorts of different problems but i 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.550
 regarding the problem which concerns 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.280
 that's exactly the note you play let's say 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.120
 career and you just crashes 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.180
 stupidly flies, I'll tell you about this 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.089
 problem some say he 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.249
 helps you update in the form of drivers 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.249
 and all this seems to me like nonsense 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.670
 some maybe helps me 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:57.200
 this did not help me the following 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.200
 look go in the hard disk and heart 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.470
 we come here it is users the user and here 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.790
 go to my documents from my documents 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:13.860
 here we find the fifa 13 folder here 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.860
 and here is the first folder instance 0 just 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.860
 still there are all sorts of autosave them 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 it is possible that is, through this retired 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.740
 Carry such I do not advise you to do this 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.960
 it may 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:33.770
 for so much praise with fly but keep 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.220
 we go to them scary and here we see get 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:42.049
 2 review document to and both are called 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:49.360
 science 0 here we first copy the first 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:53.990
 well, and then this input file 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.920
 delete then create 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.439
 here it is a text document and this one 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.549
 text document we call it like this 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.959
 here's a replay gain after that we go in 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:11.349
 properties of the text of the document and put here 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:14.540
 read-only attributes 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.010
 that's all actually go then needles 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.659
 more this problem 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.659
 towers and the problem does not face 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.799
 and most likely I will have 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.739
 passing fifa 13 career in 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:33.629
 nottingham flores ported to this 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.920
 let's see and those whom it helped put 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.629
 thumb up 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.629
 and thanks everyone for watching
