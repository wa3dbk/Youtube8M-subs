00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
in three shot mode you can actually run

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.650 
in three shot mode you can actually run
around<00:00:10.559> like<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.280> control<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.240> at<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> same

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
around like and control it at the same

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.129 
around like and control it at the same
time<00:00:12.900> which<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.830> really<00:00:14.219> fun<00:00:14.580> they<00:00:15.570> start<00:00:15.900> over

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
time which is really fun they start over

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.620 
time which is really fun they start over
here<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.470> could<00:00:16.710> actually<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:17.300> go<00:00:18.300> over<00:00:18.480> here

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
here I could actually just go over here

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.260 
here I could actually just go over here
pretty<00:00:18.900> much<00:00:18.990> travel<00:00:19.529> along<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.250> keep<00:00:21.119> in

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
pretty much travel along with it keep in

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.790 
pretty much travel along with it keep in
mind<00:00:21.300> though<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.840> switch<00:00:22.109> weapons<00:00:22.350> Walter

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
mind though if you switch weapons Walter

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.580 
mind though if you switch weapons Walter
that<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.130> when<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.330> switch<00:00:24.720> weapons<00:00:24.930> while<00:00:25.320> it

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that is when you switch weapons while it

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.509 
that is when you switch weapons while it
is<00:00:25.710> out<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.939> will<00:00:27.240> immediately<00:00:27.750> blow<00:00:28.260> off<00:00:28.519> so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
is out it will immediately blow off so

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.460 
is out it will immediately blow off so
you<00:00:29.910> can't<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.330> two<00:00:30.480> weapons<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:31.230> once

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you can't have two weapons going at once

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.410 
you can't have two weapons going at once
unfortunately<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.820> forgot<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> show<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
unfortunately and I forgot to show you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.840 
unfortunately and I forgot to show you
this<00:00:33.690> thing<00:00:34.020> which<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> cluster<00:00:35.640> bomb

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
this thing which is the cluster bomb

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.830 
this thing which is the cluster bomb
similar<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.890> shock<00:00:37.890> wave<00:00:38.239> but<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.570> has

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
similar to the shock wave but it has

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.770 
similar to the shock wave but it has
clusters<00:00:40.640> still<00:00:41.640> remote<00:00:41.850> controlled<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
clusters still remote controlled and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.959 
clusters still remote controlled and
that's<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.710> does<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.430> very<00:00:44.640> powerful

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
that's what it does it's very powerful

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.430 
that's what it does it's very powerful
but<00:00:45.450> hasn't<00:00:45.750> even<00:00:45.840> longer<00:00:46.200> reload<00:00:46.710> time<00:00:48.440> so

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
but hasn't even longer reload time so

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.319 
but hasn't even longer reload time so
yeah<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.980> leave<00:00:50.129> busters<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.180> only

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
yeah just leave busters you can only

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.420 
yeah just leave busters you can only
start<00:00:51.629> reloading<00:00:51.989> after<00:00:52.440> all<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.980> clusters

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
start reloading after all the clusters

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.840 
start reloading after all the clusters
have<00:00:53.550> been<00:00:53.730> destroyed<00:00:55.219> but<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.579> good

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
have been destroyed but it's very good

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.389 
have been destroyed but it's very good
on<00:00:57.000> groups<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.420> enemies<00:00:57.770> fact<00:00:58.770> almost<00:00:59.039> too

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
on groups of enemies fact almost too

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.290 
on groups of enemies fact almost too
good<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:01.399> let's<00:01:02.399> root<00:01:02.640> says<00:01:02.850> us<00:01:03.000> again

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
good and let's root says us again

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.179 
good and let's root says us again
alright<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.170> we're<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.799> into<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
alright now we're going to get into the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.429 
alright now we're going to get into the
devastating<00:01:06.000> weapon<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.780> these<00:01:06.930> flashing

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
devastating weapon see these flashing

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.600 
devastating weapon see these flashing
weapons<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.420> yeah<00:01:10.070> they're<00:01:11.070> doing<00:01:11.430> that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
weapons here yeah they're doing that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.270 
weapons here yeah they're doing that
because<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.090> incredibly<00:01:13.280> incredibly

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
because they are incredibly incredibly

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.830 
because they are incredibly incredibly
powerful<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.990> let's<00:01:16.290> start<00:01:16.500> with

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.840 

this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.929> behemoth<00:01:21.929> beam<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:23.670> does

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this is the behemoth beam it does

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.700 
this is the behemoth beam it does
exactly<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.359> it<00:01:24.539> sounds<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:24.929> it<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
exactly what it sounds like it is just a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.359 
exactly what it sounds like it is just a
massive<00:01:26.240> massive<00:01:27.240> being<00:01:27.990> type<00:01:28.289> of<00:01:28.439> doubt<00:01:28.649> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
massive massive being type of doubt and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.010 
massive massive being type of doubt and
these<00:01:29.549> weapons<00:01:29.939> will<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.359> destroyed<00:01:30.539> after

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
these weapons will get destroyed after

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:40.419 
these weapons will get destroyed after
you<00:01:31.319> use<00:01:31.469> them<00:01:31.649> one<00:01:31.950> time<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.969> check<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:39.049> yeah

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
you use them one time so check this yeah

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.279 
you use them one time so check this yeah
you<00:01:41.429> see<00:01:41.670> how<00:01:41.819> powerful<00:01:42.359> that<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.539> wait<00:01:43.049> let<00:01:43.259> me

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
you see how powerful that is wait let me

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.999 
you see how powerful that is wait let me
do<00:01:43.469> that<00:01:43.619> again<00:01:44.959> to<00:01:45.959> gauge<00:01:46.259> how<00:01:46.469> powerful<00:01:46.950> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
do that again to gauge how powerful it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.380 
do that again to gauge how powerful it
is<00:01:47.069> you<00:01:47.250> need<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.429> see<00:01:47.670> destroying<00:01:48.149> this

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
is you need to see destroying this

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.339 
is you need to see destroying this
Giants<00:01:49.049> floor<00:01:49.289> right<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.759> check<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.880> out

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:54.349 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:57.260 

yeah<00:01:55.349> I<00:01:55.649> miss<00:01:55.979> per<00:01:56.220> half<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> time<00:01:56.789> that<00:01:57.000> still

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
yeah I miss per half the time that still

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.139 
yeah I miss per half the time that still
destroyed<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.899> with<00:01:58.049> these<00:01:58.789> so<00:01:59.789> that's<00:02:00.030> how

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
destroyed it with these so that's how

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.529 
destroyed it with these so that's how
powerful<00:02:00.890> behemoths<00:02:01.890> beam<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:03.270> missed

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
powerful behemoths beam is you missed

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.109 
powerful behemoths beam is you missed
though<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.170> completely<00:02:04.679> useless<00:02:05.000> all<00:02:06.000> right

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
though it's completely useless all right

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.900 
though it's completely useless all right
right<00:02:06.450> here's<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.780> hyper<00:02:07.140> node<00:02:07.759> check<00:02:08.759> this

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
right here's the hyper node check this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.660 
right here's the hyper node check this
out<00:02:09.679> it's<00:02:10.679> probably<00:02:10.799> too<00:02:11.099> slow<00:02:11.340> down<00:02:11.519> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
out it's probably too slow down the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:21.700 
out it's probably too slow down the
video<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.120> pawn<00:02:12.329> but<00:02:12.599> whatever

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.930 

oh<00:02:22.810> yeah<00:02:23.860> sprays<00:02:24.860> for<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:25.280> 10<00:02:25.490> minutes<00:02:25.700> and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
oh yeah sprays for like 10 minutes and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.610 
oh yeah sprays for like 10 minutes and
killed<00:02:26.180> everything<00:02:26.600> on<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.020> screen<00:02:27.080> pretty

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
killed everything on the screen pretty
