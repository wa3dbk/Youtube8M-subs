00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
completely silver so those are very

obvious so I don't think I need to

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.030 
obvious so I don't think I need to
explain<00:01:01.640> those<00:01:02.179> but<00:01:02.839> these<00:01:03.019> three<00:01:03.440> look<00:01:03.679> very

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
explain those but these three look very

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.310 
explain those but these three look very
