00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330 

load<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> shotgun<00:01:21.990> well<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.860> guy's<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
load a shotgun well this guy's going to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.250 
load a shotgun well this guy's going to
get<00:01:23.460> annoying<00:01:23.730> okay<00:01:24.480> there<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.870> go

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
get annoying okay there we go

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:37.390 
get annoying okay there we go
oh<00:01:25.610> no<00:01:26.610> he's<00:01:26.880> after<00:01:27.090> me<00:01:28.790> he<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.000> after<00:01:30.300> me

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.390 

maybe<00:01:38.000> if<00:01:38.150> we<00:01:38.270> lure<00:01:38.540> him<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:38.990> front<00:01:39.500> of<00:01:39.680> the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
maybe if we lure him in front of the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.140 
maybe if we lure him in front of the
chain<00:01:40.730> he'll<00:01:41.480> cut<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:41.870> for<00:01:42.110> us<00:01:43.150> that's

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
chain he'll cut it for us that's

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.770 
chain he'll cut it for us that's
probably<00:01:44.570> a<00:01:44.660> stupid<00:01:44.840> idea<00:01:46.300> okay<00:01:47.300> so<00:01:47.360> that

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
probably a stupid idea okay so that

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.000 
probably a stupid idea okay so that
seems<00:01:48.020> like<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.200> hint<00:01:48.470> that<00:01:48.530> we're<00:01:48.800> probably

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
seems like a hint that we're probably

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.050 
seems like a hint that we're probably
going<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.370> actually<00:01:49.640> have<00:01:49.760> to<00:01:49.880> kill<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.270> guy

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060

and<00:01:55.100> he<00:01:56.100> doesn't<00:01:56.460> even<00:01:56.580> seem<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.880> care<00:01:57.030> when<00:01:57.450> I

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and he doesn't even seem to care when I

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.060 
and he doesn't even seem to care when I
shoot<00:01:57.750> him<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.049> shotgun<00:01:58.290> oh<00:01:58.590> no<00:01:58.890> there's

crossbow

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.870 

explosive<00:02:16.220> rounds<00:02:17.980> well<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.490> was<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.670> first

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
explosive rounds well that was the first

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.880 
explosive rounds well that was the first
thing<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.150> staggered<00:02:20.750> him<00:02:20.870> okay<00:02:21.560> let's<00:02:21.770> try

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
thing that staggered him okay let's try

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.990 
thing that staggered him okay let's try
the<00:02:22.010> flashback<00:02:22.550> all<00:02:23.480> right<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.960> got<00:02:24.500> an<00:02:24.590> idea

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
the flashback all right I got an idea

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.690 
the flashback all right I got an idea
there<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.120> go<00:02:27.280> stealth<00:02:28.280> kill<00:02:28.520> with<00:02:28.640> a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
there we go stealth kill with a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.850 
there we go stealth kill with a
flashbang<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.060> couple<00:02:32.240> achievements<00:02:32.870> so

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
flashbang and a couple achievements so

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.990 
flashbang and a couple achievements so
there's<00:02:34.040> probably<00:02:34.340> more<00:02:34.550> than<00:02:34.670> one<00:02:34.820> way<00:02:34.970> to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
there's probably more than one way to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.420 
there's probably more than one way to
skin<00:02:35.240> that<00:02:35.390> cat

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:46.520 

oh<00:02:38.540> okay<00:02:39.540> again<00:02:39.870> okay<00:02:45.200> anyway<00:02:46.200> when<00:02:46.439> you
