we still get a little bit of stuff to do
there's<00:00:46.409> the<00:00:46.589> end<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.859> it<00:00:46.949> I'm<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:47.159> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
there's the end of it I'm going to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.950 
there's the end of it I'm going to
either<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> extend<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.299> out<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
either going to extend that out this is

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.229 
either going to extend that out this is
the<00:00:49.199> little<00:00:49.379> drainage<00:00:49.979> run<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.579> where<00:00:51.059> my

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the little drainage run of where my

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.779 
the little drainage run of where my
culvert<00:00:51.809> cistern<00:00:52.139> empties<00:00:53.069> into<00:00:53.280> from<00:00:53.639> its

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
culvert cistern empties into from its

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.259 
culvert cistern empties into from its
overflow<00:00:54.389> pipe<00:00:55.139> right<00:00:55.350> over<00:00:55.559> there

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
overflow pipe right over there

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.090 
overflow pipe right over there
full<00:00:57.269> walking<00:00:57.749> along<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.139> swell<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.949> can

full walking along this swell so you can
see<00:00:59.339> it's<00:00:59.819> about<00:00:59.969> 12<00:01:00.329> inches<00:01:00.510> over<00:01:00.749> here<00:01:01.199> comes

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
see it's about 12 inches over here comes

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.640 
see it's about 12 inches over here comes
up<00:01:01.799> to<00:01:01.920> about<00:01:02.129> 20<00:01:02.489> inches<00:01:02.639> as<00:01:02.999> the<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.440> land

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
up to about 20 inches as the as the land

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.960 
up to about 20 inches as the as the land
drops<00:01:05.339> down<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.670> elevation<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:07.500> contour<00:01:08.010> line

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
drops down in elevation the contour line

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.480 
drops down in elevation the contour line
goes<00:01:09.300> from<00:01:09.930> about<00:01:10.050> right<00:01:10.230> here<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.220> it

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
goes from about right here and it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.770 
goes from about right here and it
actually<00:01:11.610> continues<00:01:12.300> in<00:01:12.420> front<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.690> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
actually continues in front of that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.520 
actually continues in front of that
little<00:01:13.740> junky<00:01:14.070> pallet<00:01:14.400> bridge<00:01:14.580> into<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.780> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
little junky pallet bridge into there so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.620 
little junky pallet bridge into there so
all<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.130> actually<00:01:17.310> lower<00:01:17.760> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
all of this is actually lower this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
all of this is actually lower this
little<00:01:18.930> pie<00:01:19.110> shaped<00:01:19.500> area<00:01:19.710> about<00:01:20.550> six<00:01:20.850> or

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
little pie shaped area about six or

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.000 
little pie shaped area about six or
seven<00:01:21.210> inches<00:01:21.330> lower<00:01:21.690> but<00:01:22.620> I<00:01:22.650> did<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.950> on

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
seven inches lower but I did that on

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.450 
seven inches lower but I did that on
purpose<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.970> could<00:01:24.150> almost<00:01:25.370> makes<00:01:26.370> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
purpose just so it could almost makes a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.740 
purpose just so it could almost makes a
little<00:01:26.550> collection<00:01:26.940> point<00:01:27.300> for<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.540> water

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
little collection point for that water

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.530 
little collection point for that water
to<00:01:27.900> build<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.410> and<00:01:28.620> flow<00:01:29.400> down<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.790> PVC<00:01:30.330> pipe

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
to build up and flow down that PVC pipe

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.150 
to build up and flow down that PVC pipe
right<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.170> yellow<00:01:31.320> cap<00:01:31.620> on<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.010> I

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
right there with the yellow cap on it I

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.490 
right there with the yellow cap on it I
just<00:01:32.670> put<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.940> cap<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.360> keep<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> mice<00:01:34.260> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
just put a cap on keep the mice and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.260 
just put a cap on keep the mice and
stuff<00:01:34.590> out<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.250> now

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
stuff out of it for now

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.790 
stuff out of it for now
and<00:01:36.510> then<00:01:36.690> it's<00:01:36.870> going<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.140> end<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.410> flowing

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
and then it's going to end up flowing

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.830 
and then it's going to end up flowing
into<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.070> fruit<00:01:38.370> tree<00:01:38.610> wells<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.690> other

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
into my fruit tree wells on the other

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.440 
into my fruit tree wells on the other
side<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.580> garden<00:01:42.090> fence<00:01:42.300> right

side of that that garden fence right

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.990 
side of that that garden fence right
there<00:01:42.830> we've<00:01:43.830> got<00:01:43.860> two<00:01:44.160> peach<00:01:44.370> trees<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.910> an

brought out here this soil is either dug

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.759 
brought out here this soil is either dug
from<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> land<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:37.060> most<00:02:37.359> of<00:02:37.540> its<00:02:37.769> actually

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
from the land but most of its actually

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.770 
from the land but most of its actually
sucked<00:02:39.040> my<00:02:39.189> garden<00:02:39.549> beds<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.030> changed<00:02:40.720> from

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
sucked my garden beds I changed from

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.780 
sucked my garden beds I changed from
raised<00:02:41.019> beds<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> sunken<00:02:42.099> garden<00:02:42.430> bed<00:02:42.549> site

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
raised beds to a sunken garden bed site

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.240 
raised beds to a sunken garden bed site
I<00:02:42.970> dug<00:02:43.299> about<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.510> foot<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.959> soil<00:02:44.109> out<00:02:44.439> and<00:02:44.680> then

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
I dug about a foot of soil out and then

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.479 
I dug about a foot of soil out and then
added<00:02:45.700> my<00:02:45.849> good<00:02:46.329> compost<00:02:47.010> mix<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.220> anyway

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
added my good compost mix so anyway

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.420 
added my good compost mix so anyway
we're<00:02:48.670> following<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.540> way<00:02:50.189> go<00:02:51.189> across

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
we're following it this way go across

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.240 
we're following it this way go across
one<00:02:51.790> little<00:02:52.319> another<00:02:53.319> little<00:02:53.650> junky<00:02:53.919> pallet

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
one little another little junky pallet

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.309 
one little another little junky pallet
bridge<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.700> you'll<00:02:55.450> see<00:02:55.629> it's<00:02:55.750> meandering

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
bridge and you'll see it's meandering

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.559 
bridge and you'll see it's meandering
through<00:02:56.409> the<00:02:56.680> land<00:02:56.859> like<00:02:57.099> that<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:58.450> that's

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
through the land like that and that's

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.170 
through the land like that and that's
just<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.349> was<00:02:59.980> just<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.370> level<00:03:00.700> line<00:03:00.909> of<00:03:01.090> the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
just that was just the level line of the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.940 
just that was just the level line of the
land<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:05.049> then<00:03:05.169> it<00:03:05.200> goes<00:03:05.439> up<00:03:05.470> through<00:03:05.829> those

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
land and then it goes up through those

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.280 
land and then it goes up through those
trees<00:03:06.310> right<00:03:06.579> there<00:03:06.609> and<00:03:07.480> across<00:03:07.750> my<00:03:07.930> walking

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
trees right there and across my walking

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.339 
trees right there and across my walking
trail<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.510> go<00:03:10.629> up<00:03:10.750> there<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.989> little<00:03:11.169> bit

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
trail so if you go up there a little bit

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.960 
trail so if you go up there a little bit
i<00:03:11.470> eyeballed<00:03:11.889> that<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:12.250> didn't<00:03:12.489> really<00:03:12.609> level

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
i eyeballed that I didn't really level

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.970 
i eyeballed that I didn't really level
that<00:03:13.120> out<00:03:13.269> but<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.989> rest<00:03:14.079> of<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.409> is<00:03:14.620> leveled

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
that out but the rest of this is leveled

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.580 
that out but the rest of this is leveled
with<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.489> a-frame<00:03:15.849> level<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.389> water<00:03:17.379> is<00:03:17.470> going

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
with the a-frame level so water is going

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.580 
with the a-frame level so water is going
to<00:03:17.650> move<00:03:17.739> extremely<00:03:18.159> slowly<00:03:18.790> through<00:03:19.150> this

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
to move extremely slowly through this

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.949 
to move extremely slowly through this
and<00:03:20.590> eventually<00:03:21.069> go<00:03:21.220> down<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:22.209> pool<00:03:22.479> up<00:03:22.720> in

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
and eventually go down to pool up in

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.319 
and eventually go down to pool up in
that<00:03:23.409> little<00:03:23.709> diversion<00:03:23.979> area<00:03:24.430> or<00:03:24.729> the<00:03:24.879> PVC

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
that little diversion area or the PVC

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.949 
that little diversion area or the PVC
pipe<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.370> then<00:03:27.370> I'll<00:03:28.359> just<00:03:28.540> give<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.840> a

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
pipe is and then I'll just give you a

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.379 
pipe is and then I'll just give you a
quick<00:03:29.199> little<00:03:29.379> look<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:30.060> a-frame<00:03:31.060> level

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
quick little look of the a-frame level

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.670 
quick little look of the a-frame level
that<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.540> used<00:03:32.129> so<00:03:33.129> just<00:03:33.790> some<00:03:33.970> old<00:03:34.120> junk

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
that I used so just some old junk

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.020 
that I used so just some old junk
redwood<00:03:35.680> sticks<00:03:35.979> I<00:03:36.129> used<00:03:36.340> as<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.549> tomato

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
redwood sticks I used as a tomato

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.009 
redwood sticks I used as a tomato
trellis<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:39.510> anyway<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.569> can<00:03:40.750> make<00:03:40.900> these

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
trellis and anyway you can make these

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.149 
trellis and anyway you can make these
a-frame<00:03:41.409> levels<00:03:41.709> out<00:03:41.829> of<00:03:41.919> pretty<00:03:42.069> much

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
a-frame levels out of pretty much

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.020 
a-frame levels out of pretty much
anything<00:03:42.489> but<00:03:42.879> I<00:03:43.060> just<00:03:43.659> had<00:03:44.079> this<00:03:44.109> available

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:47.229 
here's my string I don't know if you can

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:51.780 
here's my string I don't know if you can

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
little notch I made with a nail and then

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.259 
little notch I made with a nail and then
I<00:03:54.849> just<00:03:55.150> used<00:03:56.549> this<00:03:57.549> old<00:03:57.790> hook<00:03:58.060> as<00:03:58.239> a
