00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:16.090 

welcome<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.879> my<00:00:03.030> second<00:00:03.360> video<00:00:12.139> in<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.320> video

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:38.900 

and<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:18.000> particular<00:00:18.180> I'm<00:00:18.779> going<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:37.910> using

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and in particular I'm going to using

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:54.310 
and in particular I'm going to using
these<00:00:39.000> two<00:00:39.210> jumps<00:00:39.570> I'm<00:00:39.719> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.020> clear

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.800 

so<00:00:54.950> you<00:00:55.040> can<00:00:55.220> see<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.550> default<00:00:55.700> jumps<00:00:56.270> they

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
so you can see the default jumps they

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.100 
so you can see the default jumps they
work<00:00:56.990> well<00:00:57.200> and<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:58.550> could<00:00:58.790> just<00:00:59.210> be<00:00:59.480> you

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
work well and you could just be you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.750 
work well and you could just be you
could<00:01:00.290> just<00:01:00.530> drop<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.100> character<00:01:01.460> into<00:01:01.610> your

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
could just drop the character into your

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.110 
could just drop the character into your
scene<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:02.590> build<00:01:03.590> around<00:01:03.710> those<00:01:04.460> jumps<00:01:04.910> and

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
scene and build around those jumps and

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.560 
scene and build around those jumps and
everything<00:01:06.050> would<00:01:06.230> be<00:01:06.350> fine<00:01:06.610> however<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:08.360> don't

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
everything would be fine however I don't

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.260 
everything would be fine however I don't
expect<00:01:09.500> people<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.890> necessarily<00:01:10.580> do<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:11.030> I

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
expect people to necessarily do that I

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.790 
expect people to necessarily do that I
understand<00:01:12.050> that<00:01:12.140> people<00:01:12.320> might<00:01:12.590> want<00:01:12.620> to

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
understand that people might want to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.110 
understand that people might want to
take<00:01:12.980> this<00:01:13.100> character<00:01:13.550> and<00:01:13.610> put<00:01:13.760> it<00:01:13.880> into

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
take this character and put it into

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
take this character and put it into
multiple<00:01:15.110> different<00:01:15.950> situations<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.140> they

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
multiple different situations and they

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.540 
multiple different situations and they
may<00:01:18.350> just<00:01:18.530> have<00:01:18.650> different<00:01:18.800> ideas<00:01:19.220> of<00:01:19.400> what

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
may just have different ideas of what

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.740 
may just have different ideas of what
they<00:01:19.700> one<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:20.030> came<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.240> be

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
they one that came to be

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.250 
they one that came to be
for<00:01:21.560> example<00:01:22.570> developer<00:01:23.570> may<00:01:23.750> wish<00:01:23.960> the

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
for example developer may wish the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.510 
for example developer may wish the
character<00:01:24.620> to<00:01:24.740> be<00:01:24.770> small<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.430> the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
character to be small and the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.460 
character to be small and the
environments<00:01:26.000> be<00:01:26.180> quite<00:01:27.020> large<00:01:27.200> in

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
environments be quite large in

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.460 
environments be quite large in
comparison<00:01:27.880> if<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:28.970> look<00:01:29.119> at<00:01:29.240> this<00:01:31.840> here<00:01:32.840> you

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
comparison if you look at this here you

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
comparison if you look at this here you
see<00:01:33.650> it's<00:01:33.800> much<00:01:34.009> larger<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:36.530> if<00:01:37.190> we're<00:01:37.369> gonna

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
see it's much larger and if we're gonna

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:46.120 
see it's much larger and if we're gonna
use<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:38.000> default<00:01:38.479> jumps<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.740> can<00:01:39.800> see<00:01:45.130> all

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
use the default jumps you can see all

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:54.100 
use the default jumps you can see all
the<00:01:46.280> jumps<00:01:46.610> in<00:01:46.850> this<00:01:51.460> animation<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.270> we<00:01:53.960> can

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
the jumps in this animation so we can

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.660 
the jumps in this animation so we can
change<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.470> few<00:01:54.649> settings<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.310> we<00:01:55.399> should<00:01:55.580> be

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
change a few settings and we should be

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:07.149 
change a few settings and we should be
able<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.820> clear<00:01:56.090> these<00:01:56.240> jumps<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:05.979> coach<00:02:06.979> the

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
able to clear these jumps in coach the

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.969 
able to clear these jumps in coach the
inspector<00:02:07.989> look<00:02:08.989> for<00:02:09.260> jump<00:02:09.530> booster

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
inspector look for jump booster

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.789 
inspector look for jump booster
third-person<00:02:10.489> script<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.540> then<00:02:12.200> scroll<00:02:12.560> down

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
third-person script and then scroll down

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:24.009 
third-person script and then scroll down
to<00:02:12.980> find<00:02:13.040> vertical

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.429 

there<00:02:25.019> we<00:02:25.109> go<00:02:25.260> we've<00:02:25.469> cleared<00:02:25.859> a<00:02:26.069> much<00:02:26.579> taller

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
there we go we've cleared a much taller

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:39.619 
there we go we've cleared a much taller
height<00:02:35.150> now<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:37.549> multiplier<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.849> there's<00:02:39.569> a

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
height now the multiplier is there's a

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:51.770 
height now the multiplier is there's a
multiplier<00:02:40.109> for<00:02:47.629> they<00:02:48.629> will<00:02:49.159> take<00:02:50.159> your<00:02:50.780> jump

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
multiplier for they will take your jump

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.660 
multiplier for they will take your jump
height<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.530> they<00:02:52.620> will<00:02:52.769> basically<00:02:52.980> multiply

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
height and they will basically multiply

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.149 
height and they will basically multiply
it<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.389> I've<00:02:54.569> got<00:02:54.599> four<00:02:55.169> I'll<00:02:55.859> be<00:02:55.980> jumping

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
it so if I've got four I'll be jumping

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:02.509 
it so if I've got four I'll be jumping
four<00:02:56.519> times<00:03:00.530> there's<00:03:01.530> also<00:03:01.680> another<00:03:02.069> control

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
four times there's also another control

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:11.149 
four times there's also another control
in<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.939> script<00:03:07.819> that<00:03:08.819> does<00:03:08.879> is<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:10.290> will<00:03:10.319> push

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
in the script that does is it will push

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.030 
in the script that does is it will push
me<00:03:11.459> further<00:03:11.760> forward<00:03:12.389> on<00:03:12.569> any<00:03:12.689> jump<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:13.319> no

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
me further forward on any jump so no

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.920 
me further forward on any jump so no
extra<00:03:14.549> height<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.909> that<00:03:18.120> control<00:03:18.659> I'm

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
extra height so with that control I'm

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.959 
extra height so with that control I'm
gonna<00:03:19.079> try<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.560> jump<00:03:19.739> across<00:03:19.980> these<00:03:20.400> large

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:20.969 
gonna try and jump across these large

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.990 
gonna try and jump across these large
gaps<00:03:21.439> now<00:03:22.439> on<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.709> floor<00:03:22.919> I'll<00:03:23.219> just<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.730> do

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
gaps now on the floor I'll just you do

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.090 
gaps now on the floor I'll just you do
the<00:03:24.120> same<00:03:24.329> thing<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.719> the<00:03:24.780> default<00:03:25.169> jump

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.920 

and<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:31.490> see<00:03:31.700> I<00:03:31.970> wouldn't<00:03:32.420> really<00:03:32.510> get

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and you can see I wouldn't really get

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.860 
and you can see I wouldn't really get
very<00:03:33.110> far<00:03:33.440> maybe<00:03:33.650> one<00:03:33.920> third<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.370> way<00:03:34.870> but

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
very far maybe one third of the way but

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.050 
very far maybe one third of the way but
changing<00:03:36.260> these<00:03:36.350> values<00:03:36.830> I<00:03:37.130> should<00:03:37.430> be<00:03:37.970> able

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
changing these values I should be able

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.480 
changing these values I should be able
to<00:03:38.180> clear<00:03:38.420> this<00:03:38.569> jump<00:03:39.010> now<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.040> just<00:03:40.130> want<00:03:40.400> to

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
to clear this jump now I just want to

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.580 
to clear this jump now I just want to
know<00:03:40.610> these<00:03:41.360> are<00:03:41.420> multipliers<00:03:42.080> in<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.380> same

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
know these are multipliers in the same

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.890 
know these are multipliers in the same
way<00:03:42.770> as<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.130> height<00:03:43.670> so<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.450> may<00:03:44.690> have<00:03:44.780> to

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
way as the height so you may have to

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.940 
way as the height so you may have to
change<00:03:45.050> around<00:03:45.410> with<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.709> little<00:03:45.740> bit

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
change around with it a little bit

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.740 
change around with it a little bit
before<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.370> get<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.580> right<00:03:46.760> figure<00:03:52.270> okay<00:03:53.270> so

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
before you get the right figure okay so

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.750 
before you get the right figure okay so
these<00:03:54.170> are<00:03:54.230> also<00:03:54.530> taller<00:03:55.010> than<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.340> previous

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
these are also taller than the previous

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:12.070 
these are also taller than the previous
one<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.200> I'm<00:03:57.200> gonna<00:03:57.320> change<00:03:57.590> my<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:11.360> I'm<00:04:11.900> gonna

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
one so I'm gonna change my so I'm gonna

one so I'm gonna change my so I'm gonna
look<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.709> vertical<00:04:13.130> room<00:04:13.430> multiplex<00:04:13.940> I'm

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
look to the vertical room multiplex I'm

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.400 
look to the vertical room multiplex I'm
gonna<00:04:14.269> do<00:04:14.390> this<00:04:14.540> with<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:14.780> running<00:04:15.050> jump<00:04:15.200> I'm

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
gonna do this with a running jump I'm

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.440 
gonna do this with a running jump I'm
gonna<00:04:15.560> change<00:04:15.769> up<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:15.950> three<00:04:16.370> now<00:04:17.030> that's<00:04:17.269> not

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
gonna change up to three now that's not

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.870 
gonna change up to three now that's not
needed<00:04:17.660> because<00:04:18.230> I'm<00:04:18.470> gonna<00:04:18.620> be<00:04:18.739> jumping<00:04:18.950> so

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
needed because I'm gonna be jumping so

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.310 
needed because I'm gonna be jumping so
much<00:04:20.060> further<00:04:20.359> I'd<00:04:20.720> like<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:21.049> give<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.200> a

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
much further I'd like to give it a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.950 
much further I'd like to give it a
little<00:04:21.500> bit<00:04:21.650> extra<00:04:21.919> height<00:04:22.220> for<00:04:22.960> plausibility

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
little bit extra height for plausibility

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.480 
little bit extra height for plausibility
even<00:04:24.470> though<00:04:24.590> it's<00:04:25.240> ridiculous<00:04:27.310> I'm<00:04:28.310> also

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
even though it's ridiculous I'm also

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.580 
even though it's ridiculous I'm also
gonna<00:04:28.669> change<00:04:28.970> D<00:04:29.210> forward<00:04:29.570> from<00:04:29.750> boost<00:04:29.990> now<00:04:30.200> to

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
gonna change D forward from boost now to

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.900 
gonna change D forward from boost now to
20

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.380 

we<00:04:37.740> just<00:04:38.740> about<00:04:38.860> made<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.310> across<00:04:39.520> there<00:04:39.820> you

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
we just about made it across there you

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.360 
we just about made it across there you
can<00:04:40.540> see<00:04:40.660> I've<00:04:40.780> jumped<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.230> much<00:04:41.470> much<00:04:42.130> further

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
can see I've jumped a much much further

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.430 
can see I've jumped a much much further
distance<00:04:42.850> I'll<00:04:43.000> try<00:04:43.210> and<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.570> try<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.290> just

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
distance I'll try and I try and just

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:57.480 
distance I'll try and I try and just
zoom<00:04:44.740> out<00:04:44.920> and<00:04:45.130> do<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:45.880> same<00:04:46.030> thing<00:04:46.300> so<00:04:56.490> that's

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
zoom out and do the same thing so that's

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:10.410 
zoom out and do the same thing so that's
the<00:04:57.730> basics<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:59.110> jump<00:04:59.500> controls<00:05:09.420> there's

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
the basics of the jump controls there's

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.890 
the basics of the jump controls there's
an<00:05:10.540> extra<00:05:10.780> control<00:05:11.140> here<00:05:11.350> called

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
an extra control here called

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.480 
an extra control here called
short<00:05:13.900> fall<00:05:14.170> height<00:05:14.410> now<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:14.800> may<00:05:15.070> change<00:05:15.250> that

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
short fall height now I may change that

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.490 
short fall height now I may change that
to<00:05:15.640> full<00:05:15.850> height<00:05:16.000> in<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.330> fund<00:05:16.540> release<00:05:16.870> but

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
to full height in the fund release but

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.500 
to full height in the fund release but
it'll<00:05:17.740> be<00:05:17.860> it'll<00:05:18.340> be<00:05:20.700> now<00:05:21.700> this<00:05:21.940> says<00:05:22.240> the

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
it'll be it'll be now this says the

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.710 
it'll be it'll be now this says the
height<00:05:22.690> at<00:05:22.900> which<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.730> character<00:05:24.730> will<00:05:25.060> enter

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
height at which the character will enter

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.020 
height at which the character will enter
a<00:05:25.750> falling<00:05:26.260> state<00:05:26.560> so<00:05:27.430> when<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.640> come<00:05:27.820> up<00:05:27.850> this

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
a falling state so when I come up this

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.970 
a falling state so when I come up this
ramp<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.510> jump<00:05:28.690> off<00:05:28.870> you'll<00:05:29.050> see<00:05:29.140> that<00:05:29.440> he

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
ramp and jump off you'll see that he

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.960 
ramp and jump off you'll see that he
starts<00:05:30.310> to<00:05:30.340> fall<00:05:30.640> and<00:05:32.400> if<00:05:33.400> I<00:05:33.580> do<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:33.790> same

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
starts to fall and if I do the same

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:43.110 
starts to fall and if I do the same
thing<00:05:34.030> from<00:05:34.450> a<00:05:34.570> short<00:05:34.810> distance<00:05:41.790> if<00:05:42.790> you<00:05:42.940> make

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
thing from a short distance if you make

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.670 
thing from a short distance if you make
this<00:05:43.240> high<00:05:45.750> you<00:05:46.750> shouldn't<00:05:47.050> enter<00:05:47.200> their<00:05:47.470> full

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
this high you shouldn't enter their full

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.070 
this high you shouldn't enter their full
stance

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
stance

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.320 
stance
so<00:05:49.949> you<00:05:50.039> went<00:05:50.250> over<00:05:50.340> just<00:05:50.460> that<00:05:50.849> to<00:05:51.000> your<00:05:51.120> game

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
so you went over just that to your game

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.689 
so you went over just that to your game
and<00:05:51.690> depends<00:05:52.169> how<00:05:52.289> soon<00:05:52.620> you<00:05:53.430> like<00:05:53.610> the

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
and depends how soon you like the

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.210 
and depends how soon you like the
character<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.270> enter<00:05:54.509> a<00:05:54.539> full<00:05:54.750> state<00:05:55.080> I'm<00:05:56.039> just

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
character to enter a full state I'm just

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.439 
character to enter a full state I'm just
gonna<00:05:56.370> change<00:05:56.550> that<00:05:56.729> back<00:05:56.909> down<00:05:57.060> to<00:05:57.210> ten

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
gonna change that back down to ten

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.360 
gonna change that back down to ten
underneath<00:05:58.259> it<00:05:58.470> there's<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.680> falling<00:05:59.069> speed

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
underneath it there's a falling speed

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.140 
underneath it there's a falling speed
direction

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
direction

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.450 
direction
sorry<00:06:00.780> falling<00:06:01.319> directional<00:06:01.889> speed<00:06:02.190> and

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
sorry falling directional speed and

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.450 
sorry falling directional speed and
that's<00:06:03.210> how<00:06:03.530> much<00:06:04.530> control<00:06:04.919> the<00:06:05.099> character

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
that's how much control the character

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.969 
that's how much control the character
will<00:06:05.580> have<00:06:05.610> when<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.629> character<00:06:07.199> sorry<00:06:07.889> how

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
will have when the character sorry how

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.589 
will have when the character sorry how
much<00:06:08.129> control<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:08.550> player<00:06:08.789> will<00:06:08.940> have<00:06:08.970> when

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
much control the player will have when

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.360 
much control the player will have when
the<00:06:09.720> character<00:06:10.080> is<00:06:10.110> falling<00:06:11.629> change<00:06:12.629> that<00:06:12.870> to

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
the character is falling change that to

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.770 
the character is falling change that to
for<00:06:14.370> demonstration<00:06:14.970> purposes<00:06:15.360> I'll<00:06:15.509> put<00:06:15.690> that

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
for demonstration purposes I'll put that

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.170 
for demonstration purposes I'll put that
up<00:06:15.840> to<00:06:16.110> fifty<00:06:16.500> you<00:06:17.250> should<00:06:17.460> see<00:06:17.669> now<00:06:17.849> that<00:06:17.879> when

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
up to fifty you should see now that when

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.779 
up to fifty you should see now that when
I<00:06:18.210> fall<00:06:18.629> I<00:06:18.960> will<00:06:19.409> do<00:06:19.740> so<00:06:20.300> much<00:06:22.610> much<00:06:23.610> faster

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
I fall I will do so much much faster

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:30.490 
I fall I will do so much much faster
rate<00:06:24.150> in<00:06:24.419> terms<00:06:25.050> of<00:06:25.199> direction<00:06:25.500> about<00:06:25.889> to<00:06:26.039> go<00:06:26.780> I

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.959 

didn't<00:06:31.500> expect<00:06:31.830> to<00:06:31.889> make<00:06:32.069> it<00:06:32.219> over<00:06:32.490> there<00:06:32.759> but

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 
didn't expect to make it over there but

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:38.270 
didn't expect to make it over there but
you<00:06:33.060> can<00:06:33.210> see<00:06:36.139> so<00:06:37.139> you<00:06:37.530> want<00:06:37.710> to<00:06:37.800> change<00:06:38.009> that

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
you can see so you want to change that

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:45.619 
you can see so you want to change that
too<00:06:42.229> apart<00:06:43.229> from<00:06:43.289> that<00:06:43.469> there's<00:06:43.680> two<00:06:43.860> graphs<00:06:44.629> I

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:45.629 
too apart from that there's two graphs I

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:49.610 
too apart from that there's two graphs I
think<00:06:46.620> I<00:06:46.830> should<00:06:47.280> do<00:06:47.430> a<00:06:47.460> separate<00:06:48.090> video<00:06:48.620> so

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
think I should do a separate video so
