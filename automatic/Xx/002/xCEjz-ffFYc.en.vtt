00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.980 
hi today I'm going to talk about just
the<00:00:02.159> basic<00:00:02.580> tools<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:03.240> need<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.510> get<00:00:03.870> started

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
the basic tools you need to get started

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.720 
the basic tools you need to get started
in<00:00:04.319> woodturning<00:00:04.740> so<00:00:05.160> let's<00:00:05.370> go<00:00:05.490> ahead<00:00:05.609> and

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
in woodturning so let's go ahead and

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.010 
in woodturning so let's go ahead and
take<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> look<00:00:06.060> at<00:00:06.180> those<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.480> got<00:00:06.629> em<00:00:06.839> all

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
take a look at those and I got em all

take a look at those and I got em all
laid<00:00:07.259> out<00:00:07.670> alright<00:00:08.670> so<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:08.910> picked<00:00:09.150> out<00:00:09.240> six<00:00:09.540> of

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
laid out alright so I picked out six of

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.390 
laid out alright so I picked out six of
them<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.809> are<00:00:10.019> just<00:00:10.050> just<00:00:10.559> basic<00:00:11.040> tools<00:00:11.280> that

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
them that are just just basic tools that

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.839 
them that are just just basic tools that
I<00:00:11.519> use<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.950> lot<00:00:13.950> if<00:00:14.160> not<00:00:14.190> every<00:00:14.639> project

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
I use on on a lot if not every project

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.279 
I use on on a lot if not every project
every<00:00:15.179> couple<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.809> projects<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.609> this<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
every couple of projects so this is a

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.460 
every couple of projects so this is a
skew<00:00:19.289> chisel<00:00:20.510> spend<00:00:21.510> some<00:00:21.660> time<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.289> this

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
skew chisel spend some time on on this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.779 
skew chisel spend some time on on this
and<00:00:22.710> figure<00:00:22.949> out<00:00:22.980> how<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.189> use<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.760> just

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
and figure out how to use it you just

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.700 
and figure out how to use it you just
get<00:00:24.180> comfortable<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.289> once<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
get comfortable with it because once you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.810 
get comfortable with it because once you
do<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.760> valuable<00:00:27.539> valuable<00:00:27.869> tool<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.590> will

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
do it's a valuable valuable tool it will

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.009 
do it's a valuable valuable tool it will
get<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.939> clean<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.210> there's<00:00:30.539> not<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.869> much

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
get it clean so there's not as much

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.170 
get it clean so there's not as much
sanding<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.160> makes<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.460> nice<00:00:32.730> clean

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
sanding it just makes a nice clean

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
sanding it just makes a nice clean
smooth<00:00:33.870> cut<00:00:34.140> but<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.920> does<00:00:35.100> take<00:00:35.340> some

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
smooth cut but it does take some

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.190 
smooth cut but it does take some
practice<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.510> spend<00:00:36.660> some<00:00:36.840> time<00:00:37.050> with

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
practice so just spend some time with

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.410 
practice so just spend some time with
that<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.950> some<00:00:38.160> spindle<00:00:38.489> work<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.910> figure

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that and do some spindle work and figure

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.709 
that and do some spindle work and figure
out<00:00:39.480> how<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.690> cuts<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:41.640> will<00:00:41.850> you

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
out how it cuts and and you will you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.600 
out how it cuts and and you will you
will<00:00:42.899> appreciate<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.250> great

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
will appreciate it that it's a great

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.150 
will appreciate it that it's a great
tool<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.910> learn<00:00:45.450> how<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.629> use<00:00:46.039> this<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.129> a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
tool to learn how to use this is a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.840 
tool to learn how to use this is a
parting<00:00:47.489> tool<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.079> I<00:00:49.219> probably<00:00:50.219> use<00:00:50.640> this

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
parting tool and I probably use this

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.049 
parting tool and I probably use this
probably<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.629> almost<00:00:51.899> every<00:00:52.289> project<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:53.059> if

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
probably on almost every project if if

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.670 
probably on almost every project if if
not<00:00:54.329> every<00:00:54.600> other<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.140> something<00:00:55.649> with

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
not every other one I do something with

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.290 
not every other one I do something with
it<00:00:55.829> even<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.280> I'm<00:00:56.399> not<00:00:56.579> partying<00:00:57.000> something

off with it
I<00:00:57.960> use<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.190> other<00:00:59.250> things<00:00:59.399> doing<00:00:59.760> beadwork

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
I use it for other things doing beadwork

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.330 
I use it for other things doing beadwork
and<00:01:00.359> all<00:01:00.600> sorts<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> things<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.590> it's

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
is valuable you know it's something

you<00:02:06.210> probably<00:02:06.450> never<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.899> me<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.680> me<00:02:07.710> use<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
you probably never see me see me use it

you probably never see me see me use it
this<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.660> one<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.810> use<00:02:10.050> most

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
this is the one I use most

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.630 
this is the one I use most
most<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.050> time<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.470> this<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:14.340> inch<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.550> a

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
most the time and this is a inch and a

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.270 
most the time and this is a inch and a
half<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:16.930> just<00:02:17.290> used<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.560> day<00:02:17.830> just

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
half and I just just used that day just

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.400 
half and I just just used that day just
get<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.610> down<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:18.940> then<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.180> go<00:02:19.959> at<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.110> with

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
get it down and then I go at it with

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.830 
get it down and then I go at it with
with<00:02:20.980> other<00:02:21.580> tools<00:02:21.880> bowl<00:02:22.180> gouge<00:02:22.390> or<00:02:22.630> whatever

with other tools bowl gouge or whatever

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.480 
with other tools bowl gouge or whatever
but<00:02:23.080> like<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.770> say<00:02:23.920> these<00:02:24.160> come<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:24.430> a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
but like it's the say these come in a

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.220 
but like it's the say these come in a
variety<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.910> sizes<00:02:25.150> but<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:25.600> it's<00:02:25.840> probably

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
variety of sizes but it's it's probably

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.720 
variety of sizes but it's it's probably
another<00:02:26.380> must-have<00:02:27.130> when<00:02:27.489> you're<00:02:27.610> first

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
another must-have when you're first

another must-have when you're first
starting<00:02:27.850> out<00:02:28.319> um<00:02:29.640> okay<00:02:30.640> here's<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.209> scraper

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
starting out um okay here's a scraper

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.559 
starting out um okay here's a scraper
and<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.830> use<00:02:33.040> these<00:02:33.459> a<00:02:33.520> lot<00:02:33.819> of<00:02:34.000> times<00:02:34.120> for

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
and I use these a lot of times for

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.760 
and I use these a lot of times for
cleaning<00:02:34.989> out<00:02:35.110> inside<00:02:36.390> boxes<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.600> bowls<00:02:38.590> and

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
cleaning out inside boxes and bowls and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.309 
cleaning out inside boxes and bowls and
stuff<00:02:38.920> like<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.430> little<00:02:40.150> vases<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:41.290> a

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
stuff like that little vases this is a

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.920 
stuff like that little vases this is a
valuable<00:02:42.130> tool<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.430> I'm<00:02:42.670> not<00:02:42.790> sure<00:02:43.060> whether

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
valuable tool that I'm not sure whether

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.990 
valuable tool that I'm not sure whether
they<00:02:44.170> come<00:02:44.380> with<00:02:44.590> all<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.860> kits<00:02:45.100> but<00:02:45.340> it's<00:02:45.850> a

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
they come with all the kits but it's a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.390 
they come with all the kits but it's a
nice<00:02:46.180> tool<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.480> have<00:02:46.630> just<00:02:47.530> -<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:48.190> doesn't

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
nice tool to have just - it doesn't

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.520 
nice tool to have just - it doesn't
catch<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:49.000> much<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.510> can<00:02:49.660> get<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:50.019> on<00:02:50.140> a

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
catch that much so you can get in on a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.070 
catch that much so you can get in on a
bowler<00:02:50.860> box<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:52.000> clean<00:02:52.450> up<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.750> side<00:02:52.930> of

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
bowler box and and clean up the side of

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.259 
bowler box and and clean up the side of
it<00:02:53.200> with<00:02:53.350> this<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.709> they<00:02:54.100> they<00:02:54.670> do<00:02:54.730> make<00:02:55.060> these

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
it with this and they they do make these

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.540 
it with this and they they do make these
you<00:02:56.260> probably<00:02:56.380> see<00:02:56.709> me<00:02:56.830> use<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.220> one<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.489> is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
you probably see me use this one this is

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.870 
you probably see me use this one this is
another<00:02:57.850> inch<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.239> half<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.850> use<00:03:00.850> a

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
another inch and a half and I I use a

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.850 
another inch and a half and I I use a
lot<00:03:01.330> on<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.600> inside<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.989> boxes<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.590> they<00:03:02.709> come

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
lot on the inside of boxes so they come

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.800 
lot on the inside of boxes so they come
in<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.040> variety<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.489> different<00:03:04.060> sizes<00:03:04.269> and

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
in a variety of different sizes and

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.180 
in a variety of different sizes and
inlets<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.560> last<00:03:08.800> one<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.670> bowl<00:03:09.970> gouge<00:03:10.180> and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
inlets the last one is a bowl gouge and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.890 
inlets the last one is a bowl gouge and
this<00:03:12.190> is<00:03:12.370> probably<00:03:12.630> one<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.780> most

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
this is probably one of the most

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.350 
this is probably one of the most
valuable<00:03:14.440> tools<00:03:14.799> this<00:03:15.280> will<00:03:15.610> clean<00:03:16.090> out<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
valuable tools this will clean out the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.300 
valuable tools this will clean out the
inside<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.780> bowls<00:03:16.989> it'll<00:03:17.500> shape<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.890> outside

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
inside of bowls it'll shape the outside

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.090 
inside of bowls it'll shape the outside

is a half inch I believe but they come

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.630 
is a half inch I believe but they come
in<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.640> variety<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:34.420> sizes<00:03:35.079> -<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.950> think<00:03:36.130> I<00:03:36.489> have<00:03:36.579> a

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
3/8 and I'm not sure how much bigger

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.660 
3/8 and I'm not sure how much bigger
they<00:03:41.170> go<00:03:41.350> but<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:43.209> is<00:03:43.420> a<00:03:43.450> just<00:03:44.049> a<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.680> must<00:03:45.430> tool
