00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.320 

I<00:00:06.220> discovered<00:00:07.220> a<00:00:07.370> problem<00:00:07.550> with<00:00:07.850> this<00:00:08.030> hive

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
I discovered a problem with this hive

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.900 
I discovered a problem with this hive
scale<00:00:09.040> this<00:00:10.040> wasn't<00:00:10.250> part<00:00:10.610> of<00:00:10.639> the<00:00:10.730> original

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
scale this wasn't part of the original

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.310 
scale this wasn't part of the original
design<00:00:11.240> this<00:00:11.540> was<00:00:11.720> something<00:00:11.930> that<00:00:12.050> I<00:00:12.230> have

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
design this was something that I have

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.870 
design this was something that I have
done<00:00:12.380> myself<00:00:12.830> and<00:00:13.010> it's<00:00:13.130> a<00:00:13.190> problem<00:00:13.550> so<00:00:13.760> I'm

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
done myself and it's a problem so I'm

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.210 
done myself and it's a problem so I'm
gonna<00:00:14.030> go<00:00:14.210> back<00:00:14.420> to<00:00:14.930> the<00:00:15.050> original<00:00:15.140> design<00:00:15.590> and

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
gonna go back to the original design and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.130 
gonna go back to the original design and
that's<00:00:16.369> these<00:00:16.580> uprights<00:00:17.119> here<00:00:17.300> to<00:00:17.420> hold<00:00:17.630> this

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.350 

that<00:00:21.140> hold<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:21.439> pulley<00:00:21.849> I've<00:00:22.849> did<00:00:23.150> some

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
that hold this pulley I've did some

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.670 
that hold this pulley I've did some
narrow<00:00:23.630> ones<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.169> original<00:00:24.470> design

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
narrow ones and the original design

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.409 
narrow ones and the original design
actually<00:00:25.250> just<00:00:25.610> wider<00:00:25.820> ones<00:00:26.090> but<00:00:26.210> I<00:00:26.239> didn't

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
actually just wider ones but I didn't

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:27.760 
actually just wider ones but I didn't
like<00:00:26.509> the<00:00:26.660> look<00:00:26.869> of<00:00:26.989> it<00:00:27.110> so<00:00:27.349> I<00:00:27.380> went<00:00:27.710> with

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
like the look of it so I went with

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.170 
like the look of it so I went with
narrow<00:00:28.070> ones<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.369> problem<00:00:28.520> though<00:00:28.910> is<00:00:29.150> that

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
narrow ones the problem though is that

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.560 
narrow ones the problem though is that
they<00:00:29.509> want<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.900> bend<00:00:30.230> with<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.829> weight<00:00:31.450> when<00:00:32.450> I

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
they want to bend with the weight when I

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.900 
they want to bend with the weight when I
try<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:32.780> weigh<00:00:33.590> Queen<00:00:34.010> Anne<00:00:34.250> type<00:00:34.550> here<00:00:34.790> it's

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
try to weigh Queen Anne type here it's

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.759 
try to weigh Queen Anne type here it's
so<00:00:35.090> heavy<00:00:35.329> it's<00:00:35.930> in<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.110> hundreds<00:00:36.470> of<00:00:36.590> pounds

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
so heavy it's in the hundreds of pounds

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.750 
so heavy it's in the hundreds of pounds
now<00:00:37.129> and<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.320> pulley<00:00:39.559> just<00:00:39.680> pulls<00:00:40.430> back

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
now and the the pulley just pulls back

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.640 
now and the the pulley just pulls back
there's<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:41.210> much<00:00:41.329> weight<00:00:41.600> on

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.580 

I<00:00:47.450> repaired<00:00:48.450> my<00:00:48.660> hive<00:00:48.870> scale<00:00:49.550> these

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
I repaired my hive scale these

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.790 
I repaired my hive scale these
l-brackets<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.740> were<00:00:52.830> holding<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.970> pulley

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
l-brackets that were holding this pulley

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.770 
l-brackets that were holding this pulley
were<00:00:55.800> too<00:00:56.070> flimsy<00:00:56.400> the<00:00:57.060> ones<00:00:57.240> I<00:00:57.360> had<00:00:57.480> put<00:00:57.660> on

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
were too flimsy the ones I had put on

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.040 
were too flimsy the ones I had put on
and<00:00:58.080> they're<00:00:59.040> actually<00:00:59.310> bending<00:00:59.940> back<00:01:00.240> what

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and they're actually bending back what

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.240 
and they're actually bending back what
happens<00:01:01.380> is<00:01:01.560> when<00:01:01.880> the<00:01:02.880> lever<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.860> pulls<00:01:04.860> on

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
happens is when the lever here pulls on

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.490 
happens is when the lever here pulls on
the<00:01:05.490> on<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.350> scale<00:01:08.480> it<00:01:09.480> actually<00:01:09.840> wants<00:01:10.350> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the on the scale it actually wants to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.620 
the on the scale it actually wants to
pull<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.040> pulley<00:01:11.870> back<00:01:14.180> towards<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> handle

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
pull this pulley back towards the handle

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.160 
pull this pulley back towards the handle
and<00:01:15.980> that<00:01:16.980> was<00:01:17.130> causing<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.150> l-brackets<00:01:19.080> that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and that was causing the l-brackets that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.190 
and that was causing the l-brackets that
I<00:01:19.200> had<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.220> bend<00:01:20.640> back<00:01:21.200> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
I had right here to really bend back and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.880 
I had right here to really bend back and
it<00:01:22.979> wasn't<00:01:23.400> doing<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:23.820> very<00:01:23.850> good<00:01:24.060> job<00:01:24.210> of

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
it wasn't doing a very good job of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.140 
it wasn't doing a very good job of
taking<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> weight<00:01:26.190> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.550> heavier<00:01:26.880> hives

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
taking the weight of the heavier hives

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.490 
taking the weight of the heavier hives
so<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.619> upgraded<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.940> L<00:01:30.090> brackets<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so I have upgraded the L brackets to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.520 
so I have upgraded the L brackets to
some<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:31.979> beefy<00:01:32.490> ones<00:01:33.380> hopefully<00:01:34.380> this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
some really beefy ones hopefully this

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.880 
some really beefy ones hopefully this
will<00:01:34.650> work

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
will work

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950 
will work
I<00:01:35.040> haven't<00:01:35.340> tested<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.700> yet<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.780> imagine

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
I haven't tested it yet but I imagine

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.520 
I haven't tested it yet but I imagine
that<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.380> will<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> job<00:01:38.520> these<00:01:39.270> are<00:01:39.530> much

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that it will do the job these are much

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.980 
that it will do the job these are much
thicker<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.220> wider<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.660> should<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.930> able

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
thicker and wider so they should be able

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.240 
thicker and wider so they should be able
to<00:01:43.080> take<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.410> weight<00:01:43.590> better<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.970> we'll<00:01:45.090> see

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
to take the weight better so we'll see

00:01:46.250 --> 00:02:04.999 
to take the weight better so we'll see
Wayne<00:01:47.250> Queen<00:01:47.670> Beatrice

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:27.760 

56.5<00:02:07.739> not<00:02:08.739> 56<00:02:09.280> even

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.250 

it's<00:02:28.010> drifting<00:02:28.400> down

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:42.670 

fifty-two<00:02:33.780> cell<00:02:34.780> then<00:02:34.989> 52

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.839 

those<00:02:43.340> l-brackets<00:02:44.080> much<00:02:45.080> beefier<00:02:45.680> now<00:02:45.920> really

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
those l-brackets much beefier now really

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:57.400 
those l-brackets much beefier now really
held<00:02:47.060> up<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.540> good<00:02:48.379> weight<00:02:48.590> on<00:02:48.860> there

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.240 

Queen<00:02:58.040> Anne

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.000 

or<00:03:04.430> just<00:03:04.970> settle<00:03:05.270> out

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.010 

65.2

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.490 

yeah<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:19.690> made<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.750> big<00:03:21.050> difference<00:03:21.230> having<00:03:22.060> good

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
yeah I made a big difference having good

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.069 
yeah I made a big difference having good
l-brackets<00:03:24.500> on<00:03:24.650> there

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.799 

felt<00:03:28.079> much<00:03:28.379> stronger
