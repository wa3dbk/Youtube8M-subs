00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.000
 Hello, I'm working on the same scheme. 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.070
 faced such a problem as 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.230
 determine that two signals are the same 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.420
 power and today will show you how this 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.369
 the problem was solved and so starting from 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.140
 installation of two comparators directed 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.880
 they are both ways in both directions 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.009
 subtraction and accordingly so 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.410
 corner fit further pave 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.779
 redstone here and here green blocks it 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.669
 the inputs of our circuit opposite comparators 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.720
 we put blocks on them we install 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.450
 red torches 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.880
 one more block by torch and us 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.829
 you will need two torches inside that is on 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.379
 inner side of the upper blocks 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.010
 it over the comparator me then you need one 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.649
 from entrances 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.899
 put a block on this block place the torch 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.000
 and so that the torch is not above 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.489
 our diet and a piece of stone and 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.829
 above all our scheme is ready this is our 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.350
 the output signal is now lit because 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.000
 we have the same signal at the inputs 2 0 well 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.399
 I have a ready-made example here. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.859
 let's look at it also 2 0 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.809
 the output signal is there is a signal we have 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.880
 different as you can see the delay 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.740
 about half a second we have a signal to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.990
 the output disappears which indicates that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.090
 The signal is different for us, respectively. 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.619
 there will also be different signals and if we 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.790
 give the same output 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.100
 signal appears 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.049
 This works for all combinations of essentially 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.970
 here are two halves each half 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.670
 engaged next let's say this night 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.040
 the first signal is 2 we are from the first signal 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.720
 subtracting 2 ie comparing 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.350
 that the first signal is less than or equal to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.329
 the second 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.369
 accordingly, if it is true, that is 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.890
 here we will have 0 output 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.229
 fact lit top torch extinguished second 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.180
 part of the circuit does the opposite compares 2 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.399
 with the first respectively executing these two 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.920
 equations we get equality at the top 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.689
 we have essentially a logical element and well 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.030
 on the way out naturally we get ours 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.280
 signal if we have a signal at the inputs 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 such a scheme is equal I hope that you 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.890
 everything was clear thank you very much for 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.420
