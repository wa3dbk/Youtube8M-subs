it<00:02:06.640> depends<00:02:07.210> on<00:02:07.480> how<00:02:07.720> often<00:02:07.930> they're<00:02:08.200> doing<00:02:08.470> it

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
it depends on how often they're doing it

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.950 
it depends on how often they're doing it
and<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.070> on<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.820> am<00:02:10.000> very<00:02:10.030> pleased<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.780> draw

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
and so on but I am very pleased to draw

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.600 
and so on but I am very pleased to draw

parallel with children before slightly
something<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.390> I've<00:02:13.570> been<00:02:13.600> suggesting<00:02:14.070> that

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
something that I've been suggesting that

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.880 
something that I've been suggesting that
the<00:02:15.610> cyber<00:02:15.940> world<00:02:16.090> are<00:02:16.690> giving<00:02:17.320> people<00:02:17.650> here

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
the cyber world are giving people here

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.150 
the cyber world are giving people here
and<00:02:18.070> our<00:02:18.250> experiences<00:02:19.000> with<00:02:19.270> no<00:02:19.720> consequences

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
and our experiences with no consequences

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.040 
and our experiences with no consequences
where<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.280> have<00:02:21.490> high<00:02:21.850> excitement<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.960> of

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
where you have high excitement and of

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.930 
where you have high excitement and of
course<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.350> can<00:02:23.500> be<00:02:23.560> nice<00:02:23.740> sometimes<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.520> as

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
course that can be nice sometimes and as

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.880 
course that can be nice sometimes and as
you<00:02:25.090> say<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.480> make<00:02:25.660> me<00:02:25.810> more<00:02:25.960> open<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.860> things

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
you say that make me more open to things

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.190 
you say that make me more open to things
but<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:27.850> need<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.150> always<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.570> life<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.870> balance

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
but we need is always in life of balance

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.140 
but we need is always in life of balance
and<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.070> think<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.460> issue<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.910> we<00:02:31.000> need<00:02:31.030> to

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
and I think the issue that we need to

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.570 
and I think the issue that we need to
address<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.920> good<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.220> they're

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
address is is it good that they're

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.390 
address is is it good that they're
spending<00:02:33.910> 30-plus<00:02:34.480> hours<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.840> week<00:02:34.990> doing

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
spending 30-plus hours a week doing

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.100 
spending 30-plus hours a week doing
probably<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.580> it's<00:02:36.970> very<00:02:37.150> nice<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.870> it's

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
probably not it's very nice and it's

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.260 
probably not it's very nice and it's
relaxing<00:02:38.620> like<00:02:39.220> some<00:02:39.550> people<00:02:39.640> go<00:02:39.880> for<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> drink

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
relaxing like some people go for a drink

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.970 
relaxing like some people go for a drink
something<00:02:40.660> about<00:02:40.900> some<00:02:41.290> people<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.680> skin

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
something about some people get a skin

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.460 
something about some people get a skin
you<00:02:42.640> can<00:02:42.760> do<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.060> yes<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.420> course<00:02:43.630> but<00:02:44.320> you

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
you can do that yes of course but you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.590 
you can do that yes of course but you
need<00:02:44.620> also<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.010> have<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.250> real<00:02:45.520> life<00:02:45.760> with<00:02:46.420> real

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
need also to have a real life with real

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
world otherwise will become someone who

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.510 
world otherwise will become someone who
can't<00:02:52.480> cope<00:02:52.750> with<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.350> robot<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.980> especially

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
can't cope with the robot and especially

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.330 
can't cope with the robot and especially
for<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> young<00:02:54.850> person<00:02:55.240> they<00:02:55.930> won't<00:02:56.170> learn<00:02:56.500> how

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
for a young person they won't learn how

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.100 
for a young person they won't learn how
to<00:02:57.400> live<00:02:57.820> in<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.030> real<00:02:58.209> world<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.840> means

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
to live in the real world and that means

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.750 
to live in the real world and that means
that<00:02:59.290> they<00:02:59.380> will<00:02:59.590> become<00:02:59.890> dysfunctional<00:03:00.190> and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that they will become dysfunctional and

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.280 
that they will become dysfunctional and
not<00:03:01.000> be<00:03:01.120> able<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.330> establish<00:03:01.480> relationships

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
not be able to establish relationships

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.220 
not be able to establish relationships
become<00:03:03.130> depressed<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:04.690> therefore<00:03:04.870> you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
become depressed and so therefore you

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.650 
become depressed and so therefore you
need<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.820> think<00:03:06.820> about<00:03:07.000> those<00:03:07.300> who<00:03:07.450> couldn't

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
need to think about those who couldn't

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.800 
need to think about those who couldn't
bad<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.200> how<00:03:08.890> we<00:03:08.950> can<00:03:09.040> harness<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.730> good<00:03:09.910> like

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
bad and how we can harness the good like

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.440 
bad and how we can harness the good like
my<00:03:11.050> mum<00:03:11.290> but<00:03:12.190> at<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.400> same<00:03:12.610> time<00:03:12.820> how<00:03:13.090> we<00:03:13.150> can

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
my mum but at the same time how we can

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.150 
my mum but at the same time how we can
minimize<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:14.200> value<00:03:14.470> differences<00:03:14.890> but<00:03:15.040> we

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
minimize the value differences but we

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.500 
minimize the value differences but we
need<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.459> think<00:03:15.610> about<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:15.940> that's<00:03:16.209> not<00:03:16.269> so

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
need to think about this that's not so

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.759 
need to think about this that's not so
glad<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.870> come<00:03:17.019> know<00:03:17.170> why<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.320> wanted<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.680> come

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
here and I'll do I can get rotation

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.810 
here and I'll do I can get rotation
because<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.920> think<00:03:20.980> you're<00:03:21.220> more<00:03:21.370> we<00:03:21.519> will<00:03:21.640> talk

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820

about this more we can think about it

the more you as you in the media

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.780 
the more you as you in the media
especially<00:03:25.410> can<00:03:26.410> get<00:03:26.560> debates<00:03:26.860> going<00:03:27.010> perhaps

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
especially can get debates going perhaps

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.699 
especially can get debates going perhaps
you<00:03:27.940> could<00:03:28.090> do<00:03:28.269> surveys<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:28.989> your<00:03:29.140> newspapers

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
you could do surveys but your newspapers

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.949 
you could do surveys but your newspapers
your<00:03:29.890> TV<00:03:30.340> channels<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.330> more<00:03:31.540> the

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
your TV channels the more the

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.570 
your TV channels the more the

anywhere we can change things we can't

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
just sleep walking to this but the more

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.390 
just sleep walking to this but the more

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
we can raise awareness someone points it

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.520 
we can raise awareness someone points it

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
is and I know this is a goal because so

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.730 
is and I know this is a goal because so
many<00:03:41.620> people<00:03:42.070> talk<00:03:42.280> about<00:03:42.310> it
