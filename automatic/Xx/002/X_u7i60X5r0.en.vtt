00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 battle team genre popular but 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.210
 somewhat monotonous appearance of the call of 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.820
 duty to counter strike 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.519
 everywhere gunfire grenades and 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.500
 other attributes of modernity in general 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.820
 very strange that the domestic panzar 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.160
 almost the first successful attempt 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.859
 make teams action fantasy 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.779
 according to the latest fashion panzar action with 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.720
 pumping for each fight hero 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.880
 accrued experience and gold and the ratio 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.769
 you can change the sliders if you want 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.119
 donate money to fast 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.880
 development or vice versa 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.130
 besides slaughtering heroes get resources 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.309
 to create armor and healing potions 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.440
 can use real for impatient 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.840
 who want to quickly purchase 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.120
 the main action takes place on in combat 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 maps from miniature meadows where 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.840
 teams take over 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 single target up to challenging 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.610
 the rent will not be long forgotten 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.710
 on the type of cards and depends on the rules of the game 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.050
 one they are elementary key point 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.719
 gives points to the team that I have his day on 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.609
 other points of capture are several one 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.040
 the country is storming the other is protecting 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.070
 if the usual team battle wall on 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.500
 wall the battles themselves are in spirit very 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.229
 similar to team stomping and from the same 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.869
 warcraft and or warhammer online will give 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.850
 there are character options 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.369
 classic talent trees and subject 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.439
 if heroes are with her but skill decides 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.200
 quick response and generally the skill of playing 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.030
 Adventure kick back for example taxes in 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.299
 hurt the front and the one who looks 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.310
 digital this lives longer the unit goes 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.900
 too much to save health and even 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.850
 weak opponent on the belly 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.090
 blocking the roadblock Russian rear enemy 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.800
 will help to hold out until help 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.870
 besides traditional role health and 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.630
 mana here is the third parameter this 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.190
 energy it diverges to run fast and 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.860
 power strikes which are much 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.930
 more effective than usual for a beginner who 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.780
 just created your first hero and 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.550
 hitting the battle everything happens soon 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.140
 just will remind senseless 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:06.080
 meat crowd running into the light someone rushing to 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.630
 the center of the map there meets a crowd of enemies and 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.150
 gone-gone killed wait a few 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.120
 seconds and reborn in the same place 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.430
 or on the taken point we run to the center again 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.740
 cards of someone we wet from someone 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.440
 embrace and so on until you get bored 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.750
 but the first impression is very deceptive 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.880
 worth starting to pay attention to what 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.400
 going around and being clear here 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.800
 something more is going on than a group 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.320
 cut and beautiful becomes obvious 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.260
 that without a team to catch on the field 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.930
 battles nothing of the group here is taking shape 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.390
 very motley delves into that elf ears 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.769
 network product lte after all four races by 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.260
 2 classes for each 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.630
 Greenskin fanged menacingly 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.880
 tanks in one hand the sword from the other right 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.670
 shield tanks holds damage grab points 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.440
 and drawn by five enemies but by 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.590
 useful ability magical defense 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.510
 which stops magic and bullets under 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.360
 under the cover of the tank, the team goes forward 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.769
 like a siege machine around tanks 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.350
 usually jumps berserks 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.330
 also green-skinned arches but with 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.239
 double handed batons and no shields 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.060
 the leaves of the battle which they break in to 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.910
 pounding rapture left and right and those 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.310
 and the others did nothing without treatment and 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.000
 behind the backs of the orcs usually run 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.820
 tails 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.970
 paladins in hand scepter to onvif mountains 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.130
 slaves or heals friends sneak around the corners 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.080
 inquisitors having caught the moment they leave in 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.299
 stealth term i'm welcome 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.380
 hanging ira sudden powerful blow by two 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.870
 swords in the back 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.180
 Most often gets alfikom which 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.519
 issued prepared 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.099
 magicians or run in the thick of the battle tremor 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.870
 living all on earth 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.060
 all businesslike and fussy gnomes 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.950
 bounce us not walkers they 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.590
 laid out useful to such 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.079
 install teleportator and others 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.209
 cocked in a trap and mines collect machine guns 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.010
 at strategic locations and sent in 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.069
 deadly lead to the enemy 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.349
 gifts fun that's probably it 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.959
 the main thing that the developers managed to panzar 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.090
 it would certainly be nice to get not 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.129
 only fights on the open world however his 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.510
 absence is hardly a big problem for 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.510
 clean pvp lover
