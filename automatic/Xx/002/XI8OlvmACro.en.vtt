00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.670
 welcome to the fifth video 10 that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.010
 they will make up our boxcutter 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.830
 Swiss emergency service in the classroom 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.380
 today the strategy I share with you 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.090
 we will need to weld it even more 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.710
 our relationship by class 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.720
 furthermore it will also serve you indirectly 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.310
 to call attention perhaps to 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.360
 some absent- minded boy to cheer up a 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.489
 fortify some girl for maybe 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.370
 you are a little down or a 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
 then no reward to corroborate the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.579
 job that some guy already is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.859
 doing so well 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.320
 what I'm talking about a simple one 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.719
 strategy a simple little step from 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.239
 make your own class what it is 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.920
 this physical contact physical contact 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.370
 with the boys, therefore, what is owed 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.149
 do when maybe it will happen already 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.659
 retrace a few steps 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.199
 within the three between the poles of between 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.609
 boys and girls 0 every now and then 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.830
 touch make a shoulder or 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.510
 bend over to look at the work that is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.950
 on the boy and simply do it 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.990
 putting a bench has no nature 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.490
 shot or a hand on the arm and of 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.010
 what you have to do is simply to 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.160
 reduce for a few moments even yesterday 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.310
 the distance after distance with that 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.290
 vacation guy that student at 0 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.380
 there simply to touch this 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.820
 it will be useful for you to call back 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.560
 attention maybe some guy from 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.160
 state that simply passing 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.080
 you will write and strengthen those relationships 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.760
 just with relationships and therefore 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.500
 are already told in a way with i 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.420
 kids for miter fees 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.730
 experiment with this technique as usual 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.440
 I invite you to let me know how it went 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.660
 so after having the maximum of 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.270
 results that will give you is dyed are a 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.650
 great job appointment at 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.650
 next video hello
