a struggle for me it took me forever and

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.560 
a struggle for me it took me forever and
then<00:01:12.040> I<00:01:12.070> scooped<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.640> out<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.940> put<00:01:13.120> it<00:01:13.210> into<00:01:13.360> my

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
container to mix things and in what

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.690 
container to mix things and in what
you're<00:01:17.170> going<00:01:17.409> to<00:01:17.560> need<00:01:17.710> half<00:01:18.009> a<00:01:18.159> cup<00:01:18.369> of<00:01:18.490> this

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
you're going to need half a cup of this

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.580 
you're going to need half a cup of this
so<00:01:18.909> just<00:01:19.119> eyeball<00:01:19.630> it<00:01:19.659> that's<00:01:19.990> what<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.200> did

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
so just eyeball it that's what I did

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.929 
so just eyeball it that's what I did
because<00:01:20.710> you<00:01:20.890> can't<00:01:21.189> really<00:01:21.340> scoop<00:01:21.759> out

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
because you can't really scoop out

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.310 
because you can't really scoop out
something<00:01:22.299> that's<00:01:22.390> solid<00:01:22.689> and<00:01:23.020> get<00:01:23.140> the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
something that's solid and get the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.319 
something that's solid and get the
correct<00:01:23.619> amounts<00:01:24.100> but<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.549> actually<00:01:24.820> did<00:01:25.180> get

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
correct amounts but I actually did get

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.690 
correct amounts but I actually did get
enough<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:25.750> just<00:01:25.930> eyeball<00:01:26.290> it<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.590> it'll<00:01:27.430> be

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
enough so just eyeball it and it'll be

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.230 
enough so just eyeball it and it'll be
good<00:01:27.969> and<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:30.490> after<00:01:30.820> that<00:01:30.850> you're<00:01:31.060> going<00:01:31.180> to

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
good and then after that you're going to

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.330 
good and then after that you're going to
want<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.479> microwave<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.259> microwave<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.100> in

15<00:01:33.790> second<00:01:34.210> ink<00:01:34.390> reveals<00:01:34.689> just<00:01:34.810> because<00:01:35.409> in<00:01:35.680> my

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
15 second ink reveals just because in my

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.679 
15 second ink reveals just because in my
fern<00:01:36.430> ends<00:01:36.939> you<00:01:37.000> don't<00:01:37.180> want<00:01:37.329> that<00:01:37.479> so<00:01:37.540> i

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
fern ends you don't want that so i

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.600 
fern ends you don't want that so i
microwaved<00:01:38.290> it<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:38.560> 15<00:01:38.890> seconds<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.460> then<00:01:39.520> it

microwaved it for 15 seconds and then it

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.279 
microwaved it for 15 seconds and then it

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.380 
chips and the first thing you do is
empty<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.530> chocolate<00:03:09.980> fudge<00:03:10.160> cake<00:03:10.190> mix<00:03:11.060> into

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
empty the chocolate fudge cake mix into

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.780 
empty the chocolate fudge cake mix into
the<00:03:11.750> container<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.950> then<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.430> add<00:03:13.580> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the container and then you add the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.850 
the container and then you add the
chocolate<00:03:13.970> chips<00:03:14.330> into<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.630> container<00:03:15.440> and

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
chocolate chips into the container and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.860 
chocolate chips into the container and
that's<00:03:16.010> basically<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.030> then<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.540> decided

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
that's basically it and then I decided

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.750 
that's basically it and then I decided
to<00:03:17.990> try<00:03:18.110> cookie<00:03:18.560> mix<00:03:18.770> on<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.130> side<00:03:19.430> because

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
to try cookie mix on the side because

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.330 
to try cookie mix on the side because
it's<00:03:20.330> for<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.720> cookie<00:03:21.140> bar<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.590> it's<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.070> good

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
it's for a cookie bar and it's so good

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.430 
it's for a cookie bar and it's so good
so<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.210> wrote<00:03:23.540> cookie<00:03:23.840> mix<00:03:24.020> on<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.230> side

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
so I just wrote cookie mix on the side

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.350 
so I just wrote cookie mix on the side
and<00:03:24.470> then<00:03:24.800> on<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:25.070> lid<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:25.430> just<00:03:25.640> wrote<00:03:25.820> few

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.270 
and then on the lid I just wrote few
directions<00:03:26.690> which<00:03:27.110> this<00:03:27.620> part<00:03:27.890> was<00:03:28.070> so

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
recommend doing a bigger bag and then

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.960 
recommend doing a bigger bag and then
you<00:04:06.170> just<00:04:06.380> cut<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.770> bag<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.310> then<00:04:07.520> you<00:04:07.670> tie

you just cut the bag and then you tie

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.300 
you just cut the bag and then you tie
the<00:04:08.030> fuzzy<00:04:08.450> sticks<00:04:08.870> around<00:04:09.050> it<00:04:09.890> because<00:04:10.010> this

the fuzzy sticks around it because this

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.040 
the fuzzy sticks around it because this
will<00:04:10.489> secure<00:04:10.670> it<00:04:10.970> so<00:04:11.000> i<00:04:11.180> recommend<00:04:11.870> you

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
will secure it so i recommend you

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.540 
will secure it so i recommend you
twisting<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.590> as<00:04:12.680> much<00:04:12.890> as<00:04:12.920> possible<00:04:13.190> because

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
twisting it as much as possible because

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.160 
twisting it as much as possible because
I<00:04:13.700> spilled<00:04:14.030> mine<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.540> was<00:04:14.660> terrible<00:04:15.020> and

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
I spilled mine and it was terrible and

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.170 
I spilled mine and it was terrible and
then<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.770> want<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:16.010> shape<00:04:16.220> them<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.700> form<00:04:17.000> the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
then you want to shape them to form the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.240 
then you want to shape them to form the
antlers<00:04:17.870> because<00:04:18.290> ranges<00:04:18.769> have<00:04:18.950> antlers

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
antlers because ranges have antlers

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.570 
antlers because ranges have antlers
stuff<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:21.109> then<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:21.739> just<00:04:21.919> want<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.190> cut<00:04:22.400> them

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
stuff and then you just want to cut them

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.080 
stuff and then you just want to cut them
so<00:04:22.850> they<00:04:23.060> look<00:04:23.360> like<00:04:23.390> antlers<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:25.160> then

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
so they look like antlers and then

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.220 
so they look like antlers and then
you're<00:04:26.180> going<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.330> take<00:04:26.419> your<00:04:26.570> hot<00:04:26.810> glue<00:04:26.840> gun

say<00:05:15.320> it's<00:05:16.220> kind<00:05:16.580> of<00:05:16.640> a<00:05:16.729> tie<00:05:16.910> between<00:05:16.970> this<00:05:17.390> one

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
say it's kind of a tie between this one

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.460 
say it's kind of a tie between this one
in<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.810> hot<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.910> chocolate<00:05:19.910> bar<00:05:20.360> in<00:05:20.660> a<00:05:20.780> jar<00:05:21.020> 1b

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
in the hot the chocolate bar in a jar 1b

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.440 
in the hot the chocolate bar in a jar 1b
just<00:05:21.680> because<00:05:21.919> they're<00:05:22.070> both<00:05:22.310> so<00:05:22.640> simple<00:05:23.180> and

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
just because they're both so simple and

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.330 
just because they're both so simple and
I<00:05:23.810> don't<00:05:24.410> know<00:05:24.470> this<00:05:24.620> one<00:05:24.770> was<00:05:24.919> just<00:05:25.070> really

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
I don't know this one was just really

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.980 
I don't know this one was just really
easy<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.729> do<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.090> all<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:26.419> pretty<00:05:26.660> much<00:05:26.720> did

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
easy to do and all you pretty much did

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.600 
easy to do and all you pretty much did
was<00:05:27.200> draw<00:05:27.440> so<00:05:27.680> if<00:05:27.740> you<00:05:27.830> like<00:05:27.950> drawing<00:05:28.280> i<00:05:28.430> think

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
was draw so if you like drawing i think

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.150 
was draw so if you like drawing i think
this<00:05:28.729> gift<00:05:29.000> would<00:05:29.150> be<00:05:29.300> perfect<00:05:29.810> for<00:05:29.870> you<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.380> I

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
just pretty much drew ran up things all

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.409 
just pretty much drew ran up things all
over<00:05:32.900> it<00:05:33.410> and<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:34.070> ended<00:05:34.550> up<00:05:34.669> looking<00:05:34.850> cute<00:05:35.240> so

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
over it and it ended up looking cute so

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
and then right here I just decided to

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.600
