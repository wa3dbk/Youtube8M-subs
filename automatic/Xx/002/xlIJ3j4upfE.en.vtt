of the fast here in this top 5 now this

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.860 
of the fast here in this top 5 now this
is<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.040> our<00:00:32.160> attachments<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.270> rapid<00:00:33.660> fire

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870

this<00:00:50.309> thing<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.760> notorious<00:00:51.570> akimbo

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
this thing was notorious akimbo

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.410 
this thing was notorious akimbo
and<00:00:52.440> no<00:00:52.920> wonder<00:00:53.489> when<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> spewed<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.360> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and no wonder when it spewed out a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
and no wonder when it spewed out a
ridiculous<00:00:56.809> 1034<00:00:57.809> rounds<00:00:58.379> per<00:00:58.559> minute<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
ridiculous 1034 rounds per minute so you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.189 
ridiculous 1034 rounds per minute so you
can<00:00:59.550> imagine<00:00:59.789> doubling<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.989> you've

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
can imagine doubling that up and you've

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.139 
can imagine doubling that up and you've
got<00:01:01.230> something<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.070> little<00:01:02.640> bit<00:01:02.760> over<00:01:03.000> too

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
got something a little bit over too

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.420 
got something a little bit over too
powered<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.750> little<00:01:03.989> bit<00:01:04.140> crazy<00:01:04.430> smash

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
this on with steady aim and it was one

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.020 
this on with steady aim and it was one
of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> deadliest<00:01:07.979> forces<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.760> modern

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
now for me this gun was quite bouncy

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.820 
now for me this gun was quite bouncy
quite<00:01:40.120> difficult<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.290> but<00:01:41.560> at<00:01:41.680> that

quite difficult to you so but at that
fast<00:01:42.130> far<00:01:42.430> I<00:01:42.460> I<00:01:42.820> do<00:01:42.970> already<00:01:43.450> find<00:01:43.720> it<00:01:43.840> that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
fast far I I do already find it that

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.330 
fast far I I do already find it that
deadly<00:01:44.410> it's<00:01:44.530> not<00:01:44.650> something<00:01:45.010> I've<00:01:45.130> really

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.620 
technically has no burst delay between
bursts<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.489> can't<00:03:57.819> get<00:03:58.000> that<00:03:58.090> high<00:03:58.329> fire

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
bursts so you can't get that high fire

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.750 
bursts so you can't get that high fire
rate<00:03:58.810> although<00:03:59.290> in<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.739> more<00:03:59.890> practical<00:04:00.160> sense

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
rate although in a more practical sense

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.430 
rate although in a more practical sense
it's<00:04:01.090> quite<00:04:01.239> rare<00:04:01.630> that<00:04:01.660> you'll<00:04:01.959> get<00:04:02.200> that

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
it's quite rare that you'll get that

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.050 
it's quite rare that you'll get that
quite<00:04:02.680> high<00:04:02.889> fire<00:04:03.160> rate<00:04:03.280> but<00:04:03.519> it<00:04:03.609> is<00:04:03.760> possible

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
quite high fire rate but it is possible

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.569 
quite high fire rate but it is possible
so<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.930> is<00:04:05.079> up<00:04:05.290> there<00:04:05.530> with<00:04:05.739> these<00:04:05.920> top<00:04:06.250> three

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
so it is up there with these top three

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.660 
so it is up there with these top three
fastest<00:04:07.450> firing<00:04:07.930> weapons<00:04:08.440> for<00:04:08.950> me<00:04:09.160> this<00:04:09.489> was

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
fastest firing weapons for me this was

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.729 
fastest firing weapons for me this was
my<00:04:09.700> favorite<00:04:10.450> out<00:04:10.600> of<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.780> three<00:04:10.930> because<00:04:11.560> I

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
my favorite out of the three because I

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.680 
my favorite out of the three because I
found<00:04:12.069> this<00:04:12.310> actually<00:04:12.639> really<00:04:12.760> useful<00:04:13.060> range

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
found this actually really useful range

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.050 
found this actually really useful range
as<00:04:13.900> well<00:04:14.109> I<00:04:14.319> tend<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:14.829> love<00:04:15.160> burst<00:04:15.489> weapons<00:04:15.940> in

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
as well I tend to love burst weapons in

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.569 
as well I tend to love burst weapons in
