and<00:02:46.860> tell<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.099> know<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.489> i<00:02:47.519> can<00:02:47.580> continue<00:02:48.180> to

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
and tell this know so i can continue to

the<00:02:48.450> video<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:50.220> reason<00:02:50.519> for<00:02:50.549> that<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
the video the reason for that is is the

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.120 
the video the reason for that is is the

startup<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.989> i'm<00:02:55.110> going<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.319> tell<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.650> no<00:02:55.920> and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
startup so i'm going to tell it no and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.930 
startup so i'm going to tell it no and
