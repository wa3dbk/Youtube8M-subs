scenes there and because Ivan let's talk
about<00:01:09.530> those<00:01:09.829> waves<00:01:10.189> because<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:10.579> were<00:01:10.700> you

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
about those waves because you were you

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.359 
about those waves because you were you
were<00:01:11.030> saying<00:01:11.060> like<00:01:11.359> 500<00:01:11.930> miles<00:01:12.170> for<00:01:12.770> our<00:01:12.799> US

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
were saying like 500 miles for our US

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.889 
were saying like 500 miles for our US
audience<00:01:14.140> 800<00:01:15.140> kilometers<00:01:15.649> per<00:01:15.680> hour<00:01:15.920> for

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
audience 800 kilometers per hour for

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.480 
audience 800 kilometers per hour for
global<00:01:17.899> audience<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.530> mean<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:19.159> just

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
global audience I mean it just

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.090 
global audience I mean it just
extraordinary<00:01:20.299> strength<00:01:21.140> involved<00:01:21.829> in<00:01:21.950> that

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
extraordinary strength involved in that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.520 
extraordinary strength involved in that
and<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.640> say<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:23.060> comes<00:01:23.359> presumably<00:01:24.320> that

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
and you say it comes presumably that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.469 
and you say it comes presumably that
first<00:01:24.829> one<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.219> the<00:01:25.369> strongest<00:01:25.789> and<00:01:26.060> then<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
first one is the strongest and then the

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.149 
first one is the strongest and then the
ones<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:26.929> follow<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:27.350> weaker<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:28.039> that

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
ones that follow a weaker is that

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.550 
ones that follow a weaker is that
correct<00:01:28.429> or<00:01:28.609> no<00:01:28.759> not<00:01:29.149> necessarily<00:01:29.780> if<00:01:30.409> you

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
correct or no not necessarily if you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.039 
correct or no not necessarily if you
remember<00:01:30.890> in<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.039> abandoned<00:01:31.549> arch<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:32.049> tsunami

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
remember in the abandoned arch a tsunami

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.739 
remember in the abandoned arch a tsunami
the<00:01:33.439> initial<00:01:34.429> one<00:01:34.640> was<00:01:34.820> bad<00:01:35.090> enough<00:01:35.420> but<00:01:35.600> then

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
the initial one was bad enough but then

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:38.859 
the initial one was bad enough but then
we<00:01:35.869> had<00:01:36.399> essentially<00:01:37.399> a<00:01:37.759> wave<00:01:38.090> three<00:01:38.539> and<00:01:38.689> wave

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
we had essentially a wave three and wave

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.620 
we had essentially a wave three and wave
for<00:01:39.229> which<00:01:39.469> were<00:01:39.619> actually<00:01:40.039> higher<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.939> were

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
for which were actually higher and were

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.919 
for which were actually higher and were
so<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.950> damage<00:01:43.189> is<00:01:43.789> ongoing<00:01:44.179> right<00:01:44.899> now

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
so the the damage is ongoing right now

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.349 
so the the damage is ongoing right now
but<00:01:45.649> may<00:01:45.770> continue<00:01:46.310> over<00:01:46.609> the<00:01:46.640> next<00:01:46.729> several

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
but may continue over the next several

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.020 
but may continue over the next several
hours<00:01:47.659> because<00:01:48.289> we<00:01:49.219> talked<00:01:49.670> about<00:01:49.819> these

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
hours because we talked about these

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.419 
hours because we talked about these
waves<00:01:50.359> that<00:01:50.630> come<00:01:50.869> in<00:01:51.109> each<00:01:51.429> successively

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
waves that come in each successively

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.029 
waves that come in each successively
