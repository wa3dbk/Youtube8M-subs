know the higher town halls and then they

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
know the higher town halls and then they
change<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.879> matchmaking<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.750> only<00:01:04.199> see

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
change to matchmaking so you only see

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980

your own pretty much around your own
town<00:01:07.590> halls<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.520> means<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.000> these

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
town halls so what that means is these

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.190 
town halls so what that means is these
guys<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.229> getting<00:01:10.439> destroyed<00:01:11.090> 59<00:01:12.090> cups<00:01:12.479> by

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
so it's that much harder to do it so the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.870 
so it's that much harder to do it so the
achievement<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.450> he's<00:01:19.259> got<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.850> to

it's<00:02:02.490> quite<00:02:02.729> an<00:02:02.820> interesting<00:02:03.030> attack<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.659> me<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
it's quite an interesting attack on me I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.959 
it's quite an interesting attack on me I
think<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:05.130> know<00:02:05.250> he's<00:02:05.430> been<00:02:05.520> attacked<00:02:05.820> by<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
think you know he's been attacked by a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.919 
think you know he's been attacked by a
master<00:02:06.420> -<00:02:06.659> Grove<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.380> think<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.310> put<00:02:08.929> 4,100

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
master - Grove I think was I put 4,100

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.010 
master - Grove I think was I put 4,100
so<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> master<00:02:11.039> -<00:02:11.220> attacking<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.730> 4100<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.750> is

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
so a master - attacking a 4100 this is

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.080 
so a master - attacking a 4100 this is
problem<00:02:13.410> he's<00:02:13.950> going<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.190> lose<00:02:14.370> 50<00:02:14.820> million

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
problem he's going to lose 50 million

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.420 
problem he's going to lose 50 million
trophies<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.780> fact<00:02:15.990> probably<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.190> caps

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
trophies in fact probably it so it caps
