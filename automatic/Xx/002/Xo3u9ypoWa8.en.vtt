hook bring it through the last two loops

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.710 
hook bring it through the last two loops
then<00:02:35.730> we're<00:02:35.910> going<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.210> chain<00:02:36.480> two<00:02:36.830> one<00:02:37.830> two

then we're going to chain two one two

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.420 
then we're going to chain two one two
then<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.080> second<00:02:40.620> chain<00:02:40.800> from<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.010> hook

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
then in the second chain from the hook

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.610 
then in the second chain from the hook
thus<00:02:41.610> loop<00:02:41.820> here<00:02:42.000> does<00:02:42.180> not<00:02:42.360> count<00:02:42.570> one<00:02:43.350> two

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
thus loop here does not count one two

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.590 
thus loop here does not count one two
we're<00:02:44.040> going<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.340> work<00:02:44.490> a<00:02:44.730> single<00:02:44.820> crochet

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
over and sometimes this might be just a

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.510 
over and sometimes this might be just a
little<00:06:38.780> nitpicky<00:06:39.200> type<00:06:39.740> of<00:06:39.920> thing<00:06:40.160> but

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
little nitpicky type of thing but

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.400 
little nitpicky type of thing but
sometimes<00:06:41.120> when<00:06:41.570> you<00:06:41.690> do<00:06:41.840> these<00:06:41.990> one-round

sometimes when you do these one-round

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.980 
sometimes when you do these one-round
projects<00:06:42.920> and<00:06:43.070> you<00:06:43.130> join<00:06:43.340> this<00:06:44.270> gap<00:06:44.630> is<00:06:44.960> a

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
projects and you join this gap is a

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.080 
projects and you join this gap is a
little<00:06:45.320> wider<00:06:45.590> than<00:06:46.400> some<00:06:46.430> of<00:06:46.760> these<00:06:46.850> other

ones if you're experiencing this when
you<00:06:50.540> go<00:06:50.690> to<00:06:50.750> weave<00:06:50.990> in<00:06:51.170> the<00:06:51.290> ends<00:06:51.680> just<00:06:52.580> pick<00:06:52.820> up

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
you go to weave in the ends just pick up

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.660 
you go to weave in the ends just pick up
the<00:06:54.530> one<00:06:54.770> side<00:06:55.480> bridge<00:06:56.480> it<00:06:56.630> across<00:06:57.040> across<00:06:58.040> to

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.670 
the one side bridge it across across to

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.120 
the one side bridge it across across to
the<00:06:58.790> other<00:06:58.910> side<00:06:59.300> sort<00:06:59.930> of<00:07:00.020> like<00:07:00.170> that<00:07:00.350> and

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
the other side sort of like that and

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.580 
the other side sort of like that and
that'll<00:07:01.400> kind<00:07:01.550> of<00:07:01.700> snug<00:07:02.120> those<00:07:02.450> corners<00:07:03.410> in

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
that'll kind of snug those corners in

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.870 
that'll kind of snug those corners in
see<00:07:03.950> how<00:07:03.980> it<00:07:04.130> kind<00:07:04.250> of<00:07:04.370> brought<00:07:04.610> it<00:07:04.730> together

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
see how it kind of brought it together

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.120 
see how it kind of brought it together
when<00:07:05.270> I<00:07:05.300> did<00:07:05.540> that<00:07:05.690> and<00:07:05.930> then<00:07:06.650> you<00:07:06.770> can<00:07:06.920> just

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.130 
when I did that and then you can just

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.410 
when I did that and then you can just
come<00:07:07.340> in<00:07:07.460> the<00:07:07.550> other<00:07:07.670> direction<00:07:08.120> to<00:07:08.860> finish

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
come in the other direction to finish

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:16.360 
come in the other direction to finish
weaving<00:07:11.420> your<00:07:11.750> end<00:07:11.900> in<00:07:14.920> these<00:07:15.920> one<00:07:16.130> round

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
weaving your end in these one round

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.300 
weaving your end in these one round
projects<00:07:16.880> are<00:07:17.600> really<00:07:17.930> tiny<00:07:18.260> so<00:07:18.830> sometimes

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310 
projects are really tiny so sometimes

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.540 
projects are really tiny so sometimes
they<00:07:20.150> can<00:07:20.300> be<00:07:20.330> a<00:07:20.450> little<00:07:20.720> fiddly<00:07:20.990> but<00:07:21.550> because
