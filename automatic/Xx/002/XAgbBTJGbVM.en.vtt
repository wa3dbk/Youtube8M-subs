00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.420
 education website number 1 of the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.799
 latin america personal 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.559
 So we 're back here with the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.250
 split video in the split happens 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.769
 more 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.130
 It's in this video, it's not just talking about 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.340
 division when the latter now 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.189
 divisor but its right decimal number 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.519
 so let's see this example look 24 / 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.949
 1.2 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.150
 We're seeing here that the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.180
 divider 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.290
 in this case here is the right decimal number 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.010
 now, how do we go? 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.219
 solving this account is very simple right? 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.980
 always have a will have a 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.960
 process will not take a class to 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.910
 People are going to have to do this. 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.090
 what you will have to do 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.980
 people delete the right comma and see 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.309
 how many decimal places after the comma 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.799
 in this case there is only one 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.990
 as there is only one decimal place only 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:15.830
 we'll add 10 just right 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:21.900
 so we already have the account prepared 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:25.680
 240/12 because 12 because people 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.170
 deleted the comma and added 10 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.200
 here in the dividend right 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.790
 now we will operate normally 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.950
 this division as this then let 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.130
 see here 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.180
 as here is a number that has two 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.540
 organisms 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.229
 here we will operate using the two 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:56.270
 certain numbers 24/12 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.270
 22 24 26 12 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:12.660
 24 - 24,000 / 1200 times 12 5 to 0 and the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.900
 account 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:23.129
 ends here right then 24 / 1,2 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.900
 will be equal to 20 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:42.950
 All right, let's see one more example here. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:42.950
 then 162 / 3.6 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:51.540
 we will do the first was the 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:53.730
 first step is to eliminate the comma see 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.870
 how many decimal places has a house 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.739
 decimal only growing 0 né 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:08.099
 I'm going to clean it just so we can 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:10.079
 become personal / good 36 so 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.919
 now how we operate operates the 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.079
 same way it 's here again we'll go 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.639
 see that it has two decimal places 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.819
 so we'll start with two houses 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:24.359
 July 16 by decimal 36 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.510
 In this case we will not, we will not be 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:33.599
 possible then we will do 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:44.989
 162 and now we're going to do 162 162 / 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:58.970
 36 certain this will be equal to 4 436 24 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:04:01.379
 with 246 3 12 and 2 162 minus 144 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:16.789
 borrowed here remembers everyone remembers 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:16.789
 Of course, it's going to be 12 810 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:34.190
 180/36 is equal to 5 56 33 53 15 and 3 18 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.039
 right 180 one hundred and eighty will be the same 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.560
 to zero 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.970
 one rises another example that just for us 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.970
 to see né 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:55.970
 it works only for us first 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:07.770
 see how we put those bills right 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:10.979
 so here 38 / 2,123 how do people 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:15.630
 will sort this very simple account 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:18.539
 this account is to eliminate the comma see 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:29.250
 how many decimal places do we have three 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:37.410
 Let's add 0123 to be cute 38 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:39.810
 thousand in this case or mil / 2123 we just 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:51.870
 do this account 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:06:05.210
 just to finish 2 / I'll leave the 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:06:09.319
 personal space 2 / 1,303 1127 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:12.259
 it's the same way 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:15.110
 Let's eliminate the comma, let's see. 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.849
 how many decimal places do we have in this 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:23.870
 if here are four 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:26.419
 then we will add 11234 zeros 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.979
 I'll clean once more to 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.229
 people are very clear that we are 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:38.680
 making 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:41.360
 netão here we have 20 thousand / 13,127 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:46.639
 Now it's just people settle the bill. 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:48.650
 Some educators recommend 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.889
 following videos to continue 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.889
 learning
