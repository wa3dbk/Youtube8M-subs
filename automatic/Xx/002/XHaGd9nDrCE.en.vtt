specifically<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.470> splash<00:00:22.920> petal<00:00:23.400> cataleya

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
specifically this splash petal cataleya

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.169 
specifically this splash petal cataleya
and<00:00:25.130> this<00:00:26.779> lay<00:00:27.779> there<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.560> steps

so with cattle a at work is they like a
little<00:00:39.110> bit<00:00:39.230> warmer<00:00:39.710> they're<00:00:40.430> going<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:40.640> be<00:00:40.760> an

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
little bit warmer they're going to be an

little bit warmer they're going to be an
intermediate<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.570> warm<00:00:41.870> work<00:00:42.140> it<00:00:42.760> they're

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
intermediate to warm work it they're

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.430 
intermediate to warm work it they're
going<00:00:43.880> to<00:00:43.940> like<00:00:44.120> daytime<00:00:44.960> temperature

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
going to like daytime temperature

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.369 
going to like daytime temperature
sometimes<00:00:45.739> somewhere<00:00:46.489> around<00:00:46.550> 75<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.420> 85

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
sometimes somewhere around 75 to 85

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.819 
sometimes somewhere around 75 to 85
degrees<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:49.730> a<00:00:50.059> nighttime<00:00:50.480> temperature<00:00:50.989> of

these are both Sun loving plants and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.109 
these are both Sun loving plants and
displayed<00:01:07.780> it<00:01:07.930> being<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:09.280> wintertime<00:01:09.790> now

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
displayed it being in wintertime now

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.660 
displayed it being in wintertime now
when<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.780> is<00:01:10.899> summer<00:01:11.170> these<00:01:12.100> guys<00:01:12.369> get<00:01:12.640> a

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
when it is summer these guys get a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.030 
when it is summer these guys get a
tremendous<00:01:13.060> amount<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.689> light<00:01:13.990> I<00:01:14.320> throw<00:01:14.920> them

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
tremendous amount of light I throw them

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.850 
tremendous amount of light I throw them
outside<00:01:15.220> on<00:01:15.939> sunny<00:01:16.659> days<00:01:16.750> I<00:01:17.320> leave<00:01:17.590> them<00:01:17.740> in

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
outside on sunny days I leave them in

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.130 
outside on sunny days I leave them in
the<00:01:17.950> brightest<00:01:18.340> spot<00:01:18.399> in<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.790> greenhouse<00:01:19.240> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.200 

what<00:01:23.140> that's<00:01:23.350> doing<00:01:23.560> is<00:01:23.920> giving<00:01:24.909> them<00:01:25.030> energy

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
what that's doing is giving them energy

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.450 
what that's doing is giving them energy
to<00:01:25.630> make<00:01:26.380> these<00:01:26.560> wonderful<00:01:26.710> blooms<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.369> the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
to make these wonderful blooms in the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.639 
to make these wonderful blooms in the
winter<00:01:27.700> time<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:29.110> one<00:01:29.289> is<00:01:29.409> interesting

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
winter time this one is interesting

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.120 
winter time this one is interesting
because<00:01:29.890> it's<00:01:30.250> on<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.369> big<00:01:30.640> long<00:01:31.000> stalk<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
because it's on a big long stalk and the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.160 
because it's on a big long stalk and the
plant<00:01:33.399> is<00:01:33.580> actually<00:01:33.939> down<00:01:34.090> here<00:01:34.149> coming<00:01:35.020> from

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
plant is actually down here coming from

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.320 
plant is actually down here coming from
this<00:01:35.320> one<00:01:35.500> right<00:01:35.710> here<00:01:36.039> this<00:01:37.000> is<00:01:37.119> what<00:01:37.240> the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
this one right here this is what the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.630 
this one right here this is what the
suitable<00:01:37.720> look<00:01:37.990> like<00:01:38.200> they're<00:01:39.100> quite<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.310> plump

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
suitable look like they're quite a plump

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.090 
suitable look like they're quite a plump
pseudo<00:01:40.030> bulb<00:01:40.179> very<00:01:40.659> hard<00:01:40.899> this<00:01:41.740> new<00:01:41.920> growth

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
pseudo bulb very hard this new growth

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.699 
pseudo bulb very hard this new growth
has<00:01:42.340> two<00:01:42.610> leaves<00:01:42.880> all<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.899> rest<00:01:44.409> of<00:01:44.619> the

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
has two leaves all the rest of the

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.109 
has two leaves all the rest of the
growth<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.130> we<00:01:45.250> actually<00:01:45.549> have<00:01:45.640> one<00:01:45.819> leaf<00:01:46.000> on

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
growth so we actually have one leaf on

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.600 
growth so we actually have one leaf on
the<00:01:46.270> top<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:47.409> got<00:01:47.649> lots<00:01:47.799> of<00:01:47.920> Sun<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.310> energy

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
the top so it got lots of Sun and energy

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.430 
the top so it got lots of Sun and energy
last<00:01:48.819> year<00:01:49.119> and<00:01:49.299> was<00:01:49.479> able<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.750> produce<00:01:50.080> the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
last year and was able to produce the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.760 
last year and was able to produce the
second<00:01:51.280> leaf<00:01:51.429> this<00:01:52.179> must<00:01:52.479> be<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.770> three-foot

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
second leaf this must be a three-foot

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.980 
second leaf this must be a three-foot
stalk<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.490> it's<00:01:54.640> on<00:01:54.819> and<00:01:55.149> on<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.780> end<00:01:55.899> of

and this one here this is called the
cataleya<00:02:18.740> this<00:02:19.740> was<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.190> first<00:02:20.610> one<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:21.030> open

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
cataleya this was the first one to open

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.380 
cataleya this was the first one to open
this<00:02:21.360> year<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.750> only<00:02:21.840> had<00:02:22.110> three<00:02:22.260> blooms<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.160> it

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
this one here is a second one to open it

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.170 
this one here is a second one to open it
actually<00:02:27.090> has<00:02:27.209> 11<00:02:28.020> blooms<00:02:28.350> on<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:29.180> wonderful

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
out that is going to be the bud I just

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.810 
out that is going to be the bud I just
call<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.630> sheath<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:02.130> flower<00:03:02.370> comes<00:03:02.670> out

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
call the sheath and the flower comes out

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:13.560 
call the sheath and the flower comes out
of<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.030> sheath

I use as a coarse Park mix you can see
the<00:04:35.120> roots<00:04:35.330> down<00:04:35.570> in<00:04:35.630> there<00:04:37.210> in<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:39.020> wild

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.260 
the roots down in there in the wild
these<00:04:39.500> would<00:04:39.680> grow<00:04:39.830> on<00:04:40.010> trees<00:04:40.370> and<00:04:40.400> they<00:04:41.150> would

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
these would grow on trees and they would

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.790 
these would grow on trees and they would
actually<00:04:41.540> stick<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:41.990> trees<00:04:42.260> so<00:04:42.530> having

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
actually stick to the trees so having

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.340 
actually stick to the trees so having
the<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.790> bark<00:04:44.060> is<00:04:44.570> going<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:44.870> be<00:04:44.990> sort<00:04:45.230> of<00:04:45.260> the

the the bark is going to be sort of the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.710 
the the bark is going to be sort of the
next<00:04:45.560> best<00:04:45.710> thing<00:04:45.890> it's<00:04:46.190> very<00:04:46.940> Airy<00:04:47.270> in<00:04:47.480> there

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
next best thing it's very Airy in there

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
when these are growing in a tree this

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.390
