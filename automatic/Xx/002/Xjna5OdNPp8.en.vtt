00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:12.370
 It will introduce how to tie the easy and strongest needle 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:15.760
 Even though easy such a complete view from 10 seconds in about 15 minutes if you get used 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.360
 Knot you can tie 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.720
 I will introduce you immediately 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.320
 The needle used today is such a red needle red 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.560
 Such a tension that I think easy-to-read 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.510
 I am using 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.440
 Pochi tenacious aground such a day there is a sister of a 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.380
 Harrier uses 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.380
 I think it is easy to see 35 because there is a little size 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:44.270
 Because it is a bit hard to see that line is Harris 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.270
 This is a stop but it is also a stop 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:52.550
 Use the line you is you can immediately introduce 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.170
 First hold the tip of the needle with one hand 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:01.230
 With the other hand 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:08.220
 It is such a form with the middle of Harris making a ring in this form 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.820
 Such a song that the tip of the left hand of this tip is in the foreground when making a backer 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.670
 Tip is 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.650
 In the form that comes to the front 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.450
 We have made the hoop with one hand 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:24.820
 At this time, beginners should be supported by those who have a large wheel 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.820
 Let's make it a little bigger so it's easy to do 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.659
 After all pouring 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:34.530
 Hold this needle with one hand with the other hand 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.170
 Backer and a 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.290
 Tip and needle 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.120
 Hold these three in one hand 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.260
 this 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.260
 baccano Meanwhile, here is one report 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.650
 Tip end of the needle and tip of the line and needle 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.100
 We will wound this together 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.100
 1 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.760
 here we go 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.500
 Four 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.370
 High 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.730
 6 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.700
 Tsu Na Nakai 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.700
 Generally good I mean wound around from 6 times 7 times 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.290
 At this time winding is 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.290
 like this 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.880
 As I arranged to always clean in the advice the other day 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.180
 We will wound 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.209
 And somewhat a little this so that the liquid 0 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.310
 It is shifted and it is this center part at the end 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.390
 I'm slowly pulling out this extra fallen part 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.010
 Slowly slowly slowly 9 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.010
 It is this US day 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:56.730
 I'm listening to it and I'm still going to be this kind of closing pen 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:03:02.790
 We will shift the original centimeter before winding and tightening 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:06.110
 Much of the last heart Once you have shifted towards the local people is and Shimoto 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.470
 Tightening and this sometimes point one is 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.590
 It is not so tightened to pull people here of the body 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.720
 Have towards the Narazu tip 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.810
 Tighten 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:28.000
 If you pull this one, this side will fall in the form of Yoriyore 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:32.060
 The needle is the closest part to the eyebrow, so you have to be careful in this area 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.890
 First of all, pull the tip of this way 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.950
 tighten 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.760
 Before this tightening 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.700
 Please first laminating here was a point 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.580
 Is the point of that to the Te lame mailer 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.630
 Why do you give up? 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.620
 A tree called Faris road is vulnerable to heat 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:59.019
 Because it is weak to heat 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.069
 When the last tightening is done with this needle, the heat of friction will be 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.810
 a 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:12.780
 It caused the last in Lapsang heat just this deficiency push I mean the will become weaker 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:14.850
 The point is to say the name, etc. in the color name in order to prevent that weakens 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.090
 And to this 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:22.800
 Kedomo has drawn much at the tip still Hate 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:27.400
 The truth is that this is a flash in the mouth 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.880
 I like to tighten licking at its because you tighten 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.240
 Next point is to 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.240
 this 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:42.400
 Several eyes are 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.400
 The important point is that the local needle comes inside 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:50.590
 Even though this'm still moving because not tighten the good to 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.350
 Mast says it why 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.969
 It is temporarily when Osaka took 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.169
 When the fish took 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:04.389
 If inside 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.280
 Well pull and send this Te here right it is in the right-hand side of that needle 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.480
 What 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:13.950
 Straight 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.950
 Will try to stab more in the mouth of the fish 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:22.060
 Temporarily this closing name is 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:29.860
 And will come out of it a knot in this way is the outside 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:33.099
 I understand that if you get a fish and you get a straight line 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.390
 The point is that the force is not applied straight to this needle 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:39.450
 Because power is applied in this way 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.420
 Even if a lot of fish eats this 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:46.610
 It will be a cause of dislodging 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.610
 Because there is a cause for dislodging 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:53.750
 The final name is a substitute for needles 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.750
 to come 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:02.350
 First of all , it is important to tighten this line 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.400
 The second point dampens the name 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.400
 That say third 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:14.450
 If Usuki goes inside after all 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.900
 And if it is the end here after West country 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:22.920
 Wearing hobby 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:25.730
 It is those who are left over of the distal end portion, leaving the sides about 2 mm 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.730
 I will accept 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:38.330
 The last one is 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.330
 Well this little yeah the do not Harris 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.449
 This is completed
