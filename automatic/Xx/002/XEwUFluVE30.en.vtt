start<00:00:13.139> into<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> spiral<00:00:13.830> basically<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:15.330> wait

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
start into a spiral basically we wait

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.500 
start into a spiral basically we wait
shift<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.020> add<00:00:16.170> break<00:00:16.560> as<00:00:16.940> the<00:00:17.940> intensity

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
shift and we add break as the intensity

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.900 
shift and we add break as the intensity
starts<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.930> come<00:00:19.140> up<00:00:19.350> what<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.770> do<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.550> look<00:00:20.789> at

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
starts to come up what I do is I look at

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.060 
starts to come up what I do is I look at
the<00:00:20.970> low<00:00:21.270> wing<00:00:21.539> tip<00:00:21.840> decided<00:00:22.470> maybe<00:00:22.710> break<00:00:22.920> on

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
the low wing tip decided maybe break on

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.070 
the low wing tip decided maybe break on
in<00:00:23.220> Jena<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.519> start<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.910> look<00:00:24.029> up<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.900> look

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
in Jena and start to look up as I look

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.050 
in Jena and start to look up as I look
up<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.380> can<00:00:25.560> see<00:00:25.890> where<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> glider<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.760> in

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
up I can see where the glider is in

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.900 
up I can see where the glider is in
relation<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.930> horizon<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> intensity

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
relation to the horizon as the intensity

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.759 
relation to the horizon as the intensity
comes<00:00:30.150> up<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> spiral<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.080> generally<00:00:31.590> kind

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
comes up on the spiral I generally kind

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.790 
comes up on the spiral I generally kind
of<00:00:31.949> sit<00:00:32.219> back<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.730> flatten<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> seat<00:00:33.800> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
of sit back to flatten the seat the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410 
of sit back to flatten the seat the
glider<00:00:35.010> kind<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.370> wants<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> force<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.180> back

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
glider kind of wants to force you back

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.250 
glider kind of wants to force you back
flat<00:00:36.809> don't<00:00:37.590> fight<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.890> let<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> go<00:00:38.879> flat<00:00:39.260> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
flat don't fight that let it go flat to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
flat don't fight that let it go flat to
kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.620> make<00:00:40.950> sure<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.219> don't<00:00:41.399> go<00:00:41.520> too<00:00:41.550> fast

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
kind of make sure you don't go too fast

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.630 
kind of make sure you don't go too fast
as<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:43.079> start<00:00:43.500> straightening<00:00:44.010> out<00:00:44.160> too<00:00:44.340> flat

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
as you start straightening out too flat

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
as you start straightening out too flat
it<00:00:45.120> may<00:00:45.300> want<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.600> come<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.170> may<00:00:46.350> have

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it may want to come out so you may have

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.529 
it may want to come out so you may have
to<00:00:46.649> hold<00:00:46.860> some<00:00:47.039> brake<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.090> intensity

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
to hold some brake on as the intensity

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.180 
to hold some brake on as the intensity
keeps<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.289> want<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.559> link<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:49.980> the

keeps going you want to link up with the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.850 
keeps going you want to link up with the
outside<00:00:50.640> brake<00:00:50.969> also<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.750> use<00:00:52.500> whichever

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
outside brake also and use whichever

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.430 
outside brake also and use whichever
brake<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.460> want<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.390> control<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> intensity

at whatever level you want then as you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.529 
at whatever level you want then as you

a moment but as soon as you feel the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.940 
a moment but as soon as you feel the
glider<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:10.110> making<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.530> change<00:01:10.770> it's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
glider really making a change it's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.620

spirals on your own people have a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
tendency to only use inside brake and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.889 
tendency to only use inside brake and
wait<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:44.490> works<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.720> get

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
wait and that works but it can get

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.020 
wait and that works but it can get
you<00:01:46.079> into<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.500> faster<00:01:47.070> spiral<00:01:47.520> than<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.790> want

you into a faster spiral than you want

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
you into a faster spiral than you want
and<00:01:48.270> you're<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:48.960> exhibiting<00:01:49.530> control<00:01:49.920> with

that you've got a couple things going on

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.209

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
when you're spiraling you've got gravity

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.740

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
start to swing our body out with

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.940 
start to swing our body out with

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
which works often you're in that spiral

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.580

you're<00:02:10.030> leaving<00:02:10.420> your<00:02:10.569> body<00:02:10.720> right<00:02:11.110> then<00:02:11.349> at

you're leaving your body right then at

stronger<00:02:13.300> often<00:02:13.870> it's<00:02:14.020> gravity<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:14.650> you'll

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
stronger often it's gravity so you'll

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.860 
stronger often it's gravity so you'll
swing<00:02:15.130> right<00:02:15.340> out<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.819> but<00:02:16.480> if<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.720> had

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:33.749 
swing out the other way the glider will

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.349 
swing out the other way the glider will
move<00:03:33.930> forward<00:03:34.379> we<00:03:34.499> link<00:03:34.859> up<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.760> hands<00:03:36.180> up

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
move forward we link up and in hands up

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.959 
move forward we link up and in hands up
not<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.049> problem<00:03:37.439> it<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.459> way<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.700> make<00:03:38.939> it

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:38.969 
not a problem it is a way to make it

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.479 
not a problem it is a way to make it
exit<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.450> little<00:03:39.659> smoother<00:03:40.109> and<00:03:41.010> that's<00:03:41.310> why

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
exit a little smoother and that's why

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.670 
exit a little smoother and that's why
going<00:03:41.700> back<00:03:41.969> into<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.389> we'll<00:03:42.510> try<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.810> weight

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
going back into it we'll try that weight

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.670 
going back into it we'll try that weight
ship<00:03:43.980> or<00:03:44.189> adding<00:03:44.549> inside<00:03:44.939> break<00:03:45.269> as<00:03:45.569> it<00:03:46.469> dies

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
ship or adding inside break as it dies

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.319 
ship or adding inside break as it dies
if<00:03:46.980> we<00:03:47.129> add<00:03:47.280> more<00:03:47.579> it's<00:03:47.819> going<00:03:47.909> to<00:03:47.969> increase

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
if we add more it's going to increase

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.720 
if we add more it's going to increase
we're<00:03:49.079> going<00:03:49.109> pretty<00:03:49.500> fast<00:03:49.739> we<00:03:50.069> let<00:03:50.280> off

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.660 

and<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:55.319> feels<00:03:55.770> not<00:03:56.190> quite<00:03:56.690> as<00:03:57.690> severe<00:03:58.670> now

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
and it feels not quite as severe now

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.059 
and it feels not quite as severe now
what<00:04:00.209> we'd<00:04:00.360> really<00:04:00.720> like<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.080> feel<00:04:01.800> really

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
what we'd really like you to feel really

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.040 
what we'd really like you to feel really
nice<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.519> style<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.910> need<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.300> get<00:04:03.510> going

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
nice in a style you need to get going

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.720 
nice in a style you need to get going
with<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.440> inside<00:04:04.769> break<00:04:04.980> like<00:04:05.160> we<00:04:05.310> would<00:04:05.519> but

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
with the inside break like we would but

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.119 
with the inside break like we would but
then<00:04:06.000> add<00:04:06.540> some<00:04:07.019> outside<00:04:07.500> break<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.860> field

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
then add some outside break the field

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.800 
then add some outside break the field
glider<00:04:08.489> let's<00:04:08.849> try<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.420> we're<00:04:09.629> weight

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
glider let's try that we're weight

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.660 
glider let's try that we're weight
shifting<00:04:10.349> we're<00:04:10.530> looking<00:04:10.860> at<00:04:10.980> adding<00:04:11.280> break

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
shifting we're looking at adding break

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.570 
shifting we're looking at adding break
it<00:04:12.120> speeds<00:04:12.989> up<00:04:13.170> had<00:04:13.470> more<00:04:13.739> break<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.040> we<00:04:14.340> link

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
it speeds up had more break and we link

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.080 
it speeds up had more break and we link
up<00:04:14.730> with<00:04:14.760> this<00:04:15.030> one<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:16.260> we<00:04:16.380> can<00:04:16.590> control

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
up with this one and we can control

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.370 
up with this one and we can control
well<00:04:18.269> using<00:04:18.930> either

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.480 

now<00:04:23.010> if<00:04:23.190> we<00:04:23.340> go<00:04:23.490> up<00:04:24.650> we'll<00:04:25.650> steer<00:04:25.920> back<00:04:26.040> into<00:04:26.400> it

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
now if we go up we'll steer back into it

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.040 
now if we go up we'll steer back into it
and<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.670> makes<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:26.970> feel<00:04:27.240> nice<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:27.900> not

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
and that makes it feel nice so it's not

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.740 
and that makes it feel nice so it's not
necessary<00:04:28.680> now<00:04:29.610> if<00:04:29.790> we<00:04:29.910> go<00:04:30.060> around<00:04:30.210> fast

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
necessary now if we go around fast

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.570 
necessary now if we go around fast
without<00:04:31.140> using<00:04:31.470> outside<00:04:31.620> break<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.160> outside

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
without using outside break the outside

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.610 
without using outside break the outside
tip<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.060> get<00:04:33.180> loose<00:04:33.480> let's<00:04:33.810> try<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.320> we'll

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
tip and get loose let's try that we'll

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.170 
tip and get loose let's try that we'll
go<00:04:34.770> around

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:49.390 

getting<00:04:38.720> spunky

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.540 

feel<00:04:50.400> good<00:04:50.700> so<00:04:51.390> that's<00:04:51.510> why<00:04:51.750> we<00:04:51.930> like<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.140> use

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
feel good so that's why we like to use

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.820 
feel good so that's why we like to use
and<00:04:53.550> link<00:04:53.850> up<00:04:53.970> with<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.300> outside<00:04:54.720> break<00:04:55.020> like

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
and link up with the outside break like

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.340 
and link up with the outside break like
this<00:04:56.040> to<00:04:56.190> do<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.430> again<00:04:56.730> and<00:04:57.720> it<00:04:57.930> just<00:04:57.960> starts

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
this to do it again and it just starts

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.610 
this to do it again and it just starts
to<00:04:58.410> happen<00:04:58.800> automatically<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.640> me

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
to happen automatically to me

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.500 
to happen automatically to me
and<00:05:00.680> then<00:05:00.800> you<00:05:00.919> just<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.400> feel

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
and then you just you feel

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.200 
and then you just you feel
you<00:05:02.690> realize<00:05:02.990> we're<00:05:03.140> coming<00:05:03.380> out<00:05:03.440> out<00:05:04.060> let<00:05:05.060> it

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
you realize we're coming out out let it

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.050 
you realize we're coming out out let it
come<00:05:05.420> out<00:05:05.600> right<00:05:06.250> up<00:05:07.250> move<00:05:07.430> forward<00:05:07.880> then

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
come out right up move forward then

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.720 
come out right up move forward then
we'll<00:05:08.180> link<00:05:08.540> up<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.230> then<00:05:09.590> hands<00:05:09.920> up<00:05:10.220> no<00:05:10.490> big

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
we'll link up and then hands up no big

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
we'll link up and then hands up no big
deal<00:05:12.040> okay

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
deal okay

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.160 
deal okay
very<00:05:14.750> interesting<00:05:15.650> that<00:05:16.580> run<00:05:16.850> that<00:05:17.030> I<00:05:17.170> decided

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
very interesting that run that I decided

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.630 
very interesting that run that I decided
to<00:05:18.320> go<00:05:18.440> around<00:05:18.560> fast<00:05:18.920> without<00:05:19.220> using<00:05:19.520> outside

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
to go around fast without using outside

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.910 
to go around fast without using outside
break<00:05:20.150> put<00:05:20.570> a<00:05:20.600> lot<00:05:20.840> of<00:05:20.990> strange<00:05:21.260> force<00:05:21.560> on<00:05:21.770> me

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
break put a lot of strange force on me

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.200 
break put a lot of strange force on me
as<00:05:21.980> well<00:05:22.040> throwing<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.640> outward<00:05:24.160> as<00:05:25.160> it<00:05:26.000> does

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
as well throwing the outward as it does

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.960 
as well throwing the outward as it does
so<00:05:26.890> linking<00:05:27.890> up<00:05:28.010> with<00:05:28.190> that<00:05:28.310> outside<00:05:28.490> break

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
so linking up with that outside break

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.290 
so linking up with that outside break
you<00:05:29.690> feel<00:05:30.080> the<00:05:30.260> sense<00:05:30.500> of<00:05:30.620> control<00:05:30.920> and<00:05:31.300> be

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
you feel the sense of control and be

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.000 
you feel the sense of control and be
aware<00:05:32.540> where<00:05:32.780> your<00:05:32.900> weight<00:05:33.050> shift<00:05:33.380> is<00:05:33.560> in<00:05:33.830> the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
aware where your weight shift is in the

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.640 
aware where your weight shift is in the
spirals<00:05:35.140> and<00:05:36.140> all<00:05:37.100> that<00:05:37.280> so<00:05:37.520> here<00:05:38.000> we<00:05:38.150> can<00:05:38.620> do<00:05:39.620> a

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
spirals and all that so here we can do a

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.870 
spirals and all that so here we can do a
bit<00:05:40.100> of<00:05:40.220> a<00:05:40.310> interesting<00:05:41.060> landing<00:05:41.420> here<00:05:41.570> now

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
bit of a interesting landing here now

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.880 
bit of a interesting landing here now
and<00:05:43.880> we<00:05:44.000> have<00:05:44.120> some<00:05:44.300> of<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.450> altitude<00:05:44.890> we

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
and we have some of the altitude we

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:58.130 
and we have some of the altitude we
adapt<00:05:46.220> where<00:05:46.430> before

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.940 

and

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.310 

that<00:06:04.950> was<00:06:05.070> my<00:06:05.250> regular<00:06:05.700> round<00:06:06.090> spirals<00:06:06.630> always
