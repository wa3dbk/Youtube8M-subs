00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.340 
with a couple velcro cable ties four
screws<00:02:08.570> for<00:02:08.840> installing<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.530> power<00:02:10.220> cable<00:02:10.670> and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
screws for installing it power cable and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.370 
screws for installing it power cable and
let's<00:02:12.350> check<00:02:12.620> out<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.800> power<00:02:13.100> supply<00:02:13.430> itself

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
let's check out the power supply itself

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.460 
let's check out the power supply itself
so<00:02:15.380> let's<00:02:15.650> go<00:02:15.800> ahead<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.100> hold<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.260> wire<00:02:18.260> off

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
so let's go ahead and hold this wire off

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.960 
so let's go ahead and hold this wire off
here<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:18.770> this<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.040> not<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.250> modular<00:02:19.760> power

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
here so this is not a modular power

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.300 
here so this is not a modular power
supply<00:02:20.120> however<00:02:20.900> modular<00:02:21.530> interfaces<00:02:22.160> do

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
supply however modular interfaces do

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.340 
supply however modular interfaces do
tend<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.670> reduce<00:02:22.820> efficiency<00:02:23.350> however

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
tend to reduce efficiency however

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.350 
tend to reduce efficiency however
slightly<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.430> if<00:02:25.550> they<00:02:25.700> were<00:02:25.760> going<00:02:26.060> for<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
slightly so if they were going for the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.930 
slightly so if they were going for the
most<00:02:26.540> efficient<00:02:27.230> family<00:02:27.940> planet-friendly

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
most efficient family planet-friendly

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.850 
most efficient family planet-friendly
possible<00:02:29.780> solution<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.230> can<00:02:30.260> see<00:02:30.560> how<00:02:30.709> they

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
possible solution I can see how they

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.190 
possible solution I can see how they
would<00:02:30.980> want<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.250> go<00:02:31.370> with<00:02:31.580> fixed<00:02:32.390> connected

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
would want to go with fixed connected

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.770 
would want to go with fixed connected
cables<00:02:33.730> as<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.940> mentioned<00:02:35.239> before<00:02:35.270> it's<00:02:35.600> about

away the extra four pins and install it
into<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.410> 20<00:03:03.769> pin<00:03:03.980> motherboard<00:03:04.580> if<00:03:05.000> you

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
into a 20 pin motherboard if you

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.920 
into a 20 pin motherboard if you
honestly<00:03:05.390> still<00:03:06.170> have<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.769> 20<00:03:07.130> pin<00:03:07.459> motherboard

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
honestly still have a 20 pin motherboard

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.420 
honestly still have a 20 pin motherboard
that<00:03:08.930> you're<00:03:09.049> buying<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.440> new<00:03:09.769> power<00:03:10.100> supply

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
that you're buying a new power supply

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.880 
that you're buying a new power supply
for<00:03:10.670> although<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.540> mean<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:11.810> really<00:03:12.170> don't<00:03:12.590> see

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
for although I mean I really don't see

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.000 
for although I mean I really don't see
the<00:03:13.549> wisdom<00:03:13.850> in<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.180> you've<00:03:15.049> got<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> 4<00:03:15.530> plus<00:03:15.739> 4

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
the wisdom in that you've got a 4 plus 4

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.190 
the wisdom in that you've got a 4 plus 4
so<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.760> can<00:03:17.030> either<00:03:17.150> use<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.540> as<00:03:17.630> an<00:03:17.720> 8-pin<00:03:18.049> or

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
so you can either use it as an 8-pin or

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.900 
so you can either use it as an 8-pin or
you<00:03:18.290> can<00:03:18.410> use<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.620> as<00:03:18.709> a<00:03:18.769> 4-pin<00:03:19.190> if<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.430> still

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
you can use it as a 4-pin if you still

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.640 
you can use it as a 4-pin if you still
have<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:20.450> four-point<00:03:20.900> no<00:03:21.140> I'm<00:03:21.230> just<00:03:21.320> kidding<00:03:21.470> I

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
have a four-point no I'm just kidding I

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.840 
have a four-point no I'm just kidding I
know<00:03:21.739> some<00:03:21.980> new<00:03:22.100> motherboards<00:03:22.580> still<00:03:22.760> have

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
know some new motherboards still have

if you still have something that uses a

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
floppy connector and then we've also got

floppy connector and then we've also got
six<00:03:57.170> SATA<00:03:57.880> connectors<00:03:58.880> on<00:03:59.209> two<00:03:59.690> separate

harnesses thus leaving on this is
actually<00:04:02.209> reasonably<00:04:02.570> high<00:04:02.720> quality<00:04:03.139> that's

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
actually reasonably high quality that's

actually reasonably high quality that's
better<00:04:03.500> than<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.739> would<00:04:03.889> have

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
better than I would have

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
did so you actually can't see the color

did so you actually can't see the color
of<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.710> wires<00:04:06.920> very<00:04:07.340> much<00:04:07.550> through<00:04:07.820> it

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
of the wires very much through it

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.730 
of the wires very much through it
