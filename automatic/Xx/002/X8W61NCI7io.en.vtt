00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello all my name jr gómez i am in 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.470
 eve of diplo yemen and in the video of 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.220
 today we are going to see how to create a zone of 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.070
 ns secondary in windows server 2012 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.290
 the purpose of creating an area of ​​ns 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330
 secondary is to copy a zone of 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.610
 ns that we have in another contains our 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.010
 dns server in my case is a 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.260
 domain controller and I will copy 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.290
 this zone from ns to another controller 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.440
 domain that has also installed the 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.780
 role of dns 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.110
 is my secondary domain controller 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.840
 for which we are going to see with the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.150
 configuration I have a driver for 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.010
 domain called c02 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.480
 the painting houses a 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:51.140
 an additional desire and also has 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.200
 our installed dns I have 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.370
 1 0 1 in which we will create 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.460
 to link the area we will copy the area 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:05.570
 and for which we go to the complement 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.750
 dns administration tools here 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.780
 I have my id on that server since 01 but 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.670
 let's connect to our 602 by 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.800
 which we go here to the root of the dns 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.850
 connect to the next team 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.850
 from c02 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.260
 here I have my second dns 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:33.400
 as we see nothing else nothing else I have 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.810
 23 in areas of a school that 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.490
 comprises the domain with the integration 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.580
 active directory and I have another one that 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.530
 also replicated with the director and in 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:47.530
 the one in that 0-1 I have four zones on the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.130
 only one that is not there is not the j city 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.650
 local point the age that we are going to perform 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.259
 with zone d in secondary s but 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.840
 first we go to the properties of the 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.500
 dns zone of domain controller 1 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.380
 we go to the properties and in the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.830
 name servers let's add the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.830
 of c02 which is why we go to servers 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:17.160
 name we say add we are going to 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:21.600
 add the cc of c02 point 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.030
 j point more we add the name of pq of 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.860
 n we give them solve and at the moment we 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.610
 will give as if the server does not 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.010
 was because he had no contact 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.960
 has not had the ns zone or has not 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.000
 created the secondary n area but what 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.130
 let's give it accept apply as we see 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.740
 Here we have added the name the new 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.840
 server name dns then now yes 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.250
 we proceed to create the dns zone 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.790
 secondary for which we go then 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.980
 already to our of c02 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.019
 and in 13 02 we are going to go to the zones 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.099
 search in direct search and we will 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:02.579
 give a new zone new to us 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.469
 opens the wizard to create a zone in 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.060
 which we give next and we will 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.640
 give several creation options 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.440
 the main main area which is the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.239
 that we are not going to create at this moment are 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.370
 the secondary ones which we are going to use 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.130
 and the area of ​​internal routes 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.569
 we selected the secondary area we 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.480
 disable by default 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.840
 the store in the area in the area in 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.319
 active directory we give you following 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.989
 and here we are going to look we are going here in the 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.239
 button examine the name of the area as 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.550
 can see here shows us the 01's 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.670
 where the area that we are going is stored 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.110
 to copy the one from that 0 2 we search here in 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.860
 the zones of 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.470
 direct search and we select the area 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.380
 that we are going to copy in this case is jota 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.420
 haiti local point we say accept now 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.550
 we have the name of the area 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.730
 we say next and here we go to 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.800
 specify the ip address of the server 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:06.150
 where are we going to copy our dns zone 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.150
 in this case it is 01 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.700
 let's go here how we got here is valid 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.490
 accept we give you next here he came back 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.460
 I repeat is the server where we will 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.520
 copy the cam nsn area in this 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.950
 this is the ip address of my 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.800
 c02 of that 0 1 as specified in that 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.390
 the pq of our server we give 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.310
 next and here it gives us 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.560
 a summary of the completion of the 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.690
 assistant for the new area gives us 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.100
 says that the area of sj city ​​local point 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.600
 in the high school type and tells us the 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.700
 type of search to resend and the 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.400
 name of the file that is j hate and point 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.400
 local point dns we give you final 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.849
 and as we see we have already created the new 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.889
 zone if we display here the one of 0 1 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.800
 we have the area too but it has 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.020
 created the new zone here in de c02 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.590
 we are going to enter the area and as we see 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:11.090
 we already have our area created then 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.969
 in the idea of ​​being able to create ns zones 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.909
 secondary is to copy these areas 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.620
 dns from another server another server 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.740
 dns that we have in our network or not 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.949
 domain or also that is in our 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:29.930
 forest then in this way we already have 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:34.129
 our secondary dns zone created and 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:37.129
 as we see with all the records that 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:39.349
 create when creating the denis zone I hope that 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.879
 this video is very helpful and we 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:42.879
 we see in a next occasion
