00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
think Emma's breaking up this hope it

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.900 
think Emma's breaking up this hope it
works<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:10.110> reason<00:00:10.260> why<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:11.490> camera<00:00:11.820> is

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
works the reason why the camera is

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.509 
works the reason why the camera is
acting<00:00:12.269> up<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.599> because<00:00:12.809> uh<00:00:13.340> I've<00:00:14.340> been

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
acting up is because uh I've been

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.340 
acting up is because uh I've been
holding<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.089> my<00:00:15.120> mouth<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.809> different

holding it in my mouth in different

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.529 
holding it in my mouth in different
times<00:00:16.650> when<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.880> do<00:00:18.000> things<00:00:18.240> from

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.439 
all right starting to ball so we put the
Apple<00:06:58.690> in<00:06:58.840> I<00:07:01.949> think<00:07:02.949> about<00:07:03.160> this<00:07:04.120> is<00:07:04.270> pretty

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
Apple in I think about this is pretty

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:08.969 
Apple in I think about this is pretty
good<00:07:04.630> stuff<00:07:04.750> by<00:07:05.020> the<00:07:05.050> way<00:07:05.139> to<00:07:05.320> try<00:07:05.680> it<00:07:07.440> so<00:07:08.440> what

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
good stuff by the way to try it so what

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.529 
good stuff by the way to try it so what
happens<00:07:09.340> is<00:07:09.490> the<00:07:09.669> Apple<00:07:10.000> is<00:07:10.060> gonna<00:07:10.210> get<00:07:10.360> more

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:10.539 
happens is the Apple is gonna get more

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:12.779 
happens is the Apple is gonna get more
like<00:07:10.750> liquidy<00:07:11.229> and<00:07:11.410> you<00:07:12.130> need<00:07:12.400> a<00:07:12.430> crushing

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:12.789 
like liquidy and you need a crushing

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:16.890 
like liquidy and you need a crushing
machine<00:07:13.680> to<00:07:15.090> crush<00:07:16.090> it<00:07:16.120> then<00:07:16.419> turn<00:07:16.630> it<00:07:16.720> into

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
machine to crush it then turn it into

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.620 
machine to crush it then turn it into
like<00:07:17.199> a<00:07:17.229> sauce<00:07:17.590> if<00:07:18.370> you<00:07:19.030> can<00:07:19.240> use<00:07:19.389> something

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630 
like a sauce if you can use something

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:26.640 
like a sauce if you can use something
that<00:07:19.900> looks<00:07:20.080> like<00:07:20.139> this<00:07:20.669> I<00:07:21.669> did<00:07:22.600> it<00:07:22.720> with<00:07:25.650> uh

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.650 
that looks like this I did it with uh

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.750 
that looks like this I did it with uh
with<00:07:27.610> a<00:07:27.639> fork<00:07:28.090> but<00:07:28.590> it's<00:07:29.590> like<00:07:30.010> a<00:07:30.039> fork<00:07:30.460> is<00:07:30.610> like

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:30.760 
with a fork but it's like a fork is like

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.390 
with a fork but it's like a fork is like
at<00:07:30.880> an<00:07:30.970> angle<00:07:31.360> is<00:07:31.479> this<00:07:31.660> you<00:07:32.350> directly<00:07:33.160> from

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 
at an angle is this you directly from

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.300 
at an angle is this you directly from
the<00:07:33.580> Frog<00:07:33.789> looks<00:07:34.180> better<00:07:34.650> now<00:07:35.650> you<00:07:35.949> should

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310 
the Frog looks better now you should

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.150 
the Frog looks better now you should
love<00:07:37.090> to
