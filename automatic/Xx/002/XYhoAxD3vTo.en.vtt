okay<00:00:01.290> I<00:00:01.319> wanted<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:01.979> show<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:03.179> Ironman

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
okay I wanted to show the Ironman

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.099 
okay I wanted to show the Ironman
walking<00:00:04.529> sound<00:00:04.770> effect<00:00:05.120> actual<00:00:06.120> unit<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.960> this

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
walking sound effect actual unit in this

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.580 
walking sound effect actual unit in this
video<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:07.790> here<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.290> very

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
video so here it is this is the very

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.280 
video so here it is this is the very
compact<00:00:11.509> circuit<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.809> can<00:00:12.929> map<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
compact circuit that you can map to the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.099 
compact circuit that you can map to the
inside<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.620> your<00:00:13.889> leg<00:00:14.340> armor<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.570> velcro

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
inside of your leg armor you can velcro

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.279 
inside of your leg armor you can velcro
it<00:00:16.170> around<00:00:16.440> your<00:00:16.760> leg<00:00:17.760> or<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.390> somehow

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
it around your leg or you can somehow

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.529 
it around your leg or you can somehow
make<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> little<00:00:19.740> pocket<00:00:20.029> or<00:00:21.029> even<00:00:21.270> put<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.449> in

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
make a little pocket or even put it in

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.939 
make a little pocket or even put it in
your<00:00:21.630> pocket<00:00:21.779> as<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.350> did<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
your pocket as I did in the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.089 
your pocket as I did in the
demonstration<00:00:23.670> video<00:00:24.109> so<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.320> wired<00:00:25.560> down

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
demonstration video so it's wired down

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.779 
demonstration video so it's wired down
to<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.789> accelerometer<00:00:27.710> this<00:00:28.710> side<00:00:29.039> faces

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
to the accelerometer this side faces

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.740 
to the accelerometer this side faces
outwards<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:32.009> two<00:00:32.189> holes<00:00:32.480> at<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> bottom

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
outwards and the two holes at the bottom

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.020 
outwards and the two holes at the bottom
go<00:00:34.170> at<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.800> bottom<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.370> towards<00:00:35.730> your<00:00:35.850> knee

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
go at the bottom so towards your knee

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.869 
go at the bottom so towards your knee
you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.079> use<00:00:37.230> those<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.620> mount<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> inside

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
you can use those to mount to the inside

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.700 
you can use those to mount to the inside
of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.969> armor<00:00:39.270> or<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.350> sew<00:00:40.590> them

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
of the armor or you can sew them

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.250 
of the armor or you can sew them
directly<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.540> pants<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:43.110> put

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
directly on to your pants or just put

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.700 
directly on to your pants or just put
velcro<00:00:43.590> around<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.160> secure<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.969> way<00:00:45.710> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
velcro around and secure it that way the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.910 
velcro around and secure it that way the
reset<00:00:47.100> button<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.690> on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.289> Arduino<00:00:49.890> board

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
reset button is on the Arduino board

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.880 
reset button is on the Arduino board
here<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:51.480> once<00:00:51.660> you've<00:00:51.809> got<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:51.989> leg<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.770> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
here so once you've got your leg and a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.580 
here so once you've got your leg and a
slightly<00:00:53.239> tilted<00:00:54.239> bent<00:00:54.899> position<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
slightly tilted bent position so you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.510 
slightly tilted bent position so you
don't<00:00:55.710> want<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:55.949> standing<00:00:56.129> straight<00:00:56.489> up

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
don't want to be standing straight up

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.849 
don't want to be standing straight up
when<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> reset<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.750> slightly<00:00:58.500> tilted

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
when you reset it so slightly tilted

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.040 
when you reset it so slightly tilted
forward<00:00:59.359> that's<00:01:00.359> gonna<00:01:00.510> help<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.809> configure

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
forward that's gonna help you configure

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.889 
forward that's gonna help you configure
the<00:01:01.620> amount<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> Bend<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.420> need<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> take

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the amount of Bend that you need to take

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
the amount of Bend that you need to take
in<00:01:04.320> order<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.710> activate<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.220> lift

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
in order to activate the lift

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.990 
in order to activate the lift
sound<00:01:05.939> effect<00:01:06.830> there's<00:01:07.830> an<00:01:07.950> SD<00:01:08.100> card<00:01:08.250> micro<00:01:08.790> SD

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
sound effect there's an SD card micro SD

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.310 
sound effect there's an SD card micro SD
card<00:01:09.240> here<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.510> has<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> sound<00:01:10.110> effects

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
card here that has all the sound effects

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.160 
card here that has all the sound effects
on<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:11.549> battery<00:01:11.909> powers<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.750> Arduino

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
on it and one battery powers the Arduino

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
on it and one battery powers the Arduino
unit<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.430> powers<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.150> sound

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
unit the other one powers the sound

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.380 
unit the other one powers the sound
board<00:01:15.630> an<00:01:16.140> amplifier<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.119> then<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> goes<00:01:18.360> down

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
board an amplifier and then it goes down

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.550 
board an amplifier and then it goes down
to<00:01:19.220> speaker<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.080> want<00:01:22.290> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
to speaker and you can if you want you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.340 
to speaker and you can if you want you
can<00:01:22.680> separate<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.030> attach<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.080> louder

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
can separate this and attach a louder

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.010 
can separate this and attach a louder
speaker<00:01:25.830> bigger<00:01:26.040> speaker<00:01:26.509> has<00:01:27.509> entirely<00:01:27.840> up

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
speaker bigger speaker has entirely up

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.069 
speaker bigger speaker has entirely up
to<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.710> did<00:01:29.040> get<00:01:29.189> quite<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> bit<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:30.079> wire

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
to you but I did get quite a bit of wire

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.020 
to you but I did get quite a bit of wire
there<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.740> position<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.369> wherever

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
there so you can position it wherever

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.929 
there so you can position it wherever
you<00:01:33.180> need<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.110> that's<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.280> basic<00:01:35.460> assembly

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
you need to so that's the basic assembly

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.080 
you need to so that's the basic assembly
you<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.540> two<00:01:37.430> batteries<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.790> lithium

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
you get two batteries with it lithium

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.240 
you get two batteries with it lithium
polymers<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.259> get<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> battery<00:01:40.770> charger

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
polymers and you get the battery charger

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.810 
polymers and you get the battery charger
and<00:01:41.400> USB<00:01:41.810> cord<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:44.549> that's<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and USB cord for that so that's the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.120 
and USB cord for that so that's the
setup<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.630> entire<00:01:45.899> thing<00:01:46.200> right<00:01:46.380> here

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
setup that's the entire thing right here

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.399 
setup that's the entire thing right here
and<00:01:47.340> each<00:01:47.700> kit<00:01:48.000> comes<00:01:48.210> with<00:01:48.390> two<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.229> these

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and each kit comes with two of these

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.819 
and each kit comes with two of these
setups<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:51.780> guess<00:01:52.380> I'll<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.530> demonstrate

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
setups so I guess I'll just demonstrate

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.660 
setups so I guess I'll just demonstrate
really<00:01:53.369> quick<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.170> how<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.670> effect

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
really quick with you how the effect

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.219 
really quick with you how the effect
works<00:01:56.939> here<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.600> doesn't<00:01:57.930> matter<00:01:58.079> which

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
works here so it doesn't matter which

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.739 
works here so it doesn't matter which
order<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.619> plug<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> batteries<00:01:59.340> in

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:11.080 

slightly<00:02:04.619> tilted<00:02:05.159> forward<00:02:05.490> position<00:02:07.190> so

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090
