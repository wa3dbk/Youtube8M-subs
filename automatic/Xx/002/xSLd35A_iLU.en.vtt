automatically shuts off but anyways like

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.000 
automatically shuts off but anyways like
I<00:00:07.830> was<00:00:07.859> saying<00:00:08.599> you<00:00:09.599> may<00:00:09.870> or<00:00:10.110> may<00:00:10.139> not<00:00:10.410> have<00:00:10.740> to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
I was saying you may or may not have to

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.629 
I was saying you may or may not have to
take<00:00:11.219> your<00:00:11.429> flywheel<00:00:11.670> off<00:00:12.059> before<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.599> start

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
take your flywheel off before you start

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.369 
take your flywheel off before you start
I'm<00:00:14.639> guessing<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.509> probably<00:00:15.990> don't

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
I'm guessing that you probably don't

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.980 
I'm guessing that you probably don't
have<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:17.960> as<00:00:18.960> long<00:00:19.470> as<00:00:21.020> your<00:00:22.020> flywheel<00:00:23.990> would

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
have to as long as your flywheel would

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.109 
have to as long as your flywheel would
be<00:00:25.109> connected<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:26.010> as<00:00:26.609> long<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:26.970> it

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
be connected to here as long as it

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.189 
be connected to here as long as it
clears<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:28.340> which<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.150> turn<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.630> with

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
clears this which you can turn this with

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.760 
clears this which you can turn this with
your<00:00:31.320> kick-start<00:00:32.000> over<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.649> way

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
your kick-start over to here that way

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.729 
your kick-start over to here that way
you<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:35.040> make<00:00:35.190> your<00:00:35.219> lineups<00:00:35.790> marks<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
you can make your lineups marks on this

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.410 
you can make your lineups marks on this
night<00:00:37.920> line<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.149> could<00:00:39.239> see

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
night line here and this you could see

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
night line here and this you could see
my<00:00:39.540> old<00:00:39.690> marks<00:00:39.989> right<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> down<00:00:41.579> there

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
my old marks right here and down there

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.420 
my old marks right here and down there
so<00:00:42.320> as<00:00:43.320> long<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.739> clears<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.190> won't<00:00:44.340> have

this<00:01:07.680> especially<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.520> CRF<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.460> had<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
this especially on CRF and I had like I

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.429 
this especially on CRF and I had like I
was<00:01:12.960> saying<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.409> had<00:01:13.770> big<00:01:14.010> problems<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:15.290> first<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
was saying I had big problems I first I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.020 
was saying I had big problems I first I
got<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> wrong<00:01:16.890> parts<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.640> had<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
got the wrong parts and then I had to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.390 
got the wrong parts and then I had to
then<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.780> finally<00:01:19.350> got<00:01:19.470> my<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:19.680> bearings<00:01:20.220> in

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
then I finally got my two bearings in

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.920 
then I finally got my two bearings in
and<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:20.790> they<00:01:20.909> said<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.270> wasn't<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.600> seal

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and then they said there wasn't a seal

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.830 
and then they said there wasn't a seal
there<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.650> no<00:01:22.799> seal<00:01:23.130> involved<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.570> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
there was no seal involved in there so I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.370 
there was no seal involved in there so I
even<00:01:25.320> took<00:01:25.470> pictures<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.880> actual<00:01:27.380> shaft

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
even took pictures of the actual shaft

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
even took pictures of the actual shaft
with<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> seal<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.610> itself<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.360> brought<00:01:30.479> them

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
with the seal in itself and brought them

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.319 
with the seal in itself and brought them
to<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.560> dealership<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.060> finally

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
to the dealership and then they finally

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.770 
to the dealership and then they finally
found<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.880> microfiche<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> wrong

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
found out that the microfiche is wrong

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.710 
found out that the microfiche is wrong
from<00:01:37.049> Honda<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.070> only<00:01:38.850> these<00:01:39.090> two<00:01:39.360> bearings

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
from Honda so only these two bearings

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.170 
from Honda so only these two bearings
are<00:01:39.869> shown<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.530> microfiche<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:41.909> are<00:01:42.060> on

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
are shown in the microfiche these are on

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.800 
are shown in the microfiche these are on
the<00:01:42.299> balancer<00:01:42.899> section<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.810> microfiche

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the balancer section of the microfiche

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.240
