00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
back in the water again it's probably

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.200 
back in the water again it's probably
just<00:03:09.130> going<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.400> be<00:03:09.490> a<00:03:09.520> matter<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.850> time<00:03:10.180> before

another serious event occurs and then
next<00:03:13.150> time<00:03:13.390> can<00:03:13.750> be<00:03:13.870> on<00:03:14.020> them<00:03:14.290> right<00:03:15.010> because<00:03:15.250> I

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
next time can be on them right because I

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.490 
next time can be on them right because I
every<00:03:15.940> time<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.270> hear<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.480> story<00:03:16.780> like<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.110> it

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
every time I hear a story like this it

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.950 
every time I hear a story like this it
makes<00:03:17.860> me<00:03:18.160> question<00:03:18.760> whether<00:03:19.240> these<00:03:19.510> animals

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
makes me question whether these animals

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.370 
makes me question whether these animals
should<00:03:20.140> even<00:03:20.290> be<00:03:20.530> in<00:03:20.680> captivity<00:03:21.160> at<00:03:21.610> all<00:03:22.380> given

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
should even be in captivity at all given

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.020 
should even be in captivity at all given
not<00:03:23.710> only<00:03:23.740> what<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.280> does<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.640> animals

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
not only what it does to the animals

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.700 
not only what it does to the animals
themselves<00:03:25.180> but<00:03:25.630> also<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.110> fact<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.500> there

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
themselves but also the fact that there

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.410 
themselves but also the fact that there
