like<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.340> 25th<00:01:11.340> i<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.710> more<00:01:13.710> 26th

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
like the 25th i think it is of more 26th

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
like the 25th i think it is of more 26th
of<00:01:14.570> May<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:16.049> will<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.590> bit

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
of May it will be kind of bit

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.010 
of May it will be kind of bit
inconsistent<00:01:17.369> once<00:01:17.909> that's<00:01:18.180> over<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.780> pretty

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
inconsistent once that's over we pretty

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.830 
inconsistent once that's over we pretty
much<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.530> once<00:01:19.740> every<00:01:19.979> two<00:01:20.159> days<00:01:20.340> and

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.970 
I've got a finger this bit pointless and
here's<00:03:09.120> thinking<00:03:09.389> actually<00:03:09.739> if<00:03:10.739> slightly

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
here's thinking actually if slightly

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.710 
here's thinking actually if slightly
one's<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.700> week<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:13.170> might<00:03:13.409> make<00:03:13.590> more<00:03:13.739> sense

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
one's a week that might make more sense

one's a week that might make more sense
I'm<00:03:15.720> just<00:03:16.139> yeah<00:03:16.530> I'm<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:16.739> throwing<00:03:17.010> ideas<00:03:17.189> it

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
I'm just yeah I'm just throwing ideas it

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
average thought about that and because

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.949 
average thought about that and because

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
once a week you know that's easy to do

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.530 
once a week you know that's easy to do
and<00:03:25.889> it's<00:03:26.549> not<00:03:26.609> really<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.269> difficult

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
and it's not really that difficult

rather than deal once every like 3-4
days<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.419> that<00:03:39.480> may<00:03:39.690> we<00:03:40.049> don't<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:40.440> be

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530
