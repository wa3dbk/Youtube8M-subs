the reward for that is the l96 a1 and

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.619 
the reward for that is the l96 a1 and
you<00:02:25.830> see<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.250> similar<00:02:26.580> story<00:02:26.640> for<00:02:27.299> open

assignment path so that's how

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.930

assignments look in the battle log say
the<00:03:15.090> wording<00:03:15.540> isn't<00:03:15.959> great<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.500> some<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.859> them

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
the wording isn't great on some of them

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.180 
the wording isn't great on some of them
but<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.660> basic<00:03:19.139> gist<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.620> what<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.920> need<00:03:20.069> to

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
but the basic gist of what you need to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.780 
but the basic gist of what you need to
do<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.609> there<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:22.709> completion<00:03:23.700> of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
do is there and the completion of

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.180 
do is there and the completion of
assignment<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.690> reported<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.560> game<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:26.069> look

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
assignment is reported in game to look

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.550 
assignment is reported in game to look
like<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.670> appearing<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.019> best<00:03:28.260> place<00:03:28.530> to

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
like on appearing but the best place to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.500 
like on appearing but the best place to
look<00:03:28.829> at<00:03:28.950> your<00:03:29.099> assignment<00:03:29.370> progress<00:03:29.849> is<00:03:30.299> at

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
the end of a round and we'll have a look

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.470 
the end of a round and we'll have a look
at<00:03:33.389> that<00:03:33.540> now<00:03:34.639> so<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.730> first<00:03:35.970> place<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.359> can

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
the need only one assignment you need

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.349 
the need only one assignment you need
dear<00:03:43.410> mark<00:03:43.739> Hill<00:03:44.010> as<00:03:44.609> you<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:44.880> see<00:03:45.030> it's

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
dear mark Hill as you can see it's

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.589 
dear mark Hill as you can see it's
showing<00:03:45.569> me<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.079> have<00:03:46.290> points<00:03:46.709> for<00:03:46.919> DMR's

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
showing me that I have points for DMR's

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.900 
showing me that I have points for DMR's
and<00:03:48.599> for<00:03:49.169> open<00:03:49.440> firing<00:03:49.889> Co<00:03:50.160> got<00:03:50.519> points<00:03:50.880> for

and for open firing Co got points for

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.509 
and for open firing Co got points for
pistols<00:03:51.480> now<00:03:52.169> this<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:52.470> useful<00:03:52.680> because<00:03:53.040> some

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
pistols now this is useful because some

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.280 
pistols now this is useful because some
weapons<00:03:54.000> don't<00:03:54.329> class<00:03:54.690> as<00:03:54.930> what<00:03:55.109> you<00:03:55.260> think

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
weapons don't class as what you think

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.909 
weapons don't class as what you think
they<00:03:55.739> are<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.639> a<00:03:56.669> shorty<00:03:57.239> shotgun<00:03:57.780> which<00:03:58.530> may

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
they are so a shorty shotgun which may

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.220 
they are so a shorty shotgun which may
well<00:03:59.130> be<00:03:59.790> in<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.000> pistol<00:04:00.359> slot<00:04:00.599> and<00:04:00.900> doesn't

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
well be in the pistol slot and doesn't

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.470 
well be in the pistol slot and doesn't
count<00:04:01.440> as<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.709> pistol<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.370> counts<00:04:02.700> as<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.790> shotgun

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
count as a pistol it counts as a shotgun

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.119 
count as a pistol it counts as a shotgun
so<00:04:05.480> when<00:04:05.629> you<00:04:05.720> get<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.050> scorecard<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.890> can

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
so when you get to the scorecard you can

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.400 
so when you get to the scorecard you can
see<00:04:07.280> in<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.700> center<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.870> bar<00:04:09.080> across<00:04:09.290> the

see in the center of the bar across the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.830 
see in the center of the bar across the
top<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:10.099> have<00:04:10.150> assignment<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.390> that's<00:04:11.540> where

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
millimeter or deep big kills so this is

failing<00:05:11.840> to<00:05:12.260> unlock<00:05:13.330> now<00:05:14.330> it's<00:05:14.510> often<00:05:14.660> down<00:05:15.020> to

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
failing to unlock now it's often down to

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.810 
failing to unlock now it's often down to
confusion<00:05:15.710> as<00:05:15.800> to<00:05:15.830> what<00:05:16.100> weapon<00:05:16.550> you<00:05:16.580> should

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.190 
path that work for me if that still
doesn't<00:06:50.340> work<00:06:50.730> then<00:06:51.240> I<00:06:51.360> recommend<00:06:51.660> going<00:06:52.080> on

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200
