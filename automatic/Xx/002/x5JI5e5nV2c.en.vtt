00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello swami deserters talk today 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.109
 about the difficulties of choosing a case if you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.389
 happy owner of iphone 5s or 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.040
 iphone 5 why these particular models 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.170
 because yes they are basically the same 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.630
 by design and let's see which 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.630
 covers do not exist there are different types 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.600
 that is, a flip case and there is a clip case and they 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.689
 they are different in that they are on magnets 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.939
 same ordinary and it snaps we 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.640
 just worn on top of the cover if 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.349
 such covers of this type where there is this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.700
 hatch for which you pull and phone 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.660
 pulled out example let's show you 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.670
 that is, I shove him 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.920
 and in principle when transporting not 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.579
 the screen is not scratched 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.500
 nothing but there are such covers it 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:53.940
 lining the back of the phone 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.070
 their phone looks like many 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.730
 people are confused do not know what case 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.680
 buy but today we talk about such 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 types of covers like these pads but 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.559
 About this model is our case 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.040
 speck 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.250
 and why we chose him now I 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.250
 I will tell you 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.070
 so if we talk about the covers here it is 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.110
 taste and a matter of choice each of us for 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.970
 chooses his favorite gadget 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.250
 completely different covers someone chooses 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.940
 someone chooses a flip case and someone 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.010
 selects the back cover pads and 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.380
 stick a film on the screen 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.510
 this is a matter of taste and by the way write to 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.580
 comments of you which covers 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.010
 of these species enjoys will be very 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.590
 It is interesting to get some such feedback and 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.900
 see why today is about this 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.820
 I wanted to tell the cover because but about 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.580
 this case you saw on the channel video 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.830
 if you have not seen, be sure to look 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.900
 I like this case because it comes from 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.550
 very soft plastic made this type 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.820
 like rubberized then there is this one on 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.890
 light glossy plastic and this is rubber 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.790
 soft touch design elements probably 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.369
 so to speak 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.240
 rubber buttons here a hole for 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.490
 buttons new button duplicating the way 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.740
 button it is rubber so basically 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.600
 edges should not be erased and scratched 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.820
 will be if you have a black iphone 5 to 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.970
 for example, but let's see how inside 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.800
 sitting iphone 5s 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.790
 by the way he climbed here very tightly 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.190
 firmly and very well felt in 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.900
 hand all the buttons are perfectly pressed 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.850
 Kindle Newt Truth Becomes Less 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.980
 affordable but it is basically good that 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.519
 you're not holding us on in your pocket 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.610
 silent mode here below us 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:54.260
 mesh where the speaker connector lightning 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.780
 and a headphone jack 35 and a mesh for 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.230
 microphone that is everything remains available 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.060
 the sound is not muffled everything becomes 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.190
 cool and good that is for example if u 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.190
 you phone is stored in the bag constantly 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.470
 then it will not interfere in that case 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.620
 when there is some flip case and here 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.760
 here for example we see what is for 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.760
 headphones a little bit 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:24.290
 hole to hole 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.459
 how well said and there is just visually 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.120
 will show that I fight 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.909
 mod, that is, we have a little speaker 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.890
 still there is a way but there are birds 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.530
 when the speaker closes completely we go 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.560
 suffers all covers for example movies finely 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.959
 As for the cover of the company he speck us 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.939
 I liked generally only its price 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.159
 probably yes because I bought myself 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.189
 I will look at this cover to 5 as if down 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.049
 pray iphone 5 yes in principle too 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.810
 should really fit well I wouldn't 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.200
 said that there are any cons all 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.239
 cool everything is cool and that is but there are people 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.750
 who like to feel aluminum and 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.359
 glass up in the phone ie feel top 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.120
 what engineers came up with in apple 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.829
 and there are those who like to something 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.709
 pad I'm here for example you were why 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.870
 because it is soft-touch plastic here and 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.519
 here is some sort of texture behind 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.620
 now come to the flip case again because 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.419
 what I already told you inside lsa 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.479
 put scratches on your screen 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.160
 she is barely noticeable but to abstract 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.400
 from the fact that it is not already completely 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.250
 hard and here is this case he came on 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.180
 change worn another flip case and 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.330
 I think it's a great substitute because 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.580
 sometimes 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.639
 phone you lay carelessly sometimes phone 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.289
 lies bags and so on so everyone 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.580
 highly recommended use 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.240
 such numbers overlays 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.770
 creatine plenochku icon to 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.110
 probably protect your screen somehow 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.860
 and extend the life of the device and it is you 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:58.699
 longer pleased because you are with him so 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.460
 say on a short hand and still if 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.940
 take care of the device and treat 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.990
 he will cherish him longer 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.780
 here generally write what comments 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.039
 covers love to use you 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.639
 Do you use any covers up 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.240
 such question subscribe to the channel 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.729

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.410
 shield 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.270
 the apparatus is in principle not very hard for us 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.979
