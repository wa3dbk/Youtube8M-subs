00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.299
 the voices together 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.369
 take away the fact that he did leverage 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.750
 of the very few where it remained as 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.750
 well she made it water 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.960

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:34.050
 innocent face and a little scared that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.870
 ago when he wants intener tender are 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.200
 dyslexic is okay that we talk like 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.030
 subject rockets make a butcher and me 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.570
 may be dyslexic that you are racist 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.250
 and in the voice so eh no if in the book has 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.460
 written hello 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.100
 at least I hope I looked at her just the same 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.620
 bring it more luck works because 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.660
 a few minutes later he fell asleep badly 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.329
 saw him monster is normal that yes 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.859
 once sleeps the journey of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.960
 return seems much longer than that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.010
 of the going but luckily for me I had 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.020
 brought the headphones 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.670
 so at least I could hear some 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.070
 music looks out the window 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.020
 all the while as he began to 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.509
 raining bad weather 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.340
 bad day is bad life in 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.360
 general 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:26.369
 and then shows clear writing guy and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.350
 non-spoiler traveling but I give you; 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.250
 god makes spoilers to free gifts too 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.400
 dare to via de via is gone but for 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.560
 my luck we already have bad weather 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.590
 bad day is bad life in 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.860
 general that sucks and the beauty was that 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.670
 beautiful buffalo worse than a bear and I had 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.560
 the head that was about to burst 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.180
 I swear I wanted to wake her up but when I have 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.079
 since the drool descended from her 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.970
 mouth 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.829
 I started laughing so hard that I have 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.780
 had to hold my belly when 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.409
 we arrived at the drool he had insulted them 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.409
 the T-shirt 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.060
 but the actress wakes up 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.170
 we arrived that if she is wrong and 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.970
 rubbing his eyes 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.060
 yes but I advise you to put in the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.830
 valley I replied holding back the laughter 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.620
 she looked at me and looked at my wife and 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.560
 then I look at the shirt and at it or not that 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.560
 sucks because she did n't wake me up 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.709
 they want to do it but when i saw that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.930
 you slept so well I said yesterday to me 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.890
 he glared and stood up 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.730
 snorting , he followed her and we waited for the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.709
 such as other strands of hair 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.620
 no let me understand there is a hairdresser 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.480
 on the witty bus we continue 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.010
 everyone to their home then 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.580
 we make a piece of road all three 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.590
 together 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.299
 there was a grave silence between us that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.349
 usually there was only when one of us 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:11.290
 took a bad grade I do not 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:11.290
 I take you all so very well 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.569
 50 white which is usually that usually 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.630
 there was only when that meant 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.450
 often we were all three hyperactive 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.329
 dyslexics see also contributes to 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.120
 of the I in particular therefore ours 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.400
 average was not much if they 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.690
 they took 6 I took 4 if I took it 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.840
 resumed 5 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.579
 I three and so on try to start one 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.190
 conversation but they closed it 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.019
 always with a monosyllable at the end 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.900
 he gives me a quarter of an hour later 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:50.900
 I arrived home so the healthy ed 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.730
 I already entered a weapon I am at home online but 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.380
 he didn't answer so I thought he was out 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.000
 went into the kitchen because as someone 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.950
 he had taken my lunch from me 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.290
 hands were starving 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.269
 open the fridge and take the first thing 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.740
 a heart came to me from 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.090
 dinosaur 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.100
 no no no it was not a paradise not 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.140
 forget that luckily he was a kinder 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.900
 pinguì because my sister liked 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.020
 very kinder pinguì I threw myself 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.850
 literally on the bed and me 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.150
 I fell asleep a few hours 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.340
 after 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.900
 will have been more or less the 7 series a 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.120
 from the living room waiting to see in me 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.120
 sitting on the sofa but instead pd on him 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.790
 it was all about four 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.160
 as if there had been thieves and i 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.170
 mine were not there and probably before 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.510

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:46.820

 a doubt assails me eat is not beautiful 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:59.510

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.440

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.490

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.430
 but what doubts confirmed you too 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.130

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.990

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.650

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.010
 small group I rushed to the door and 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.960
 I let him in but what happens but 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.540
 what is happening said beautifully 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.860
 scared I'm confused with lions 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.449
 I 'm not understanding anything anymore 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:49.740
 this particle really is 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:51.360

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.949

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.550
 our parents are gone and the house is 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.860
 upside down 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.210
 I didn't know how confused I was 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.819
 they had my things 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.529
 I had too many questions that probably 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.779
 they would never master found 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:06.059

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:10.979
 mess was late and we were alone and 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:20.430
 especially hungry and there was only one 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:22.469

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.689

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:26.639

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:28.770
 language I went there kitchen followed 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:32.339

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:36.629

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.839
 the items at the end something feet from 

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:44.460
 to eat 

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:46.289

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:13.770
 bed of mine perhaps in a bed 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.740
