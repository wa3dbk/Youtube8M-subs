regulator from the factory Suzuki now as

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.580 
regulator from the factory Suzuki now as
you<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.760> both<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.350> same

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
you see in both they have it on the same

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.389 
you see in both they have it on the same
age<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.960> each<00:00:47.870> each<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.160> start

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
age of each each one so they can start

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.080 
age of each each one so they can start
the<00:00:51.270> test<00:00:51.510> at<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.079> same<00:00:52.320> time<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.920> from<00:00:53.820> point

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the test at the same time and from point

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.580 
the test at the same time and from point
A<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.870> point<00:00:55.410> B<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:57.030> end<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.410> same

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
A to point B that you end on the same

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.660 
A to point B that you end on the same
time<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.340> their<00:01:00.379> original<00:01:01.379> ones<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.370> because

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
time if their original ones but because

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.490 
time if their original ones but because
the<00:01:02.820> aftermarket<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.870> better<00:01:04.170> than<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the aftermarket one is better than the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.060 
the aftermarket one is better than the
original<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:07.080> will<00:01:07.350> end<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.890> lot

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
original one this one will end a lot

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.850 
original one this one will end a lot
faster<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.210> lot<00:01:09.479> better<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.140> there's<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> lot

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
faster is a lot better and there's a lot

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.210 
faster is a lot better and there's a lot
quieter<00:01:11.460> too<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.030> well<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.110> let's<00:01:13.650> start<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
quieter too as well so let's start the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.310 
quieter too as well so let's start the
test<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:15.530> have<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> battery<00:01:17.549> right<00:01:17.790> next<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> me

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
test I have a battery right next to me

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.899 
test I have a battery right next to me
which<00:01:19.320> I'm<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.860> test<00:01:20.040> both<00:01:20.340> at<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> same

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
which I'm going to test both at the same

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.330 
which I'm going to test both at the same
time<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.630> want<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.840> show<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.619> make
