This is the Epsilon unit

This is what you've been looking for?

Clearly they transferred Epsilon into that floating thing we saw

You saw a floating thing?

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.040
Yes, like a metal eye

It shot a laser at us

Yeah, ok

This is a storage unit

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.660
We were trained to modify them

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.140
We can change a storage unit into a capture unit

Or the Epsilon that's just a floating head and visits you when you're alone?

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.700
I'm not crazy
