programs can rip mp3s from CDs but the

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.050 
programs can rip mp3s from CDs but the
tricky<00:02:02.230> part<00:02:02.470> is<00:02:02.710> if<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.190> try<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.460> do<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:03.850> in

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
tricky part is if you try to do this in

tricky part is if you try to do this in
iTunes<00:02:04.450> for<00:02:04.780> example<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.790> put<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:07.330> an

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
iTunes for example you put in an

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.650 
iTunes for example you put in an
audiobook<00:02:08.260> CD<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:10.060> will<00:02:10.330> rip<00:02:10.680> the<00:02:11.680> 1<00:02:11.980> CD<00:02:12.910> into

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
audiobook CD it will rip the 1 CD into

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.240 
audiobook CD it will rip the 1 CD into
20<00:02:14.050> different<00:02:14.170> tracks<00:02:15.600> but<00:02:16.600> we<00:02:16.750> only<00:02:16.900> want

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
which will turn out to be 20 different

created in that folder called
remembering<00:05:22.960> was<00:05:23.200> created<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:24.510> there<00:05:25.510> is<00:05:25.720> a

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
remembering was created and there is a

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:34.590 
remembering was created and there is a
file<00:05:27.720> this<00:05:29.400> 261<00:05:30.400> megabytes<00:05:31.320> and<00:05:32.340> that's<00:05:33.340> it<00:05:33.610> so

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
file this 261 megabytes and that's it so

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.420 
file this 261 megabytes and that's it so
the<00:05:34.810> trick<00:05:35.110> again<00:05:35.320> was<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:37.210> go<00:05:37.420> to<00:05:37.480> the<00:05:37.930> last
