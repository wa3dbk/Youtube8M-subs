first time I thought Disney really got
that<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.380> they<00:02:28.500> really<00:02:28.920> captured<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.210> for

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
that and they really captured it and for

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.690 
that and they really captured it and for

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
well me I should say but like I said

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.310 
well me I should say but like I said
it's<00:03:14.370> not<00:03:14.610> bad<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.330> just<00:03:15.570> turns<00:03:15.810> out<00:03:15.930> they<00:03:16.140> did

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
it's not bad it just turns out they did

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.070 
it's not bad it just turns out they did
one<00:03:16.590> element<00:03:17.100> way<00:03:17.460> too<00:03:17.520> well<00:03:18.000> but<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.690> be<00:03:18.810> fair

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
one element way too well but to be fair

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.630 
one element way too well but to be fair
that's<00:03:19.380> better<00:03:19.710> than<00:03:19.920> having<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.250> whole<00:03:20.400> film

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
that's better than having the whole film

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.120 
that's better than having the whole film
just<00:03:20.910> be<00:03:21.090> mediocre<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:22.080> much<00:03:22.230> like<00:03:22.440> Tarzan<00:03:23.010> I

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
just be mediocre and much like Tarzan I

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.100 
just be mediocre and much like Tarzan I
shouldn't<00:03:23.370> analyze<00:03:23.850> what<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.090> wanted<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.720> be<00:03:24.930> as

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
shouldn't analyze what I wanted to be as

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.200 
shouldn't analyze what I wanted to be as
much<00:03:25.320> as<00:03:25.560> what<00:03:25.740> it<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.550> what<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.940> it

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
much as what it is and for what it is it

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.200 
much as what it is and for what it is it
is<00:03:27.270> really<00:03:28.110> good<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.950> animation<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.760> great

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
seen that explore it a little bit more

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.840 
seen that explore it a little bit more
but<00:03:58.410> it's<00:03:58.560> still<00:03:58.740> good<00:03:59.040> flick<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.640> stuff

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
but it's still good flick and the stuff

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.000 
but it's still good flick and the stuff
that<00:04:00.030> stands<00:04:00.300> out<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.720> really<00:04:01.260> fantastic

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:15.040 
the aliens are okay but the sisters are
more<00:04:04.830> than<00:04:05.070> worth<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.310> price<00:04:05.610> of<00:04:05.790> admission

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050
