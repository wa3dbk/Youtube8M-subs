00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
down below now this actually slides

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.800 
down below now this actually slides
right<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.970> actually<00:01:15.030> took<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.570> off

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
right in here and I actually took it off

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.289 
right in here and I actually took it off
because<00:01:16.080> I'm<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.250> big<00:01:17.430> fan<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> suction

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
because I'm not a big fan of the suction

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.140 
because I'm not a big fan of the suction
and<00:01:18.479> since<00:01:18.830> I<00:01:19.830> later<00:01:20.280> found<00:01:20.369> out<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.970> this

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and since I later found out that this

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.340 
and since I later found out that this
wasn't<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:22.080> our<00:01:22.830> radio<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:25.049> under<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
wasn't a our radio I was under the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.580 
wasn't a our radio I was under the
impression<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.250> shower<00:01:26.580> radio<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
impression this was a shower radio and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.090 
impression this was a shower radio and
this<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:28.920> really<00:01:29.250> neat<00:01:29.930> but<00:01:30.979> what<00:01:31.979> you

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
this would be really neat but what you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.350 
this would be really neat but what you
can<00:01:32.310> actually<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
can actually do with this is you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.780 
can actually do with this is you
actually<00:01:33.450> put<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.619> there<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.400> can

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
actually put this on there and this can

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.810 
actually put this on there and this can
actually<00:01:35.939> sit<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.659> your<00:01:36.960> mirror<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:38.280> get<00:01:38.490> I'm

take the bunch of the rain as long as
the<00:02:48.860> thing<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.010> actually<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.760> if<00:02:51.060> it's

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
the thing is actually like this if it's

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.590 
the thing is actually like this if it's
like<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.959> this<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.590> exposed<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.550> would<00:02:54.450> be

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
like this and this is exposed I would be

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.070 
like this and this is exposed I would be
a<00:02:54.630> little<00:02:54.900> weary<00:02:55.170> about<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:56.989> even<00:02:57.989> though

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
a little weary about that even though

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.430 
a little weary about that even though
I'm<00:02:58.200> sure<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:58.650> probably<00:02:58.860> sealed<00:03:00.140> ok<00:03:01.140> enough

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
I'm sure it's probably sealed ok enough

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.090 
I'm sure it's probably sealed ok enough
it's<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:01.739> not<00:03:02.010> sealed<00:03:02.430> for<00:03:02.670> water<00:03:02.880> proof

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
it's just not sealed for water proof

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.350 
it's just not sealed for water proof
this<00:03:05.100> little<00:03:05.870> five<00:03:06.870> bolted<00:03:07.410> uh<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:08.850> little<00:03:09.030> 5

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
this little five bolted uh this little 5

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.900 
this little five bolted uh this little 5
volt<00:03:09.660> door<00:03:10.110> right<00:03:10.410> here<00:03:10.680> actually<00:03:11.520> did<00:03:11.730> come

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
volt door right here actually did come

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.640 
volt door right here actually did come
off<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.420> had<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.750> actually<00:03:12.900> put<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.320> back

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
off and I had to actually put that back

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.789 
off and I had to actually put that back
on<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.580> do<00:03:14.970> we<00:03:15.380> think<00:03:16.380> about<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:18.500> there<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.769> a

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
on so do we think about that there is a

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.590 
on so do we think about that there is a
built-in<00:03:20.370> mic<00:03:20.610> right<00:03:20.880> there<00:03:20.910> which<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.299> can

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
built-in mic right there which you can

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.740 
built-in mic right there which you can
tell<00:03:21.870> which<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:22.380> very<00:03:23.220> neat<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.350> low-budget

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
tell which is very neat for a low-budget

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.330 
tell which is very neat for a low-budget
water-resistant<00:03:27.750> speaker<00:03:28.200> which<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.190> thought

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
water-resistant speaker which I thought

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.140 
water-resistant speaker which I thought
was<00:03:29.519> really<00:03:29.730> neat<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.269> know<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.420> turn<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.989> on

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
was really neat you know to turn it on

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.289 
was really neat you know to turn it on
he<00:03:33.150> actually<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.600> push<00:03:33.810> right<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.140> here<00:03:35.299> and

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
he actually just push right on here and

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.990 
he actually just push right on here and
you<00:03:36.510> hold<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.070> should<00:03:38.280> start<00:03:38.549> pairing

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
you hold it and it should start pairing

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.449 
you hold it and it should start pairing
and<00:03:39.330> then<00:03:40.019> right<00:03:40.230> over<00:03:40.440> here<00:03:40.620> we<00:03:40.739> come<00:03:40.950> here

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
and then right over here we come here

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:49.400 
and then right over here we come here
and<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:42.239> should<00:03:42.570> be<00:03:42.690> right<00:03:42.810> here<00:03:42.840> BTS<00:03:43.680> 0<00:03:44.010> 6<00:03:48.410> it

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
and it should be right here BTS 0 6 it

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.990 
and it should be right here BTS 0 6 it
should<00:03:49.739> pair

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.050 

now<00:03:55.230> now<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.439> it's<00:03:56.620> paired<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:57.790> see

your off and to hold it you just hold it
and<00:04:08.799> you're<00:04:08.950> like<00:04:09.069> two<00:04:09.310> seconds<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:09.909> turns<00:04:10.120> off

and you're like two seconds it turns off
two<00:04:10.569> to<00:04:10.690> three<00:04:10.870> seconds<00:04:11.319> so<00:04:11.500> now<00:04:12.220> it's

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
two to three seconds so now it's

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.300 
two to three seconds so now it's
connected<00:04:12.700> what's<00:04:13.090> going<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.420> spot<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:13.840> by<00:04:14.310> now

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310

compare to the other five speaker and of

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.150 
compare to the other five speaker and of
course<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:31.120> price<00:04:31.479> it<00:04:32.350> doesn't<00:04:32.680> compare<00:04:32.979> to

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
course in price it doesn't compare to

the<00:04:33.280> other<00:04:33.430> buyer<00:04:33.669> speaker<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:36.250> let's<00:04:36.580> go

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
the other buyer speaker so let's go

the other buyer speaker so let's go
ahead<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:36.910> play<00:04:55.470> so<00:04:56.470> as<00:04:56.530> you<00:04:56.650> can<00:04:56.800> tell<00:04:57.039> the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
ahead and play so as you can tell the

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.670 
ahead and play so as you can tell the
sound<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.849> pretty<00:04:58.210> good<00:04:58.510> especially<00:04:58.930> if<00:04:59.500> you

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
sound is pretty good especially if you

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.379 
sound is pretty good especially if you
are<00:04:59.830> in<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.039> bathroom<00:05:00.550> so<00:05:00.910> because<00:05:01.240> the

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
are in a bathroom so because the

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.260 
are in a bathroom so because the
bathrooms<00:05:01.810> are<00:05:02.050> mostly<00:05:02.380> made<00:05:02.710> like<00:05:03.580> like<00:05:04.120> an

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
bathrooms are mostly made like like an

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.700 
bathrooms are mostly made like like an
echo<00:05:04.570> chamber<00:05:04.599> kind<00:05:05.320> of<00:05:05.410> thing

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
echo chamber kind of thing

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.430 
echo chamber kind of thing
this<00:05:06.010> will<00:05:06.190> sound<00:05:06.370> pretty<00:05:06.550> good<00:05:07.320> but<00:05:08.320> if

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
this will sound pretty good but if

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.610 
this will sound pretty good but if
you're<00:05:08.560> using<00:05:08.740> this<00:05:09.039> in<00:05:10.110> just<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.349> regular
