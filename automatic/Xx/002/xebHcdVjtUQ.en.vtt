and<00:00:15.210> minerals<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.690> needs<00:00:15.929> as<00:00:16.710> we<00:00:16.859> all<00:00:16.980> know

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
and minerals that needs as we all know

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.429 
and minerals that needs as we all know
minerals<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.480> been<00:00:18.690> depleted<00:00:19.140> out<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.320> our

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
minerals have been depleted out of our

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.920 
minerals have been depleted out of our
soil<00:00:19.740> even<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.340> we're<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.640> organic<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
soil even if we're going organic and a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.509 
soil even if we're going organic and a
lot<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.199> times<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:22.590> we're<00:00:22.740> finding<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.460> that

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
lot of times what we're finding is that

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.630 
lot of times what we're finding is that
we<00:00:24.420> need<00:00:24.750> these<00:00:25.350> re<00:00:25.859> induce<00:00:26.130> these<00:00:26.310> minerals

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
we need these re induce these minerals

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880 
we need these re induce these minerals
back<00:00:26.789> into<00:00:26.849> our<00:00:27.180> body<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> hydro<00:00:28.650> pier

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
back into our body with the hydro pier

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.920 
back into our body with the hydro pier
it's<00:00:29.400> out<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.609> sulfate<00:00:30.090> minerals<00:00:32.930> are

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
it's out of sulfate minerals are

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.889 
it's out of sulfate minerals are
balances<00:00:34.380> sulfur<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.820> exactly<00:00:36.630> what

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
balances sulfur so this is exactly what

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.770 
balances sulfur so this is exactly what
our<00:00:36.930> body<00:00:37.260> needs<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.190> ion<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.579> formed

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
our body needs it all and ion is formed

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.600 
our body needs it all and ion is formed
at<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> same<00:00:40.230> time<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.010> giving<00:00:41.280> us<00:00:41.399> all

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
at the same time that is giving us all

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.700 
at the same time that is giving us all
the<00:00:41.730> minerals<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:42.809> helping<00:00:43.469> get

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the minerals it's actually helping get

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
the minerals it's actually helping get
rid<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> contaminants<00:00:44.760> there's<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> product<00:00:45.660> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
rid of contaminants there's a product to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.770 
rid of contaminants there's a product to
processes<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.620> occur<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:47.879> basically<00:00:48.390> it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
processes that occur and basically it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.450 
processes that occur and basically it's
bringing<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.530> contaminants<00:00:50.100> together

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
bringing the contaminants together

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
bringing the contaminants together
because<00:00:51.149> its<00:00:51.300> restructuring<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.320> our

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
because its restructuring all of our

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.799 
because its restructuring all of our
water<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:53.129> our<00:00:53.309> body<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.690> actually

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
water in our body and you can actually

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
water in our body and you can actually
see<00:00:54.989> them<00:00:55.289> visibly<00:00:55.710> sometimes<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.910> you're

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
see them visibly sometimes if you're

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.430 
see them visibly sometimes if you're
just<00:00:57.210> treating<00:00:57.329> water<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.020> see<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> in

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
just treating water you can see it in

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
just treating water you can see it in
the<00:00:58.500> water<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.520> then<00:00:59.730> also<00:00:59.879> I've<00:01:00.149> had

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the water and then also I've had

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180 
the water and then also I've had
patients<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.020> clients<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.739> actually

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
just coming out of their body which is

15<00:01:44.460> drops<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.390> hole<00:01:45.600> leader<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.650> just

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
15 drops in a hole leader and you just

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.920 
15 drops in a hole leader and you just
drink<00:01:47.160> that<00:01:47.400> throughout<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:47.970> day<00:01:48.120> I<00:01:48.390> like

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
drink that throughout the day I like

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.690 
drink that throughout the day I like
people<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.740> whole<00:01:50.190> leader<00:01:50.460> within

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
people to have that whole leader within

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.850 
people to have that whole leader within
two<00:01:51.060> hours<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.480> them<00:01:51.960> taking<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> super<00:01:52.680> shot

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
two hours of them taking the super shot

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.610 
two hours of them taking the super shot
but<00:01:53.760> that's<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.210> protocol<00:01:54.600> right<00:01:55.140> there<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
but that's the protocol right there and

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.400 
but that's the protocol right there and
I<00:01:56.400> can't<00:01:56.700> emphasize<00:01:57.390> how<00:01:57.420> important<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
I can't emphasize how important it is to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.380 
I can't emphasize how important it is to
drink<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:58.980> liter<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.340> water<00:01:59.580> though<00:01:59.880> because

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
drink that liter of water though because

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.970 
drink that liter of water though because
if<00:02:00.570> we're<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.320> take<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.800> these

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
if we're going to take all these

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.160 
if we're going to take all these
minerals<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.880> super<00:02:03.210> concentrated<00:02:03.720> form

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
minerals in a super concentrated form

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.219 
minerals in a super concentrated form
then<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.370> need<00:02:05.400> to<00:02:05.670> make<00:02:06.060> sure<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.810> we're

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
then we need to make sure that we're

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.020 
then we need to make sure that we're
flushing<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.890> water<00:02:08.130> in<00:02:08.340> behind<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.880> so<00:02:08.970> we

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
flushing the water in behind it so we

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.609 
flushing the water in behind it so we
can<00:02:09.179> put<00:02:09.360> those<00:02:09.510> minerals<00:02:09.840> or<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> body<00:02:10.260> and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
can put those minerals or a body and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.410 
can put those minerals or a body and
when<00:02:11.010> we<00:02:11.100> elect<00:02:11.400> people<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.850> that<00:02:11.970> for<00:02:12.180> 30

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
when we elect people to do that for 30

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.240 
when we elect people to do that for 30
days<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:13.260> what<00:02:13.470> would<00:02:13.590> be<00:02:13.650> your<00:02:13.770> overall

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
