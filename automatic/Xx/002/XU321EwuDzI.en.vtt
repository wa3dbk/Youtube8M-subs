00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.800 
ball let the Ravens win hopefully Joe
Flacco<00:01:35.400> doesn't<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:35.880> out<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.180> play<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.540> ass

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
Flacco doesn't go out and play like ass

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.469 
Flacco doesn't go out and play like ass
but<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.170> think<00:01:37.409> Andrew<00:01:37.740> Luck<00:01:37.950> being<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.310> rookie

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
but I think Andrew Luck being a rookie

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.940 
but I think Andrew Luck being a rookie
that's<00:01:39.479> mainly<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.079> reason<00:01:40.229> why<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:40.740> going

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
