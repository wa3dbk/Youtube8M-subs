problem-solving<00:01:02.010> which<00:01:03.010> has<00:01:03.219> three<00:01:03.489> steps

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
problem-solving which has three steps

problem-solving which has three steps
let's<00:01:04.720> take<00:01:04.899> a<00:01:04.930> look<00:01:07.170> first<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:09.539> have<00:01:10.539> to

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
let's take a look first you have to

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.060 
let's take a look first you have to
admit<00:01:10.960> that<00:01:11.289> a<00:01:11.320> problem<00:01:11.740> exists<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.979> does

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
admit that a problem exists what does

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.430 
admit that a problem exists what does
that<00:01:15.100> take<00:01:18.390> takes<00:01:19.390> humility<00:01:19.750> honesty<00:01:22.440> will

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
that take takes humility honesty will

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.990 
that take takes humility honesty will
have<00:01:23.679> some<00:01:23.950> work<00:01:24.100> to<00:01:24.280> do<00:01:24.399> in<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.550> department

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
have some work to do in that department

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.790 
have some work to do in that department
know<00:01:27.000> step<00:01:28.000> number<00:01:28.179> two<00:01:30.090> identify<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:32.530> the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
know step number two identify what the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.570 
know step number two identify what the
problem<00:01:33.310> is<00:01:33.459> why<00:01:34.060> does<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.539> seem<00:01:34.780> hard<00:01:35.580> hmm

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
problem is why does it seem hard hmm

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.199 
problem is why does it seem hard hmm
what<00:01:37.450> does<00:01:37.539> that<00:01:37.569> take

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:50.609 

takes<00:01:43.259> curiosity<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:45.160> awareness<00:01:46.890> okay<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:49.619> can

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
takes curiosity and awareness okay I can

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.309 
takes curiosity and awareness okay I can
see<00:01:50.830> that<00:01:50.979> right<00:01:51.989> and<00:01:53.069> step<00:01:54.069> number<00:01:54.220> three

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
see that right and step number three

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.109 
see that right and step number three
once<00:01:56.319> we<00:01:56.500> find<00:01:56.770> what<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:56.979> problem<00:01:57.310> is<00:01:57.459> we<00:01:57.910> just

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
once we find what the problem is we just

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.389 
once we find what the problem is we just
need<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.479> need<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:58.810> do<00:01:58.959> some<00:01:59.399> exploration

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
need to need to do some exploration

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.380 
need to need to do some exploration
right<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.050> experimentation<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:03.069> see<00:02:03.390> if

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
right and experimentation to see if

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.330 
right and experimentation to see if
there's<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.780> different<00:02:05.530> way<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:06.009> we<00:02:06.130> can

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
there's a different way that we can

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.609 
there's a different way that we can
think<00:02:06.369> about<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.239> music<00:02:07.569> or<00:02:07.720> plan<00:02:07.989> or<00:02:08.259> a

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
think about the music or plan or a

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.880 
think about the music or plan or a
different<00:02:09.220> way<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:10.569> move<00:02:10.750> our<00:02:11.110> body<00:02:11.530> right

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
different way to move our body right

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.250 
different way to move our body right
until<00:02:12.520> we<00:02:12.580> solve<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.569> problem<00:02:16.170> what<00:02:17.170> does

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
until we solve the problem what does

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.180 
until we solve the problem what does
that<00:02:17.290> require<00:02:20.160> discipline<00:02:22.620> all<00:02:23.620> right<00:02:23.800> don't

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that require discipline all right don't

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.580 
that require discipline all right don't
give<00:02:24.430> up<00:02:24.750> right<00:02:26.099> Wow<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:28.599> you're<00:02:29.349> seeing
