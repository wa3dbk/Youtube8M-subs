the<00:01:17.520> different<00:01:17.820> rooms<00:01:17.939> especially<00:01:18.090> advanced

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the different rooms especially advanced

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.030 
the different rooms especially advanced
you<00:01:18.689> never<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.350> setting<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.009> be

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
you never know what the setting can be

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.469 
you never know what the setting can be
especially<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:20.700> you're<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> morning

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
especially when you're in the morning

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.670 
especially when you're in the morning
it's<00:01:21.630> something<00:01:21.900> differently<00:01:22.229> than<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it's something differently than the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
it's something differently than the
ambient<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:23.159> night<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.270> something

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
ambient at night so it's something

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.609 
ambient at night so it's something
you're<00:01:24.540> gonna<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.900> keep<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.200> mind<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you're gonna have to keep in mind and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.660 
you're gonna have to keep in mind and
it's<00:01:25.740> very<00:01:25.890> very<00:01:26.100> important<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.640> you

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it's very very important that you

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
it's very very important that you
understand<00:01:27.330> maybe<00:01:27.479> how<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> use<00:01:27.840> flash<00:01:28.170> or<00:01:28.409> how

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
understand maybe how to use flash or how

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.230 
understand maybe how to use flash or how
to<00:01:28.590> understand<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.250> I'll<00:01:29.369> light<00:01:29.610> because

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to understand and I'll light because

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.219 
to understand and I'll light because
that<00:01:30.420> way<00:01:30.509> you're<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:30.990> better

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that way you're going to get better

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
that way you're going to get better
shots<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> always<00:01:32.369> recommend<00:01:32.549> having<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
shots so I always recommend having a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.609 
shots so I always recommend having a
flash<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.570> way<00:01:33.720> you're<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:33.930> killing<00:01:34.409> your

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
flash that way you're not killing your

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.499 
flash that way you're not killing your
eye<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.159> don't<00:01:35.310> need<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.759> once<00:01:36.390> again
