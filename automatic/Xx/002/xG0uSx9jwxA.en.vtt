00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello to all who believe that the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.299
 technology will provide the solutions that 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.299
 you need this planet 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.980
 we present the mitsubishi outlander p el 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.200
 First 4x4 hybrid with five seats a 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.230
 large trunk and that can also be 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.869
 charge in any network socket you know 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.300
 more about the pep are acronyms of plug 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.490
 in hybrid electric vehicle or vehicle 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.349
 hybrid plug-in electric 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.710
 outlander pep has three modes of 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.480
 driving the electric driving 100% 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.489
 two electric motors drive the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.980
 outlander pep without consuming a drop of 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.170
 gasoline and without emissions this mode of 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.180
 driving is possible below 120 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.769
 kilometers / hour and it's incredibly 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.449
 Safe silent clean and powerful 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.399
 hybrid driving in series the two 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.440
 electric motors drive the vehicle 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.929
 using the electricity generated by 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.789
 the gasoline engine in this way is 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.359
 possible to increase the power when 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.339
 instant acceleration is needed 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.140
 hybrid driving in parallel the engine 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.510
 of gasoline drives the vehicle to high 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.550
 speed and is assisted by the engines 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.730
 electrical when power is needed 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.730
 additional 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.410
 the battery that drives the motors 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.900
 electric can be charged at any 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.409
 conventional take and in only 5 hours the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.299
 load will be complete 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.429
 you can also do a load 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.799
 regenerative recovering energy 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.929
 kinetics of the vehicle in motion or 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.109
 a fast charge that in just 30 minutes 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.509
 reaches 80 percent the battery 

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:43.850
 loaded in full allows you to travel more 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.280
 50 kilometers without spending gasoline and 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.909
 with zero emissions at speeds of 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.380
 up to 120 kilometers per hour never 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.380
 traveling was so safe 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.710
 the outlander pp is built with 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.450
 materials of the highest quality 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.760
 assembled and adjusted with precision to 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.970
 offer maximum reliability during 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.250
 many years also moves in any 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.959
 ground in complete safety thanks to the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.200
 stability and precision of the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.350
 4x4 technology from mitsubishi 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.420
 perfected in rallies since 1983 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.220
 all occupants are protected by 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.350
 multiple active security elements 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.730
 as the mitigation system of 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.620
 frontal collision 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.900
 the lane departure warning or the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.730
 adaptive speed control the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.430
 solid body outlander pep 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.900
 equipped with the rise technology absorbs 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.750
 possible shocks in all 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.670
 directions the outlander pep has obtained 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.700
 the highest security rating 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.129
 euroncap of 5 stars 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.790
 if you had to summarize the fish outlander 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.989
 in a word, technology 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.540
 technology at the service of the medium 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.790
 environment of energy saving of the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.610
 safety of the durability of the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.819
 Reliability of comfort economy 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.650
 of silence in definitive technology to 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.650
 driving pleasure service 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.629
 for example various functions of 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.970
 outlander pets can be controlled from 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.610
 a smartphone with the free application 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.800
 mitsubishi remote control is possible 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.410
 plan the load to be done 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.090
 in sections of lower electrical cost 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.890
 control the remaining charge time e 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.390
 even set the moment of the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.319
 start-up of the heating 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.319
 electric 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.760
 the interior of the outlander pp is

 materials are of high quality and fit 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.030
 perfectly but if there is something that 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.730
 Highlights when driving the outlander 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.100
 pp is the absence of noise and vibrations 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.590
 so it is possible to enjoy a lot 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.680
 more of the conversation of music by 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.740
 simply of silence with a
