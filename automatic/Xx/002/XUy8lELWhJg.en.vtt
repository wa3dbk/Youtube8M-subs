drawing<00:00:04.359> Holograms<00:00:04.960> by<00:00:05.230> hand<00:00:05.620> in<00:00:06.750> mid-1994<00:00:07.750> I

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
drawing Holograms by hand in mid-1994 I

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.990 
drawing Holograms by hand in mid-1994 I
started<00:00:08.559> drawing<00:00:08.800> much<00:00:09.309> more<00:00:09.640> complicated

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
started drawing much more complicated

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.249 
started drawing much more complicated
Holograms<00:00:10.750> than<00:00:11.049> before<00:00:11.440> this<00:00:12.339> was<00:00:12.610> my<00:00:12.940> first

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
Holograms than before this was my first

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.990 
Holograms than before this was my first

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.950 
little checkerboard that actually tilts
downwards<00:00:21.940> in<00:00:22.090> space<00:00:22.420> and<00:00:23.250> here<00:00:24.250> is<00:00:24.340> my<00:00:24.520> first

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
downwards in space and here is my first

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.630

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.319 

this<00:00:38.440> little<00:00:38.740> tetrahedron<00:00:39.490> is<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.150> first

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
this little tetrahedron is the first

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.780 
this little tetrahedron is the first
object<00:00:40.540> I<00:00:40.870> drew<00:00:41.140> where<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.160> lines<00:00:42.400> come

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
object I drew where the lines come

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.340 
object I drew where the lines come
through<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.270> film<00:00:43.480> plane<00:00:43.750> and<00:00:44.020> stick<00:00:44.230> out

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
through the film plane and stick out

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.400 
through the film plane and stick out
into<00:00:44.620> space<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.780> tip<00:00:46.960> of<00:00:47.079> the<00:00:47.170> little

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
into space so the tip of the little

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
into space so the tip of the little
pyramid<00:00:48.660> goes<00:00:49.660> right<00:00:49.930> through<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.200> plastic

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
find they look much more realistic if

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620 
find they look much more realistic if

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.830 
you lay them on the ground in the Sun
and<00:01:51.929> then<00:01:52.799> move<00:01:53.039> your<00:01:53.069> head<00:01:53.429> don't<00:01:54.330> tilt<00:01:54.599> the

and then move your head don't tilt the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
up and some of our slots and I found it

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.010 
up and some of our slots and I found it
works<00:02:39.350> much<00:02:39.590> better<00:02:39.620> if<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.100> give<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.490> a<00:02:41.020> coat

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
works much better if you give it a coat

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.890 
works much better if you give it a coat
