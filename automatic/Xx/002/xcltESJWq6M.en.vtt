but<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.540> think<00:02:12.629> sing<00:02:12.989> us<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
but I think sing us the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.580 
but I think sing us the
is<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.860> best<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.870> if<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.020> don't<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.410> these

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
is the best and if you don't have these

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.380 
is the best and if you don't have these
tools<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.160> might<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> bit<00:02:17.700> more<00:02:17.880> difficult

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
tools it might be a bit more difficult

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.260 
tools it might be a bit more difficult
to<00:02:18.660> actually<00:02:18.840> sleep<00:02:19.440> your<00:02:19.740> power<00:02:19.980> supply<00:02:20.340> but

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
to actually sleep your power supply but

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.690 
to actually sleep your power supply but
it's<00:02:21.720> not<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.170> big<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.530> deal<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.430> start

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
it's not that big of a deal so to start

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.430 
it's not that big of a deal so to start
off<00:02:23.820> we're<00:02:24.060> going<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.240> take<00:02:24.300> our<00:02:24.540> tool<00:02:24.750> slide

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
off we're going to take our tool slide

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.680 
off we're going to take our tool slide
it<00:02:25.680> into<00:02:25.800> place<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.370> we're<00:02:27.240> gonna<00:02:27.360> pull<00:02:27.600> on

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
it into place and we're gonna pull on

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.830 
it into place and we're gonna pull on
the<00:02:27.780> cable<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:28.920> comes<00:02:29.100> up<00:02:29.310> right<00:02:29.550> out<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the cable and it comes up right out the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.660 
the cable and it comes up right out the
way<00:02:30.960> these<00:02:31.140> cables<00:02:31.650> are<00:02:31.770> actually<00:02:32.070> held<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.460> is

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
way these cables are actually held in is

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.100 
way these cables are actually held in is
by<00:02:33.240> these<00:02:33.300> little<00:02:34.110> clips<00:02:34.920> on<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.250> side<00:02:35.430> and

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
by these little clips on the side and

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.730 
by these little clips on the side and
hopefully<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.320> can<00:02:37.500> see<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.400> right<00:02:39.240> there

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
hopefully you can see that right there

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.560 
hopefully you can see that right there
so<00:02:40.740> they<00:02:40.890> actually<00:02:41.010> hold<00:02:41.460> it<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:41.940> place<00:02:42.120> so

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
so they actually hold it in place so

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.300 
so they actually hold it in place so
once<00:02:43.230> you're<00:02:43.410> gonna<00:02:43.590> be<00:02:43.740> whenever<00:02:44.040> you're

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
once you're gonna be whenever you're

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.400 
once you're gonna be whenever you're
gonna<00:02:44.460> be<00:02:44.670> putting<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.210> back<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.630> what<00:02:46.290> you

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
gonna be putting it back in what you

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.990 
gonna be putting it back in what you
want<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.620> do<00:02:46.710> is<00:02:46.950> sort<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.250> put<00:02:47.490> your<00:02:47.580> exacto

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
want to do is sort of put your exacto

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.750 
want to do is sort of put your exacto
knife<00:02:48.150> underneath<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.840> sort<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.520> take<00:02:50.520> mod

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
knife underneath it and sort of take mod

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.820 
knife underneath it and sort of take mod
against<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.420> make<00:02:51.600> sure<00:02:51.720> they<00:02:51.840> stick<00:02:52.710> in

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
against to make sure they stick in

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.860 
against to make sure they stick in
properly<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.940> we're<00:02:54.060> gonna<00:02:54.180> take<00:02:54.360> up<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
properly so we're gonna take up the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.080 
properly so we're gonna take up the
other<00:02:55.260> side<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.680> cable<00:02:55.980> as<00:02:56.100> well<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.880> the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
other side of the cable as well so the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.180 
other side of the cable as well so the
same<00:02:57.270> thing<00:02:57.480> goes<00:02:57.660> for<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:58.320> side<00:02:58.650> we're<00:02:59.010> just

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
same thing goes for this side we're just

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.600 
same thing goes for this side we're just
gonna<00:02:59.400> pull<00:02:59.730> put<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.660> tool<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.490> pull<00:03:02.490> on

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
gonna pull put the tool in and pull on

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.580 
gonna pull put the tool in and pull on
the<00:03:02.730> cable<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.210> as<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.930> can<00:03:04.020> see<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.380> cable

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
the cable and as you can see the cable

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.700 
the cable and as you can see the cable
is<00:03:04.860> out<00:03:05.070> right<00:03:05.310> now<00:03:05.490> now<00:03:06.240> this<00:03:06.540> will<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:07.680> a

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
is out right now now this will be a

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.650 
is out right now now this will be a
little<00:03:07.890> bit<00:03:08.100> different<00:03:08.430> if<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.450> non

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
little bit different if you have a non

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.510 
little bit different if you have a non
module<00:03:09.990> power<00:03:10.200> supply<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.770> might<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.250> to

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
module power supply you might have to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.180 
module power supply you might have to
like<00:03:12.480> for<00:03:12.870> example<00:03:13.230> take<00:03:13.410> your<00:03:13.560> sleeving<00:03:13.890> and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
like for example take your sleeving and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.830 
like for example take your sleeving and
sleeve<00:03:14.490> it<00:03:14.610> from<00:03:14.790> one<00:03:14.970> side<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.360> sort<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.600> end

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
sleeve it from one side and sort of end

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.530 
sleeve it from one side and sort of end
it<00:03:15.960> here<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.350> just<00:03:17.190> put<00:03:17.790> heat<00:03:18.030> ring<00:03:18.209> over<00:03:18.480> it

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
it here and just put heat ring over it

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.510 
it here and just put heat ring over it
because<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.930> can't<00:03:19.140> really<00:03:19.950> take<00:03:20.220> off<00:03:20.370> the

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
because you can't really take off the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.070 
because you can't really take off the
cable<00:03:20.670> from<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.300> power<00:03:21.480> supply<00:03:21.780> if<00:03:21.930> it's

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
cable from the power supply if it's

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.630 
cable from the power supply if it's
soldered<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:24.050> so<00:03:25.050> I'm<00:03:25.530> not<00:03:25.709> gonna<00:03:25.860> do<00:03:26.459> this

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
soldered in and so I'm not gonna do this

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.810 
soldered in and so I'm not gonna do this
filippo<00:03:28.250> basically<00:03:29.250> what<00:03:29.400> you're<00:03:29.490> gonna<00:03:29.640> do

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
filippo basically what you're gonna do

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.610 
filippo basically what you're gonna do
is<00:03:30.060> take<00:03:31.020> your<00:03:31.200> sleeving

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
is take your sleeving

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.020 
is take your sleeving
which<00:03:31.830> is<00:03:32.010> right<00:03:32.160> here<00:03:32.190> I'm<00:03:32.430> just<00:03:32.490> using<00:03:32.670> this

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
which is right here I'm just using this

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.199 
which is right here I'm just using this
leftover<00:03:33.510> from<00:03:33.720> my<00:03:33.870> blue<00:03:34.560> cam<00:03:34.770> beast<00:03:35.209> you're

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
leftover from my blue cam beast you're

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.440 
leftover from my blue cam beast you're
gonna<00:03:36.330> sort<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.380> push<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.770> from<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.790> sides<00:03:39.000> -<00:03:39.240> a

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
gonna sort of push it from the sides - a

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.350 
gonna sort of push it from the sides - a
little<00:03:39.750> bit<00:03:39.870> flat<00:03:40.110> as<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:40.350> was<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.430> my<00:03:42.090> tool

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
little bit flat as it was in in my tool

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.810 
little bit flat as it was in in my tool
box<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.860> hasn't<00:03:44.220> been<00:03:44.370> used<00:03:44.670> before

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
box so this hasn't been used before

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.270 
box so this hasn't been used before
obviously<00:03:45.140> so<00:03:46.140> you're<00:03:46.260> gonna<00:03:46.380> stretch<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.220> out

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
obviously so you're gonna stretch it out

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.790 
obviously so you're gonna stretch it out
stretch<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.360> out<00:03:48.420> what<00:03:48.600> you're<00:03:48.720> gonna<00:03:48.840> sort<00:03:49.739> of

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
stretch it out what you're gonna sort of

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.160 
stretch it out what you're gonna sort of
push<00:03:50.550> on<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.000> as<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.690> can<00:03:51.870> see<00:03:51.930> it

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
push on it and as you can see it

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.860 
push on it and as you can see it
increases<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:52.860> size<00:03:53.010> but<00:03:53.280> also<00:03:53.480> makes<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.660> a

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
increases in size but also makes it a

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.040 
increases in size but also makes it a
little<00:03:55.770> bit<00:03:55.980> more<00:03:56.220> flexible<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.060> then<00:03:57.930> you're

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
little bit more flexible and then you're

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.540 
little bit more flexible and then you're
gonna<00:03:58.260> take<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.800> you're<00:03:59.040> gonna<00:03:59.130> slide<00:03:59.310> it

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
gonna take it and you're gonna slide it

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.580 
gonna take it and you're gonna slide it
over<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.790> connector<00:04:00.300> and<00:04:00.480> you're<00:04:01.230> gonna<00:04:01.320> hold

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
over the connector and you're gonna hold

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.820 
over the connector and you're gonna hold
the<00:04:02.160> very<00:04:02.430> end<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.750> with<00:04:04.050> your<00:04:04.230> let's<00:04:04.739> say

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
the very end of this with your let's say

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.770 
the very end of this with your let's say
left<00:04:05.040> hand<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.940> you're<00:04:06.030> gonna<00:04:06.150> push<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.690> to

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
left hand and you're gonna push on it to

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.420 
left hand and you're gonna push on it to
stretch<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.200> out<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.770> you're<00:04:08.040> gonna<00:04:08.190> hold

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
stretch it out and you're gonna hold

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.280 
stretch it out and you're gonna hold
this<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.940> let<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.270> side<00:04:09.570> go<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:10.170> you're

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
this and let that side go so you're

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.460 
this and let that side go so you're
gonna<00:04:10.380> slowly<00:04:10.680> sort<00:04:11.550> of<00:04:11.640> push<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.000> over<00:04:12.470> the

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
gonna slowly sort of push that over the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.990 
gonna slowly sort of push that over the
cable<00:04:14.480> I'm<00:04:15.480> not<00:04:15.720> gonna<00:04:15.870> do<00:04:16.080> a<00:04:16.290> full<00:04:16.850> sort<00:04:17.850> of

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
cable I'm not gonna do a full sort of

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.270 
cable I'm not gonna do a full sort of
sleeve<00:04:18.600> on<00:04:18.750> this<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:19.049> guess<00:04:19.290> well<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.620> could<00:04:20.040> but

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
sleeve on this I guess well I could but

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.969 
sleeve on this I guess well I could but
I<00:04:20.810> I'm<00:04:21.810> not<00:04:22.049> gonna<00:04:22.200> bother<00:04:22.350> with<00:04:22.590> that<00:04:22.650> right

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
I I'm not gonna bother with that right

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.950 
I I'm not gonna bother with that right
now<00:04:23.130> because<00:04:23.460> these<00:04:23.850> cables<00:04:24.419> are<00:04:24.510> just<00:04:24.780> sort

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
now because these cables are just sort

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.140 
now because these cables are just sort
of<00:04:25.050> lying<00:04:25.260> around

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
of lying around

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.029 
of lying around
basically<00:04:27.150> let's<00:04:27.870> just<00:04:28.110> say<00:04:28.229> this<00:04:28.469> side<00:04:28.800> is

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
basically let's just say this side is

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.679 
basically let's just say this side is
hooked<00:04:29.759> up<00:04:29.879> to<00:04:29.939> your<00:04:30.030> power<00:04:30.270> supply<00:04:30.629> sir

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
hooked up to your power supply sir

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.559 
hooked up to your power supply sir
you're<00:04:30.960> only<00:04:31.050> gonna<00:04:31.349> really<00:04:32.360> be<00:04:33.360> paying

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
you're only gonna really be paying

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.800 
you're only gonna really be paying
attention<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.169> this<00:04:34.370> side<00:04:35.370> so<00:04:35.699> once<00:04:36.539> you<00:04:36.659> have

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
attention to this side so once you have

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.059 
attention to this side so once you have
that<00:04:36.930> over<00:04:37.199> you<00:04:37.289> can<00:04:37.439> see<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.770> this<00:04:38.009> sort<00:04:38.699> of

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
that over you can see that this sort of

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.600 
that over you can see that this sort of
the<00:04:41.069> little<00:04:41.490> wires<00:04:41.699> released<00:04:42.240> but<00:04:42.599> but

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
the little wires released but but

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.040 
the little wires released but but
basically<00:04:44.610> you're<00:04:44.819> gonna<00:04:44.999> you're<00:04:45.719> going<00:04:45.960> to

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
basically you're gonna you're going to

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.399 
basically you're gonna you're going to
want<00:04:46.229> to<00:04:46.259> leave<00:04:46.439> a<00:04:46.740> bit<00:04:47.129> of<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:48.330> actual<00:04:48.689> metal

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
want to leave a bit of the actual metal

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.899 
want to leave a bit of the actual metal
and<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.979> plastic<00:04:50.270> opened<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:52.039> in<00:04:53.039> order<00:04:53.400> to

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
and the plastic opened and in order to

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.739 
and the plastic opened and in order to
get<00:04:54.240> your<00:04:54.569> heat<00:04:55.349> drink<00:04:55.590> which<00:04:55.949> you<00:04:55.979> cut<00:04:56.249> before

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:56.749 
get your heat drink which you cut before

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:01.070 
get your heat drink which you cut before
so<00:04:57.749> so<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.889> sticks<00:04:59.279> to<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.759> cable<00:05:00.090> itself<00:05:00.389> so

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
so so it sticks to the cable itself so

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.179 
so so it sticks to the cable itself so
we're<00:05:01.199> gonna<00:05:01.289> take<00:05:01.469> the<00:05:01.620> heat<00:05:01.770> shrink<00:05:01.889> and

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:02.189 
we're gonna take the heat shrink and

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:03.769 
we're gonna take the heat shrink and
we're<00:05:02.310> gonna<00:05:02.460> slowly<00:05:02.699> slide<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.270> over<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.629> make

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
we're gonna slowly slide it over to make

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:06.379 
we're gonna slowly slide it over to make
sure<00:05:03.900> we<00:05:04.020> don't<00:05:04.199> really<00:05:04.819> mess<00:05:05.819> up<00:05:05.969> the<00:05:06.180> cave

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
sure we don't really mess up the cave

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.159 
sure we don't really mess up the cave
sleeping<00:05:07.319> itself<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:08.330> as<00:05:09.330> you<00:05:09.539> can<00:05:09.659> see<00:05:09.719> right

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
sleeping itself and as you can see right

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.559 
sleeping itself and as you can see right
there<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.919> heat<00:05:11.400> shrink<00:05:11.639> is<00:05:11.669> over<00:05:11.969> so<00:05:12.360> what

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
there the heat shrink is over so what

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.119 
there the heat shrink is over so what
we're<00:05:12.719> gonna<00:05:12.810> do<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.199> we're<00:05:13.680> gonna<00:05:13.740> pull<00:05:14.009> it

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:14.129 
we're gonna do is we're gonna pull it

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.420 
we're gonna do is we're gonna pull it
back<00:05:14.279> half<00:05:14.550> way<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:15.590> that<00:05:16.590> leaves<00:05:16.830> us<00:05:17.069> with

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
back half way and that leaves us with

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.339 
back half way and that leaves us with
half<00:05:18.089> of<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.360> heat<00:05:18.509> shrink<00:05:18.629> over<00:05:19.139> the

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
half of the heat shrink over the

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.920 
half of the heat shrink over the
sleeving<00:05:19.919> itself<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:20.699> half<00:05:21.509> of<00:05:21.689> the<00:05:21.779> heat

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
sleeving itself and half of the heat

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.369 
sleeving itself and half of the heat
ring<00:05:22.110> over<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:22.529> cable<00:05:23.360> so<00:05:24.360> once<00:05:24.960> we<00:05:25.139> do<00:05:25.349> that

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:25.379 
ring over the cable so once we do that

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:28.040 
ring over the cable so once we do that
we're<00:05:26.009> gonna<00:05:26.189> take<00:05:26.400> our<00:05:26.639> lighter<00:05:26.879> now<00:05:27.330> this<00:05:27.839> I

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
we're gonna take our lighter now this I

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.200 
we're gonna take our lighter now this I
don't<00:05:28.469> know<00:05:28.680> what<00:05:28.830> size<00:05:29.129> heat<00:05:29.669> shrink<00:05:29.909> this<00:05:30.060> is

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
don't know what size heat shrink this is

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.019 
don't know what size heat shrink this is
so<00:05:30.360> this<00:05:30.539> might<00:05:30.779> not<00:05:30.810> actually<00:05:31.169> shrink<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:32.029> a

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
so this might not actually shrink to a

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.240 
so this might not actually shrink to a
proper<00:05:33.659> size<00:05:33.839> because<00:05:34.560> like<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:34.889> said<00:05:35.069> these

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
proper size because like I said these

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.640 
proper size because like I said these
are<00:05:35.310> just<00:05:35.669> leftovers<00:05:36.180> but<00:05:36.839> basically<00:05:37.379> this<00:05:37.500> is

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
are just leftovers but basically this is

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.350 
are just leftovers but basically this is
what<00:05:37.800> you<00:05:37.919> do<00:05:38.099> you're<00:05:38.699> gonna<00:05:38.819> take<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.089> lighter

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
what you do you're gonna take a lighter

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.769 
what you do you're gonna take a lighter
and<00:05:39.599> you're<00:05:39.810> gonna<00:05:40.520> slowly<00:05:41.520> heat<00:05:41.789> up<00:05:41.909> the<00:05:42.149> heat

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:42.779 
and you're gonna slowly heat up the heat

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.179 
and you're gonna slowly heat up the heat
shrink<00:05:43.819> and<00:05:45.199> as<00:05:46.199> you<00:05:46.319> can<00:05:46.409> see<00:05:46.469> shrinks<00:05:47.009> over

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
shrink and as you can see shrinks over

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.179 
shrink and as you can see shrinks over
the<00:05:48.149> cable<00:05:48.539> so<00:05:49.229> once<00:05:49.409> that's<00:05:49.740> done<00:05:49.979> you<00:05:50.159> can

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:50.189 
the cable so once that's done you can

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:52.309 
the cable so once that's done you can
sort<00:05:50.550> of<00:05:50.580> press<00:05:50.849> it<00:05:51.000> on<00:05:51.089> just<00:05:51.659> be<00:05:51.899> careful

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
sort of press it on just be careful

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.629 
sort of press it on just be careful
because<00:05:52.349> it's<00:05:52.680> really<00:05:52.979> hot<00:05:53.189> and<00:05:55.189> and<00:05:56.189> there
