00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello i'm just like the giraffe and 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.300
 Today I will plant flowers 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.469
 the small dump truck and the excavator 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.469
 will help me with that 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.460
 the little truck gave us the flowers 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:34.930
 they smell so good 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.930
 Now we need sand and earth 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.739
 while the little truck brings the sant 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.739
 the excavator will dig a hole for us 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.670

 Hello Excavator, you can join us 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.090
 dig a big hole 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.600
 but you have a big shovel there 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.600
 fits a lot of earth pure 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.510

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.510

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.820
 so the hole is ready but we 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.820
 still need gardening tools 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:06.070
 Look, the little truck has that 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:10.790

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:05.950

 we need the watering can our flowers 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:21.060
