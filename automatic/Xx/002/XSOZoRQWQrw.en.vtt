00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.540 
need to break that's that's my question
I<00:05:46.670> mean<00:05:46.880> is<00:05:47.000> it<00:05:47.030> do<00:05:47.690> just<00:05:47.950> need<00:05:48.950> to<00:05:49.070> break<00:05:49.280> like

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
oh like all altars in the whole world

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.130 
oh like all altars in the whole world
that's<00:05:52.130> probably<00:05:52.370> going<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.550> I<00:05:52.880> mean<00:05:53.480> this<00:05:53.930> is

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
that's probably going to I mean this is

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.190 
that's probably going to I mean this is
a<00:05:54.170> large<00:05:54.470> map<00:05:54.770> so<00:05:55.010> I<00:05:55.040> guess<00:05:55.810> we<00:05:56.810> do<00:05:56.990> need<00:05:57.170> to

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
a large map so I guess we do need to

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.230 
a large map so I guess we do need to
spawn<00:05:57.560> as<00:05:57.830> many<00:05:58.220> materials<00:05:58.790> as<00:05:58.940> we<00:05:59.060> possibly

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
spawn as many materials as we possibly

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.880 
spawn as many materials as we possibly
can<00:06:00.700> so<00:06:01.700> breaking<00:06:02.150> or<00:06:02.360> alters<00:06:02.780> is<00:06:03.050> definitely

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
can so breaking or alters is definitely

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.760 
can so breaking or alters is definitely
a<00:06:04.040> must<00:06:04.960> right<00:06:05.960> let's<00:06:06.170> get<00:06:06.260> away<00:06:06.380> from<00:06:06.470> their

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
a must right let's get away from their

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.020 
a must right let's get away from their
race<00:06:08.620> so<00:06:09.620> I<00:06:09.650> think<00:06:09.770> we've<00:06:10.220> pretty<00:06:10.400> much<00:06:10.520> broken

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
race so I think we've pretty much broken

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.930 
race so I think we've pretty much broken
all<00:06:11.390> of<00:06:11.540> the<00:06:11.600> altars<00:06:11.990> in<00:06:12.460> this<00:06:13.460> little<00:06:13.730> section
