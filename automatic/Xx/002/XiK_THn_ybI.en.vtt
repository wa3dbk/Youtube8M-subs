familiar you might go what did we
already<00:00:13.650> look<00:00:13.920> at<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.130> laptop<00:00:14.670> we<00:00:15.210> did<00:00:15.540> that

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
already look at this laptop we did that

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.470 
already look at this laptop we did that
was<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.289> z<00:00:16.650> 8<00:00:16.920> 35<00:00:17.840> p330<00:00:18.840> model<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.010> AP<00:00:20.609> 370

was the z 8 35 p330 model this is AP 370
model<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> difference<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.529> first

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
model and the difference is that first

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
one was eight hundred dollars a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.820 
one was eight hundred dollars a
fantastic<00:00:26.369> value<00:00:26.550> considering<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> had<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> 128

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
expensive ultrabook that we have seen to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.470

differences the original had an intel
core<00:00:41.610> i3<00:00:42.059> cpu<00:00:42.809> that's<00:00:43.200> how<00:00:43.350> they<00:00:43.469> managed<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
core i3 cpu that's how they managed to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.920 
core i3 cpu that's how they managed to
save<00:00:43.950> some<00:00:44.190> money<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:45.210> version<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.719> has<00:00:45.899> a

mainstream core i5 cpu very similar to
what<00:00:48.960> we've<00:00:49.079> seen<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> other<00:00:49.829> ultrabooks<00:00:50.489> so

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449

what we've seen in other ultrabooks so
how<00:00:51.660> does<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.840> new<00:00:52.170> version<00:00:52.320> stack<00:00:52.770> up

how does this new version stack up
against<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.340> competition<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.120> there<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
against the competition and there is a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.880 
against the competition and there is a
lot<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> ultrabook<00:00:55.050> competition<00:00:55.710> now

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
lot of ultrabook competition now

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.520 
lot of ultrabook competition now
performance<00:00:56.760> wise<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.989> fine<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.379> got

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
performance wise it's just fine it's got

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.110 
performance wise it's just fine it's got
the<00:00:58.620> same<00:00:58.770> core<00:00:59.010> i5<00:00:59.309> CPU<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> lot<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.059> these

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the same core i5 CPU as a lot of these

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.490 
the same core i5 CPU as a lot of these
other<00:01:00.270> ultrabooks<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.840> actually<00:01:01.079> has<00:01:01.199> six

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
models but at the same time we forgave a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
models but at the same time we forgave a
lot<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> design<00:01:08.220> things<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.090> didn't

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
lot of the design things that we didn't

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
lot of the design things that we didn't
like<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.780> much<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.920> particular

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
like so much about this particular

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.710 
like so much about this particular
laptop<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> eight<00:01:12.210> hundred<00:01:12.540> dollar

laptop in the eight hundred dollar

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.210 
laptop in the eight hundred dollar
version<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> was<00:01:13.530> someone<00:01:13.740> expensive

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220

dollars well then you say to yourself I

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.649 
dollars well then you say to yourself I
could<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.460> HP<00:01:20.880> version<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> dell

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
could get the HP version of the dell

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.410 
could get the HP version of the dell
version<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.799> even<00:01:23.100> less<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.729> that's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
version for even less and that's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.719 
version for even less and that's
actually<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.780> nicer<00:01:25.380> overall<00:01:25.860> experience<00:01:26.310> I
