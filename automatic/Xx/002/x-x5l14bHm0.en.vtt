quite<00:02:34.570> nerve-wracking<00:02:35.230> because<00:02:35.680> you're<00:02:36.340> not

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
quite nerve-wracking because you're not

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.370 
quite nerve-wracking because you're not
really<00:02:36.640> used<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:37.120> depends<00:02:37.840> on<00:02:37.870> what<00:02:38.080> high

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
really used to that depends on what high

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.930 
really used to that depends on what high
