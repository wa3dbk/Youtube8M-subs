00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 for dozens of nautical miles around anyone 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.230
 besides the ships cordoning one of the areas 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.599
 Peter the Great Bay is temporarily closed 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.519
 for shipping now it's a testing ground for 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.010
 shock group of missile boats 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.539
 Pacific Fleet called this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.359
 anti-ship cruise missile 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.699
 mosquito video and really and and do not razgledish and 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.859
 don't even hear until you sting on 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.500
 supersonic speed she flies to the goal 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.570
 almost touching the waves a rocket launch for 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.679
 boats this event are being prepared which 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.840
 all crew 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.239
 navigator and expect to exit on combat 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 the course mechanics provide the course of the ship 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.899
 firing 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.540
 personally commander rocket artillery 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.079
 warhead for this remote I enter 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.520
 data on shooting that is either a goal 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.770
 distance target speed course goal 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.360
 accordingly according to these parameters in 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.570
 the rocket is the solution of a certain 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.490
 tasks after this is done at sea 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.590
 this is a strike group of missile boats already 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.930
 only a few days back to base 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.330
 replenish ammunition crews rent 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.850
 coursework tasks that is whole days 1 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.100
 training alert is replaced by another if 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.660
 rocket launches are carried out without warheads 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.390
 then artillery firing 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.430
 are already on the battle target old tanks 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.430
 ashore covers shells 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.600
 I understood 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 fire is fired from the nasal artillery 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.330
 installations to 176 and 600 while 630 ship 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.430
 runs at a speed of about 12 15 knots 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.530
 Stream carried after the date of 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.259
 standards rocket boats preparing 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.060
 intercede already causing combat service in 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.310
 the southern part of the Sea of Okhotsk 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.030
 but for now go check the result of the same 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.009
 fx-trend in the target it lights the tug 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.030
 we approach already then at a distance which 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.340
 the rocket flew by 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.649
 in less than a minute, kadir overcame 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.520
 a few hours but also in the dark you can see that 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.039
 firing 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.630
 proved successful in the hole a 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.850
 it means one hundred percent hit
