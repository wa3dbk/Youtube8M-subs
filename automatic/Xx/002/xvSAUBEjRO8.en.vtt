below I have no clue why Nike decided to

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.859 
below I have no clue why Nike decided to
do<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.439> kind<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.860> makes<00:01:38.040> no<00:01:38.310> sense<00:01:38.869> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
do that it kind of makes no sense the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.410 
do that it kind of makes no sense the
sock<00:01:40.140> liner<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:41.280> kind<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.670> composed<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.299> like

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
this nylon meshing material I guess you

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.910

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
would say they're neoprene decided to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.460 
would say they're neoprene decided to
pull<00:01:50.070> off<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> insole<00:01:50.840> it's<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.320> red

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
which to me as far as quality it's a lot

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.460 
which to me as far as quality it's a lot
better<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:44.210> mean<00:02:45.210> it's<00:02:45.720> also<00:02:45.870> nice<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.440> has

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
better I mean it's also nice that it has

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.130 
better I mean it's also nice that it has
the<00:02:46.680> gold<00:02:46.860> hits<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.180> gives<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.720> nice<00:02:48.870> touch
