the 15-inch model has stayed relatively
the<00:00:28.320> same<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.920> course<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.670> same<00:00:29.880> can't<00:00:30.150> be

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the same of course the same can't be

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.999 
the same of course the same can't be
said<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.510> what's<00:00:31.080> inside<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.859> what's

said for what's inside so what's

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.530 
said for what's inside so what's
actually<00:00:32.130> change<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.969> new<00:00:33.120> macbook

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
actually change then in the new macbook

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.900 
actually change then in the new macbook
pro<00:00:33.780> first<00:00:34.590> off<00:00:34.800> they've<00:00:34.980> got<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> new<00:00:35.430> Intel

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
pro first off they've got the new Intel

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.360 
pro first off they've got the new Intel
Haswell<00:00:36.210> processes<00:00:37.140> these<00:00:37.739> processes<00:00:38.340> are

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
Haswell processes these processes are

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.970 
Haswell processes these processes are
slightly<00:00:39.120> faster<00:00:39.450> than<00:00:39.780> before<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> main

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
slightly faster than before but the main

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.110 
slightly faster than before but the main
thing<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.579> increase<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> battery

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
thing is that they increase the battery

the range come with AC as standard now
they've<00:01:08.760> changed<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.210> graphics<00:01:09.600> cards<00:01:09.930> quite

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
they've changed the graphics cards quite

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.039

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
essentially an integrated graphics

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.109 
essentially an integrated graphics
solution<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.890> Minter<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:26.909> be

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
solution and it's Minter can it not be

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.270 
solution and it's Minter can it not be
bad<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> first<00:01:28.020> time<00:01:28.290> integrated

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
bad for the first time integrated

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.710 
bad for the first time integrated
graphics<00:01:29.430> will<00:01:29.850> actually<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.390> able<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> play

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
graphics will actually be able to play

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.210 
graphics will actually be able to play
games<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.439> what<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> want<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
games if that's what you want and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.310 
games if that's what you want and
actually<00:01:33.150> come<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.390> performance<00:01:34.079> quite

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
actually come with performance quite

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.649 
actually come with performance quite
close<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.759> dedicated<00:01:36.180> graphics

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
close to that of a dedicated graphics

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
close to that of a dedicated graphics
card<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.350> also<00:01:37.500> better<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.890> powering

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
card it's also better for powering

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.130 
card it's also better for powering
external<00:01:39.119> displays<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.689> well<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> course

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
external displays as well as of course

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.260 
external displays as well as of course
the<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:40.979> high<00:01:41.250> res<00:01:41.490> display<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:42.060> this

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the really high res display on this

Thunderbolt<00:02:18.000> 2<00:02:18.120> ports<00:02:18.630> here<00:02:18.870> well<00:02:19.620> they

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
Thunderbolt 2 ports here well they

Thunderbolt<00:02:20.310> 2<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.880> brand<00:02:21.150> new<00:02:21.270> thing<00:02:21.690> and

faster than the USB three equivalent now
I<00:02:27.510> doubt<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.020> actually<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.410> using

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
I doubt you actually be using

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.070 
I doubt you actually be using
Thunderbolt<00:02:29.280> 2<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.640> its<00:02:29.790> full<00:02:29.940> potential<00:02:30.300> but

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
Thunderbolt 2 to its full potential but

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.440 
Thunderbolt 2 to its full potential but
it's<00:02:31.560> got<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.400> got<00:02:32.580> potential<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.330> you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
it's got that it's got potential and you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.480 
it's got that it's got potential and you
can<00:02:33.600> daisy-chain<00:02:33.959> devices<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.010> even<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.400> you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
can daisy-chain devices so even if you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.820 
can daisy-chain devices so even if you
don't<00:02:35.670> max<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.240> with<00:02:36.600> one<00:02:36.780> device<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.650> you

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
don't max out with one device if you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.620 
don't max out with one device if you
connect<00:02:38.070> multiple<00:02:38.250> devices<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.120> daisy<00:02:39.330> chain

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
connect multiple devices and daisy chain

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.780 
connect multiple devices and daisy chain
them<00:02:39.750> together<00:02:39.870> you've<00:02:40.470> got<00:02:41.160> more<00:02:41.310> room<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.670> do

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
them together you've got more room to do

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.400 
them together you've got more room to do
that<00:02:41.970> but<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.540> course<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.930> thing<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.230> makes

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
that but of course the thing that makes

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.440 
that but of course the thing that makes
