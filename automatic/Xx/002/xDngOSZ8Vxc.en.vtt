close enough to the action and you don't
know<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.130> do<00:03:56.250> not<00:03:56.370> have<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:58.280> guess

know you do not have the I guess
advantage<00:04:00.030> for<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.660> or<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.170> enemy<00:04:01.769> almost

advantage for the or the enemy almost

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.930 
advantage for the or the enemy almost
roadside<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:03.420> know<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.680> get<00:04:04.860> kills<00:04:05.100> but

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
roadside you know you you get kills but

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.420 
roadside you know you you get kills but
you<00:04:06.090> don't<00:04:06.269> get<00:04:06.570> nearly<00:04:06.870> enough<00:04:07.019> kills<00:04:07.709> as<00:04:08.040> you

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
you don't get nearly enough kills as you

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.900 
you don't get nearly enough kills as you
could<00:04:08.730> have<00:04:08.850> gotten<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:10.459> this<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.579> a<00:04:11.610> good

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
could have gotten like this is a good

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.780 
could have gotten like this is a good
area<00:04:12.120> but<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.170> fact<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.590> that<00:04:13.650> if<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.610> had

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
area but the fact is that if you had

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.080 
area but the fact is that if you had
moods<00:04:15.090> 10<00:04:15.989> steps<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.890> double<00:04:17.370> stairs<00:04:17.640> and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
moods 10 steps to the double stairs and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.789 
moods 10 steps to the double stairs and
could<00:04:18.359> have<00:04:18.450> waited<00:04:18.600> up<00:04:18.840> there<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.290> waited

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
could have waited up there and waited

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.800 
could have waited up there and waited
behind<00:04:19.919> that<00:04:20.130> wall<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:21.329> could<00:04:21.510> have<00:04:21.599> gotten

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
behind that wall you could have gotten

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.850 
behind that wall you could have gotten
your<00:04:22.260> moat<00:04:22.470> by<00:04:22.650> now<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.780> if<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.960> earlier<00:04:25.650> have

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
your moat by now and if you earlier have

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.200 
your moat by now and if you earlier have
jumped<00:04:26.190> on<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.400> flower<00:04:26.640> pot<00:04:26.880> and

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
jumped on the flower pot and

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.850 
jumped on the flower pot and
towards<00:04:27.870> they<00:04:27.990> could<00:04:28.199> have<00:04:28.289> gotten<00:04:28.470> like<00:04:28.620> five

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
towards they could have gotten like five

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.879 
towards they could have gotten like five
kills<00:04:29.250> there<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.810> gotta<00:04:31.020> work<00:04:31.229> on<00:04:31.470> going

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
kills there so you gotta work on going

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.040 
kills there so you gotta work on going
to<00:04:32.100> those<00:04:32.310> better<00:04:32.699> positions<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.539> catch<00:04:33.780> the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
to those better positions to catch the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.129 
to those better positions to catch the
enemy<00:04:34.169> of<00:04:34.560> guard<00:04:35.030> because<00:04:36.030> running<00:04:36.569> out<00:04:36.780> dere

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
enemy of guard because running out dere

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.020 
enemy of guard because running out dere
and<00:04:37.380> try<00:04:37.949> to<00:04:38.009> shoot<00:04:38.250> some<00:04:38.460> isn't<00:04:38.819> the<00:04:38.880> best

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
and try to shoot some isn't the best

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.450 
and try to shoot some isn't the best
idea<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.569> would<00:04:39.900> like<00:04:40.349> I<00:04:40.620> do<00:04:40.949> that<00:04:41.280> sometimes

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
idea I would like I do that sometimes

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.210 
idea I would like I do that sometimes

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
but when my mind works right like it

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.379
