Indian Christmas the first thing I need

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.170 
Indian Christmas the first thing I need
to<00:00:11.540> do<00:00:11.720> is<00:00:11.960> make<00:00:12.200> my<00:00:12.350> marinade<00:00:13.000> put<00:00:14.000> in<00:00:14.090> a

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
to do is make my marinade put in a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.599 
to do is make my marinade put in a
couple<00:00:14.420> of<00:00:14.480> tablespoons<00:00:14.780> of<00:00:15.200> yogurt<00:00:15.609> your

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
couple of tablespoons of yogurt your

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.250 
couple of tablespoons of yogurt your
it's<00:00:16.789> great<00:00:17.060> to<00:00:17.240> marinade<00:00:17.689> because<00:00:18.140> it

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
it's great to marinade because it

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260 
it's great to marinade because it
actually<00:00:18.410> breaks<00:00:19.100> down<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.580> proteins<00:00:20.030> in<00:00:20.210> the

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
actually breaks down the proteins in the

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.609 
actually breaks down the proteins in the
meat<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:20.900> it<00:00:20.930> actually<00:00:21.080> makes<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:21.440> lot<00:00:21.470> more

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
meat so it actually makes a lot more

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.380 
meat so it actually makes a lot more
tender<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:22.340> it<00:00:22.490> helps<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:22.730> marinade<00:00:23.090> stick

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
tender and it helps the marinade stick

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.450 
tender and it helps the marinade stick
to<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:23.869> actual<00:00:24.110> meat<00:00:24.410> we're<00:00:25.190> going<00:00:25.310> to<00:00:25.369> be

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460
