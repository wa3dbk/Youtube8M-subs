it's gonna go right along these pretty
burrow<00:00:37.290> sites

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.160 

earthmovers<00:00:42.130> are<00:00:42.370> breaking<00:00:42.910> ground

groundhogs and fox in harm's way they

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.950 
groundhogs and fox in harm's way they
wouldn't<00:00:54.730> make<00:00:54.850> it<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.270> Fox<00:00:55.510> in<00:00:55.660> groundhogs

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
wouldn't make it the Fox in groundhogs

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.500 
wouldn't make it the Fox in groundhogs
would<00:00:56.500> would<00:00:56.890> likely<00:00:57.130> not<00:00:57.370> make<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:57.700> the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
would would likely not make it the

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.750 
would would likely not make it the
animals<00:00:58.840> would<00:00:58.900> get<00:00:59.020> buried<00:00:59.230> alive

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
animals would get buried alive

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.220 
animals would get buried alive
especially<00:01:00.760> since<00:01:00.970> this<00:01:01.060> is<00:01:01.210> ground<00:01:01.570> zero<00:01:01.660> we

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
especially since this is ground zero we

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.390 
especially since this is ground zero we
know<00:01:02.380> this<00:01:02.560> is<00:01:02.710> where<00:01:02.830> the<00:01:02.920> roads<00:01:03.070> coming

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
know this is where the roads coming

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.219 
know this is where the roads coming
through<00:01:03.610> so<00:01:03.880> we<00:01:04.000> know<00:01:04.180> this<00:01:04.390> area<00:01:04.570> is<00:01:04.750> going<00:01:05.170> to

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
through so we know this area is going to

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.830 
through so we know this area is going to
be<00:01:05.290> completely<00:01:05.970> altered<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.210> most<00:01:07.479> of<00:01:07.630> it<00:01:07.720> is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
be completely altered and most of it is

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.640 
be completely altered and most of it is
going<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.050> be<00:01:08.140> gone<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.420> many<00:01:10.810> animals<00:01:11.380> are

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
going to be gone so many animals are

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.510 
going to be gone so many animals are
being<00:01:11.920> relocated<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:14.800> trapping<00:01:15.190> effort<00:01:15.430> is

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
being relocated the trapping effort is

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.400 
being relocated the trapping effort is
sort<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.760> last-ditch<00:01:16.120> effort<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.630> get<00:01:17.260> the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
sort of the last-ditch effort to get the

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.840 
sort of the last-ditch effort to get the
remaining<00:01:17.979> animals<00:01:18.400> out<00:01:18.550> of<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.700> Burrow

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
remaining animals out of the Burrow

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.680 
remaining animals out of the Burrow
systems<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.950> this<00:01:21.310> groundhog<00:01:21.910> brought<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.660> a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
systems like this groundhog brought to a

systems like this groundhog brought to a
new<00:01:22.990> home<00:01:23.290> miles<00:01:23.890> away<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.920> here<00:01:30.400> she'll<00:01:30.850> be

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
new home miles away but here she'll be

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.790 
new home miles away but here she'll be
safe<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:32.850> HSUS<00:01:33.850> staff<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.479> stepping<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.229> so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
safe and HSUS staff is stepping in so

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.140 
safe and HSUS staff is stepping in so
we're<00:01:35.979> walking<00:01:36.160> that<00:01:36.490> swath<00:01:36.880> and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
we're walking that swath and

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.760 
we're walking that swath and
concentrating<00:01:37.750> on<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:37.960> area<00:01:38.170> make<00:01:38.500> sure

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
concentrating on that area make sure

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.760 
concentrating on that area make sure
others<00:01:39.369> survive<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.180> habitat<00:01:40.720> Long's<00:01:40.990> all

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.030 
others survive the habitat Long's all
right<00:01:41.920> let's<00:01:42.190> go<00:01:43.830> unfortunate<00:01:44.830> that<00:01:44.920> these

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
right let's go unfortunate that these

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.109 
right let's go unfortunate that these
animals<00:01:45.460> have<00:01:45.550> been<00:01:45.580> living<00:01:45.880> here<00:01:46.060> for

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
animals have been living here for

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.210 
animals have been living here for
countless<00:01:46.960> years<00:01:47.200> are<00:01:47.710> going<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:47.979> be<00:01:48.070> losing

countless years are going to be losing
their<00:01:48.490> homes<00:01:48.700> so<00:01:49.090> I<00:01:49.119> want<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.450> just<00:01:49.660> dedicate<00:01:50.590> a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
their homes so I want to just dedicate a

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.290 
their homes so I want to just dedicate a
little<00:01:50.800> bit<00:01:50.890> of<00:01:50.979> my<00:01:51.100> time<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.729> try<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.090> help

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
little bit of my time to try to help

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.330 
little bit of my time to try to help
them<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.900> save<00:01:53.470> their<00:01:53.650> lives<00:01:53.800> ultimately

them and save their lives ultimately
it's<00:01:54.940> sort<00:01:55.210> of<00:01:55.300> I<00:01:55.420> guess<00:01:55.450> representative<00:01:56.229> of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
it's sort of I guess representative of

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.370 
it's sort of I guess representative of
what's<00:01:56.770> happening<00:01:57.100> across<00:01:57.400> America<00:01:58.120> with

what's happening across America with
