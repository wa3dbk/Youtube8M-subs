our<00:04:51.110> coasters<00:04:51.470> defense<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:52.190> lot<00:04:52.400> of<00:04:52.490> that<00:04:52.639> is

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
our coasters defense a lot of that is

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.490 
our coasters defense a lot of that is
often<00:04:53.090> going<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.540> fact<00:04:53.780> that<00:04:53.900> some<00:04:54.410> of

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
often going to the fact that some of

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.980 
often going to the fact that some of
these<00:04:54.560> plugins<00:04:54.919> needs<00:04:55.720> licenses<00:04:56.720> and

these plugins needs licenses and

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.469 
these plugins needs licenses and
therefore<00:04:57.950> would<00:04:58.040> add<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.850> cost<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.419> the

therefore would add to the cost of the

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.530 
therefore would add to the cost of the
unit<00:04:59.800> from<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:00.979> point<00:05:01.220> of<00:05:01.400> view<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:02.210> will<00:05:02.360> let

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
unit from that point of view it will let

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.300 
unit from that point of view it will let

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
you access the core function out into

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.790 
you access the core function out into
the<00:05:04.370> player<00:05:04.660> at<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.840> cheapest<00:05:06.260> cost<00:05:06.500> they<00:05:06.650> can

the<00:05:33.860> portable<00:05:34.160> media<00:05:34.370> player<00:05:34.820> look<00:05:35.780> at<00:05:35.960> our

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
the portable media player look at our

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.400 
the portable media player look at our
cost<00:05:36.380> there<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:36.770> shining<00:05:37.160> example<00:05:37.370> of<00:05:37.850> this<00:05:38.410> ok

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
cost there a shining example of this ok

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.140 
cost there a shining example of this ok
so<00:05:39.470> let's<00:05:39.710> have<00:05:39.740> a<00:05:39.860> look<00:05:39.950> at<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.130> scores<00:05:41.650> value

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
so let's have a look at the scores value

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.029 
so let's have a look at the scores value
7<00:05:44.150> out<00:05:44.240> of<00:05:44.270> 10<00:05:44.510> they<00:05:45.020> really<00:05:45.380> are<00:05:45.500> cutting<00:05:45.919> edge

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
7 out of 10 they really are cutting edge

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.980 
7 out of 10 they really are cutting edge
of<00:05:46.220> what's<00:05:46.460> possible<00:05:46.580> but<00:05:47.450> our<00:05:47.600> cost<00:05:47.870> is
