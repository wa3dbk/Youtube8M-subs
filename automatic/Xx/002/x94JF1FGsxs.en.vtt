00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.180
 good afternoon today we will consider more 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:13.769
 one bike 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:17.100
 we got avanti coloring means 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:24.660
 let's start spacers mean kindling 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.930
 he has 16 inches tall under the principle 140 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.099
 165 centimeters 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.940
 being comfortable enough means that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.469
 us breakers 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:45.960
 back tour worth Nevsky 2013 worth 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:52.680
 Shimanovsky Siberian with a brush color 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.949
 us comets z51 worth beautiful such 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.239
 aluminum template 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:05.240
 shiny steel stars there something he 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.310
 aluminum star set 42 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.189
 the front derailleur, we should 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.040
 shimano tour her principle here is all 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.760
 full-scale noise level costs at least 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.500
 running gear 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.210
 for their money will go very 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:26.580
 good on the brakes then we we 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.580
 aluminum artek breaks 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.650
 So we look at the rim of our rim 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:44.620
 double we break dv 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:48.700
 2,500 so we still have a protector 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:53.729
 hard enough on the cross-road will be 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:02:01.740
 also great ride too ken. state 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:05.320
 most likely there are 26 to 195 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.869
 look further such meter frames can 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.590
 look quite interesting 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.490
 geometry 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.200
 frame I forgot to say steel what in 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.870
 principle of course will affect 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.370
 whole and bicycle 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.880
 our clamp is aluminum 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.070
 shields are of course the simplest too 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.989
 only dirt protection 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:36.900
 back strongly not zealous cutoff dec 25 4 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:42.239
 seatpost og steel seat 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:45.160
 the seat is comfortable enough myagenkaya 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.330
 I think it will be enough to ride 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.340
 interesting so let's move on 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.310
 look back sleeve we have a team 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.600
 must be up to the back cube pukoff cuando 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.580
 also available on the frame 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.780
 for the disk who needs so much 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.110
 go to the fork 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.110
 what do we have this yuko fork sky zoom a 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:19.960
 it's hard to say a small move here 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:25.490
 about 63 millimeters likely 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.120
 somewhere there is a front one which means 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.760
 wheels 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.100
 quand sleeve is the same rim 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.630
 double aluminum 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.240
 come on 2,500 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.740
 tire too kendo all under 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:48.900
 car nipple so on with us 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:51.650
 also worth artek aluminum cat fotik 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.770
 shield is the easiest 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:02.000
 steering even two spacer ring 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:07.080
 for some reason you set over steel 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.170
 steering rack also steel steering further 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.270
 the switches here are revo shift and 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.480
 Shimanovsk, too, the level of turn and 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:20.010
 good enough principle 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:22.110
 brake handles artek alumin to and 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.700
 our pedals are full 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:32.100
 white aluminum in general here 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:36.110
 such a bike turned out here too 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.110
 there is on the frame attachment for under the beachers 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.070
 that's pretty comfortable enough principle 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.360
 women's bike 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.880
 only I see which is a flaw 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.550
 here it is of course a cut that is, it weighs 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.470
 about 15 kilograms it can be a network 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.100
 drag on the porch let on some 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.910
 manual floor may be enough 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:07.850
 so hard 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.850
 from so the bike is very beautiful stylish 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.479
 Well, in general, that is all that it can be 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.629
 say well and only the price of it 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.330
 good enough 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:23.220
 by today's standards not very expensive 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.520
 Thank you all for your attention, see mine 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.520
