let's<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:15.930> make<00:01:16.170> sure<00:01:16.409> nothing<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.040> running

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
let's just make sure nothing is running

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.429 
let's just make sure nothing is running
in<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> background<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.630> no<00:01:18.840> recent<00:01:19.049> apps<00:01:19.350> on

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
in the background so no recent apps on

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.249 
in the background so no recent apps on
the<00:01:19.530> Samsung<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:21.270> let's<00:01:21.509> cancel<00:01:21.750> these<00:01:22.049> out

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the Samsung and let's cancel these out

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.820 
the Samsung and let's cancel these out
on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> HTC<00:01:23.369> One<00:01:23.580> m8<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.259> then<00:01:25.259> let's<00:01:25.500> launch

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
on the HTC One m8 and then let's launch

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.980 
on the HTC One m8 and then let's launch
Geekbench<00:01:26.580> 3<00:01:29.479> there<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
Geekbench 3 there it is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.039 
Geekbench 3 there it is
and<00:01:32.030> just<00:01:33.030> click<00:01:33.240> run<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:35.630> then<00:01:36.630> once<00:01:36.869> they're

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and just click run and then once they're

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.600 
and just click run and then once they're
finished<00:01:37.259> we'll<00:01:37.560> take<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> look<00:01:37.979> at<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> scores

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
finished we'll take a look at the scores

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:49.800 
finished we'll take a look at the scores
and<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.900> which<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.710> fact<00:01:41.040> faster

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.770 

you

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.060 

all<00:01:53.780> right<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.260> looks<00:01:54.470> like<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.770> single

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
all right so it looks like the single

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.400 
all right so it looks like the single
core<00:01:55.460> performance<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:56.300> almost<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.900> same<00:01:57.110> on

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
core performance is almost the same on

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.820 
core performance is almost the same on
both<00:01:57.680> of<00:01:58.010> these<00:01:58.190> phones<00:01:58.600> Samsung<00:01:59.600> reads<00:01:59.870> 964

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
both of these phones Samsung reads 964

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.130 
both of these phones Samsung reads 964
and<00:02:01.100> each<00:02:01.370> TC<00:02:01.910> 1<00:02:02.150> reads<00:02:03.100> 943<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.900> look<00:02:05.900> at<00:02:06.020> the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
and each TC 1 reads 943 and look at the

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.020 
and each TC 1 reads 943 and look at the
multi-core<00:02:06.620> scores<00:02:07.070> we<00:02:07.250> can<00:02:07.400> say<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.880> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
multi-core scores we can say that the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.320 
multi-core scores we can say that the
Samsung<00:02:08.869> s5<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.800> fact<00:02:10.039> faster<00:02:10.550> than<00:02:10.729> HTC

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
Samsung s5 is in fact faster than HTC

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.990 
Samsung s5 is in fact faster than HTC
One<00:02:11.540> m8<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> single<00:02:13.040> core<00:02:13.310> performance<00:02:13.520> is

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
One m8 so the single core performance is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.850 
One m8 so the single core performance is
almost<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.390> same<00:02:14.600> but<00:02:14.840> multi<00:02:15.530> score

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
almost the same but multi score

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.070 
almost the same but multi score
performance<00:02:16.490> samsung<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.240> fact<00:02:17.540> faster

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
performance samsung is in fact faster

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.860

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.760 
next benchmarking tool once again let's
clear<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.400> background<00:02:25.750> applications<00:02:27.459> and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
clear the background applications and

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:39.060 
clear the background applications and
launch<00:02:30.770> on<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.730> benchmark<00:02:35.170> alrighty

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:50.050 

try<00:02:40.070> now<00:02:43.270> test<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:47.110> then<00:02:48.110> test<00:02:48.470> again<00:02:49.060> which

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
try now test and then test again which

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.110 
try now test and then test again which
actually<00:02:50.600> starts<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> test<00:02:51.820> ok<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:52.910> I'm<00:02:53.000> gonna

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
actually starts the test ok so I'm gonna

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.820 
actually starts the test ok so I'm gonna
do<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.300> fast<00:02:53.570> forward<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.290> we're<00:02:54.380> gonna<00:02:54.470> go<00:02:54.650> all

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
do a fast forward and we're gonna go all

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.100 
do a fast forward and we're gonna go all
the<00:02:54.950> way<00:02:55.040> at<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.190> end<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:56.000> see<00:02:56.239> at<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.540> final

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
the way at the end to see at the final

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:07.730 
the way at the end to see at the final
score<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:58.280> see<00:02:58.489> which<00:02:58.760> one<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.269> faster

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:19.400

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
details view so we can see the numbers

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.110 
details view so we can see the numbers
and<00:03:25.080> Vic<00:03:25.230> type<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.250> Samsung<00:03:26.760> scores<00:03:28.850> 36,800<00:03:29.850> -
