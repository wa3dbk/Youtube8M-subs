worked<00:00:56.559> yes<00:00:57.159> on<00:00:57.339> it<00:00:57.489> on<00:00:57.639> this<00:00:57.819> mare<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
worked yes on it on this mare the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.729 
worked yes on it on this mare the
students<00:00:58.569> found<00:00:58.749> her<00:00:58.960> this<00:00:59.109> morning

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
and so in order to to figure out

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.370 
and so in order to to figure out
acupuncture<00:01:05.650> wise<00:01:05.800> if<00:01:06.660> if<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:07.960> pain<00:01:08.200> is

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
acupuncture wise if if the pain is

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.960 
acupuncture wise if if the pain is
associated<00:01:08.680> with<00:01:09.040> one<00:01:09.280> part<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.700> body<00:01:09.880> or

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
associated with one part of the body or

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.760 
associated with one part of the body or
another<00:01:10.240> there's<00:01:10.510> a<00:01:10.570> system<00:01:11.290> that<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:11.590> can

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
another there's a system that you can

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.280 
another there's a system that you can
use<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.640> go<00:01:12.790> through<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.390> look<00:01:13.930> at<00:01:14.140> the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
use to go through and look at the

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.470 
use to go through and look at the
complete<00:01:14.680> horse<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:15.940> start<00:01:16.300> with

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
complete horse and so you start with

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.440 
complete horse and so you start with
this<00:01:16.690> in<00:01:17.170> them<00:01:17.410> in<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:18.010> mouse<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.550> you<00:01:19.210> take<00:01:19.420> a

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
this in them in the mouse and you take a

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.000 
this in them in the mouse and you take a
look<00:01:19.660> at<00:01:20.340> at<00:01:21.340> her<00:01:21.580> tongue<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.150> see<00:01:22.840> how<00:01:23.020> dry<00:01:23.770> or

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
through the body at different highways

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.600 
through the body at different highways
if<00:01:56.320> you<00:01:56.560> will<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.890> these<00:01:57.010> highways<00:01:57.220> have

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
if you will and these highways have

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.350 
if you will and these highways have
intersections<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:58.480> they<00:01:58.600> they<00:01:59.050> branch<00:01:59.409> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
intersections and they they branch and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.080 
intersections and they they branch and
they<00:02:01.360> traverse<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.110> body<00:02:02.610> okay<00:02:03.610> but<00:02:03.880> there

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
they traverse the body okay but there

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.180 
they traverse the body okay but there
are<00:02:04.180> certain<00:02:04.510> points<00:02:04.780> along<00:02:05.590> these<00:02:05.770> meridians

really responds to this is on the
stomach<00:02:25.519> meridian<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:26.150> called<00:02:26.390> stomach<00:02:26.780> seven

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
stomach meridian is called stomach seven

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.199 
stomach meridian is called stomach seven
and<00:02:27.409> if<00:02:27.799> they<00:02:27.920> react<00:02:28.280> there<00:02:28.519> that<00:02:28.760> tells<00:02:29.030> you

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
and if they react there that tells you

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.500 
and if they react there that tells you
that<00:02:29.450> it's<00:02:30.049> her<00:02:30.739> pain<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.280> somewhere<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:31.970> this

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
that it's her pain is somewhere in this

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.960 
that it's her pain is somewhere in this
area<00:02:32.569> on<00:02:33.049> this<00:02:33.290> on<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.980> side<00:02:34.220> from<00:02:34.730> touching

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
area on this on this side from touching

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.569 
area on this on this side from touching
there<00:02:35.269> by<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.540> eye<00:02:35.689> right<00:02:36.200> what<00:02:36.590> right<00:02:36.799> so

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
there by the eye right what right so

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.210 
there by the eye right what right so
then<00:02:37.730> we<00:02:37.760> go<00:02:37.939> through<00:02:38.209> here<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.980> she's<00:02:39.980> not

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
then we go through here and she's not

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.830 
then we go through here and she's not
not<00:02:40.760> responding<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:43.269> these<00:02:44.269> points<00:02:44.720> which

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
not responding to these points which

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.129 
not responding to these points which
would<00:02:44.989> tell<00:02:45.200> us<00:02:45.349> it<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.920> she<00:02:46.159> had<00:02:47.139> something

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
would tell us it that she had something

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:58.800 
would tell us it that she had something
wrong<00:02:48.470> with<00:02:48.530> this<00:02:48.829> front<00:02:49.069> end<00:02:49.900> not<00:02:50.900> seeing<00:02:51.290> it

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.540 

so<00:02:59.350> you're<00:02:59.530> just<00:02:59.650> going<00:02:59.860> point<00:03:00.160> by<00:03:00.310> point

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
so you're just going point by point

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.670 
so you're just going point by point
looking<00:03:01.060> at<00:03:01.210> there<00:03:01.480> there's<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.870> series<00:03:02.530> of

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
looking at there there's a series of

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.990 
looking at there there's a series of
diagnostic<00:03:02.950> points<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.730> go<00:03:03.850> through

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
diagnostic points that you go through

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.420 
diagnostic points that you go through
now<00:03:04.150> she's<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.720> see<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.080> she's<00:03:06.070> definitely

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
now she's you see that she's definitely

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.670 
now she's you see that she's definitely
reacting<00:03:06.910> through<00:03:07.120> here<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.660> these<00:03:08.200> this

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
reacting through here and these this

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.490 
reacting through here and these this
area<00:03:09.130> through<00:03:09.310> here<00:03:09.400> are<00:03:09.850> all<00:03:10.030> diagnostic<00:03:10.780> for

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
area through here are all diagnostic for

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.350 
area through here are all diagnostic for
her<00:03:11.800> abdomen<00:03:12.460> caudal<00:03:12.820> abdomen

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
her abdomen caudal abdomen

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.360 
her abdomen caudal abdomen
so<00:03:13.750> this<00:03:13.900> mirror<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.290> telling<00:03:14.800> us<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:14.980> she<00:03:15.280> is

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
so this mirror is telling us that she is

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.080 
so this mirror is telling us that she is
painful<00:03:15.910> somewhere<00:03:16.840> through<00:03:17.080> here

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
painful somewhere through here

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.199 
painful somewhere through here
now<00:03:19.090> earlier<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:20.490> palpated<00:03:21.490> this<00:03:21.940> mare

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
now earlier I palpated this mare

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.540 
now earlier I palpated this mare

kind of cut to the chase on this we

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.210 
kind of cut to the chase on this we
already<00:03:29.709> figured<00:03:30.070> out<00:03:30.340> what's<00:03:31.000> going<00:03:31.270> on<00:03:32.220> on

already figured out what's going on on
on<00:03:33.550> it<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.630> acupuncture<00:03:35.320> scan<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.860> tells<00:03:36.100> us

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
on it the acupuncture scan it tells us

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.040 
on it the acupuncture scan it tells us
that<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.489> pain<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:36.790> associated<00:03:37.480> with<00:03:37.630> here

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
and on on palpating this mayer per

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.640 
and on on palpating this mayer per
rectum

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650

acupressure will have a certain amount
of<00:06:15.490> response

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
of response

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.400 
of response
I<00:06:16.150> keep<00:06:16.330> puncture<00:06:16.720> a<00:06:16.750> little<00:06:16.990> bit<00:06:17.080> stronger

and then if you hook up electricity to

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.930 
and then if you hook up electricity to
it<00:06:19.600> the<00:06:20.050> response<00:06:20.500> is<00:06:20.710> a<00:06:20.740> little<00:06:21.310> stronger<00:06:21.640> and

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
it the response is a little stronger and

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.360 
it the response is a little stronger and
a<00:06:22.000> little<00:06:22.510> more<00:06:22.630> long-lasting<00:06:23.200> so<00:06:24.130> for
