for<00:01:00.350> having<00:01:00.949> a<00:01:01.010> modular<00:01:01.370> helmet<00:01:01.519> it<00:01:02.120> has<00:01:02.359> an

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
for having a modular helmet it has an

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.359 
for having a modular helmet it has an
advanced<00:01:03.019> poly<00:01:03.289> alloy<00:01:03.739> shell<00:01:04.070> which<00:01:04.250> is

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
advanced poly alloy shell which is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.270 
advanced poly alloy shell which is
basically<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.729> polycarbonate<00:01:05.330> shell<00:01:06.070> it<00:01:07.070> is

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
ECE 2205 approved as well as de OT

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.490 
ECE 2205 approved as well as de OT
approved<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:11.570> does<00:01:11.690> have<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:11.990> european

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
approved so it does have the european

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.950 
approved so it does have the european
standard<00:01:13.340> take<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.090> look<00:01:14.240> real<00:01:14.570> quick<00:01:14.600> at<00:01:14.780> the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
standard take a look real quick at the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.649 
standard take a look real quick at the
ventilation<00:01:15.649> system<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:17.030> have<00:01:17.149> a<00:01:17.210> closeable

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
ventilation system you have a closeable

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.109 
ventilation system you have a closeable
event<00:01:17.869> that<00:01:18.229> is<00:01:18.380> located<00:01:18.830> at<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.280> top<00:01:19.310> here

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
event that is located at the top here

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.700 
event that is located at the top here
it's<00:01:20.360> basically<00:01:20.690> spring<00:01:21.020> loaded<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:21.530> if<00:01:21.590> you

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
it's basically spring loaded so if you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.440 
it's basically spring loaded so if you
slide<00:01:21.950> this<00:01:22.130> forward<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:22.550> pops<00:01:22.789> up<00:01:23.000> into<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
slide this forward it pops up into the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.420 
slide this forward it pops up into the
air<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:23.810> it's<00:01:24.470> going<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.649> draw<00:01:24.860> some<00:01:24.890> air<00:01:25.220> down

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
air and it's going to draw some air down

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.429 
air and it's going to draw some air down
into<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.909> helmet<00:01:26.090> here<00:01:26.390> at<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.110> front<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.350> the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
warm air is going to come right out the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.980 
warm air is going to come right out the
back<00:01:40.430> of<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.640> helmet<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.060> you've<00:01:41.600> got<00:01:41.719> some

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
back of the helmet and you've got some

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.020 
back of the helmet and you've got some
reflectivity<00:01:42.500> for<00:01:42.920> nighttime<00:01:43.100> visibility<00:01:43.610> as

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
reflectivity for nighttime visibility as

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.289 
reflectivity for nighttime visibility as
well<00:01:44.979> talk<00:01:45.979> about<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.280> shield<00:01:46.520> mechanism<00:01:47.090> and

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
well talk about the shield mechanism and

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.590 
well talk about the shield mechanism and
the<00:01:47.329> shield<00:01:47.630> itself<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.170> has<00:01:48.200> their<00:01:49.600> anti-fog

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
the shield itself it has their anti-fog

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.359 
the shield itself it has their anti-fog
coating<00:01:50.659> as<00:01:51.229> well<00:01:51.530> as<00:01:51.619> an<00:01:51.740> anti<00:01:52.100> scratch

so<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.259> there's<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.890> slider<00:02:07.159> switch<00:02:07.460> on<00:02:07.670> the

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
so you there's a slider switch on the

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.150 
so you there's a slider switch on the
side<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.869> helmet<00:02:09.019> here<00:02:09.349> along<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.979> base

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
side of the helmet here along the base

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.550

it<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.700> spring<00:02:11.150> loaded<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.750> can<00:02:11.900> drop<00:02:12.379> it

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
it is spring loaded so you can drop it

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.259 
it is spring loaded so you can drop it
down<00:02:12.680> it's<00:02:12.920> going<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.099> lock<00:02:13.250> in<00:02:13.430> place<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.910> you

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
down it's going to lock in place and you

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.300 
down it's going to lock in place and you
need<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.569> raise<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.410> just<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.739> quick<00:02:15.980> flip

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
need to raise it it's just a quick flip

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.120 
need to raise it it's just a quick flip
of<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:16.910> spring<00:02:17.510> loads<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.130> opens

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
of that and spring loads and opens

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.460 
of that and spring loads and opens
really<00:02:19.790> quickly<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.450> if<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.170> wanted<00:02:21.349> to

itself<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.769> little<00:02:25.069> bit<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.340> different

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
itself it's a little bit of a different

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.580 
itself it's a little bit of a different
system<00:02:25.880> than<00:02:26.269> what<00:02:26.750> we<00:02:26.900> might<00:02:27.049> be<00:02:27.200> used<00:02:27.410> to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
system than what we might be used to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.229 
system than what we might be used to
it's<00:02:28.099> called<00:02:28.250> their<00:02:28.459> lock<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.879> load<00:02:29.030> design

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
it's called their lock and load design

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.229 
it's called their lock and load design
you<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:30.200> two<00:02:30.650> dials<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.549> sides<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
you have two dials on the sides of the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.449 
you have two dials on the sides of the
shield<00:02:32.480> they<00:02:32.989> have<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.410> red<00:02:33.650> slider<00:02:34.099> switch

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
shield they have a red slider switch

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.580 
shield they have a red slider switch
which<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.180> kind<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.450> like<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.630> look<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:36.500> you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
which is kind of like a look that you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.009 
which is kind of like a look that you
can<00:02:36.709> slide<00:02:36.980> forward<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.489> back<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:38.239> open<00:02:38.870> and

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
can slide forward and back to open and

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.250 
can slide forward and back to open and
close<00:02:39.049> this<00:02:39.940> if<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.030> slide<00:02:41.299> this<00:02:41.510> back<00:02:41.750> it's

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
close this if you slide this back it's

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.199 
close this if you slide this back it's
going<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.880> be<00:02:43.880> able<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.120> rotate<00:02:44.329> and<00:02:46.209> come

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
going to be able to rotate and come

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.449 
going to be able to rotate and come
right<00:02:47.450> off<00:02:47.480> see<00:02:48.049> it<00:02:48.319> basically<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.040> completely

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
right off see it basically is completely

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.160 
right off see it basically is completely
removable<00:02:49.910> you're<00:02:50.569> going<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.049> on

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
removable you're going to do that on

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.259 
removable you're going to do that on
both<00:02:51.200> sides<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.950> then<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.459> put<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.700> back<00:02:52.819> you

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
both sides and then to put it back you

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.089 
both sides and then to put it back you
just<00:02:53.540> have<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.860> put<00:02:54.860> this<00:02:55.069> back<00:02:55.400> in<00:02:55.640> place<00:02:57.099> push

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
just have to put this back in place push

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.800 
just have to put this back in place push
it<00:02:58.250> down<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.700> then<00:02:59.000> there's<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.239> couple<00:02:59.450> tabs

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
it down and then there's a couple tabs

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.100 
it down and then there's a couple tabs
on<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.860> backside<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.940> knob<00:03:02.420> here<00:03:02.690> that

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
on the backside of this knob here that

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.170 
on the backside of this knob here that
you<00:03:03.170> have<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.500> line<00:03:03.739> up<00:03:03.920> with<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.280> openings<00:03:04.940> on

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
you have to line up with the openings on

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.840 
you have to line up with the openings on
the<00:03:05.239> shelf<00:03:05.989> here<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.709> little<00:03:07.489> bit<00:03:07.670> more

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
the shelf here so a little bit more

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.120 
the shelf here so a little bit more
tricky<00:03:08.090> than<00:03:08.269> some<00:03:08.720> others<00:03:08.959> but<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:09.859> going

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
tricky than some others but it is going

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.740 
tricky than some others but it is going
to<00:03:10.220> hold<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.519> chilled<00:03:10.760> down<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.209> place<00:03:11.450> and

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
to hold the chilled down in place and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.710 
to hold the chilled down in place and
it's<00:03:12.620> not<00:03:12.980> too<00:03:13.760> difficult<00:03:13.910> as<00:03:14.299> long<00:03:14.480> as<00:03:14.600> you

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
it's not too difficult as long as you

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.840 
it's not too difficult as long as you
line<00:03:14.930> everything<00:03:15.319> up<00:03:15.680> great<00:03:16.549> thing<00:03:16.760> about

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
air channels so that the air can

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.980 
air channels so that the air can
actually<00:04:42.970> go<00:04:43.120> all<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.450> way<00:04:43.480> down<00:04:43.570> and

actually exhaust out the base of the
shell<00:04:45.970> as<00:04:46.180> well<00:04:46.690> as<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.230> we're<00:04:47.380> exit<00:04:47.830> vent<00:04:48.040> on

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
that's going to really help reduce wind

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.370 
that's going to really help reduce wind
noise<00:04:53.890> wind<00:04:54.040> noise<00:04:54.940> can<00:04:55.270> really<00:04:55.630> occur<00:04:55.960> you

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
noise wind noise can really occur you

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.260 
noise wind noise can really occur you
know<00:04:56.500> if<00:04:56.800> there's<00:04:57.100> a<00:04:57.160> lot<00:04:57.310> going<00:04:57.340> on<00:04:57.850> on<00:04:58.030> the
