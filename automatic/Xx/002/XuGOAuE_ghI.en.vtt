so<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.370> drum<00:00:02.580> replacement<00:00:02.790> jump

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
so this is the drum replacement jump

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.909 
so this is the drum replacement jump
chip<00:00:03.870> replacement<00:00:04.440> for<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.680> xerox<00:00:05.130> DC<00:00:05.609> 286<00:00:06.919> this

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
chip replacement for a xerox DC 286 this

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.110 
chip replacement for a xerox DC 286 this
is<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.160> drum<00:00:08.370> unit<00:00:08.490> in<00:00:08.639> front<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:08.910> us<00:00:09.030> right

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
is the drum unit in front of us right

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.299 
is the drum unit in front of us right
now<00:00:10.040> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.460> front<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.880> drum<00:00:12.059> unit

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
now this is the front of the drum unit

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.720 
now this is the front of the drum unit
therefore<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.490> must<00:00:14.730> be<00:00:16.310> the<00:00:17.310> rear<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
therefore this must be the rear of the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.870 
therefore this must be the rear of the
drum<00:00:17.910> unit<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:20.220> we've<00:00:20.400> got<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.670> careful

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
drum unit and we've got to be careful

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.140 
drum unit and we've got to be careful
that<00:00:21.240> under<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> drum<00:00:21.750> flap<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.910> drum

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
that under the drum flap that the drum

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.750 
that under the drum flap that the drum
which<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.600> shiny<00:00:24.840> blue<00:00:25.109> roller<00:00:25.580> we<00:00:26.580> don't

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
which is the shiny blue roller we don't

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.380 
which is the shiny blue roller we don't
touch<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.240> our<00:00:27.390> bare<00:00:27.510> hands

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
touch that with our bare hands

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.150 
touch that with our bare hands
so<00:00:30.390> you'll<00:00:30.810> need<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.439> Philips<00:00:31.980> head

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
so you'll need a Philips head

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.959 
so you'll need a Philips head
screwdriver<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:34.350> tiny<00:00:34.559> flat<00:00:34.829> blade<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
screwdriver and a tiny flat blade and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:47.200 
screwdriver and a tiny flat blade and
now<00:00:36.030> Pete<00:00:36.960> will<00:00:37.590> remove<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.250> rear<00:00:38.430> drum<00:00:38.670> plate

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:01:03.259 

there<00:00:48.210> will<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.450> four<00:00:49.610> Phillips<00:00:50.610> head<00:00:50.700> screws

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.210 

and<00:01:04.269> now<00:01:04.720> we<00:01:04.780> can<00:01:05.050> pull<00:01:05.230> off<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.800> drum<00:01:05.980> plate

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
and now we can pull off the drum plate

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.630 
and now we can pull off the drum plate
with<00:01:06.430> a<00:01:06.460> bit<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:07.290> slight<00:01:08.290> effort<00:01:08.650> now<00:01:09.430> we<00:01:09.490> have

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
with a bit of slight effort now we have

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.960 
with a bit of slight effort now we have
to<00:01:09.730> remove<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.090> drum<00:01:10.270> gear<00:01:11.550> which<00:01:12.550> we<00:01:12.760> will

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
to remove the drum gear which we will

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.500 
to remove the drum gear which we will
need<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.210> flat<00:01:13.390> blade<00:01:13.570> for<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.330> drum

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
need the flat blade for and the drum

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.310 
need the flat blade for and the drum
bushing<00:01:16.900> which<00:01:17.470> also<00:01:17.680> need<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.920> flat<00:01:18.130> blade<00:01:18.310> for

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
bushing which also need a flat blade for

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.590 
bushing which also need a flat blade for
it<00:01:20.320> should<00:01:20.470> just<00:01:20.560> pop<00:01:20.650> off<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:25.240> this<00:01:25.420> next

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
it should just pop off now this next

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.520 
it should just pop off now this next
step<00:01:25.720> we<00:01:25.960> have<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.200> be<00:01:26.290> careful<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:28.380> secure<00:01:29.380> the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
step we have to be careful to secure the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.900 
step we have to be careful to secure the
drum<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:29.979> does<00:01:30.070> not<00:01:30.190> fall<00:01:30.369> out<00:01:30.400> of<00:01:30.520> position

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
drum so it does not fall out of position

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.140 
drum so it does not fall out of position
so<00:01:31.229> Pete<00:01:32.229> puts<00:01:32.470> his<00:01:32.590> hand<00:01:32.800> on<00:01:32.920> top<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.369> it'll
