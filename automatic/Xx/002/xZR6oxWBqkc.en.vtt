key ally I think that's a good way into

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.860 
key ally I think that's a good way into
it<00:05:46.919> the<00:05:47.159> last<00:05:47.310> one<00:05:47.550> it's<00:05:48.120> an<00:05:48.210> interesting<00:05:48.479> one

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
it the last one it's an interesting one

beautiful I looked at it properly so I

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.570 
beautiful I looked at it properly so I
think<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.900> last<00:05:52.110> one<00:05:52.469> that<00:05:52.860> Shakespeare

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
think the last one that Shakespeare

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.100 
think the last one that Shakespeare
wrote<00:05:53.610> for<00:05:53.969> himself<00:05:54.389> was<00:05:54.659> thought<00:05:54.960> to<00:05:54.990> have

wrote for himself was thought to have

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.240 
wrote for himself was thought to have
written<00:05:55.289> by<00:05:55.469> ourselves<00:05:55.620> which<00:05:56.039> is<00:05:56.069> The

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
written by ourselves which is The

Tempest the cover is absolutely

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.050 
Tempest the cover is absolutely
incredible<00:05:58.500> The<00:05:59.069> Tempest<00:05:59.400> is<00:05:59.490> like<00:05:59.639> a<00:05:59.669> very

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
incredible The Tempest is like a very

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.330 
incredible The Tempest is like a very
classical<00:06:00.960> play<00:06:01.409> and<00:06:01.770> when<00:06:01.889> you<00:06:01.949> read<00:06:02.130> it<00:06:02.159> you

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
classical play and when you read it you

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.709 
classical play and when you read it you
get<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:02.580> sense<00:06:02.759> that<00:06:02.880> this<00:06:03.029> is<00:06:03.090> a<00:06:03.210> man<00:06:03.389> very

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
get the sense that this is a man very

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.149 
get the sense that this is a man very
aware<00:06:03.930> that<00:06:04.080> he's<00:06:04.229> gonna<00:06:04.349> be<00:06:04.560> like<00:06:04.860> people

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
gonna be looking back at him and his

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.450 
gonna be looking back at him and his
legacy<00:06:06.900> I<00:06:07.020> felt<00:06:07.319> always<00:06:07.560> when<00:06:07.800> reading<00:06:08.009> it<00:06:08.159> was

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
legacy I felt always when reading it was

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.980 
legacy I felt always when reading it was
like<00:06:08.639> he<00:06:08.789> was<00:06:08.909> trying<00:06:09.029> to<00:06:09.210> create<00:06:09.360> a<00:06:09.690> very

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
like he was trying to create a very

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.709 
like he was trying to create a very
classical<00:06:10.529> Greek<00:06:11.069> and<00:06:11.340> play<00:06:11.969> it's<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.449> Duke

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
classical Greek and play it's the Duke

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.830 
classical Greek and play it's the Duke
of<00:06:13.080> Milan<00:06:13.710> I<00:06:14.250> think<00:06:14.490> or<00:06:14.699> the<00:06:14.789> Duke<00:06:15.000> of<00:06:15.180> someone

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
of Milan I think or the Duke of someone

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.140 
of Milan I think or the Duke of someone
is<00:06:16.020> trying<00:06:16.380> to<00:06:16.500> restore<00:06:16.650> his<00:06:17.099> daughter<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.729> her

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
is trying to restore his daughter to her

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.420 
is trying to restore his daughter to her
rightful<00:06:18.539> places<00:06:18.779> like<00:06:19.259> the<00:06:19.409> abbe<00:06:19.560> so<00:06:20.099> he

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
rightful places like the abbe so he

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.290 
rightful places like the abbe so he
tempts<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.630> King<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:22.169> I<00:06:22.800> think<00:06:22.979> his<00:06:23.099> son<00:06:23.699> over

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
tempts the King and I think his son over

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.930 
tempts the King and I think his son over
from<00:06:24.839> the<00:06:24.960> mainland<00:06:25.349> but<00:06:26.070> through<00:06:26.370> this<00:06:26.520> storm

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
from the mainland but through this storm

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.450 
from the mainland but through this storm
