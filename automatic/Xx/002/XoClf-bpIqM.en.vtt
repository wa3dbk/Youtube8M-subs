talked about that one video for laying

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.810 
talked about that one video for laying
off<00:00:54.210> centers<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.740> do<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.220> this<00:00:56.370> way<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
off centers you can do it this way and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.620 
off centers you can do it this way and
you<00:00:56.880> just<00:00:57.660> take<00:00:58.820> find<00:00:59.820> your<00:01:00.000> Center<00:01:00.360> you<00:01:00.480> can

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
you just take find your Center you can

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.299 
you just take find your Center you can

adjust this subscribe it boom make a
mark<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.940> probably<00:01:06.300> can't<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.870> this<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
mark you probably can't see this in the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.280 
mark you probably can't see this in the
video<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.100> made<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.550> mark<00:01:09.480> I<00:01:09.630> scratched<00:01:10.050> it

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
video but I made a mark I scratched it

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.470 
video but I made a mark I scratched it
in<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> blue<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.880> will<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:12.180> Mar<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
in the blue now you will not Mar the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.230 
in the blue now you will not Mar the
material<00:01:13.050> when<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.260> do<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.800> that

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
material when you do that because that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.720 
material when you do that because that
dye<00:01:15.240> come<00:01:15.600> layout<00:01:16.290> fluid<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.860> super<00:01:17.310> sensitive

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
dye come layout fluid is super sensitive

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.480 
dye come layout fluid is super sensitive
so<00:01:18.060> even<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> slightest<00:01:18.960> bit<00:01:19.130> will<00:01:20.130> scratch

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
so even the slightest bit will scratch

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.570 
so even the slightest bit will scratch
it<00:01:20.760> without<00:01:21.090> scratching<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.780> actual<00:01:22.170> metal

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
it without scratching the actual metal

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.330 
it without scratching the actual metal
okay<00:01:24.980> once<00:01:25.980> I<00:01:26.100> did<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.700> found<00:01:27.920> my<00:01:28.920> angle<00:01:29.310> of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
okay once I did that I found my angle of

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.830 
okay once I did that I found my angle of
course<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:29.940> of<00:01:30.060> my<00:01:30.150> string

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
course because of my string

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.460 
course because of my string
I<00:01:31.520> ran<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.790> tight<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:34.050> I'm<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.350> gonna

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.960 
I ran it up tight and I'm just gonna
worry<00:01:34.740> about<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.070> end<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.580> not<00:01:35.640> gonna<00:01:35.880> worry

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
about the ire end yet so once I have

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.410 
about the ire end yet so once I have
that<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:40.320> transfer<00:01:40.770> my<00:01:40.920> angle<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:42.210> this

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that I just transfer my angle but this

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.880 
that I just transfer my angle but this
time<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.930> flip<00:01:43.500> my<00:01:43.880> angle<00:01:44.880> finder<00:01:45.060> around<00:01:45.720> okay

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.550 

and<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.979> scratch<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.870> once<00:01:51.870> I<00:01:52.020> scratch<00:01:52.320> that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and I scratch it in once I scratch that

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.969 
and I scratch it in once I scratch that
market<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.600> take<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.840> my<00:01:54.960> disc<00:01:55.200> sander<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.799> I

market I take it on my disc sander and I
grind<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:57.150> it<00:01:57.320> okay<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> left<00:01:59.280> myself<00:01:59.460> an

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
away and what I did is just from

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.580 
away and what I did is just from
experience<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.479> knew<00:02:06.690> I<00:02:06.720> had<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.140> kind<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.440> round

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
experience I knew I had to kind of round

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.419 
experience I knew I had to kind of round
it<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.189> I<00:02:08.219> rounded<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.789> right<00:02:08.939> away

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
it so I rounded it right away

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.630 
it so I rounded it right away
and<00:02:09.549> then<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.239> went<00:02:10.390> right<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.810> grinder<00:02:11.260> i

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and then I went right to the grinder i

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.699 
and then I went right to the grinder i
ground<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.819> radius<00:02:13.209> here<00:02:13.569> ground<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.140> radius<00:02:14.500> on

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
ground a radius here ground a radius on

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.470 
ground a radius here ground a radius on
the<00:02:14.860> end<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:16.599> if<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.959> can<00:02:17.140> hold<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.439> is<00:02:17.620> one

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the end and if I can hold this is one

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.899 
the end and if I can hold this is one
one<00:02:19.480> hand<00:02:20.040> let's<00:02:21.040> see<00:02:21.370> here

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.550 

it<00:02:24.909> fits<00:02:25.239> about<00:02:25.569> like<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:27.090> okay<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:29.319> you<00:02:29.409> can

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
it fits about like that okay and you can

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.660 
it fits about like that okay and you can
see<00:02:30.599> that<00:02:31.599> joint<00:02:31.989> fits<00:02:32.739> perfect

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
see that joint fits perfect

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.960 
see that joint fits perfect
okay<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:35.349> now<00:02:35.470> once<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:35.859> have<00:02:36.099> that<00:02:36.430> now

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
okay so now once I have that now

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.399 
okay so now once I have that now
remember<00:02:37.299> I<00:02:37.329> can<00:02:37.540> stay<00:02:37.720> away<00:02:37.900> from<00:02:38.109> the<00:02:38.200> line

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
remember I can stay away from the line

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.610 
remember I can stay away from the line
because<00:02:38.859> my<00:02:39.250> lower<00:02:39.459> longer<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.359> my<00:02:40.620> wing

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
because my lower longer on and my wing

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.220 
because my lower longer on and my wing
fitting<00:02:42.069> up<00:02:42.220> above<00:02:42.519> is<00:02:42.819> parallel<00:02:43.329> so<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:43.989> could

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
fitting up above is parallel so I could

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.960 
fitting up above is parallel so I could
slide<00:02:44.560> this<00:02:44.590> back<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.190> forth<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.700> get<00:02:45.790> my

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
slide this back and forth and get my

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.309 
slide this back and forth and get my
measurements<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.569> don't<00:02:46.750> need<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.959> be<00:02:47.079> on<00:02:47.170> my

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
measurements I don't need to be on my

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.970 
measurements I don't need to be on my
mark<00:02:47.560> yet

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
mark yet

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.979 
mark yet
as<00:02:48.370> long<00:02:48.609> as<00:02:48.639> I'm<00:02:48.879> parallel<00:02:49.329> with<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.510> string

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
as long as I'm parallel with that string

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.190 
as long as I'm parallel with that string
I<00:02:50.260> know<00:02:50.829> my<00:02:51.099> layout<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.549> good<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.480> up<00:02:52.629> here<00:02:52.989> I

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
I know my layout is good so up here I

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.470 
I know my layout is good so up here I
just<00:02:54.129> kind<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.430> have<00:02:54.639> it<00:02:54.819> there's<00:02:54.970> my<00:02:55.120> piece<00:02:55.299> of

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
just kind of have it there's my piece of

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.849 
just kind of have it there's my piece of
tape<00:02:55.689> I'm<00:02:55.870> going<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.049> use<00:02:56.139> that<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.439> hold<00:02:56.620> this

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
tape I'm going to use that to hold this

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.339 
tape I'm going to use that to hold this
end<00:02:57.129> I'm<00:02:58.060> gonna<00:02:58.239> go<00:02:58.510> up<00:02:58.569> there<00:02:58.750> with<00:02:58.870> my<00:02:59.019> angle

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
end I'm gonna go up there with my angle

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.789 
end I'm gonna go up there with my angle
finder<00:02:59.609> find<00:03:00.609> the<00:03:00.790> angle<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.720> then<00:03:02.439> start<00:03:02.680> on

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
finder find the angle and then start on

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.220 
finder find the angle and then start on
the<00:03:02.889> other<00:03:03.040> end
