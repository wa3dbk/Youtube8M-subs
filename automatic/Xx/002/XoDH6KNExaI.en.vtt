which<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.790> absolutely<00:00:36.600> crazy<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.230> let's<00:00:37.860> move

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
which is absolutely crazy but let's move

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.470 
which is absolutely crazy but let's move
on<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.219> take<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> look<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.820> our<00:00:38.879> example<00:00:39.059> for

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
on and take a look at our example for

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.940 
on and take a look at our example for
this<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.690> my<00:00:39.809> first<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> be

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
this so my first one is going to be

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.069 
this so my first one is going to be
player<00:00:41.700> positions<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> multiple

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
player positions and have a multiple

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.080 
player positions and have a multiple
positions<00:00:44.070> now<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> don't<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.789> add<00:00:44.910> in

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
positions now I don't want to add in

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.819 
positions now I don't want to add in
more<00:00:45.300> position<00:00:46.079> cards<00:00:46.320> because<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.590> don't

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
more position cards because I don't

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.709 
more position cards because I don't
think<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.070> should<00:00:47.219> be<00:00:47.460> able<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.760> convert<00:00:48.090> every

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
think it should be able to convert every

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.119 
think it should be able to convert every
right<00:00:48.930> mid<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> game<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> centimeter

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
right mid on the game to a centimeter

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.470 
right mid on the game to a centimeter
because<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.430> dhoni<00:00:50.550> demaria<00:00:50.969> who<00:00:51.149> does<00:00:51.329> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
because it's dhoni demaria who does that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.700 
because it's dhoni demaria who does that
and<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.930> shouldn't<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.199> able<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.410> convince

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and you shouldn't be able to convince

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.830 
and you shouldn't be able to convince
convert<00:00:53.250> every<00:00:53.579> centerfold<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> game<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
convert every centerfold on the game to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.029 
convert every centerfold on the game to
right<00:00:55.020> wing<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.649> only<00:00:55.739> players

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
right wing because it's only players

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.830 
right wing because it's only players
like<00:00:56.190> bale<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.120> similarly<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
like bale you do that and similarly you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240 
like bale you do that and similarly you
shouldn't<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.140> able<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> convert<00:00:58.649> every<00:00:59.039> right

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
shouldn't be able to convert every right

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.590 
shouldn't be able to convert every right
back<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.579> game<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.940> ascend<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.359> fence

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
back on the game to ascend to the fence

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.389 
back on the game to ascend to the fence
of<00:01:00.690> myth<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.410> should<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.739> also<00:01:01.890> converted

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
of myth but you should be also converted

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.860 
of myth but you should be also converted
to<00:01:02.460> fill<00:01:02.670> up<00:01:02.760> alarm<00:01:02.969> because<00:01:03.149> he<00:01:03.359> plays<00:01:03.539> two

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
to fill up alarm because he plays two

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.630 
to fill up alarm because he plays two
thirds<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.320> his<00:01:04.470> games<00:01:04.710> there<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.460> think

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
thirds of his games there and I think

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.250 
thirds of his games there and I think
it'd<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.090> good<00:01:06.270> idea<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.110> could

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it'd be a really good idea if you could

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.859 
it'd be a really good idea if you could
get<00:01:07.470> maybe<00:01:08.460> multiple<00:01:08.790> alarms<00:01:09.180> impacts<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
get maybe multiple alarms impacts so

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.300 
get maybe multiple alarms impacts so
when<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.170> alarm<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> pack<00:01:10.770> there's<00:01:11.220> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
when you get alarm in a pack there's a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.740 
when you get alarm in a pack there's a
two-third<00:01:11.700> chance<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.240> he'll<00:01:12.360> come<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.570> as

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
two-third chance that he'll come out as

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
two-third chance that he'll come out as
a<00:01:12.780> CDM<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.680> one-third<00:01:14.130> chance<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.580> he'll

nine chemistry to haven't three which is

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.010 
nine chemistry to haven't three which is
just<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.090> annoying<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.540> he's<00:02:00.689> gonna<00:02:00.810> play

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020

expensive ones and in a position that
this<00:02:18.459> guy<00:02:18.670> doesn't<00:02:19.060> play<00:02:19.330> two<00:02:19.660> thirds<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.140> the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
this guy doesn't play two thirds of the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.770 
this guy doesn't play two thirds of the
time<00:02:20.470> if<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.550> was<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.849> happen<00:02:21.970> another<00:02:22.540> cool

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
time if that was to happen another cool

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.540 
time if that was to happen another cool
idea<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.290> had<00:02:23.349> would<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.069> idea<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.489> a

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
idea that I had would be the idea of a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.280 
idea that I had would be the idea of a
special<00:02:24.970> position<00:02:25.090> card<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:25.629> this<00:02:25.780> one<00:02:25.930> old

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
special position card so this one old

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.869 
special position card so this one old
position<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:27.040> going<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.220> switch<00:02:27.459> long<00:02:27.730> between

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
position is going to switch long between

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.970 
position is going to switch long between
us<00:02:28.150> two<00:02:28.330> positions<00:02:28.750> CDM<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.590> right<00:02:29.769> back

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
us two positions CDM and right back

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.500 
us two positions CDM and right back
maybe<00:02:30.610> these<00:02:30.760> are<00:02:30.819> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.060> cost<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.360> fortune

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
maybe these are going to cost a fortune

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.850 
maybe these are going to cost a fortune
