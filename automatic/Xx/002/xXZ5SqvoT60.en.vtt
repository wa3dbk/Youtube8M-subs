of<00:02:09.539> slight<00:02:10.200> hybrid<00:02:11.009> feel<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.550> these<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.090> I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
of slight hybrid feel with these and I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.940 
of slight hybrid feel with these and I
know<00:02:12.180> they've<00:02:12.480> got<00:02:12.690> grain<00:02:12.930> flow<00:02:13.170> forged<00:02:13.470> on<00:02:13.830> it

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
know they've got grain flow forged on it

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.070 
know they've got grain flow forged on it
but<00:02:14.790> that's<00:02:14.940> almost<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.330> branded<00:02:15.840> we're<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.019> a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
but that's almost the branded we're in a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.690 
but that's almost the branded we're in a
brand<00:02:16.349> isn't<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.680> that's<00:02:16.830> there<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.280> just<00:02:17.489> try

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
brand isn't it that's there to just try

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.640 
brand isn't it that's there to just try
and<00:02:17.730> sell<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.090> -<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.450> think<00:02:18.630> for<00:02:19.170> me<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.470> feels

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
and sell it - I think for me that feels

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.320 
and sell it - I think for me that feels
quite<00:02:20.010> firm<00:02:20.280> off<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.610> face<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.970> feels<00:02:21.090> quite

like<00:02:48.840> let's<00:02:49.380> give<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.560> another<00:02:49.680> hit<00:02:50.099> oh<00:02:52.880> yeah

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
like let's give it another hit oh yeah

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.150 
like let's give it another hit oh yeah
that<00:02:55.290> feels<00:02:55.530> really<00:02:56.010> really<00:02:56.610> nice<00:02:56.970> very<00:02:57.660> easy

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
that feels really really nice very easy

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.440 
that feels really really nice very easy
to<00:02:59.160> move<00:02:59.340> forwards<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.819> get<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.360> air

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
to move forwards and get up in the air

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.569 
to move forwards and get up in the air
but<00:03:00.599> not<00:03:00.989> as<00:03:01.110> easy<00:03:01.319> as<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.560> hybrid<00:03:01.829> would<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.519> so

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
but not as easy as a hybrid would be so

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.460 
but not as easy as a hybrid would be so
you<00:03:02.760> do<00:03:03.090> still<00:03:03.150> get<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.599> forward<00:03:04.079> flight<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.440> I

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
you do still get a forward flight so I

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.800 
you do still get a forward flight so I
do<00:03:04.530> feel<00:03:04.799> like<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:04.980> could<00:03:05.130> use<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.660> still<00:03:06.660> on

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
do feel like I could use that still on

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.599 
do feel like I could use that still on
the<00:03:06.900> links<00:03:07.170> course<00:03:07.410> still<00:03:07.709> as<00:03:07.890> my<00:03:08.160> three<00:03:08.430> iron

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
the links course still as my three iron

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.340 
the links course still as my three iron
keep<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.030> down<00:03:09.180> as<00:03:09.359> well<00:03:09.600> as<00:03:09.720> try<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.049> move<00:03:10.170> up

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
keep it down as well as try and move up

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.289 
keep it down as well as try and move up
in<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> F<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.799> wanted<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.819> let's<00:03:12.000> come<00:03:12.269> down

in the F I wanted to so let's come down

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.379 
in the F I wanted to so let's come down
them<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.370> four<00:03:14.790> iron<00:03:15.590> here<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:18.120> again<00:03:18.209> very

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
them to the four iron here so again very

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.020 
them to the four iron here so again very
