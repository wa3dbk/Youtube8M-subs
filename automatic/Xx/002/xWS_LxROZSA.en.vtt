medium I'm thinking I should have gotten
a<00:02:00.060> light<00:02:00.420> even<00:02:01.380> though<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:02.040> tan<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:03.660> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
a light even though I'm tan it's the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.180 
a light even though I'm tan it's the
lights<00:02:04.830> seem<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.780> more<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:07.050> a

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
lights seem to be more like a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.670 
lights seem to be more like a
illuminator<00:02:08.190> while<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:09.030> medium<00:02:09.600> has<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.410> very

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
illuminator while the medium has a very

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.070 
illuminator while the medium has a very
orange<00:02:11.130> vector<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.910> i<00:02:11.940> don't<00:02:12.210> know<00:02:12.300> i'll<00:02:12.720> try
