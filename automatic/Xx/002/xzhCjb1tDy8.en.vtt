00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:15.600
 hello now it's about the mouse 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:20.910
 radio and mouse which transmits its 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 signal on wifi what are its features 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.020
 Well, sort of like heaped on 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:33.769
 cheap without a button on the wheel 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:39.000
 rotates on emotions from like this 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.710
 switching the speed of response further here 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.540
 still 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 buttons back and forth well, what else is there 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:56.390
 turn on turn on here turn on that is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.390
 everything works fine 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.379
 connect means in it 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:10.759
 such a transmitter is worth more to understand 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.759
 can be used somehow 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:20.390
 nerds yes how raw get it so once and 

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:25.700
 everything 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.700
 not delivered gone gone go hide 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:36.270
 Now let's see what we have inside because 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:43.709
 This rubric we have about what we have 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:46.860
 inside the whole there is no longer with us as 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:56.209
 quick and easy while tricked in here 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:56.209
 force from the point of the guides everything is necessary 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:07.950
 box suranu nothing special yes 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:12.930
 so this is the LED that shines 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:20.610
 transmits a signal through the lenses of glasses you see 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:25.620
 there is a little lens here so we flew out 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:30.560
 let's see the tongue again means served 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:35.849
 here it is refracted and transmitted to 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:42.510
 rug how many comes back and here is our 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:48.870
 fi wait a bit like this camera 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:56.310
 like mobile phones cool before 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:57.620
 there just stood this photodiode now 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.829
 some camera 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.829
 from this side 4 from that side 4 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.829
 contact 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:18.310
 so before there were wholesale sensors 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:23.100
 there are LED and photodiode and and now 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.100
 now it turns out contact probably 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:34.020
 device in one of the mice 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:39.190
 This device is shorter than a stunt on 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.260
 if the contacts are bad then turn off a bunch 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:47.890
 buttons 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.790
 all sorts of different details here at least so 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.700
 what are you this 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.700
 Nitsche not see 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.340
 and here pancake in general sli here it 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.420
 the only 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:14.230
 the chip is not a circuit that 's 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:24.710
 transmitter quartz worth antenna because 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:27.169
 zigzag com is an antenna wi fi well in 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:33.290
 principle and everything else you can see 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:36.919
 nothing interesting could not make sense to them 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:41.750
 you looked at your mouse looked okay 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:46.270
 okay write your comments you still 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:49.010
 wanted to see the disassembled 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.790
 subscribe to the channel all bye 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.790
 Good luck everyone
