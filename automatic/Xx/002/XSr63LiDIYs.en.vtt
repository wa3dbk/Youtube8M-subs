00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.430
 it comes a little bit to the other 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.830
 technology and a bit on the 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.959
 taste on i use world caster before 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.509
 especially when fishing with turkish 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.119
 surface coolers also to stroll what 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.169
 I think the nice one has the Schnurr 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.580
 Schnurr directly on the coil had 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.020
 I find better contact with the bait 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.320
 you get a better feeling for what you do 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.269
 makes 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.410
 I think that's great and you can 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.580
 Of course you can do it fast 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.990
 quickly realized you do not have until 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.580
 The arms fold over the amis and the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.900
 black magic have this trend yes 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.910
 Start fast fishing 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.710
 that is quite fix so I find yours 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.300
 world casta is fun with it 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.690
 Collecting is just what you get 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.690
 can say 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.830
 the splatter design of the real 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.350
 Role enables savings in weight 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.040
 the role will be easy but still very much 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.050
 stable 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.730
 These are the savings you get here 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.290
 Looks are incredibly resilient 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.820
 you can not break those roles and 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.110
 the saving that is the serves for it 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.040
 that the role becomes easy that one 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.040
 a good feeling so roller 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.820
 so we have this role here in the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.799
 for example in the left hand version 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.540
 because we europeans also with the left 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.340
 hand between most at least the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.049
 right hand models that one knows yes 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.040
 the us fell that did not here so 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.330
 correctly attached 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.590
 there are the left has models yet 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.210
 better because you have the right hand 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.500
 year so have the strong of the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.850
 most in the good has and that makes yes 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.890
 synonymous sense when the places or throws 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.420
 and so you should be the better 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.040
 in the evening between and have 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.899
 have worse evening birds because of that 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.580
 We left hand that makes on ours 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.790
 that's what makes it all over 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.790
 are 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.730
 big multi roll that was from the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.020
 handle as you have the route was me 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.290
 that's too bulky until now only 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.270
 these low profile rollers they lie a lot 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.830
 much better in the hand because one man 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.510
 should indeed take the role in the case 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.830
 fishing and if you have a big role 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.480
 does one have a bad grip one 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.910
 flat roll has you got a better one 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.080
 handle and the flatter the role is the more 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.820
 better than the handle and this role 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 very shallow so you still have a very 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.080
 Good job and you easy
