specific<00:02:16.970> things<00:02:17.269> like<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.750> was<00:02:17.840> watching<00:02:18.019> a

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
specific things like I was watching a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.199 
specific things like I was watching a
scene<00:02:18.560> where<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.980> rain<00:02:19.310> was<00:02:19.519> coming<00:02:19.549> down<00:02:19.849> and

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
scene where the rain was coming down and

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.089 
scene where the rain was coming down and
I<00:02:20.390> decided<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.959> switch<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.319> mode<00:02:21.500> up<00:02:21.680> from

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
I decided to switch the mode up from

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.949 
I decided to switch the mode up from
speech<00:02:22.430> some<00:02:22.670> more<00:02:22.849> music<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.330> drain<00:02:23.720> it

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
speech some more music and drain it

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.750 
speech some more music and drain it
coming<00:02:24.260> down<00:02:24.409> really<00:02:24.709> enhance<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.400> overall

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
coming down really enhance the overall

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.729 
coming down really enhance the overall
experience<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.659> that<00:02:26.840> whatever<00:02:27.230> clip<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.590> was

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
experience of that whatever clip I was

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.350 
experience of that whatever clip I was
watching<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.280> really<00:02:28.640> made<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.060> big

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
watching and it really made a big

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.030 
watching and it really made a big
difference<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:30.349> one<00:02:30.500> thing<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.739> didn't<00:02:31.010> like

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
difference the one thing I didn't like

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.830 
difference the one thing I didn't like
is<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.610> when<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:31.909> enable<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.599> mode

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
is that when you enable the mode

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.660 
is that when you enable the mode
selection<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.620> limits<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.129> sound<00:02:34.400> of

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
selection it limits the sound of

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.789 
selection it limits the sound of
whatever<00:02:35.239> you're<00:02:35.450> receiving<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:36.170> about<00:02:36.379> 70%

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
whatever you're receiving to about 70%

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.440 
whatever you're receiving to about 70%
of<00:02:37.159> the<00:02:37.250> capacity<00:02:37.730> not<00:02:37.760> only<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.150> there's

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
of the capacity not only that there's

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.360 
of the capacity not only that there's
not<00:02:38.629> a<00:02:38.690> lot<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.019> balance<00:02:39.230> between<00:02:39.680> highs<00:02:40.129> and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
not a lot of balance between highs and

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.250 
not a lot of balance between highs and
lows<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.909> lot<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.269> people<00:02:41.510> want<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.840> watch<00:02:42.110> a

well<00:04:47.210> it's<00:04:47.509> chipping<00:04:47.900> out<00:04:48.139> but<00:04:48.380> I<00:04:48.440> can<00:04:48.650> barely

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
well it's chipping out but I can barely

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:56.320 
well it's chipping out but I can barely
catch<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.400> signal<00:04:49.610> oh<00:04:54.940> yeah

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330

where<00:05:01.729> that<00:05:01.940> door<00:05:02.389> was<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:03.669> this<00:05:04.669> is<00:05:04.729> where<00:05:05.060> I

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
where that door was and this is where I

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.719 
where that door was and this is where I
ran<00:05:05.360> out<00:05:05.509> of<00:05:05.539> distance<00:05:06.020> copy<00:05:06.949> waiting<00:05:07.460> for

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
ran out of distance copy waiting for

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.909 
ran out of distance copy waiting for
action<00:05:08.000> so<00:05:08.690> as<00:05:08.720> far<00:05:08.930> as<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.199> distance<00:05:09.560> test

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
action so as far as the distance test

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.920 
action so as far as the distance test
the<00:05:10.400> habit<00:05:10.729> I<00:05:10.820> was<00:05:10.970> using<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.419> measure<00:05:11.599> the

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
the habit I was using to measure the

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.890 
the habit I was using to measure the
distance<00:05:12.320> of<00:05:12.440> 100<00:05:12.919> meters<00:05:12.949> uses<00:05:13.759> GPS<00:05:14.270> which<00:05:14.720> is

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
distance of 100 meters uses GPS which is

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.080 
distance of 100 meters uses GPS which is
an<00:05:14.990> approximation<00:05:15.680> it's<00:05:16.099> not<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.340> specific<00:05:16.610> to

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
an approximation it's not a specific to

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.640 
an approximation it's not a specific to
give<00:05:17.240> me<00:05:17.389> down<00:05:17.539> to<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.840> millimeter<00:05:18.169> where<00:05:18.560> I

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
give me down to the millimeter where I

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.890 
give me down to the millimeter where I
am<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.310> distance<00:05:19.849> that<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:20.210> got<00:05:20.509> was<00:05:20.720> nowhere

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
am the distance that I got was nowhere

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.860 
am the distance that I got was nowhere
close<00:05:21.380> to<00:05:21.409> what<00:05:21.949> 100<00:05:22.520> meters<00:05:22.789> was<00:05:23.000> so<00:05:23.240> so<00:05:23.539> even

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
close to what 100 meters was so so even

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.379 
close to what 100 meters was so so even
with<00:05:24.080> that<00:05:24.320> room<00:05:24.650> for<00:05:25.099> marginal<00:05:25.880> error<00:05:26.150> it

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
with that room for marginal error it

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.210 
with that room for marginal error it
still<00:05:26.810> didn't<00:05:27.050> come<00:05:27.199> close<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.740> in<00:05:27.860> fact<00:05:28.070> it

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
still didn't come close and in fact it

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.920 
still didn't come close and in fact it
checked<00:05:28.460> out<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:28.610> lot<00:05:28.880> earlier<00:05:29.300> than<00:05:29.539> that<00:05:29.599> I

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
checked out a lot earlier than that I

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.850 
checked out a lot earlier than that I
just<00:05:30.169> kept<00:05:30.409> going

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
just kept going

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.430 
just kept going
for<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.310> test<00:05:31.550> to<00:05:31.729> see<00:05:31.940> exactly<00:05:32.389> how<00:05:32.539> far<00:05:33.169> I

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
for the test to see exactly how far I

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.379 
for the test to see exactly how far I
really<00:05:33.860> could<00:05:34.159> pick<00:05:34.490> up<00:05:34.610> a<00:05:34.729> signal<00:05:34.970> all<00:05:35.360> right

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389

I really shouldn't have to deal with

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.360 
I really shouldn't have to deal with
that<00:06:47.450> so<00:06:47.750> oh<00:06:47.780> no<00:06:47.900> they're<00:06:48.350> not<00:06:48.440> really<00:06:48.680> for<00:06:49.100> me

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370

I<00:06:49.640> mean<00:06:49.850> but<00:06:50.030> I<00:06:50.060> also<00:06:50.240> I<00:06:50.360> don't<00:06:50.570> have<00:06:50.720> that<00:06:50.900> need

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
to quietly listen immediately at night I

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.880

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.290 
kind of don't have any neighbors on and
really<00:06:55.130> disturb<00:06:55.520> but<00:06:55.820> I<00:06:55.880> do<00:06:55.970> think<00:06:56.180> that

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
really disturb but I do think that

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.690 
really disturb but I do think that
they're<00:06:56.480> worth<00:06:56.660> giving<00:06:56.900> a<00:06:57.080> try<00:06:57.110> I<00:06:57.640> want<00:06:58.640> to
