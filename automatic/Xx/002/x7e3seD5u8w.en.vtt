00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.870
 a dark disguise for halloween either 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.060
 dark but not scary follow this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.689
 easy dark make-up tutorial 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.520
 lady and you will be monstrously sexy for 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.980
 first let's take some bits of 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.660
 scotch to be applied obliquely to the sides 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.119
 of our eyes to have no problems 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.250
 of smudges and make perfect the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.110
 makeup once finished and removed it 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.150
 Scotch tape 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.040
 we take a black carbon eye shadow and it 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.800
 apply with an eye shadow brush 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.809
 we spread it over the entire mobile eyelid 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.760
 tapping so that the color does not 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.530
 spread out but remain beautiful intense with a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.100
 angled brush and the same eye shadow 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.140
 black 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.899
 we strengthen the color of the hairline 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.430
 of the upper lashes and outline the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.940
 line that extends outwards 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.940
 eye 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.969
 take a gradient brush e 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.390
 blend the black eye shadow up 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.160
 outside with a gradient brush 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.680
 smaller and a plum-colored eye shadow 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.360
 let's fade the black with the plum 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.670
 at the height of the natural fold 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.209
 of the eye pushing us enough towards 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.209
 the interior 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.430
 under the browbone we light up 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.159
 with a spoken white eye shadow and I have it 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.960
 let's blend with the plum color 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.580
 we will thus have a nuance of colors 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.580
 white plum and black 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.600
 they shade the area with black eyeshadow 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.439
 lower lashes with a small brush 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.060
 we can from a smaller shade now 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.649
 remove the scotch we create a line 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.719
 eyeliner type at the hairline 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.789
 eyelashes using a black eye shadow e 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.789
 wetting a little angled panel 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.000
 let's delineate and fill in the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.759
 eyebrows using a small brush 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.500
 angled and a brown eye shadow or if 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.500
 prefer an eyebrow pencil 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.170
 we end up building the base and we apply 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.390
 then the foundation with the appropriate 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.129
 cat's tongue brush 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.650
 we start from the area under the eye in 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.940
 so that it is well lit. 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.860
 I chose a solid color background 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.379
 slightly lighter than my tone 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.049
 leather to emphasize black 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.790
 of eyes blot with a sponge 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.030
 moist to remove excesses of 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.709
 foundation we take a concealer 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.450
 clear and pass it with your fingers 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.760
 tapping in the area around the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.500
 nostrils under the eyes to define 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.500
 make up and illuminate even better 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.709
 in the middle of the chin of the forehead and on the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.480
 back of the nose with an oblique brush 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.579
 of the earth we run the sides of the nose 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.340
 to thin it and use a 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.810
 brick red blush on the cheeks 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.489
 then we move the temples and the neck with 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.349
 of the earth 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.090
 finally by the mouth with we return the 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.400
 our lips with a black pencil and 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.260
 let's say that also in the middle then 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.540
 let the pencil fade with a red lipstick 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.849
 brick applied with the appropriate 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.980
 brush to create a chiaroscuro 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.680
 at the edges darker and in the middle more 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.299
 clear we take mascara in gel 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.540
 transparent to pass on 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.370
 eyebrows to fix them we apply 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.590
 then of the tufts of false eyelashes only 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.910
 outside of our eye and we finish 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.319
 make up eyes with plenty 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.319
 mascara both above and below 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.880
