with George T stag and it is a bubbly

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.980 
with George T stag and it is a bubbly
good<00:02:27.440> but<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:28.820> hard<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.420> find<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:29.870> it's

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
good but it's hard to find and it's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.950

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
a little bit more sweetness because

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.330 
a little bit more sweetness because
we're<00:02:39.020> not<00:02:39.080> using<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.410> much<00:02:39.530> amaretto<00:02:39.980> a

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
we're not using that much amaretto a
