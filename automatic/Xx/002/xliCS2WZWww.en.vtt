volume buttons to change the brightness

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.830 
volume buttons to change the brightness
on<00:01:13.260> our<00:01:13.439> device<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:15.689> we

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
on our device just like that so then we

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.570 
on our device just like that so then we
can<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.110> ahead<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.320> both<00:01:16.770> press<00:01:17.070> them<00:01:17.310> again

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and it switches back to your volume so

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
and it switches back to your volume so
it's<00:01:20.640> really<00:01:20.820> useful<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.810> use

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
it's really useful because you can use

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.920 
it's really useful because you can use
both<00:01:22.409> features<00:01:23.060> brightness<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.270> volume

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
both features brightness and volume

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.370 
both features brightness and volume
using<00:01:25.320> your<00:01:25.710> brightness<00:01:26.280> vol<00:01:26.820> tweak<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.170> this

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
which is really really useful because

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.550 
which is really really useful because
