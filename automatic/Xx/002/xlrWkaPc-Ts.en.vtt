00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
tight and the problem with that being is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.420 
tight and the problem with that being is
you<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> reach<00:01:22.470> around<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.860> back<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
make that connection back there as well

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.800 
make that connection back there as well
if<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.430> pulled<00:01:26.670> over<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> chains

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
put on as a preventive situation then

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.219 
put on as a preventive situation then
you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.890> take<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.100> chains<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:36.229> lay

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you can just take the chains and lay

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
you can just take the chains and lay
them<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:37.829> remember<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.369> you're<00:01:38.490> laying

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.480 
them out now remember when you're laying
them<00:01:38.850> out<00:01:38.970> they're<00:01:39.930> marked<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.770> near<00:01:41.009> this

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
them out they're marked on near this

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.310 
them out they're marked on near this
side<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> tire<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> flip<00:01:43.200> it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
side to the tire so you have to flip it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440 
side to the tire so you have to flip it
upside<00:01:43.590> down<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.310> would<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> tire

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
upside down so that would be to the tire

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.260 
upside down so that would be to the tire
and<00:01:45.930> lay<00:01:46.409> both<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.890> change<00:01:47.189> right<00:01:47.939> underneath

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and lay both the change right underneath

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.469 
and lay both the change right underneath
the<00:01:48.509> front<00:01:49.500> tires<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:50.460> front-wheel<00:01:50.970> drive<00:01:51.210> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the front tires if front-wheel drive and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.149 
the front tires if front-wheel drive and
then<00:01:51.780> just<00:01:52.049> take<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> vehicle<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> put<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.040> in

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
then just take the vehicle and put it in

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.190 
then just take the vehicle and put it in
neutral<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.240> reverse<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:55.020> slowly

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
neutral or in reverse and just slowly

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.380 
neutral or in reverse and just slowly
back<00:01:55.530> up<00:01:55.560> about<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.040> foot<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.430> half<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.909> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
back up about a foot and a half and that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.880 
back up about a foot and a half and that
will<00:01:57.570> locate<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.960> car<00:01:58.200> right<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> center

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
will locate the car right on the center

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.709 
will locate the car right on the center
of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> chains<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.700> then<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.360> could<00:02:00.479> pull

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
of the chains and then you could pull

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.039 
of the chains and then you could pull
and<00:02:00.990> make<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.130> connections<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.119> chains

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
and make the connections on the chains

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.160 
and make the connections on the chains
on<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:05.219> top<00:02:05.520> half<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.939> tire<00:02:06.180> where<00:02:06.450> you're

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
on the top half of the tire where you're

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.389 
on the top half of the tire where you're
out<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> snow<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.950> don't<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.339 
out of the snow and you don't have the
cold<00:02:09.149> conditions<00:02:09.420> where<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.989> have<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> get

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
cold conditions where you have to get

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.290 
cold conditions where you have to get
your<00:02:10.470> hands<00:02:10.709> down

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300
