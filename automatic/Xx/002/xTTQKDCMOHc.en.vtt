guess<00:03:58.569> this<00:03:58.780> video<00:03:59.350> is<00:03:59.980> talking<00:04:00.310> about

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
guess this video is talking about

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.160 
guess this video is talking about
utilizing<00:04:00.940> your<00:04:01.269> garrison<00:04:01.569> to<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.900> maximum

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
utilizing your garrison to the maximum

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.500 
utilizing your garrison to the maximum
extent<00:04:02.620> because<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.609> pretty<00:04:03.819> much<00:04:03.940> offers<00:04:04.209> you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
extent because it pretty much offers you

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.390 
extent because it pretty much offers you
a<00:04:04.540> way<00:04:04.840> for<00:04:05.019> you<00:04:05.109> to<00:04:05.139> earn<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.829> maximum<00:04:06.250> amount

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
a way for you to earn the maximum amount

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.039 
a way for you to earn the maximum amount
of<00:04:06.430> money<00:04:06.670> that<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:07.060> can<00:04:07.299> make<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.690> in<00:04:07.930> the

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
of money that you can make it in the

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.009 
of money that you can make it in the
game<00:04:08.230> right<00:04:08.380> now<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:10.150> guess<00:04:10.480> homes<00:04:10.690> trying

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
game right now and I guess homes trying

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.770 
game right now and I guess homes trying
to<00:04:11.109> say<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.410> you<00:04:12.310> should<00:04:13.060> really<00:04:13.209> take<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.540> look

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
to say is you should really take a look

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.270 
to say is you should really take a look
at<00:04:13.840> your<00:04:13.930> garrison<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.560> see<00:04:14.829> what<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.069> want

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
to do with it and therefore by taking

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.110 
to do with it and therefore by taking
your<00:04:17.349> time<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.620> Panthers<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.370> garrison<00:04:18.669> you

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
your time to Panthers to garrison you

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.219 
your time to Panthers to garrison you
might<00:04:19.269> actually<00:04:19.479> be<00:04:19.660> able<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.870> make<00:04:20.049> up

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
might actually be able to make up

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.900 
might actually be able to make up
electrical<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:20.950> would<00:04:21.099> hopefully<00:04:21.639> you<00:04:21.849> guys

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910
