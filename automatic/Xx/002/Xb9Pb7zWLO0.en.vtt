00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello I'm mike rockenfeller and me 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.879
 explain the steering wheel today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.879
 our audi rs5 dtm 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.460
 if it's out with the so-called 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.169
 quick release as you are here beautiful 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.699
 the steering wheel sees a few too fast 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.169
 lock and settle the terms 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.840
 emergency in an accident or something like that 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.399
 you get out of the car quickly here 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.509
 behind the steering wheel you can see the three 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.210
 Panels very nice 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.430
 the right one is to the upshift left to 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.410
 down and here we still have 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.879
 sometimes one for the drs that means if one 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.070
 but it is close enough to the front man 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.690
 not bad fold down then to 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.650
 overtake and a bit more 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.650
 to get topspeed 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.720
 Here we see the steering wheel from the beginning 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.030
 So from our point of view we have new ones 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.920
 button once the dot button with it 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.240
 we can constantly with the team 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.240
 communicate at the box wall 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.579
 then we have the button here directly 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.240
 next to it is for the rear wheel brake 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.680
 so you can lock the startup 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.600
 if you let go of the button then 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.340
 the lights go out then the brake goes 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.330
 also on and you have the clutch 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.890
 already looking forward 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.390
 and then the car goes off 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.009
 just relieve this first one 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.810
 approach and prevent you 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.430
 starts rolling before the traffic lights go out 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.619
 then we have the windscreen wiper button 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.360
 we have an interval function and 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.700
 fast function in heavy rain 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.710
 then a very important button 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.140
 here pitts b we have one here 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.840
 pit lane 60 km h top speed 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.220
 and that enabled us at the end if you 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.170
 activate it and you will come once 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.930
 Among the important that you with full throttle 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.970
 can drive through in the first gear and the 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.100
 car really not over 60 km h 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.420
 accelerates this very important for 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.649
 us 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.750
 yes and then we have it here again 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.479
 the middle of the track map is also still 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.860
 quite interesting may ask 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.450
 why do we have that we can but 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.700
 the curves notice yes we can but 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.829
 of course so we different here 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.630
 Numbers have in the curves and that is 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.569
 really important if we have the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.450
 engineer explain in the box what that 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.800
 auto makes use of setup or the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.140
 changes we want to make or 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.550
 then describe the characteristic 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.500
 Let's talk about the same curves 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.940
 number and not about any curves 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.269
 name and nobody knows what the other one 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.269
 means 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.090
 yes that was the explanation of the audi 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.040
 detemple in grace if you still ask 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.569
 have and here on the weekend side and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.860
 Maybe I can see you 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.310
 one or the other in detail 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.310
 to explain
