of<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.980> guess<00:00:29.760> since<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.269> compact

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and hold the screw in there's a wire

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.870 
and hold the screw in there's a wire
through<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> hole<00:01:30.780> through<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:32.540> Wow<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.640> side

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
through a hole through it Wow the side

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.550 
through a hole through it Wow the side
of<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.150> look<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> bad<00:01:36.869> brake<00:01:37.350> pad

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
of that look that bad brake pad

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
of that look that bad brake pad
materials<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:39.030> bad<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.450> I'm

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
materials not one now not bad but I'm

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.889 
materials not one now not bad but I'm
gonna<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:39.750> man<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.990> are<00:01:40.909> compared<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.540> new

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
gonna do man you are compared to the new

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.050 
gonna do man you are compared to the new
brake<00:01:43.259> pads<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> new<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.820> all

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
brake pads this is a new one this is all

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.039 
brake pads this is a new one this is all
naturally<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.869> more<00:01:45.899> material<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:48.049> guess

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
naturally have more material I guess

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.990 
naturally have more material I guess
that<00:01:49.079> means<00:01:49.380> he's<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.710> higher<00:01:50.280> quality<00:01:50.759> pad

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that means he's are higher quality pad

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.330 
that means he's are higher quality pad
but<00:01:51.420> they're<00:01:52.229> definitely<00:01:52.439> not<00:01:52.740> worn<00:01:53.100> down

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
but they're definitely not worn down

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.020 
but they're definitely not worn down
let's<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.579> piston<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.149> working

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.420 

he<00:02:03.030> knows<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.660> had<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.590> screw<00:02:04.950> holding<00:02:05.280> them

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
he knows just had one screw holding them

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.650 
he knows just had one screw holding them
in<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:06.500> pistons<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.070> they<00:02:08.220> are<00:02:08.369> working

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
in and pistons out so they are working

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.730 
in and pistons out so they are working
so<00:02:09.660> i<00:02:09.869> gotta<00:02:10.200> replace<00:02:10.500> these<00:02:13.050> now<00:02:13.380> i<00:02:13.440> can

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
so i gotta replace these now i can

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.060 
so i gotta replace these now i can
get<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> brake<00:02:14.540> cylinder<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.660> come<00:02:15.870> back<00:02:16.110> in

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.650 

now<00:02:20.070> since<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.550> side<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:20.970> i<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.240> pen

now since this side then i have a pen

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.600 
now since this side then i have a pen
and<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.230> only<00:02:22.290> shaking<00:02:22.770> down<00:02:22.860> over<00:02:23.100> time<00:02:23.280> and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
this one just holding my wire I'm going

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.640 
this one just holding my wire I'm going
to<00:02:26.040> do<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.190> I'm<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.370> take<00:02:26.460> this<00:02:26.640> pin<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.930> old

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
to do is I'm and take this pin this old

a little bit cut it off their drill it
here<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.710> put<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> wire<00:02:32.190> there<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.240> doesn't

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
here so I put a wire there so it doesn't

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.460 
here so I put a wire there so it doesn't
slide<00:02:33.750> out<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.200> drop<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.800> pads<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:36.470> it's

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
slide out and drop the pads and it's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.890 
slide out and drop the pads and it's
kind<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.709> our<00:02:37.800> redneck<00:02:38.010> solution<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:38.760> that

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
kind of our redneck solution for that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.180 
kind of our redneck solution for that
yeah<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.110> nice<00:02:40.230> drill<00:02:40.590> bits<00:02:40.890> hardened

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
yeah it's a nice drill bits hardened

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.440 
yeah it's a nice drill bits hardened
steel<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.520> guess<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.060> dull<00:02:43.370> alright<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.209> get

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
steel I guess it's dull alright so I get

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.390 
steel I guess it's dull alright so I get
that<00:02:45.570> drill<00:02:45.840> bit<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.320> can't<00:02:46.530> drill<00:02:46.950> through<00:02:47.250> it

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
that drill bit I can't drill through it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.960 
that drill bit I can't drill through it
so<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.670> blinded<00:02:48.600> little<00:02:48.930> sides<00:02:49.230> off<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.800> that

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
so I blinded little sides off so that

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.710 
so I blinded little sides off so that
that<00:02:50.970> why<00:02:51.180> i<00:02:51.209> can't<00:02:51.570> slip<00:02:51.930> really<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.530> then

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
that why i can't slip really and then

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:06.830 
that why i can't slip really and then
just<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.840> lady<00:02:55.050> reassemble<00:03:04.610> okay<00:03:05.610> once<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.660> get

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
just a lady reassemble okay once you get

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.570 
just a lady reassemble okay once you get
your<00:03:06.959> brake<00:03:07.170> pads<00:03:07.200> Semele<00:03:07.890> on<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.250> want<00:03:08.459> to

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
your brake pads Semele on you want to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.560 
your brake pads Semele on you want to
spin<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.560> doesn't<00:03:10.560> make<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.709> lot<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.980> noise<00:03:11.570> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
spin it doesn't make a lot of noise the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.210 
spin it doesn't make a lot of noise the
sound<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:12.930> it's<00:03:13.050> really<00:03:13.260> hitting<00:03:13.440> that

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
sound like it's really hitting that

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.560 
sound like it's really hitting that
means<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.489> got<00:03:14.610> good<00:03:14.790> clearance<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.269> have<00:03:15.450> to

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
means you got good clearance you have to

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.620 
means you got good clearance you have to
adjust<00:03:15.780> anything<00:03:16.080> ah<00:03:17.209> this<00:03:18.209> one's<00:03:18.420> been<00:03:18.600> a
