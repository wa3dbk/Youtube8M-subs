00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.290
 hello cooks this Friday we are almost 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.420
 on the eve of Easter and then 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.010
 we propose you a very typical recipe 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 of the Italian tradition for this time 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.359
 the recipe that we are going to propose is the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.100
 leg of lamb the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.439
 ingredients that we need are 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.720
 obviously we start with a leg of 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.609
 lamb weighs a kilo a kilo and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.740
 medium to me I like it like that so I can 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.059
 leave it a little red inside the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.649
 Lamb meat is a meat that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.260
 very beautiful left when it stays 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.270
 pink inside and with this weight you can 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.000
 have the possibility to decide how much 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.100
 do it as soon as you leave the column 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.129
 Other ingredients that we need are 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.360
 a sprig of rosemary and a few sprigs of 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:57.670
 Sage a little salt and pepper 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.670
 we need olive oil obviously 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.780
 a glass of white wine to give a little 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.729
 of lamb flavor 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.460
 and we also need to make a caldito 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.260
 for a broth we need an onion and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.600
 a carrot the broth we need 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.009
 because the leg of lamb needs a lot 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.930
 time inside the oven then it 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.240
 could dry then let's prepare 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.100
 this soup apart and we are adding what 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.140
 little by little during cooking for 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.820
 keep it from drying out let's see now 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.680
 how the lamb leg is prepared 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.149
 oven the first step is to prepare the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.440
 broth to prepare the broth 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.979
 put a little bit of boiling water and 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.820
 we have put an onion and a carrot 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.770
 cooking 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.990
 meanwhile we can prepare the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.210
 mix we need to season 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.580
 our lamb leg in the mix 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.800
 let's put our rosemary and our 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.170
 salvia then what we are going to do is 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.590
 take the rosemary and remove the leaves 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.359
 because we do not need the twigs 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.359
 and we do the same with salvia 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.950
 we add a little bit of olive oil 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.970
 and ground pepper 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.900
 let's put a font preferably 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.510
 of glass let's put our paw on 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.209
 Lamb inside the fountain 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.209
 let's play our herbal mix 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.810
 and we are going to throw it over the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.110
 leg of lamb 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.110
 taking care that we take well the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.740
 oil and we throw it over we can 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.380
 help us with a brush 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.950
 we turn around and do the same for 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.950
 the other side 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.680
 now that our leg of lamb 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.410
 seasoned we put it for 10 15 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.790
 minutes in the oven very very strong to 220 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.790
 degrees so that it browns well 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.959
 It has been more or less 15 minutes we will 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.959
 to take out the lamb 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.990
 As you can see it has been cooked very well 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.300
 on the outside I like the noise of the oil 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.270
 what is this we are going to do now 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.800
 is to drink it with a little white wine 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.800
 let's throw the white wine over 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.420
 and we wait 5 minutes until the wine 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.340
 have not gone away completely have passed 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.120
 about 5 minutes and the wine should 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.120
 be absorbed 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.890
 we take the lamb out of the oven let's play 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.100
 our broth and we're going to add a 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.100
 tablespoon 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.880
 the lamb now needs to be more or 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.190
 minus 40 minutes depending on how much 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.140
 of cooked you want it inside what 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.570
 I advise you to use a thermometer 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.360
 to cook inside the oven so what 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.120
 you can put on the lamb by touching 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.500
 reaching its innermost part and you can 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.500
 find out the temperature 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.499
 we will put it inside the oven until 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.990
 reach about 170 degrees every 10 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:59.969
 15 minutes we will take it out and we will add 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.969
 a spoonful of broth 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.829
 40 minutes have passed we have been 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.299
 putting a little bit of each data every 10 

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:07.799
 minutes more or less about our 

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:10.069
 lamb and let's see now how 

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:10.069
 we're 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:21.810
 Well, it seems to be very good 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.680
 we are going to take it and put it inside 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.680
 our plate
