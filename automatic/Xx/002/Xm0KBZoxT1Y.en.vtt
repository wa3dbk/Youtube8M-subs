00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
with them but once they've cooled down

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.180 
with them but once they've cooled down

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
slightly I'm going to grab a paring

00:00:43.190 --> 00:01:02.950 
slightly I'm going to grab a paring

you're gonna add some egg yolks and
start<00:01:44.770> mixing<00:01:45.040> this<00:01:45.369> all<00:01:45.610> together<00:01:45.850> until<00:01:46.300> it

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
start mixing this all together until it

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:59.969 
start mixing this all together until it
becomes<00:01:47.080> one<00:01:47.320> mass

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.319 

next<00:02:00.670> you're<00:02:00.759> going<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.909> want<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.149> start

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
next you're going to want to start

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.090 
next you're going to want to start
adding<00:02:01.659> all-purpose<00:02:02.140> flour<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.770> potato

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
adding all-purpose flour to the potato

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.160 
adding all-purpose flour to the potato
dough<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:04.119> should<00:02:04.270> do<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:04.479> in<00:02:04.630> three<00:02:04.899> stages

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
dough you should do this in three stages

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.529 
dough you should do this in three stages
and<00:02:05.409> every<00:02:05.860> time<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.280> add<00:02:06.460> flour<00:02:06.880> just<00:02:07.270> knead

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
and every time you add flour just knead

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.089 
and every time you add flour just knead
it<00:02:07.659> for<00:02:07.689> about<00:02:07.869> two-and-a-half<00:02:08.470> minutes<00:02:09.009> or

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
it for about two-and-a-half minutes or

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.369 
it for about two-and-a-half minutes or
so<00:02:09.310> until<00:02:09.849> you<00:02:10.149> have<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.300> really<00:02:10.509> nice<00:02:10.750> smooth

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
so until you have a really nice smooth

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.350 
so until you have a really nice smooth
piece<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.830> dough<00:02:11.980> once<00:02:12.730> that's<00:02:12.970> achieved

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
piece of dough once that's achieved

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.000 
piece of dough once that's achieved
shape<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.930> into<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.140> nice<00:02:14.349> ball<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.860> then

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
shape it into a nice ball and then

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.259 
shape it into a nice ball and then
you're<00:02:15.099> going<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.250> cut<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.550> into<00:02:15.640> quarters<00:02:16.120> and

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
flavor it cuts through some of the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.360 
flavor it cuts through some of the
richness<00:05:08.750> of<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.199> knee<00:05:09.289> okey<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:10.009> texture<00:05:10.340> of

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
not gummy at all if you make a gnocchi

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.360 
not gummy at all if you make a gnocchi
just<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.110> little<00:05:15.410> bit<00:05:15.500> smaller<00:05:15.830> it<00:05:16.039> makes<00:05:16.220> it<00:05:16.310> a

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
just a little bit smaller it makes it a

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.770 
just a little bit smaller it makes it a
little<00:05:16.430> bit<00:05:16.610> easier<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:16.970> eat<00:05:17.180> it's<00:05:17.479> a<00:05:17.570> little

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
little bit easier to eat it's a little

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.420 
little bit easier to eat it's a little
bit<00:05:17.870> more<00:05:18.020> refreshing<00:05:18.380> this<00:05:19.099> is<00:05:19.220> really

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
bit more refreshing this is really

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.580 
bit more refreshing this is really
really<00:05:19.580> close<00:05:19.729> to<00:05:19.970> like<00:05:20.120> an<00:05:20.270> ideal<00:05:20.690> yoky<00:05:21.380> size

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
really close to like an ideal yoky size

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.469 
really close to like an ideal yoky size
but<00:05:22.490> next<00:05:22.669> time<00:05:22.849> I<00:05:22.880> make<00:05:23.120> it<00:05:23.150> I'll<00:05:23.330> probably

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
but next time I make it I'll probably

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.360 
but next time I make it I'll probably
get<00:05:23.720> just<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.990> little<00:05:24.440> bit<00:05:24.560> smaller<00:05:24.860> so<00:05:25.250> it's

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
get just a little bit smaller so it's

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.279 
get just a little bit smaller so it's
just<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.639> little<00:05:25.789> bit<00:05:25.880> more<00:05:25.970> refreshing<00:05:26.289> you

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
just a little bit more refreshing you

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:28.810 
just a little bit more refreshing you
get<00:05:27.410> more<00:05:27.560> sauce<00:05:27.800> and<00:05:28.070> I<00:05:28.099> like<00:05:28.220> this<00:05:28.340> stuff<00:05:28.580> but

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
get more sauce and I like this stuff but

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.640 
get more sauce and I like this stuff but
it's<00:05:29.270> killer<00:05:30.759> mmm

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
it's killer mmm

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.510
