trying on tons of different album titles

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.600 
trying on tons of different album titles
and<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.290> as<00:01:07.290> always<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:08.040> came<00:01:08.250> back<00:01:08.430> full

at my life in a really sort of critical
way<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.750> feeling<00:01:19.200> my<00:01:20.159> own<00:01:20.310> stagnancy<00:01:20.820> and

I liked the way Martha frames that idea

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.249 
I liked the way Martha frames that idea
of<00:01:30.580> if<00:01:31.210> there's<00:01:31.420> a<00:01:31.479> reason<00:01:31.930> that<00:01:32.049> we're

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
of if there's a reason that we're

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.050 
of if there's a reason that we're
dissatisfied<00:01:33.250> with<00:01:33.400> where<00:01:33.610> we<00:01:33.729> are<00:01:33.850> because

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
dissatisfied with where we are because

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.999 
dissatisfied with where we are because
we're<00:01:34.479> being<00:01:34.690> drawn<00:01:34.960> into<00:01:35.229> something<00:01:35.770> greater

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
we're being drawn into something greater

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.270 
we're being drawn into something greater
and<00:01:36.280> something<00:01:36.900> our<00:01:37.900> next<00:01:38.229> artistic<00:01:38.500> endeavor

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
and something our next artistic endeavor

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.429 
and something our next artistic endeavor
and<00:01:39.880> that<00:01:40.180> was<00:01:40.299> like<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.659> really<00:01:40.810> peaceful<00:01:41.170> way

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
and that was like a really peaceful way

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.050 
and that was like a really peaceful way
to<00:01:41.500> look<00:01:41.770> at<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.040> fact<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.430> I<00:01:42.460> was<00:01:42.670> leaving

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
of feeling like I'm I'm a figurehead of

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
and music that feels like it's

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.610 
and music that feels like it's
reflective<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.530> my<00:02:30.340> heart<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.880> then<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.810> have

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
reflective of my heart and then I have

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.500 
reflective of my heart and then I have
to<00:02:32.769> kind<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.070> let<00:02:33.370> go<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.850> rest<00:02:34.030> of<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.329> and

to kind of let go of the rest of it and
hope<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.110> lands<00:02:35.680> in<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.400> soft<00:02:36.640> place<00:02:36.910> and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
be making music I think - especially

with there's so much do-it-yourself
stuff<00:03:05.420> now<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.140> think<00:03:06.410> people<00:03:06.710> are<00:03:06.860> being<00:03:07.310> given

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430

stuff now I think people are being given
the<00:03:07.610> tools<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.210> resources<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:09.020> be

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
the tools and the resources to be

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.890 
the tools and the resources to be
especially<00:03:10.280> creative<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.970> think<00:03:11.210> it's<00:03:11.570> we're

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
especially creative I think it's we're

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.870 
especially creative I think it's we're
all<00:03:11.990> so<00:03:12.110> inundated<00:03:12.440> with<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:13.130> lot<00:03:13.520> of<00:03:13.550> music

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
right now but but I think it's really

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.110 
right now but but I think it's really
cool<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:18.500> see<00:03:18.770> people<00:03:19.280> push<00:03:19.730> boundaries

cool to to see people push boundaries

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.710

about<00:05:59.889> the<00:06:00.070> concept<00:06:00.430> of<00:06:00.520> brave<00:06:00.820> is<00:06:01.060> that<00:06:01.210> it's

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
about the concept of brave is that it's

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.390 
about the concept of brave is that it's
not<00:06:01.510> about<00:06:01.780> the<00:06:01.930> outcome<00:06:02.350> it's<00:06:02.530> about<00:06:02.770> the

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
not about the outcome it's about the

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.909 
not about the outcome it's about the
intention<00:06:03.970> of<00:06:04.150> turning<00:06:04.780> to<00:06:05.020> face<00:06:05.350> what<00:06:05.680> it<00:06:05.800> is

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
intention of turning to face what it is

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.920 
intention of turning to face what it is
that<00:06:06.130> scares<00:06:06.460> you<00:06:06.699> and<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.330> doesn't<00:06:07.630> have<00:06:07.750> to

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
that scares you and it doesn't have to

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.420 
that scares you and it doesn't have to
be<00:06:08.080> you<00:06:08.410> know<00:06:08.500> nobody<00:06:08.770> was<00:06:08.860> sharing<00:06:09.220> things

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
be you know nobody was sharing things

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.650 
be you know nobody was sharing things
like<00:06:09.610> I'm<00:06:09.790> brave<00:06:10.030> enough<00:06:10.090> to<00:06:10.300> win<00:06:10.540> the

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
like I'm brave enough to win the

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.420 
like I'm brave enough to win the
basketball<00:06:10.810> game<00:06:11.260> and<00:06:11.440> it<00:06:11.710> was<00:06:11.860> like<00:06:12.190> I'm

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
basketball game and it was like I'm

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.760 
basketball game and it was like I'm
brave<00:06:12.760> enough<00:06:13.090> to<00:06:13.360> tell<00:06:14.050> my<00:06:14.229> family<00:06:14.410> who<00:06:14.710> I

brave enough to tell my family who I

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.070 
brave enough to tell my family who I
really<00:06:14.979> am<00:06:15.310> and<00:06:15.610> those<00:06:16.180> those<00:06:16.600> kinds<00:06:16.990> of

really am and those those kinds of
moments<00:06:17.260> are<00:06:18.100> profound<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:19.300> I<00:06:19.630> felt<00:06:19.930> so

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
moments are profound and I felt so

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.940 
moments are profound and I felt so
inspired<00:06:20.590> by<00:06:20.979> my<00:06:21.460> who<00:06:21.970> who<00:06:22.870> was<00:06:23.110> sharing<00:06:23.290> and

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
inspired by my who who was sharing and

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.760 
inspired by my who who was sharing and
what<00:06:24.190> they<00:06:24.310> were<00:06:24.370> sharing<00:06:25.080> last<00:06:26.080> year<00:06:26.320> was<00:06:26.500> a

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
what they were sharing last year was a

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.800 
what they were sharing last year was a
really<00:06:27.130> hard<00:06:27.520> year<00:06:27.610> for<00:06:27.820> me<00:06:28.000> and<00:06:28.270> it<00:06:28.389> was<00:06:28.510> very

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
really hard year for me and it was very

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.980 
really hard year for me and it was very
very<00:06:31.810> introspective<00:06:32.320> and<00:06:33.540> just<00:06:34.540> looking<00:06:34.870> at

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
very introspective and just looking at

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.950 
very introspective and just looking at
my<00:06:35.110> life<00:06:35.290> and<00:06:35.620> how<00:06:35.710> I<00:06:36.430> had<00:06:36.669> created<00:06:36.910> these<00:06:37.630> sort

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
my life and how I had created these sort

my life and how I had created these sort
of<00:06:38.020> constructs<00:06:38.530> that<00:06:38.680> I<00:06:38.800> what<00:06:39.760> I<00:06:39.789> was<00:06:40.090> just

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
of constructs that I what I was just

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.620 
of constructs that I what I was just
getting<00:06:40.539> stuck<00:06:40.780> inside<00:06:40.990> of<00:06:41.350> and<00:06:41.590> in<00:06:41.919> terms<00:06:42.130> of

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
getting stuck inside of and in terms of

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.830 
getting stuck inside of and in terms of
relationships<00:06:43.630> and<00:06:43.990> my<00:06:44.639> my<00:06:45.639> location<00:06:46.120> my
