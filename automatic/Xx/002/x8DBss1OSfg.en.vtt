 black I really do understand and I go 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.740
 then use the sigma potential 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.080

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.190
 then we can join in the end were more 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.770
 because I did not do it from the beginning of 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.550
 ours and to the end always with a brush 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550
 on the horizontal 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.930
 The trick is to actually draw 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.000

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.620

 done with anyone says think only 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.110
 the easiest name because I already have say 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.360
 to do this so I'll use the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.840
 line services of water and t is that 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.840
 top 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:52.280
 the block always brings more 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.830
 We've been wanting since the last 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.959
 while we create so far we will unite with 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.959
 the brush horizontally and so 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.060
 now just fill in 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.180
 to correct if you want and you're in 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.519
 something can take a path of 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.500
 a child and components can clean 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.500
 that low and make a perfect dash 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.579

 I did not do it now to get very bad. 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.599
 because there it is practical and easy 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.519
 perfection and therefore I am sure that 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.970
 They will be able to do our own to there 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.220
