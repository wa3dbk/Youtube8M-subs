00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.490
 they say that the result of playing golf is 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.529
 depends a lot on the sword professional 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.170
 players prefer the so -called 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.300
 ball wrapped ball with rubber winding 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.730
 because he has more predictable 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.670
 flight but most people use 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.949
 the so-called two - component ball with 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.779
 rough surface modern balls 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.449
 golf has come a long way 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.930
 considering that the first ball was made from 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.650
 feathers 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.020
 and that's what's inside them now elastic 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.540
 rubber in it adding other chemical 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.020
 substances and melt turn hot 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.300
 mass 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.100
 then it is rolled out like dough and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.969
 cool between two huge 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.489
 steel drums further twisted 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.100
 rubber sheets are placed in such a machine 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.079
 which is called extruder piston 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.140
 inwards and pushes the rubber through 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.530
 the result is a blank 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.480
 similar to a large soufflÃ© 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.080
 on the conveyor belt they fall on 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.510
 molding press worker lays out 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.760
 their steel molds billets 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.330
 There are different colors depending on 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330
 kind of sword 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.400
 when the door closes the top 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.880
 the press closes with the bottom under pressure 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880
 groan well 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.960
 blanks acquires a new shape and 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.380
 baked at a temperature of one hundred and sixty 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:35.550
 seven degrees celsius after 30 minutes 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.550
 heat treated rubber hardens 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.120
 after cooling water worker covers 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.690
 blanks patterns from org glass she 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:51.520
 separates and retains residual chips 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.960
 when vacuuming swords extra 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.960
 rubber sent for recycling 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.500
 now like a jelly billet 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.290
 turned into a solid base for swords 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.250
 the robot moves these basics 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.560
 in another press the piston pushes 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.980
 molten post mass through the tubes in 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.750
 stencil cavity is so formed 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.940
 outer shell of the sword including holes 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.940
 which will increase his speed 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:32.330
 This is what the ball looks like in a new shell 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:34.610
 from within similar injection systems 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.470
 formations produce four dozen 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.120
 golf balls per minute 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.030
 look at the new sword and go 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.460
 then they roll into the basket and 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.370
 from there to the lift following to point 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.010
 cleaning 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.620
 you will see residuals on the sword shell 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.270
 nodules of plastic 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.920
 the next process will help get rid of 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:13.010
 them this automatic milling machine 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:14.330
 remove the extra layer of mass that's the ball that 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.460
 milling 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.750
 But after when they took him off 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.750
 plastic husk 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.800
 Further, the machine directs the ball from the discharge 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.959
 gutter 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.330
 quality control is carried out here 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.920
 if the ball is not smooth enough 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.020
 correct it gets stuck in the hole 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.370
 now the wheel directs the ball and into the stigma 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.510
 powerful machine automatic put silicone on 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.870
 corroding steel plate 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.709
 silicone absorbs paint and transfers it 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.709
 on swords 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.800
 the machine puts every ball 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:00.680
 player number company name and 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:03.310
 the model view then the ink dries under 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.310
 UV light 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.860
 swords fall into the basket where they come from 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:17.739
 sent to another dairy glue 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.709
 machine that applies logos to order 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.980
 now the acceptance stamp 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:28.370
 Dali machine sprays swords 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:39.590
 polyurethane rotating them on axis polyurethane 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:42.500
 protects the paint logos machine 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.080
 transfers wet swords to drying frame 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.940
 where they stay for 5 minutes at 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.520
 temperature 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.520
 66 degrees Celsius now they are ready 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:00.040
 It is a pity that they are not attached to the guarantee 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.040
 what you hit the mark
