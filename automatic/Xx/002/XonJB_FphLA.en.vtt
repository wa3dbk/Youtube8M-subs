demonstrate this now what I have on
right<00:00:22.680> now<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.220> at<00:00:23.430> Canon<00:00:23.789> 17<00:00:24.269> 240

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
right now is this at Canon 17 240

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.009 
right now is this at Canon 17 240
millimeter<00:00:25.680> lens<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> lens<00:00:27.869> hood

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
millimeter lens and I have the lens hood

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.400 
millimeter lens and I have the lens hood
for<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.369> 24<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.580> 105<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.289> just

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
for the 24 to 105 on it and this is just

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.530 
for the 24 to 105 on it and this is just
to<00:00:31.679> demonstrate<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.189> lens<00:00:32.850> hoods<00:00:33.120> are<00:00:33.300> not

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to demonstrate that lens hoods are not

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.650 
to demonstrate that lens hoods are not
interchangeable<00:00:33.960> unless<00:00:34.770> specifically

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
interchangeable unless specifically

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.990 
interchangeable unless specifically
mentioned<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.559> lens<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.579> now<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
mentioned so this lens right now on the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.119 
mentioned so this lens right now on the
camera<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> little<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.780> wider<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
camera is a little bit wider and you

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.030 
camera is a little bit wider and you
have<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> lens<00:00:41.640> hood<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.469> you<00:00:43.469> know<00:00:43.590> normal

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
have the lens hood of a you know normal

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.760 
have the lens hood of a you know normal
focal<00:00:44.370> lengths<00:00:44.610> camera<00:00:45.320> normal<00:00:46.320> focal<00:00:46.620> length

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
focal lengths camera normal focal length

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.340 
focal lengths camera normal focal length
lens<00:00:47.100> now<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.489> don't<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.270> any<00:00:48.570> type

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
lens now you don't really see any type

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.180 
lens now you don't really see any type
of<00:00:49.379> vignette<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:51.289> effect<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> lens<00:00:52.980> hood

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
of vignette or effect that the lens hood

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.479 
of vignette or effect that the lens hood
has<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.840> zoomed<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.469> around<00:00:55.980> 40

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
has at you know zoomed in at around 40

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.849 
has at you know zoomed in at around 40
millimeters<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.210> once<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.050> zoom<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
millimeters but once you zoom out you

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.470 
millimeters but once you zoom out you
can<00:00:59.039> kind<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> edges<00:01:00.300> are<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
can kind of see that the edges are a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.830 
can kind of see that the edges are a
little<00:01:00.539> bit<00:01:00.840> dark<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.840> along

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
little bit dark you can see it along

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.250 
little bit dark you can see it along
here<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.580> along<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.960> some<00:01:07.140> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
here and along here and you know some of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810 
here and along here and you know some of
you<00:01:07.380> might<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:07.770> think<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
you might not think that that's a

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.109 
you might not think that that's a
problem<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.650> watch<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.100> stop<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:13.439> aperture

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
problem but watch as I stop the aperture

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.920 
problem but watch as I stop the aperture
all<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.420> way<00:01:15.540> down<00:01:17.210> not<00:01:18.210> too<00:01:18.420> much<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.659> can

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
all the way down not too much you can

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.840 
all the way down not too much you can
see<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.070> now<00:01:20.250> actually<00:01:20.520> see

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
see that the you can now actually see

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.910 
see that the you can now actually see
the<00:01:21.810> lens<00:01:22.020> hood<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.680> bit<00:01:22.770> more

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the lens hood it's a little bit more

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
the lens hood it's a little bit more
solid<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.670> depth<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.000> field<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
solid because the depth of field is a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.550 
solid because the depth of field is a
lot<00:01:25.200> deeper<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> kind<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.259> effect

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
lot deeper so that's the kind of effect

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.590 
lot deeper so that's the kind of effect
that<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.799> get<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.220> don't<00:01:29.400> use<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.390> proper

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that you get if you don't use the proper

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.990 
that you get if you don't use the proper
lens<00:01:30.930> hood<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> intended<00:01:32.790> lens

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
lens hood for you know the intended lens

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.319 
lens hood for you know the intended lens
that<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> sort<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:35.329> you

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that it's for you get the sort of you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
that it's for you get the sort of you
can<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> lens<00:01:36.990> head<00:01:37.200> basically<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.979> this

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
can see the lens head basically and this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.399 
can see the lens head basically and this
is<00:01:39.090> even<00:01:39.329> more<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.930> when<00:01:40.110> you're<00:01:40.229> using

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
is even more so when you're using

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.359 
is even more so when you're using
something<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.220> 24<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.799> 70<00:01:43.799> millimeter

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
something like the 24 to 70 millimeter

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.139 
something like the 24 to 70 millimeter
lens<00:01:44.700> hood<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:46.009> 24<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.100> 105<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> lot

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
lens hood on the 24 to 105 because a lot

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.359 
lens hood on the 24 to 105 because a lot
of<00:01:48.240> people<00:01:48.509> seem<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.780> want<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.259> use<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.799> 24<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
of people seem to want to use the 24 to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330 
of people seem to want to use the 24 to
70<00:01:50.670> lens<00:01:50.909> hood<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> 24<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> 105<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.220> is

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
70 lens hood on the 24 to 105 but it is

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.539 
70 lens hood on the 24 to 105 but it is
incredibly<00:01:53.909> huge<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.009> doesn't<00:01:56.310> it

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
incredibly huge and it just doesn't it

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.149 
incredibly huge and it just doesn't it
just<00:01:56.700> doesn't<00:01:56.820> work<00:01:57.619> another<00:01:58.619> reason<00:01:59.040> is

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
just doesn't work another reason is

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.050 
just doesn't work another reason is
because<00:01:59.189> the<00:02:00.060> 24<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> 70<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.700> lens<00:02:02.909> head

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
because the 24 to 70 the lens head

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.859 
because the 24 to 70 the lens head
attaches<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.270> covers<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
attaches here and so it like covers the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.869 
attaches here and so it like covers the
barrel<00:02:07.170> too<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.099> zoom<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.459> or<00:02:08.580> zoom<00:02:08.610> out

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
barrel too as you zoom in or zoom out

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.080 
barrel too as you zoom in or zoom out
while<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> 24<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.560> 70<00:02:10.979> with<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> 24<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> 105

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
while with the 24 to 70 with a 24 to 105

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.610 
while with the 24 to 70 with a 24 to 105
you<00:02:12.239> attach<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:12.930> imagine<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you attach here so imagine the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.089 
you attach here so imagine the
for<00:02:13.920> 270<00:02:14.400> millimeter<00:02:15.000> lens<00:02:15.239> just<00:02:15.390> like

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
for 270 millimeter lens just like

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.170 
for 270 millimeter lens just like
protruding<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.250> much<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.819> when<00:02:17.940> you're<00:02:18.060> at

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
protruding that much and when you're at

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.180 
protruding that much and when you're at
the<00:02:18.330> widest<00:02:18.720> angle<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.680> are<00:02:19.709> definitely

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
the widest angle you are definitely

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.539 
the widest angle you are definitely
going<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.790> see<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.209> lens<00:02:21.510> hood<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.430> is

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
going to see that lens hood so this is

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:24.740 
going to see that lens hood so this is
just<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.819> quick<00:02:23.970> video<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.360> answer<00:02:24.510> that

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
just a quick video to answer that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.899 
just a quick video to answer that
question<00:02:24.930> lens<00:02:25.830> hoods<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.430> know<00:02:26.519> typically

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
question lens hoods you know typically

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.220 
question lens hoods you know typically
typically<00:02:27.599> they're<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:27.810> interchangeable

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
typically they're not interchangeable

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.979 
typically they're not interchangeable
unless<00:02:28.920> mentioned<00:02:29.480> there<00:02:30.480> are<00:02:30.510> some<00:02:30.629> cases

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
unless mentioned there are some cases

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.240 
unless mentioned there are some cases
where<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.379> actually<00:02:31.739> can<00:02:32.040> use<00:02:34.040> lens<00:02:35.040> hoods

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
where you actually can use lens hoods

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.180 
where you actually can use lens hoods
that<00:02:35.370> aren't<00:02:35.730> intended<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.690> for<00:02:37.530> example<00:02:37.950> with

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
that aren't intended so for example with

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.819 
that aren't intended so for example with
this<00:02:38.370> lens<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:39.599> 24<00:02:40.049> to<00:02:40.140> 105<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.680> can

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
this lens the 24 to 105 you can

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.789 
this lens the 24 to 105 you can
definitely<00:02:41.010> use<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.819> 24<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.930> 17<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.500> 40

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
definitely use the 24 the 17 to 40

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.860 
definitely use the 24 the 17 to 40
lenses<00:02:44.129> on<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.280> because<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:44.849> for<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.329> wide

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
lenses on it because it's for a wide

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.690 
lenses on it because it's for a wide
angle<00:02:46.019> but<00:02:46.379> then<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.980> know<00:02:47.160> kind<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.459> takes

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
angle but then it you know kind of takes

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.869 
angle but then it you know kind of takes
away<00:02:47.790> from<00:02:48.379> the<00:02:49.379> lens<00:02:49.620> hood<00:02:49.769> doing<00:02:50.579> what<00:02:50.730> it's

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
away from the lens hood doing what it's

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.059 
away from the lens hood doing what it's
supposed<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.239> do<00:02:51.390> which<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.660> reduce<00:02:51.989> flare<00:02:52.319> all

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
supposed to do which is reduce flare all

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.520 
supposed to do which is reduce flare all
lens<00:02:53.519> hoods<00:02:53.819> are<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.510> know<00:02:54.599> made<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.840> optimize

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
lens hoods are you know made to optimize

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.460 
lens hoods are you know made to optimize
a<00:02:56.000> flare<00:02:57.000> reduction<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:57.989> it's<00:02:58.170> best<00:02:58.409> to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
a flare reduction and so it's best to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.890 
a flare reduction and so it's best to
use<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.250> lens<00:02:59.459> hood<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.849> was<00:03:00.090> intended<00:03:00.750> for

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
use the lens hood that was intended for

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.990 
use the lens hood that was intended for
that<00:03:01.049> specific<00:03:01.530> lens<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.670> that's<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:02.970> guys

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
that specific lens so that's it guys

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.539 
that specific lens so that's it guys
that<00:03:03.329> was<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.629> quick<00:03:03.750> video<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.379> hoped<00:03:05.340> it

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
that was just a quick video I hoped it

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.970 
that was just a quick video I hoped it
helped<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.120> answered<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:07.109> question<00:03:07.379> I'm

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
helped and answered that question I'm
