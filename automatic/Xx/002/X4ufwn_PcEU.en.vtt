response to a subscribers request to see
the<00:00:22.560> poor<00:00:22.980> push<00:00:23.250> doing<00:00:23.640> technique<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.810> in

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the poor push doing technique but in

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.950 
the poor push doing technique but in
slow<00:00:25.440> motion<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.060> order<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.750> see

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
slow motion so in order for you to see

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.450 
slow motion so in order for you to see
what<00:00:28.200> is<00:00:28.320> happening<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:28.860> slowed<00:00:29.280> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
what is happening I have slowed the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.600 
what is happening I have slowed the
video<00:00:29.760> down<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.420> will<00:00:31.140> talk<00:00:31.440> you<00:00:31.650> through<00:00:31.860> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
video down and will talk you through the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.630 
video down and will talk you through the
technique<00:00:33.860> firstly<00:00:34.860> let's<00:00:35.070> see<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:35.340> steering

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
technique firstly let's see the steering

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.770 
technique firstly let's see the steering
at<00:00:35.880> four<00:00:36.180> speed

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
at four speed

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.660 
at four speed
that's<00:00:37.230> steering<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> left<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> now<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that's steering to the left and now to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.700 
that's steering to the left and now to
the<00:00:41.970> right<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.340> now<00:00:44.580> in<00:00:44.730> slow<00:00:45.000> motion<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:46.080> steer

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the right so now in slow motion to steer

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.370 
the right so now in slow motion to steer
left<00:00:46.980> our<00:00:47.850> left<00:00:48.180> hand<00:00:48.480> goes<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> top<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
left our left hand goes to the top of

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.200 
left our left hand goes to the top of
the<00:00:49.470> steering<00:00:49.680> wheel<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> pulls<00:00:50.520> down<00:00:50.880> our

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the steering wheel and pulls down our

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.050 
the steering wheel and pulls down our
right<00:00:51.750> hand<00:00:52.050> slides<00:00:52.470> then<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:53.790> hand

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
right hand slides then the right hand

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.110 
right hand slides then the right hand
pushes<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.290> left<00:00:55.500> hand<00:00:55.739> slides<00:00:56.160> left

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
pushes up and the left hand slides left

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.350 
pushes up and the left hand slides left
hand<00:00:57.420> pulls<00:00:57.750> down<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:59.010> hand<00:00:59.280> pushes<00:00:59.820> up<00:01:02.360> so

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
hand pulls down right hand pushes up so

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.350 
hand pulls down right hand pushes up so
at<00:01:03.600> any<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:03.989> time<00:01:04.369> only<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.670> hand<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.210> doing

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
at any one time only one hand is doing

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.590 
at any one time only one hand is doing
the<00:01:06.570> work<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.110> other<00:01:07.259> is<00:01:07.500> simply<00:01:07.710> sliding<00:01:08.600> now

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the work the other is simply sliding now

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
the work the other is simply sliding now
we<00:01:09.660> will<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.080> at<00:01:10.340> steering<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> right

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
we will look at steering to the right

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.050 
we will look at steering to the right
and<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:13.590> right<00:01:13.830> hand<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.340> go<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.790> top

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and the right hand will go to the top

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.550 
and the right hand will go to the top
and<00:01:15.619> pull<00:01:16.619> down<00:01:20.299> my<00:01:21.299> left<00:01:21.600> hand<00:01:21.870> will<00:01:22.110> simply

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and pull down my left hand will simply

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920 
and pull down my left hand will simply
slide<00:01:22.799> down<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.460> bottom<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.060> then<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
slide down to the bottom and then the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.469 
slide down to the bottom and then the
left<00:01:25.140> hand<00:01:25.229> will<00:01:25.590> push<00:01:25.920> back<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.270> right

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
left hand will push back up as the right

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.640 
left hand will push back up as the right
hand<00:01:27.780> slides<00:01:28.490> right<00:01:29.490> hand<00:01:29.820> pulls<00:01:30.150> down<00:01:30.650> left

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
hand slides right hand pulls down left

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.180 
hand slides right hand pulls down left
hand<00:01:31.830> pushes<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.590> then<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.830> back<00:01:34.979> to

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
hand pushes up and then we are back to

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.480 
hand pushes up and then we are back to
straight<00:01:35.700> wheels<00:01:35.940> again<00:01:36.950> well<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:37.979> hope<00:01:38.280> that's

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
straight wheels again well I hope that's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.609 
straight wheels again well I hope that's
been<00:01:38.820> easier<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.540> understand<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.320> time

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
been easier to understand this time

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.370 
been easier to understand this time
around<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.390> hopefully<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.690> video<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:43.020> be

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
around and hopefully the video will be

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.540 
around and hopefully the video will be
of<00:01:43.470> use<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.830> you<00:01:43.950> all<00:01:44.100> thanks<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.210> watching
