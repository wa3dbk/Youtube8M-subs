the box again really minimalistic could
have<00:02:19.330> been<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> little<00:02:19.720> thinner<00:02:19.930> because<00:02:20.140> there

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
have been a little thinner because there

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.960 
have been a little thinner because there
is<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> good<00:02:20.800> amount<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:21.069> wasted<00:02:21.370> space<00:02:21.430> here<00:02:21.879> if

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
is a good amount of wasted space here if

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.690 
is a good amount of wasted space here if
you<00:02:22.030> take<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.239> look<00:02:22.560> all<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:23.920> right<00:02:24.190> here<00:02:24.459> it's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
you take a look all this right here it's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.400 
you take a look all this right here it's
kind<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.420> empty<00:02:25.720> space<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.019> it<00:02:26.290> could

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
kind of just empty space so it could

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.440 
kind of just empty space so it could
have<00:02:26.530> been<00:02:26.620> thinner<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.819> direction<00:02:28.120> but

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450
