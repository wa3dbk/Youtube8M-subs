00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
get around all the edges like so and it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.529 
get around all the edges like so and it
will<00:00:58.829> start<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> look<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.390> can't

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
will start to look like that you can't

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.340 
will start to look like that you can't
see<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.500> mesh<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.070> actually<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.690> almost

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
see the mesh is actually on there almost

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.399 
see the mesh is actually on there almost
clear<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.729> then<00:01:05.909> what<00:01:06.150> you're<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.600> is

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
clear so then what you're going to do is

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.859 
clear so then what you're going to do is
take<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.200> take<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.869> pop

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
take it and you have it take it and pop

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.620 
take it and you have it take it and pop
or<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.490> this<00:01:17.490> will<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.180> it'll<00:01:18.360> pull<00:01:18.600> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
or on this will do is it'll pull it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
or on this will do is it'll pull it
tight<00:01:20.030> oops<00:01:21.619> hard<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
tight oops hard to do here with the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.670 
tight oops hard to do here with the
camera<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.259> then<00:01:25.259> you're<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.619> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
camera and then you're going to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.609 
camera and then you're going to
basically<00:01:26.580> take<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> screws<00:01:27.500> you're<00:01:28.500> going

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
basically take the screws you're going

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.039 
basically take the screws you're going
to<00:01:28.710> slowly<00:01:28.939> screw<00:01:29.939> them<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> screws

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
to slowly screw them in what the screws

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.480 
to slowly screw them in what the screws
will<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.320> basically<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.860> it'll<00:01:32.070> help<00:01:32.189> tighten

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
will do basically is it'll help tighten

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.600 
will do basically is it'll help tighten
them<00:01:32.759> down<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.350> material<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:35.280> become

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
them down and the material we become

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.069 
them down and the material we become
super<00:01:35.939> tight<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:37.079> second<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.659> i'll<00:01:39.659> try

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
super tight just one second and i'll try

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.490 
super tight just one second and i'll try
and<00:01:40.320> show<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.740> for<00:01:41.009> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:02:09.370 

so<00:01:47.500> basically<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.070> got<00:01:48.189> your<00:01:48.340> screw

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.059 

just<00:02:10.380> like<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.360> see<00:02:12.569> basically<00:02:13.380> you

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
just like so you can see basically you

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.650 
just like so you can see basically you
don't<00:02:14.250> even<00:02:14.340> need<00:02:14.580> glue<00:02:14.910> for<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.270> one<00:02:15.480> all

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
don't even need glue for this one all

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.490 
don't even need glue for this one all
you're<00:02:15.959> doing<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.319> using<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.220> lip<00:02:17.489> on<00:02:18.500> pull

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
you're doing is using the lip on pull

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.309 
you're doing is using the lip on pull
start<00:02:19.860> as<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:23.090> thing<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.209> hold<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.810> squishes

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
start as a thing to hold it it squishes

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.840 
start as a thing to hold it it squishes
and<00:02:25.500> matting<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> netting<00:02:26.340> doesn't<00:02:26.760> move

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
and matting and the netting doesn't move

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.690 
and matting and the netting doesn't move
around<00:02:27.140> as<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.410> see<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.769> fully<00:02:29.160> covers

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
around as you can see it fully covers

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.070 
around as you can see it fully covers
the<00:02:29.940> fins<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.209> basically<00:02:33.390> goes<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
the fins and just basically goes the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.870 
the fins and just basically goes the
pull<00:02:34.290> start<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.610> still

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
pull start like that so you can still

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.210 
pull start like that so you can still
call<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:37.130> doesn't<00:02:38.130> interrupt<00:02:38.489> with<00:02:38.819> anything

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
call it doesn't interrupt with anything

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.680 
call it doesn't interrupt with anything
