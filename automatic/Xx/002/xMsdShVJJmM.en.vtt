titas<00:01:38.540> now<00:01:38.690> approaching<00:01:39.320> her<00:01:39.410> but<00:01:39.560> yeah<00:01:39.740> they

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
titas now approaching her but yeah they

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.640 
titas now approaching her but yeah they
should<00:01:40.040> have<00:01:40.130> done<00:01:40.160> that<00:01:40.430> it's<00:01:40.910> it's<00:01:41.240> okay<00:01:41.650> it

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
should have done that it's it's okay it

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.680 
should have done that it's it's okay it
doesn't<00:01:42.980> bother<00:01:43.070> me<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.370> much<00:01:43.550> but<00:01:44.150> I<00:01:44.210> think

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
doesn't bother me that much but I think

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.470 
doesn't bother me that much but I think
it<00:01:44.810> would<00:01:44.960> have<00:01:45.080> overall<00:01:45.790> it<00:01:46.790> would<00:01:47.180> it

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
it would have overall it would it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.630 
it would have overall it would it
probably<00:01:47.900> it<00:01:48.350> adjusts<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.100> message<00:01:49.460> to

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
probably it adjusts that message to

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.760 
probably it adjusts that message to
Thetis<00:01:49.970> at<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.270> end<00:01:50.390> for<00:01:50.480> whatever<00:01:50.810> reason<00:01:51.140> it

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
Thetis at the end for whatever reason it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.110
