you should be able to see this very

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.499 
you should be able to see this very
clearly<00:01:29.939> when<00:01:30.869> i<00:01:30.930> start<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.320> platter<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:33.360> can

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
clearly when i start the platter you can

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.810 
clearly when i start the platter you can
see<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.960> zero<00:01:34.229> dot<00:01:34.500> appears<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> be

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
see that the zero dot appears not to be

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.660 
see that the zero dot appears not to be
moving<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:37.500> speed<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.979> I'm<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> try

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
moving if I speed it up I'm going to try

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.710 
moving if I speed it up I'm going to try
and<00:01:38.729> make<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> second<00:01:39.390> row<00:01:39.509> or

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and make the second row or

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.690 
and make the second row or
three-point-three<00:01:40.530> percent<00:01:40.560> stop<00:01:43.490> now<00:01:44.490> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
three-point-three percent stop now that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.100 
three-point-three percent stop now that
three-point-three<00:01:45.240> percent<00:01:45.299> pitch<00:01:45.720> increase

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
three-point-three percent pitch increase

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.310 
three-point-three percent pitch increase
now<00:01:46.500> i'm<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> move<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.159> six<00:01:47.369> percent

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.620 

now<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:54.950> can<00:01:55.159> see<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.490> top<00:01:55.670> row<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:55.940> nearly

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
now you can see the top row is nearly

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.140 
now you can see the top row is nearly
stopped<00:01:57.050> moving<00:01:57.409> there<00:01:57.650> we<00:01:57.800> go<00:01:57.950> now<00:01:58.880> I'm<00:01:59.000> going

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
stopped moving there we go now I'm going

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.130 
stopped moving there we go now I'm going
to<00:01:59.210> slow<00:01:59.330> it<00:01:59.450> down<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.720> three<00:01:59.750> point<00:02:00.080> three

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
to slow it down to three point three

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.719 
to slow it down to three point three
negative<00:02:00.680> pitch<00:02:00.860> adjustment<00:02:03.400> now<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.490> bottom

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
negative pitch adjustment now the bottom

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.930 
negative pitch adjustment now the bottom
row<00:02:05.000> is<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.330> nearly<00:02:05.630> complete<00:02:06.050> stop<00:02:06.700> DJ's<00:02:07.700> use

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
row is it nearly complete stop DJ's use

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.999 
row is it nearly complete stop DJ's use
this<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:08.600> they<00:02:08.720> can<00:02:08.840> get<00:02:08.959> an<00:02:09.050> idea<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.440> how<00:02:09.679> fast

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
this so they can get an idea of how fast

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.620 
this so they can get an idea of how fast
or<00:02:10.190> how<00:02:10.250> slow<00:02:10.369> they're<00:02:11.030> adjusting<00:02:11.510> their

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
or how slow they're adjusting their

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.660 
or how slow they're adjusting their
records<00:02:11.930> if<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.920> choose<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.280> DJ<00:02:13.520> with

records if you choose to DJ with
turntables<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.300> should<00:02:14.480> know<00:02:14.600> that<00:02:14.630> there

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
turntables you should know that there

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.720 
turntables you should know that there
