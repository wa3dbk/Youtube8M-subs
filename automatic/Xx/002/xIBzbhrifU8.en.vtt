00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.250
 Hi guys , how are you? 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.480
 in this video we'll see how 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.150
 customize this top you will need 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.330
 a T-shirt preferably not much 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.460
 long be fair middle first thing 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.710
 What are we going to do is cut with a 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.480
 pair of scissors the sleeves and angola 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.670
 [Music] 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.500
 So here I cut and how you 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.270
 can see does not come with a finish 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.010
 very cool, so we have to give 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.440
 one stretched 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.879
 there it finishes better not 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.879
 the defects appear 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.480
 so once I've finished that part 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.539
 from above I'm going to the bottom 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.579
 you decide how short you want the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.149
 Your top, I'm doing more or less here. 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.850
 eight fingers down to angola 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.659
 I'll do is start cutting those 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.330
 a thicker cleaning of more or less a finger 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.229
 it is neither too thin nor too thick 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.750
 more or less the width here and I'm going 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.159
 cut these boxes across the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.990
 extension 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:25.040
 here around the brand of the brand 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.420
 I made it down 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.150
 then independently cut here 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.409
 I clean the front and I'll cut 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.409
 also in the back 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.040
 I will make here the same process has not 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.289
 problem if your cut does not 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.430
 perfect because when you stretch 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.350
 these imperfections they will disappear 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.840
 so I finished cutting the shorts 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.720
 round the whole shirt and what I 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.030
 I'll do this khan one by one. 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.679
 she's got very tight, she's going to stay 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.320
 with a better finish than they 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:06.220
 these effects appear 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:14.860
 so I 'll stretch and I'll make a knot 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:18.910
 well on account and let's cut the whistle 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.860
 here I've done it all here if you 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.230
 you want to stop here your top is already 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.230
 well cool this way but if you want 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.080
 and the next stage here what we people 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.390
 will take two and two of these 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.390
 parties and make a knot 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.420
 this way we'll get two in 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.840
 two in making a knot around the whole 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.840
 grow up 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.280
 So I've done all around the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.560
 shirt and again I say if you 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.739
 You want to stop here, it's already okay. 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.569
 cool this touch already worked more 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.510
 I wanted to make the next stage 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:02.640
 that will be where you pick up a 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.060
 each side of this node and makes another name 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.060
 thus 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.810
 and then you keep doing the same thing 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.500
 take one on each side of the name and make a 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.500
 another is not 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.630
 and then you will do it around 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.290
 the whole shirt and will stay with 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.810
 appearance so then that is the result 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.240
 of our personal top 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.710
 a good tip is to go to the summer then it's 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.640
 This is what I hope you have. 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.080
 liked 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.820
 If you liked, do not forget summer. 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.400
 young people in this video and signed up 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.360
 dance in the square of saudade and I see 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:55.649
 You guys in the next video kiss 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:55.649
