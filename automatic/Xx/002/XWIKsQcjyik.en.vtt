00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
piston straight out you know once you

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.020 
piston straight out you know once you
get<00:02:16.110> all<00:02:16.170> out<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.440> way<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.690> change<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.900> out

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
get all out of the way and change it out

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.590 
this plastic housing this is just a
trailer<00:02:48.540> metal<00:02:48.840> plate<00:02:53.420> there's<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.510> a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
trailer metal plate there's like a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.080 
trailer metal plate there's like a
filter<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.110> here<00:02:55.430> screen<00:02:56.430> filter<00:02:56.910> with

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
filter in here screen filter with

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.830 
filter in here screen filter with
o-rings<00:02:57.239> on<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.989> think<00:02:58.709> there's<00:02:58.860> any<00:02:59.010> actual

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
o-rings on it I think there's any actual

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.150 
o-rings on it I think there's any actual
pressurized<00:03:00.840> water<00:03:01.019> on<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.620> plate<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
pressurized water on this plate in the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.569 
pressurized water on this plate in the
seal<00:03:03.920> it's<00:03:04.920> all<00:03:05.910> written<00:03:06.150> down<00:03:07.430> but<00:03:08.430> that's

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
seal it's all written down but that's

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.699 
seal it's all written down but that's
the<00:03:08.820> arse<00:03:08.940> filter<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.840> comes<00:03:10.019> in<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.230> kit<00:03:10.470> you

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
the arse filter it comes in the kit you

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.729 
the arse filter it comes in the kit you
just<00:03:11.430> pop<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:11.970> there<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.620> then<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.920> got

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
just pop it in there and then you got

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.229 
just pop it in there and then you got
just<00:03:16.739> plastic<00:03:17.370> one<00:03:17.579> right<00:03:17.730> here<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.000> change

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
just plastic one right here you change

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.940 
just plastic one right here you change
out<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.950> then<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.430> course<00:03:21.860> it's

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
out and then of course it's

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.009 
out and then of course it's
see<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:23.310> piston<00:03:23.760> rod<00:03:23.970> sticking<00:03:24.510> out<00:03:24.810> there<00:03:27.019> to

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
see the piston rod sticking out there to

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.290 
see the piston rod sticking out there to
get<00:03:28.140> seed<00:03:28.440> her<00:03:31.040> no-hit<00:03:32.040> piston<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.879> hooks<00:03:33.150> into

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
get seed her no-hit piston it hooks into

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.550 
get seed her no-hit piston it hooks into
there<00:03:34.790> that's<00:03:35.790> how<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.090> changes<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.810> flow<00:03:37.260> for

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
there that's how it changes the flow for

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.449 
there that's how it changes the flow for
the<00:03:40.250> regeneration<00:03:41.250> all<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:43.220> that's<00:03:44.220> all

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the regeneration all that that's all

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.009 
the regeneration all that that's all
there<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:45.000> just<00:03:45.269> pop<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.660> bitch<00:03:45.840> back<00:03:46.080> on

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
there is to just pop the bitch back on

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.270 
there is to just pop the bitch back on
listen<00:03:49.019> Jen<00:03:49.230> one<00:03:49.410> hand<00:03:49.650> that's<00:03:49.799> how<00:03:49.920> easy<00:03:49.950> it

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
listen Jen one hand that's how easy it

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.440 
listen Jen one hand that's how easy it
is<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:54.019> then<00:03:55.019> it's<00:03:55.170> all<00:03:55.319> done<00:03:56.239> make<00:03:57.239> sure<00:03:57.269> you
