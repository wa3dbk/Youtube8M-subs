00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello welcome to the worldclub we are 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.290
 isabell and if and when belchen 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.910
 and we make cake pops today though 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.910
 not any cake pops but 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.500
 Everything you need for it you will find 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.080
 as always below in the description and 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.590
 we just go ahead we have like 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.320
 always as a base a cake of it rather 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.949
 funny you can of course everyone 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.599
 I want to and will jam here 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.590
 or the w you can lose weight with 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.590
 to go the time 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.079
 Meanwhile, if ever our 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.030
 coconut flakes later this double 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.559
 Become blue with color 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.520
 dye 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:54.559
 Let's go easy on the color reserves 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:59.730
 in coconut flakes and nice by amounts 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:03.030
 then everything turns blue is exactly 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.170
 us both me and he neth all day 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.110
 vy for the oil to spread and it 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.950
 afterwards everything used in color is or 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:24.350
 everything with de mediated will say 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:29.450
 It's going to be okay 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.450
 again a test if I can be happy 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:40.100
 but so I am always taking me now 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.100
 a little something laid away 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.280
 only very briefly this often enough 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.250
 let's go now you can still 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.990
 neatly sticking all the time 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.520
 So the whole color should be distributed 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.490
 go on and on the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:03.969
 Dream Monster you need neat 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.739
 knead it is supple and then so 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:13.260
 small round ones 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:13.260
 maybe so little fingernail profile 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.819
 the crumb monster you once biscuits in the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.640
 Monday we have our ball is only 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.470
 miss a small mouth and attacks 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.599
 to the knife 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:35.700
 take me such a ball and do it that way 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.700
 a little 03 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:53.030
 Here comes a hip hops now 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:57.310
 still the quiet around and I have 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.310
 already says with the overture in berlin 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.880
 so before starting to overdraw 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.950
 I have to wait a bit to do that 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.580
 bitter couverture must set 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.250
 and this whole prevents me from the 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.630
 That's why the stem later falls 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.980
 You have to be unusual at that time 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.900
 that hour is just fine 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.000
 only those who are very short 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.040
 exchanged because if now ours 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.380
 have jobs in Cupertino 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.380
 I might have the justice 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.020
 as usual with cake pops easy 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.209
 immerse and then peel off 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.209
 Shake off the chocolate 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.540
 we have to be careful that here where 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.459
 the mouth is no coconut flakes when 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.269
 So I have to come right 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.269
 come 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.370
 I already wear a doll 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.370
 get there 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.410
 that is an intermediate step 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.790
 Of course, it is missing again 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:48.280
 is the decision and once the 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:48.280
 eyes and the biscuit and the fast 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.300
 I'll do those fast now 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.010
 pupil of my eyes and for that 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.010
 I just take the pollutants 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.280
 then makes the small field and 1 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.140
 now only the most important thing is missing 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.860
 the cookie also sticks with it again 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:05.130
 humor on again just such a german 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:08.720
 plays too survived then so here 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.720
 a little bit of the biscuit 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:18.710
 may be that we where a bit 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.710
 hold tight 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.259
 ready are our krÃ¼melmonster're 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.940
 had become pretty cute 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:42.370
 exactly I hope you had fun with 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.430
 video tries it out 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.800
 what does it really just a pity 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.330
 also the other videos and we see 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.750
 nothing to see us until next time 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.750
 for her
