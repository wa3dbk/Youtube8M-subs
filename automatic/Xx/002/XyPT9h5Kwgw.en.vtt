00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.110
 Hello and welcome to another small Videoform Oberried Uche 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.830
 Today's onboard safety is the most eagerly awaited smartphone 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.189
 with the Samsung Galaxy ACE 2 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.189
 the packaging comes in a subtle black 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.900
 around the risks of others all imprints here 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:21.640
 that's fine 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.550
 he knows the sunlight will then be, so to speak, mirror sunlight 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.649
 Excessive 000 windows seen it rained 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.259
 on the back the technical details to 16 gigabytes of permanent storage 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.760
 Of course, super-amoled display with Android powered by w-lan 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.460
 Receiver Bgm 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.290
 contec-x even in HD play the designation GTI in 9100 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.590
 Dual Core processor with 1 2 0 2 the first one with currently the fastest 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.780
 Mobile phone from the factory 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.380
 8 megapixel camera with 2 megapixel front camera and lapa and autofocus and 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.660
 such more 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.550
 can record videos in full HD with 1080p 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.280
 goes with several code that means of course is the CD 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.070
 play 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.970
 Minute US 3 0 I love it built-in receiver transmits multimedia data 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.720
 via DLNA to the home stereo and and colorful has a 1650 billion 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.620
 the AKU 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.750
 and thus also one 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.390
 the most powerful good that we currently have available 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.570
 in the packaging you will find here 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.180
 the rescued offender 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.700
 of course the device itself 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.509
 with the balls unavoidable reconnaissance here 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.100
 the device is relatively large of the small telephone box and 225 millimeters 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.300
 long 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.200
 about from 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.920
 66 millimeters wide but an incredible 8 point 5 millimeters thin 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.150
 it exists 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.700
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, I would like to say from the clientele is so 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.180
 but also 116 grams worth 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.470
 I prefer to give you my little one 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.440
 Size comparison present 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.310
 long ago that the Galaxy s2 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.340
 b the HTC Wildfire s you can see it very well by taking out train 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.830
 By contrast, the WiFi is an absolute dwarf but we can do that 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.119
 of course, make it even better 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.700
 we'll wait 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.659
 she guesses 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.819
 he is then also that still acts like a little fixed Maat photos already 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.520
 significantly larger 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.569
 I can not only get more results with the 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 Samsung Nexus s offer that has similar dimensions right almost say it exactly 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.530
 to have in mind but it is slightly smaller 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.869
 "But clearly and not so powerful 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:41.679
 like the Galaxy s St 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:43.379
 and at the very end 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.239
 just for the sake of completeness compared to the Apple iPhone 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.259
 4 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:53.829
 why I LEG the Galaxy s2 with the beautiful colorful again aside 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.329
 I really do not want to say the packaging but they never feel like it 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.369
 on the tongue 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:02.459
 has very similarities with the percent of iPhones here too 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.769
 an atlas of emotions where the device comes to light not in vain 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.909
 There is currently a lawsuit against Samsung initiated by Apple and me 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.700
 think there will probably be one or the other trouble 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.709
 User manuals packed in a nice foil 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.959
 and the peaceful future comes to light so you let it hang 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.950
 In-ear headphones will certainly be the usual good quality 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.219
 from Samsung 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:27.559
 one percent 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:28.809
 Charger with 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:31.139
 integrated data cable 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.309
 a separate USB Migrol and data cable to connect it to the PC 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:40.119
 or Mac if someone did not recognize guys charging cable 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.839
 of course the 1600 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.459
 the 30 billion per 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.879
 AKU's probably just when I'm doing about two days 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.419
 will be good 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.839
 as a small supplement still different Stötel for the 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.850
 So certificate will be thinner or the corona will have 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.429
 while also with this device 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.979
 I say a woman's film in the ice integrated into his horn or the same 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.519
 a high quality headphone 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.229
 16 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.329
 I would 'liberate the device from the film so for once the beginning of the 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.879
 all the back 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.249
 protected with a foil 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:24.240
 also as a small guide 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.120
 as I say I can remove de Bakker from the device 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.120
 the front with nem 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.370
 before the shot, I'm not quite so successful I'm not quite honest 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.070
 due to the fact that it is so natural also a test field probably 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.520
 I completely renounce that thing is my distant 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.790
 because many parents and transparent film can take is on the way 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.379
 is integrated 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.009
 before Google Atlas is used behind 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.839
 completely made of plastic this time, thank God, not high glossy but 

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:53.860
 also received 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.400
 On the right, a switch on the left is quietly located 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.760
 central banks including Nico SP access 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.150
 On top of that, 4 5 millimeters would have been missing at first glance 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.550
 Naturally 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.770
 the key 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.270
 Fürth the camera 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.830
 the battery cover on the back can be very difficult a fernes for it 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.710
 cleared 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.400
 if I'm expecting so much more if I'm honest that's possible 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.419
 It is not that cheap 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.730
 currently about 530 Euro I want my life now 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.520
 Bake Falko 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.689
 the obviously not so good z 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:37.809
 Art is the talk 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.189
 lid on it 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:43.509
 only for the first time 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.059
 Battery cover weighs very well but sounds a bit plastic Meesiger what 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:51.180
 As I said the packaging on the amount of credit discounted fabric 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.270
 a push on the small circuit breaker 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.050
 that starts the Galaxy s2 with the corresponding action we did 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.900
 can also help the display is huge four command sorrowful 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.700
 I'm also only with 84 times 800 pixels on that is the typical 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.759
 I say resolutions for android-based devices 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.449
 not quite as high resolution as the iPhone 4s but as in the case also 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.680
 not at all avoid 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.580
 Dähn 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.840
 Of course we also have to adapt the corresponding applications when 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.180
 iPhone is relatively simple as you can get two 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.389
 different resolutions of the use for the branches or Heidi and here must 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.860
 one the Landolt accordingly 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.860
 position or program 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.270
 We do not touch the start at the start 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.710
 "An hour later 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.870
 The SP has as I said not so high resolution is still first class 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.259
 Europe had very strong game front, I think 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:52.659
 sunlight 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:56.309
 you do not quite get that much sense the color comes Super shine over it 

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:58.980
 So for me personally, this is now relative 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.540
 the low resolution in relation to the size of the display at all 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.039
 not unpleasant I have to say 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:05.639
 the Samsung at first sight 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:07.680
 done with class work 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.159
 the typical home screens 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:13.020
 seven in number application minim 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.960
 as you know it again 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.409
 back and forth the son was 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:21.769
 back and forth scroll was list view it also possible boxes are lit. 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:26.060
 more actually later in the review at first glance does the thing 

00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:30.989
 Huge impression it is very thin it is compared to 

00:07:30.989 --> 00:07:35.389
 iPhone really very light summer do not believe well to 25 are barely 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:39.389
 grateful and also compared to the Nexus s it is easier to drop the display 

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:42.719
 much bigger I think we have a lot of fun with the test 

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:46.479
 That was the first anvil and I would be happy if you 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:50.210
 My channel made a little more public by being able to test Mediterranean devices 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.789
 and I'll just say it again 

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:52.280
 until then
