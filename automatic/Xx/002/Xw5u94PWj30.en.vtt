Bayern but I told you the grass isn't
always<00:04:06.879> greener<00:04:07.090> on<00:04:07.480> the

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
always greener on the

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.539 
always greener on the
the<00:04:07.879> side<00:04:08.120> baby<00:04:08.510> psg<00:04:09.500> was<00:04:09.709> pretty<00:04:09.950> epic<00:04:10.129> there

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
the side baby psg was pretty epic there

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.580 
the side baby psg was pretty epic there
and<00:04:10.790> it's<00:04:11.120> pretty<00:04:11.390> cool<00:04:11.569> here<00:04:11.810> at<00:04:11.959> Bayern<00:04:12.170> too

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
and it's pretty cool here at Bayern too

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.559 
and it's pretty cool here at Bayern too
but<00:04:12.890> seems<00:04:13.430> like<00:04:13.549> a<00:04:13.579> lot<00:04:13.819> of<00:04:13.939> people<00:04:14.239> who<00:04:14.359> would

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
but seems like a lot of people who would

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.449 
but seems like a lot of people who would
like<00:04:14.719> the<00:04:14.930> PSG<00:04:15.469> side<00:04:15.709> of<00:04:15.799> things<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.130> bit<00:04:16.310> better

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
like the PSG side of things a bit better

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.430 
like the PSG side of things a bit better
so<00:04:16.820> I'm<00:04:17.150> not<00:04:17.389> really<00:04:17.600> sure<00:04:17.720> all<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.049> know<00:04:18.169> is<00:04:18.380> the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
so I'm not really sure all I know is the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.830 
so I'm not really sure all I know is the
seasons<00:04:18.799> go<00:04:18.919> by<00:04:18.949> so<00:04:19.280> fast<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:19.820> just<00:04:20.000> like<00:04:20.570> maybe

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
seasons go by so fast so just like maybe

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.990 
seasons go by so fast so just like maybe
two<00:04:21.079> more<00:04:21.289> weeks<00:04:21.530> of<00:04:21.739> this<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:22.340> being<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.729> Bayern

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
two more weeks of this of being a Bayern

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.820 
two more weeks of this of being a Bayern
in<00:04:23.449> real<00:04:23.720> life<00:04:23.930> real<00:04:24.259> life<00:04:24.289> time<00:04:24.680> will

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
in real life real life time will

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.409 
in real life real life time will
probably<00:04:25.160> like<00:04:25.250> two<00:04:25.400> more<00:04:25.580> weeks<00:04:25.759> of<00:04:25.940> episodes

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
probably like two more weeks of episodes

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.330 
probably like two more weeks of episodes
and<00:04:26.630> then<00:04:26.720> we'll<00:04:27.199> probably<00:04:27.380> be<00:04:27.740> at<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.860> new<00:04:28.100> team

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
and then we'll probably be at a new team

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.830 
and then we'll probably be at a new team
or<00:04:28.520> maybe<00:04:28.669> we<00:04:28.850> stay<00:04:29.060> at<00:04:29.180> Bayern<00:04:29.419> who<00:04:29.630> knows

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840
