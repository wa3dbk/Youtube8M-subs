00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.130 
timing push from Hydra and second gas
going<00:05:05.660> down<00:05:05.930> a<00:05:05.960> lot<00:05:06.260> of<00:05:06.350> zerglings<00:05:06.590> coming<00:05:06.980> up

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
going down a lot of zerglings coming up

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.820 
going down a lot of zerglings coming up
excuse<00:05:09.140> me<00:05:09.290> at<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.560> burb<00:05:11.320> zergling<00:05:12.320> speed<00:05:12.650> is

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
almost complete and he's going to be

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.240 
almost complete and he's going to be
attacking<00:05:15.230> here<00:05:15.590> or<00:05:15.740> at<00:05:15.800> least<00:05:15.830> pushing<00:05:16.280> out

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.030 
probably going to be oh no there's two
more<00:05:20.810> barracks<00:05:21.140> coming<00:05:21.440> down<00:05:21.560> so<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.980> doesn't

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
more barracks coming down so it doesn't

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.150 
more barracks coming down so it doesn't

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
justice the cook low there still could

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.960 
justice the cook low there still could
be<00:05:28.160> I<00:05:28.520> put<00:05:28.730> on<00:05:28.910> a<00:05:29.150> stim<00:05:29.870> timing<00:05:30.560> push<00:05:30.940> but<00:05:31.940> oh

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
be I put on a stim timing push but oh

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.969 
be I put on a stim timing push but oh
that's<00:05:32.210> a<00:05:32.300> lot<00:05:32.419> of<00:05:32.450> circlings<00:05:32.890> honestly<00:05:33.890> I

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
that's a lot of circlings honestly I

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.310 
that's a lot of circlings honestly I
don't<00:05:34.130> think<00:05:34.280> that's<00:05:34.550> enough<00:05:35.080> he's<00:05:36.080> going<00:05:36.260> to

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
don't think that's enough he's going to
