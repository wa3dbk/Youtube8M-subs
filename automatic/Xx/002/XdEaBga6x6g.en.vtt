00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
compared this I thought that this would

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.699 
compared this I thought that this would
be<00:02:50.150> unhealthier<00:02:51.150> than<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.600> found<00:02:51.840> um<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.620> know

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
be unhealthier than I found um you know

be unhealthier than I found um you know
one<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.860> those<00:02:52.980> like<00:02:53.190> whole-grain<00:02:53.640> cereals

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
yeah the whole grain cereal is way worse

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.250 
yeah the whole grain cereal is way worse
I<00:02:56.610> looked<00:02:56.940> at<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.209> like<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.570> was<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> smaller<00:02:58.019> box

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
