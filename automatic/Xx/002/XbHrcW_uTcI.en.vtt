so<00:00:04.640> Lana<00:00:05.030> just<00:00:05.300> hasn't<00:00:06.080> been<00:00:06.319> having<00:00:06.529> a<00:00:06.800> good

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
so Lana just hasn't been having a good

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.959 
so Lana just hasn't been having a good
day<00:00:07.570> so<00:00:08.570> she's<00:00:09.200> gonna<00:00:09.380> head<00:00:09.770> upstairs<00:00:09.950> to<00:00:10.460> what

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
day so she's gonna head upstairs to what

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.070 
day so she's gonna head upstairs to what
I<00:00:11.000> call<00:00:11.330> the<00:00:11.690> the<00:00:12.410> cryostasis<00:00:12.950> room<00:00:13.610> and<00:00:14.080> what

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
I call the the cryostasis room and what

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.560 
I call the the cryostasis room and what
you're<00:00:15.230> looking<00:00:15.559> at<00:00:15.740> is<00:00:16.010> one<00:00:16.460> of<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:16.760> is<00:00:17.270> the

part of the quantum power pack you get

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.779 
part of the quantum power pack you get
the<00:00:29.689> quantum<00:00:30.170> power<00:00:30.350> chamber<00:00:30.890> that<00:00:31.430> allows

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
the quantum power chamber that allows

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.880 
the quantum power chamber that allows
your<00:00:31.970> sim<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.269> enter<00:00:32.840> into<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.320> cryostasis

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
your sim to enter into a cryostasis

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.869 
your sim to enter into a cryostasis
sleep<00:00:34.809> and<00:00:35.809> Lana<00:00:36.650> here<00:00:36.949> you<00:00:37.339> know<00:00:37.430> her<00:00:37.610> moods

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
sleep and Lana here you know her moods

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.299 
sleep and Lana here you know her moods
and<00:00:38.360> you<00:00:38.629> know<00:00:38.720> all<00:00:38.870> her<00:00:38.989> needs<00:00:39.199> aren't<00:00:39.949> doing

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
and you know all her needs aren't doing

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.890 
and you know all her needs aren't doing
that<00:00:40.489> well<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:40.820> once<00:00:41.059> you<00:00:41.180> actually<00:00:41.360> enter

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
that well so once you actually enter

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.799 
that well so once you actually enter
into<00:00:42.080> this<00:00:42.470> quantum<00:00:43.250> power<00:00:43.430> chamber<00:00:43.909> it<00:00:44.420> also

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
into this quantum power chamber it also

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.590 
into this quantum power chamber it also
stabilizes<00:00:45.320> your<00:00:46.190> sims<00:00:46.549> needs<00:00:46.909> meters<00:00:47.299> as

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
stabilizes your sims needs meters as

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.189 
stabilizes your sims needs meters as
well<00:00:48.229> as<00:00:48.500> locking<00:00:49.040> in<00:00:49.159> their<00:00:49.280> aging<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.930> so

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
well as locking in their aging and so

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.680 
well as locking in their aging and so
this<00:00:51.979> is<00:00:52.100> just<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.580> quick<00:00:52.879> way<00:00:53.120> for<00:00:53.150> you<00:00:53.540> to

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
this is just a quick way for you to

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.090 
this is just a quick way for you to
actually<00:00:53.839> take<00:00:54.260> care<00:00:54.440> of<00:00:54.559> your<00:00:54.680> sins<00:00:54.890> without

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
actually take care of your sins without

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.729 
actually take care of your sins without
having<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:56.059> already<00:00:56.900> take<00:00:57.110> care<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.440> all<00:00:57.589> their

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
having to already take care of all their

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:58.930 
having to already take care of all their
different<00:00:58.129> needs<00:00:58.309> because<00:00:58.580> like<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:58.879> said

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
different needs because like I said

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.910 
different needs because like I said
earlier<00:00:59.210> ain't<00:00:59.989> nobody<00:01:00.229> got<00:01:00.379> time<00:01:00.589> to<00:01:00.739> take

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
earlier ain't nobody got time to take

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.390 
earlier ain't nobody got time to take
care<00:01:01.070> of<00:01:01.129> your<00:01:01.280> Sims<00:01:01.460> bladder<00:01:02.710> so<00:01:03.710> we<00:01:04.220> have

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
care of your Sims bladder so we have

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.280 
care of your Sims bladder so we have
Devon<00:01:04.790> here<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.150> Devon's<00:01:05.479> just<00:01:05.720> waking<00:01:06.140> up

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
Devon here and Devon's just waking up

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.510 
Devon here and Devon's just waking up
from<00:01:07.280> his<00:01:07.640> stasis<00:01:08.450> sleep<00:01:09.310> thanks<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.340> the

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
from his stasis sleep thanks to the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.789 
from his stasis sleep thanks to the
quantum<00:01:11.149> power<00:01:11.329> chamber<00:01:11.840> but<00:01:12.320> another<00:01:12.560> thing

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
quantum power chamber but another thing

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.410 
quantum power chamber but another thing
that<00:01:12.859> this<00:01:13.159> quantum<00:01:13.549> power<00:01:13.729> chamber<00:01:14.090> can<00:01:14.240> do

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
that this quantum power chamber can do

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.660 
that this quantum power chamber can do
is<00:01:14.689> enable<00:01:15.500> your<00:01:15.799> sim<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.039> equip<00:01:16.460> themselves

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
is enable your sim to equip themselves

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.249 
is enable your sim to equip themselves
with<00:01:17.329> a<00:01:17.979> quantum<00:01:18.979> power<00:01:19.219> suit

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
with a quantum power suit

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.810 
with a quantum power suit
there<00:01:21.259> you<00:01:21.439> go<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.829> not<00:01:21.950> only<00:01:22.159> is<00:01:22.369> it<00:01:22.399> a<00:01:22.520> suit

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
there you go and not only is it a suit

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.130 
there you go and not only is it a suit
it<00:01:22.969> comes<00:01:23.210> with<00:01:23.390> this<00:01:23.450> really<00:01:23.600> special

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
it comes with this really special

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.099 
it comes with this really special
quantum<00:01:24.799> powered<00:01:25.100> bracer<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.329> it<00:01:26.840> allows

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
quantum powered bracer and it allows

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:28.660 
quantum powered bracer and it allows
your<00:01:27.289> sims<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.679> do<00:01:27.829> many<00:01:28.070> different<00:01:28.159> things

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
your sims to do many different things

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.749 
your sims to do many different things
one<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.060> them<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.509> allow<00:01:30.200> them<00:01:30.409> to<00:01:30.560> warp<00:01:30.920> into

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
one of them is allow them to warp into

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.580 
one of them is allow them to warp into
different<00:01:32.179> community<00:01:32.749> Lots<00:01:32.990> in<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.350> world

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
different community Lots in the world

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.399 
different community Lots in the world
and<00:01:34.359> once<00:01:35.359> you<00:01:35.570> actually<00:01:35.719> do<00:01:36.079> so<00:01:36.259> and

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
and once you actually do so and

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.340 
and once you actually do so and
designate<00:01:36.890> a<00:01:36.920> destination<00:01:37.659> it<00:01:38.659> opens<00:01:39.109> up<00:01:39.259> a

designate a destination it opens up a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.880 
designate a destination it opens up a
time<00:01:39.619> warp<00:01:39.859> hole<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.719> and<00:01:41.890> automatically
