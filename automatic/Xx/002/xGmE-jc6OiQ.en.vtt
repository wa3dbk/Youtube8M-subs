00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.190 
peppermint sticks would make a great
little<00:01:38.040> stick<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.119> well<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.930> what<00:01:40.079> you're

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
little stick as well so what you're

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.420 
little stick as well so what you're
going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.860> you're<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> take

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
going to do is you're going to take

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.030 
going to do is you're going to take
whatever<00:01:42.119> type<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.810> stick<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.290> decide<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> use

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
whatever type of stick you decide to use

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.990 
whatever type of stick you decide to use
and<00:01:44.340> take<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.899> twist<00:01:46.890> down<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
and take it and just twist down now the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
and take it and just twist down now the
good<00:01:48.420> thing<00:01:48.659> about<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.079> marshmallows<00:01:49.740> is

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
good thing about the marshmallows is

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.920 
good thing about the marshmallows is
they're<00:01:50.250> sticky<00:01:50.790> inside<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.689> they're

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
they're sticky inside and so they're

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
they're sticky inside and so they're
going<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.140> stick<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.950> hold<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.540> well

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
going to stick on and hold really well

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.840 
going to stick on and hold really well
so<00:01:55.950> then<00:01:56.189> you're<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> take<00:01:56.700> your

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
so then you're going to take your
