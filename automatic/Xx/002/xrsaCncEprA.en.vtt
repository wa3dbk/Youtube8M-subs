00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
okay so now I'm going to show you how we

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.880 
okay so now I'm going to show you how we
will<00:00:15.510> use<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.840> Sidewinders<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.650> braided

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
will use the Sidewinders in a braided

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.609 
will use the Sidewinders in a braided
style<00:00:17.220> like<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:17.940> these<00:00:18.210> hair<00:00:18.540> and<00:00:18.930> I'm

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
style like with these hair and I'm

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.560 
style like with these hair and I'm
pretty<00:00:20.010> excited<00:00:20.430> about<00:00:20.700> using<00:00:21.450> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
pretty excited about using the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.740 
pretty excited about using the
Sidewinders<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.500> place<00:00:22.950> of<00:00:23.189> beads<00:00:23.750> because

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
Sidewinders in place of beads because

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.470 
Sidewinders in place of beads because
they're<00:00:25.110> so<00:00:25.410> fast<00:00:25.680> normally<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.270> see<00:00:27.450> I

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
they're so fast normally you can see I

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
they're so fast normally you can see I
have<00:00:27.690> a<00:00:27.720> lot<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:27.990> tubs<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.130> beads<00:00:29.400> like<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.000> I

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
have a lot of tubs of beads like this I

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.770 
have a lot of tubs of beads like this I
have<00:00:31.500> tons<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.369> these<00:00:32.550> little<00:00:32.879> beading<00:00:33.449> tools

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
have tons of these little beading tools

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.170 
have tons of these little beading tools
so<00:00:34.500> when<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.800> go<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.129> do<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> style<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.150> her

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
so when I go to do a style for her

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.500 
so when I go to do a style for her
that's<00:00:36.540> gonna<00:00:36.720> have<00:00:36.930> many<00:00:37.739> many<00:00:38.070> beads<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.580> it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
that's gonna have many many beads in it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.530 
that's gonna have many many beads in it
I<00:00:39.620> take<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.830> lot<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.070> time<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.970> know<00:00:42.090> picking

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
I take a lot of time you know picking

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.060 
I take a lot of time you know picking
through<00:00:42.900> my<00:00:43.050> beads<00:00:43.260> finding<00:00:43.769> just<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.010> right

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
through my beads finding just the right

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.939 
through my beads finding just the right
colors<00:00:44.580> loading<00:00:45.059> them<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.360> up<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.739> that's

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
colors loading them all up and that's

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.070 
colors loading them all up and that's
pretty<00:00:47.129> time-consuming<00:00:47.449> so<00:00:48.449> the<00:00:48.870> really

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
pretty time-consuming so the really

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.079 
pretty time-consuming so the really
great<00:00:49.559> thing<00:00:49.799> about<00:00:49.830> the<00:00:50.159> Sidewinders<00:00:50.790> is

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
great thing about the Sidewinders is

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.140 
great thing about the Sidewinders is
that<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.870> cuts<00:00:52.470> down<00:00:52.650> on<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.949> time<00:00:53.220> there<00:00:54.120> are

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
that it cuts down on that time there are

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.930 
that it cuts down on that time there are
little<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.600> expensive<00:00:54.960> than<00:00:55.170> beads<00:00:55.760> but<00:00:56.760> you

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
little more expensive than beads but you

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.119 
little more expensive than beads but you
can<00:00:57.089> see<00:00:57.330> here<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.260> side<00:00:58.559> winder<00:00:58.920> is

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
can see here that one side winder is

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.340 
can see here that one side winder is
about<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.580> length<00:00:59.790> of<00:01:00.030> around<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.989> eight

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
about the length of around like eight

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.759 
about the length of around like eight
beads<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.750> you're<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.379> getting<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
beads so you're you know getting a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.020 
beads so you're you know getting a
little<00:01:05.010> more<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.400> money<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:05.909> are

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
little more for your money but they are

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.359 
little more for your money but they are
more<00:01:06.210> expensive<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.619> lot<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.190> beads

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
more expensive and I have a lot of beads

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.160 
more expensive and I have a lot of beads
so<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> wouldn't<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.090> replacing<00:01:09.630> my<00:01:09.720> whole<00:01:09.960> bead

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
so I wouldn't be replacing my whole bead

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.660 
so I wouldn't be replacing my whole bead
collection<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:10.770> sign<00:01:10.920> writers<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:11.549> they

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
collection with sign writers but they

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.000 
collection with sign writers but they
are<00:01:11.790> fun<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> use<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:13.320> different<00:01:13.380> things<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
are fun to use for different things and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.990 
are fun to use for different things and
another<00:01:14.520> thing<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.299> them<00:01:16.100> as<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.880> know

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
another thing about them as a you know

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.179 
another thing about them as a you know
compared<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.539> beads<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.109> that<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.619> fit<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
compared to beads is that I can fit a

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.980 
compared to beads is that I can fit a
thicker<00:01:20.609> braid<00:01:21.000> inside<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.689> them<00:01:21.810> they<00:01:21.930> can

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
thicker braid inside of them they can

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.289 
thicker braid inside of them they can
actually<00:01:22.229> hold<00:01:22.649> a<00:01:22.920> lot<00:01:23.549> thicker<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.119> braid

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
actually hold a lot thicker of a braid

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.109 
actually hold a lot thicker of a braid
than<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> expected<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.469> lot<00:01:25.649> more<00:01:25.920> hair<00:01:26.729> like

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
than I expected and a lot more hair like

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.580 
than I expected and a lot more hair like
with<00:01:27.509> literally<00:01:27.990> than<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.289> expected

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
with literally than I expected

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.340 
with literally than I expected
okay<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:34.369> okay<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.570> attaching<00:01:36.570> them<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
okay so okay so attaching them to the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.980 
okay so okay so attaching them to the
hair<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> braid<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.479> how<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.719> end

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
hair or to the braid like how to end

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.499 
hair or to the braid like how to end
them<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.409> get<00:01:40.499> them<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.649> stay<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
them and get them to stay on is

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.849 
them and get them to stay on is
something<00:01:42.509> I've<00:01:42.659> been<00:01:42.689> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> toying<00:01:43.679> with

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
something I've been kind of toying with

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:50.300 
something I've been kind of toying with
you<00:01:44.789> can<00:01:44.969> see<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.570> these<00:01:45.929> ones<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.380> here

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.790 

that<00:01:51.310> um<00:01:52.050> because<00:01:53.050> they're<00:01:53.230> not<00:01:53.350> going<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.620> say

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
that um because they're not going to say

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.530 
that um because they're not going to say
the<00:01:54.040> braids<00:01:54.280> aren't<00:01:54.550> quite<00:01:54.730> thick<00:01:55.060> enough<00:01:55.300> and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
the braids aren't quite thick enough and

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.120 
the braids aren't quite thick enough and
I<00:01:55.600> want<00:01:55.810> them<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.080> come<00:01:56.350> all<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.710> way<00:01:56.740> down<00:01:56.950> to

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
I want them to come all the way down to

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.580 
I want them to come all the way down to
the<00:01:57.250> bottom<00:01:57.580> of<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.090> braid<00:01:58.360> if<00:01:58.660> I<00:01:59.110> shoved<00:01:59.500> them

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
the bottom of the braid if I shoved them

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.840 
the bottom of the braid if I shoved them
up<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.010> top<00:02:00.220> of<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.430> braid<00:02:00.640> they'd

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
up to the top of the braid they'd

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.790 
up to the top of the braid they'd
probably<00:02:01.030> stay<00:02:01.360> on<00:02:01.510> by<00:02:01.780> themselves<00:02:02.320> but<00:02:02.740> I

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
probably stay on by themselves but I

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.990 
probably stay on by themselves but I
want<00:02:03.040> them<00:02:03.160> down<00:02:03.340> at<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.580> bottom<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:03.940> the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
want them down at the bottom of the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.460 
want them down at the bottom of the
braid<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.390> have<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:04.720> find<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.020> way<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.170> hold

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
braid so I have to find a way to hold

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.060 
braid so I have to find a way to hold
them<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:05.980> um<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.840> for<00:02:08.110> these<00:02:08.290> you<00:02:08.619> can<00:02:08.800> kind

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
them on and um so for these you can kind

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.160 
them on and um so for these you can kind
of<00:02:09.160> see<00:02:09.460> this<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.850> ended<00:02:10.180> up<00:02:10.270> wrapping<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.930> rubber

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
of see this I ended up wrapping a rubber

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.560 
of see this I ended up wrapping a rubber
band<00:02:11.410> around<00:02:11.650> them<00:02:12.040> I'm<00:02:12.790> gonna<00:02:12.880> twist<00:02:13.240> this<00:02:13.420> up

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
band around them I'm gonna twist this up

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.880 
band around them I'm gonna twist this up
a<00:02:13.690> little<00:02:13.870> bit<00:02:13.990> so<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.200> can<00:02:14.320> see<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.680> purple

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
a little bit so you can see the purple

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.820 
a little bit so you can see the purple
one<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.910> got<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.600> end<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.140> wrapped

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
one like I got to the end and I wrapped

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.320 
one like I got to the end and I wrapped
the<00:02:18.040> braid<00:02:18.280> around<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.850> then<00:02:18.940> wrapped<00:02:19.180> a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
the braid around and then wrapped a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.140 
the braid around and then wrapped a
rubber<00:02:19.510> band<00:02:19.810> around<00:02:19.990> it<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.880> didn't<00:02:21.880> really

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
rubber band around it I didn't really

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.890 
rubber band around it I didn't really
love<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.630> way<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.110> was<00:02:23.320> working<00:02:24.330> um<00:02:25.330> it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
love the way that that was working um it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.960 
love the way that that was working um it
looks<00:02:26.140> okay<00:02:26.530> when<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:26.890> then<00:02:27.190> cover<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.700> up<00:02:27.910> with

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
looks okay when I then cover it up with

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.240 
looks okay when I then cover it up with
the<00:02:28.420> pink<00:02:28.780> one<00:02:28.870> twist<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.470> down<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:30.040> know<00:02:30.160> it

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
the pink one twist it down you know it

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.660 
the pink one twist it down you know it
looks<00:02:30.460> okay<00:02:30.850> but<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:32.380> just<00:02:32.800> didn't<00:02:33.310> love<00:02:33.430> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
looks okay but it just didn't love the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.430 
looks okay but it just didn't love the
method<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:35.050> then<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.770> got<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.190> idea<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:37.360> put<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
method so then I got the idea to put a

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.490 
method so then I got the idea to put a
bead<00:02:38.710> on<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.040> bottom<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:41.050> you<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.290> see

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
bead on the bottom and as you can see

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.400 
bead on the bottom and as you can see
here<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.130> put<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.209> bead<00:02:43.420> on<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.600> bottom<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.230> my

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
here I put the bead on the bottom of my

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.500 
here I put the bead on the bottom of my
braid<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.400> don't<00:02:45.940> know<00:02:46.030> if<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.330> see

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
braid and I don't know if you can see

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.010 
braid and I don't know if you can see
that<00:02:46.690> rubber<00:02:46.959> band<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:49.180> put<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.810> bead<00:02:49.990> on

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
that rubber band but I put the bead on

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.020 
that rubber band but I put the bead on
and<00:02:50.470> then<00:02:50.620> tied<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.190> up<00:02:51.310> with<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.580> rubber<00:02:51.790> band

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
and then tied it up with the rubber band

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.150 
and then tied it up with the rubber band
the<00:02:52.270> way<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.660> normally<00:02:52.780> would<00:02:53.440> when<00:02:54.130> I

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
the way that I normally would when I

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.790 
the way that I normally would when I
just<00:02:54.610> am<00:02:54.910> putting<00:02:55.570> beads<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.290> braid<00:02:56.530> and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
just am putting beads on the braid and

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.010 
just am putting beads on the braid and
then<00:02:57.370> I<00:02:57.400> can<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:57.880> slide<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.450> sidewinder

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
then I can just slide the sidewinder

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.250 
then I can just slide the sidewinder
down<00:02:59.230> over<00:02:59.709> I<00:03:00.010> mean<00:03:00.730> it's<00:03:01.000> no<00:03:01.120> easy<00:03:01.270> over<00:03:02.020> top

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
down over I mean it's no easy over top

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.259 
down over I mean it's no easy over top
of<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:03.160> rubberband<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:03.550> you<00:03:03.730> don't<00:03:03.880> even<00:03:04.030> see

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
of the rubberband and you don't even see

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.880 
of the rubberband and you don't even see
the<00:03:04.300> rubber<00:03:04.570> band<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.050> that's<00:03:05.500> gonna<00:03:05.680> hold

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
the rubber band and that's gonna hold

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.520 
the rubber band and that's gonna hold
them<00:03:06.010> on<00:03:06.130> really<00:03:06.370> great<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:07.300> I'm<00:03:07.989> only<00:03:08.140> needing

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
them on really great so I'm only needing

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.090 
them on really great so I'm only needing
to<00:03:08.800> do<00:03:08.920> one<00:03:09.280> bead<00:03:09.550> per<00:03:09.880> braid<00:03:10.510> instead<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.410> you

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
to do one bead per braid instead of you

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.540 
to do one bead per braid instead of you
know<00:03:12.480> six<00:03:13.480> or<00:03:13.780> eight<00:03:14.290> beads<00:03:14.560> per<00:03:14.950> braid<00:03:15.190> which

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
know six or eight beads per braid which

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.120 
know six or eight beads per braid which
is<00:03:15.700> making<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:16.090> lot<00:03:16.239> faster<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:20.800> was<00:03:21.010> able

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
is making a lot faster so so I was able

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.680 
is making a lot faster so so I was able
to<00:03:21.280> just<00:03:21.550> pick<00:03:21.730> up<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:22.000> pink<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.300> purple<00:03:22.420> ones

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
to just pick up the pink and purple ones

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.870 
to just pick up the pink and purple ones
I<00:03:22.780> want<00:03:22.989> put<00:03:23.500> them<00:03:23.650> all<00:03:23.769> on<00:03:23.800> one<00:03:24.160> beater<00:03:24.610> and

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
I want put them all on one beater and

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.729 
I want put them all on one beater and
I'm<00:03:25.030> only<00:03:25.180> using<00:03:25.420> one<00:03:25.570> for<00:03:25.870> braid<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.380> so

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
I'm only using one for braid and so

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.390 
I'm only using one for braid and so
that's<00:03:27.070> saving<00:03:27.640> me<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:27.790> lot<00:03:27.850> of<00:03:28.000> time<00:03:29.340> okay<00:03:30.340> so

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
that's saving me a lot of time okay so

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.220 
that's saving me a lot of time okay so
now<00:03:30.670> I'm<00:03:30.760> going<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.970> show<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.209> how<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.810> put<00:03:32.080> them

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
now I'm going to show you how I put them

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.780 
now I'm going to show you how I put them
on<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.500> braid<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.920> it's<00:03:33.100> pretty<00:03:33.370> similar<00:03:33.760> to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
on the braid and it's pretty similar to

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.940 
on the braid and it's pretty similar to
how<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.060> put<00:03:34.300> them<00:03:34.390> on<00:03:34.510> easier<00:03:35.050> but<00:03:35.709> I'm<00:03:35.800> going

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
how I put them on easier but I'm going

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.100 
how I put them on easier but I'm going
to<00:03:35.980> take<00:03:36.160> one<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.400> each<00:03:36.640> colored<00:03:37.090> one<00:03:37.660> pink<00:03:37.959> and

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
to take one of each colored one pink and

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.690 
to take one of each colored one pink and
one<00:03:38.230> purple

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
one purple

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.890 
one purple
and<00:03:39.849> I<00:03:39.940> just<00:03:40.150> grabbed<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.420> brain<00:03:42.660> stick<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.780> in

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
and I just grabbed the brain stick it in

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.820 
and I just grabbed the brain stick it in
there<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.290> whined<00:03:45.569> super<00:03:46.569> fast<00:03:46.780> even<00:03:47.470> easier

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
there and whined super fast even easier

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.300 
there and whined super fast even easier
really<00:03:48.130> than<00:03:48.310> with<00:03:48.459> ease<00:03:48.670> hair<00:03:48.910> because<00:03:50.310> it's

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
really than with ease hair because it's

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.540 
really than with ease hair because it's
all<00:03:51.489> braided<00:03:51.819> together<00:03:52.770> so<00:03:53.770> I've<00:03:53.920> got<00:03:54.099> two<00:03:54.370> in

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
all braided together so I've got two in

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.830 
all braided together so I've got two in
there<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:54.970> then<00:03:55.120> I'm<00:03:55.239> just<00:03:55.360> gonna<00:03:55.510> twist

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
there and then I'm just gonna twist
