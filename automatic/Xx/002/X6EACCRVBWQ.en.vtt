00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
those two are probably going to be the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.289 
those two are probably going to be the
ones<00:01:44.310> likely<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> bench<00:01:45.090> because

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
ones likely to be on the bench because

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
ones likely to be on the bench because
Ramsey<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.899> no<00:01:46.110> chance<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.649> bench<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
Ramsey is no chance in the bench and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.789 
Ramsey is no chance in the bench and
that<00:01:47.430> Ted<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.820> injured<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.799> then

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that Ted is out injured as we know then

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.960 
that Ted is out injured as we know then
the<00:01:49.920> disappointment<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.640> didn't<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
the disappointment is we didn't get a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.580 
the disappointment is we didn't get a
new<00:01:51.119> striker<00:01:51.360> wouldn't<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:51.930> an<00:01:52.020> attacker<00:01:52.320> but

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
new striker wouldn't get an attacker but

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.550 
new striker wouldn't get an attacker but
with<00:01:53.369> Podolski<00:01:53.970> he's<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:54.869> three<00:01:55.320> months

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
with Podolski he's out for three months

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
with Podolski he's out for three months
I<00:01:55.649> guess<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.820> good<00:01:56.909> enough

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I guess so not going to be good enough

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.149 
I guess so not going to be good enough
but<00:01:57.270> hopefully<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.259> Giroud<00:01:58.530> stays<00:01:58.920> fit

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
but hopefully if Giroud stays fit

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.469 
but hopefully if Giroud stays fit
because<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.430> he<00:01:59.490> doesn't<00:01:59.700> was<00:01:59.939> screwed<00:02:00.270> and

what he could have got a month ago so i

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.270
