00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
is called the wood gas stove and it

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.529 
is called the wood gas stove and it
burns<00:00:16.289> not<00:00:16.740> only<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> wood<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:18.119> little

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
burns not only the wood this little

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.810 
burns not only the wood this little
pieces<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.869> wood<00:00:19.050> they<00:00:19.289> put<00:00:19.529> inside<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.699> it

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
pieces of wood they put inside but it

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
placed so that the smoke comes up

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.590 
placed so that the smoke comes up
through<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> holes<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.149> when<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.450> gets

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
through the holes and when this gets

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.750 
through the holes and when this gets
superheated<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.500> burns<00:00:37.739> fuel<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> still

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
superheated it burns fuel that is still

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.240

and our experience is you never need to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.689 
and our experience is you never need to
put<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.809> high<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.410> works<00:00:58.620> most<00:00:59.100> efficiently

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
put it on high it works most efficiently

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.349 
put it on high it works most efficiently
on<00:00:59.940> low<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.949> this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.280> hold<00:01:02.399> your<00:01:02.640> pot<00:01:02.879> so

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
and very efficient this yesterday on our

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.810 
and very efficient this yesterday on our
test<00:02:14.060> took<00:02:14.510> 25<00:02:15.410> minutes<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:16.010> bring<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.520> gallon

test took 25 minutes to bring a gallon
of<00:02:16.880> water<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.360> boil<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:18.850> think<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:21.140> I

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
of water to a boil I think that if I

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.960 
of water to a boil I think that if I
have<00:02:21.530> been<00:02:21.650> able<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.950> do<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.370> fell<00:02:22.670> alone

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
have been able to do this fell alone

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.490 
have been able to do this fell alone
instead<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.540> tending<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.990> whole<00:02:24.170> bunch<00:02:24.350> of

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
instead of tending a whole bunch of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.320 
instead of tending a whole bunch of
stoves<00:02:24.740> at<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.010> same<00:02:25.190> time<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.700> could<00:02:26.240> have

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
stoves at the same time I could have

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.900 
stoves at the same time I could have
also<00:02:26.510> cut<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.050> down<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:28.010> 20<00:02:28.340> minutes<00:02:28.640> that's

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
also cut this down to 20 minutes that's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.960 
also cut this down to 20 minutes that's
the<00:02:29.120> field<00:02:31.960> then<00:02:32.960> this<00:02:33.530> is<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
the field then this is the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.740 
the field then this is the

comes with it

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.130 
comes with it

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
same kind of idea as the homemade rocket

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.590 
same kind of idea as the homemade rocket
stove<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:49.100> feed<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.550> fuel<00:02:49.820> in<00:02:50.150> through<00:02:50.390> this

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
stove you feed the fuel in through this

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.800 
stove you feed the fuel in through this
and<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.020> lies<00:02:51.200> on<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.620> little<00:02:51.800> tray<00:02:52.070> and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
and it lies on this little tray and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.440 
and it lies on this little tray and
flames<00:02:53.810> come<00:02:54.140> up<00:02:54.290> here<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.610> can<00:02:55.880> just<00:02:56.120> put

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
flames come up here and you can just put

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
flames come up here and you can just put
your<00:02:56.800> pot<00:02:57.800> there<00:02:58.790> like<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.320> but<00:03:00.320> it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
your pot there like that but it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.880 
your pot there like that but it
increases<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.430> efficiency<00:03:02.050> if<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.350> use<00:03:05.890> any

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
increases the efficiency if you use any

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.580 
increases the efficiency if you use any
flames<00:03:07.250> from<00:03:07.580> coming<00:03:07.970> out<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:09.170> cut<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.410> lot

a little more and this has no great it
just<00:04:41.530> goes<00:04:42.530> down<00:04:42.800> into<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.220> bottom<00:04:44.020> this<00:04:45.020> also

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
just goes down into the bottom this also

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.279 
just goes down into the bottom this also
comes<00:04:45.680> with<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:46.010> skirt<00:04:46.310> with<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.300> pot<00:04:47.539> which

comes with the skirt with the pot which

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.500 
comes with the skirt with the pot which
makes<00:04:48.560> it<00:04:48.710> more<00:04:48.860> efficient<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:51.849> all<00:04:52.849> of<00:04:53.270> these

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
makes it more efficient so all of these

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.140 
makes it more efficient so all of these
will<00:04:54.199> bring<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.740> gallon<00:04:55.220> of<00:04:55.340> water<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.669> a<00:04:55.849> boil

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
will bring a gallon of water to a boil

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.740 
will bring a gallon of water to a boil
in<00:04:56.449> about<00:04:56.960> 20<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.740> 25<00:04:58.099> minutes<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.910> that's<00:04:59.510> all

in about 20 to 25 minutes and that's all

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.180 
in about 20 to 25 minutes and that's all
the<00:04:59.900> fuel<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.139> you<00:05:00.349> need<00:05:00.560> which<00:05:01.599> it's<00:05:02.599> like

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
the fuel that you need which it's like

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.280 
the fuel that you need which it's like
this<00:05:04.190> amount<00:05:04.580> of<00:05:04.910> sticks<00:05:05.449> right<00:05:06.320> here

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.510 

maybe<00:05:10.780> four<00:05:11.780> more<00:05:12.020> is<00:05:12.680> about<00:05:12.980> all<00:05:13.160> it<00:05:13.310> takes

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
maybe four more is about all it takes

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.260 
maybe four more is about all it takes
it's<00:05:14.360> not<00:05:14.540> very<00:05:14.750> much<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.380> then<00:05:16.270> something

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
it's not very much and then something

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.640 
it's not very much and then something
that<00:05:17.300> we're<00:05:17.540> not<00:05:17.570> going<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:17.930> do<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.050> group<00:05:18.290> by<00:05:18.470> on

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
that we're not going to do a group by on

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.000 
that we're not going to do a group by on
yet<00:05:18.920> but<00:05:19.100> later<00:05:19.370> is<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:20.240> thermal<00:05:20.780> cooker<00:05:21.170> this

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
yet but later is a thermal cooker this

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.120 
yet but later is a thermal cooker this
is<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:22.540> thermostat<00:05:23.540> is<00:05:23.660> vacuum<00:05:24.170> lined<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.920> can

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
is a thermostat is vacuum lined you can

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.950 
is a thermostat is vacuum lined you can
get<00:05:25.280> lesser<00:05:25.640> models<00:05:26.030> that<00:05:26.240> are<00:05:26.330> not<00:05:26.480> vacuum

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
get lesser models that are not vacuum

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.060 
get lesser models that are not vacuum
line<00:05:27.160> once<00:05:28.160> you<00:05:28.370> bring<00:05:28.700> your<00:05:29.500> stew<00:05:30.500> or<00:05:30.950> your

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
line once you bring your stew or your

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.520 
line once you bring your stew or your
soup<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.640> a<00:05:31.670> boil<00:05:32.000> on<00:05:32.330> your<00:05:32.570> fuel<00:05:33.290> efficiency

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
soup to a boil on your fuel efficiency

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:40.840 
soup to a boil on your fuel efficiency
so<00:05:36.670> shut<00:05:37.670> the<00:05:37.850> lid<00:05:38.030> lock<00:05:39.020> it<00:05:39.290> and<00:05:39.730> it<00:05:40.730> will

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
so shut the lid lock it and it will

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.750 
so shut the lid lock it and it will
retain<00:05:41.270> the<00:05:41.810> heat<00:05:42.110> at<00:05:42.470> almost<00:05:43.340> boiling

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
retain the heat at almost boiling

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.940 
retain the heat at almost boiling
temperature<00:05:44.510> for<00:05:44.720> six<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.170> eight<00:05:45.320> hours<00:05:45.350> and

temperature for six to eight hours and
continue<00:05:46.400> to<00:05:46.490> cook<00:05:46.670> it<00:05:46.880> so<00:05:47.570> you<00:05:47.630> only<00:05:47.930> need

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
continue to cook it so you only need

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.380 
continue to cook it so you only need
however<00:05:48.920> much<00:05:49.160> fuel<00:05:49.430> it<00:05:49.550> takes<00:05:49.580> to<00:05:50.030> bring<00:05:50.240> it

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
however much fuel it takes to bring it

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.380
