of<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.580> song<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:58.119> follows<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.689> same<00:01:58.960> pattern

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
of the song it follows the same pattern

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:10.460 
of the song it follows the same pattern
or<00:01:59.650> Dorian<00:02:00.330> except<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.450> variant<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:01.960> minor

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:46.009 

a<00:02:10.500> mom

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.080 

keeps<00:02:47.019> on<00:02:47.140> going<00:02:47.530> for<00:02:47.829> quite<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.069> bit<00:02:48.340> right<00:02:49.000> at

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
keeps on going for quite a bit right at

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.500 
keeps on going for quite a bit right at
the<00:02:49.180> very<00:02:49.390> end<00:02:49.689> after<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:51.519> think<00:02:52.299> it's<00:02:52.390> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
the very end after I think it's the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.660 
the very end after I think it's the
second<00:02:52.840> course<00:02:53.019> it<00:02:53.349> goes<00:02:54.010> into<00:02:54.219> a<00:02:54.310> musical

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
second course it goes into a musical

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.280 
second course it goes into a musical
interlude<00:02:54.909> which<00:02:55.390> follows<00:02:55.719> the<00:02:55.870> same<00:02:56.049> pattern

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
interlude which follows the same pattern

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.569 
interlude which follows the same pattern
we<00:02:56.650> were<00:02:56.739> we've<00:02:56.950> been<00:02:57.069> going<00:02:57.280> through<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.549> a

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
we were we've been going through the a

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.559 
we were we've been going through the a
minor<00:02:57.909> at<00:02:58.150> c<00:02:59.079> e<00:02:59.349> minor<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.359> does<00:03:01.450> that

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
minor at c e minor but and it does that

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.330 
minor at c e minor but and it does that
four<00:03:01.780> times<00:03:01.930> in<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.200> row<00:03:02.349> but<00:03:02.739> then<00:03:02.920> after<00:03:03.189> that

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
four times in a row but then after that

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.830 
four times in a row but then after that
it<00:03:03.579> changes<00:03:03.939> into<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.299> next<00:03:04.659> pattern

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
it changes into this next pattern

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.940 
it changes into this next pattern
started<00:03:05.319> from<00:03:05.439> F

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:47.580 

why

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.800 

okay<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.879> then<00:03:48.910> just<00:03:49.090> keeps<00:03:49.300> on<00:03:49.420> rollin

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
okay so and then just keeps on rollin

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.479 
okay so and then just keeps on rollin
with<00:03:49.930> those<00:03:50.080> those<00:03:50.500> three<00:03:50.769> chords<00:03:51.040> over<00:03:51.400> and

with those those three chords over and
over<00:03:51.640> again<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:51.940> very<00:03:52.209> very<00:03:52.510> hand<00:03:52.780> it's

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
over again to the very very hand it's
