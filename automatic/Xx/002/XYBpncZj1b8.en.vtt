00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 Hello everyone, Alex Grech long ago 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.940
 dreamed of finding fun and at the same time 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.400
 useful applications and finally i found 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.969
 an application that deserves five s 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.759
 plus 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.130
 I came across an application document this 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.070
 the program will allow you to organize everything 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.350
 your files are the best you can see 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.779
 in order to find out all the charm of this 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.019
 pretty cool program we have to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.489
 go to our iphone and more please 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.420
 write your topics for our follow up 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:45.149
 issues on u tube 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:49.079
 will not linger let's go go to 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.329
 document first thing I want to say that in 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.420
 the document is very well implemented 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.059
 interface there is nothing strange in all of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.030
 simple document is functional 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.019
 document viewer text editor 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.090
 and even the browser with the ability to download 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.240
 Aiklaud tab allows you to store files 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.460
 in the apple cloud it's entertaining in effect 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.100
 the fact that we are free to work with 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.500
 documents with all devices 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.930
 tied to 1 and go 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.490
 let's try how it works 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.780
 open the document and select the ipod file 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:32.360
 5 drawing coupling aiklaud 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.909
 and now we are looking at whether a drawing will appear on 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.920
 aiklaud in ipad 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:43.649
 ipod tied to the same it likes 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.399
 that and iphone here is a drawing which i 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.829
 just copied from iphone built 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.860
 the browser is for download only 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.890
 files we need, for example, if we 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.200
 Need to download archive tracks potential 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.990

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.540
 the site from which we will download all this 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.990
 I turn on ex.ua 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:12.350

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.710

 open the file unpack producing 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:13.460
 we wait while the program unpacks the file all 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:21.170
 there was a daddy open it and that's it 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:25.180

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:29.810

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.430
 even fun 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.830
 let's also see how it works 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.360
 viewing files in the program document i 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.730
 downloaded for example the file in pdf 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.180
 correspondent magazine is also here 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.100

 can download your favorite magazines 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.370

 document and file viewing program 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.100
 the document is organized quite simply and 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:09.470
 at the same time logically present 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:13.769
 bookmarks search selection fullscreen and 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.650
 night reading mode that's switching 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.970
 enable might mod and we switched to 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.239
 night mode 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.160
 let the mod can also print the page 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.020
 open any other program 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.830
