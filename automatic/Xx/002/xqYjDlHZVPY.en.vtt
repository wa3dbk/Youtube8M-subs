00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.250
 traditional bar 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.960

 windows 8 the system is only here 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.260
 this time with more focus multitasking is just

 drag a window to the side to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.370
 fix as before but the system already 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.449
 offers other open tasks such as 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.949
 suggestion to fill the space 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.780

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.580
 the opposite gesture opens the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.470
 actions and their shortcuts in Taiwan 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.170
 making a strong connection with windows 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.820
 phone windows mobile inclusive from here 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.540
 you may have more than one 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.220
 job 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.680
 speaking of touch when activating the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.689
 tablet interface is much like 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.430
 with what we had on windows 8 screen 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.229
 starting with life style in bars 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.880
 resizing between larger windows 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.860
 to facilitate the touch 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.439
 just touch tablet mode again to 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.970
 disable study the settings of the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.189
 system also received that in 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.930
 judged her everything in the best place too 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.970
 organized things make more sense 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.619
 in windows 10 settings 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.810
 If you've already seen how windows will stay 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.670
 mobile is very similar father I am 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.810
 very close to the categories are also 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.880
 very similar 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.100
 if you already used windows 8 8 point 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.840
 you realize that it is very similar to 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.939
 Great Southern -10 improved and has more 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.890
 options then it looks like windows 8.1 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.869
 in the settings is in 10 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.000
 if you've never used either 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.119
 right click on start and place 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.679
 control panel 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.840
 the two main ones are there normally 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.209
 you can access your old 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.280
 and he finally arrived browser is 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.019
 known as the fourth came to 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.910
 erase the bad impression left by the 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.739
 internet explorer that parked in 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.360
 performance features loosing room for 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.980
 chrome firefox and other browsers 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.709
 more popular 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.410
 the edge was super simple but simple 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.569
 even in relation to internet explorer 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.099

 What are you visiting discovering more? 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.910

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.380
 a decent browser than a 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.329
 alternative or chrome 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.829

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.030
 xbox already talks to the system but the 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.980
 microsoft makes it clear that your pc and your 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.709

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.660
 together again it's all very recent 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.109

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.650

 this year at least we have a 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.389
