00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 it is ajax psv the tops of it 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.410
 weekend and ten minutes before time shoots 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.090
 tim matavz for the first time on goal it 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.440
 was typical of his competition 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.550
 maybe also before the match of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.530
 psv 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.690
 that at the end with the head bent 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.970
 catacombs popped up looking for one 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.539
 statement 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.130
 oh hot thinking 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.849
 the moment we got the ball there it 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.529
 problem was today because that happened 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.090
 not too often and if so 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.040
 then too few happen to it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.329
 this was actually the only rescue that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.750
 do it for more 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.010
 on the almost bet of zakaria labyad who 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.559
 on the boss of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.510
 matavz just a toe shortage comes on 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.160
 to become really dangerous 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.320
 either way the two zero was one 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 painful defeat 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.710
 warm here with confidence and yes 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.079
 we actually trumped 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.179
 how could he lie it 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.190
 a fierce enough or lost a lot of second 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.780
 balls and if we had to play football 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.449
 We didn't do that so we ajax 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.850
 actually calling me that's a whole lot 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.770
 honest answer but then you ask if 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.509
 sit your head high on the stand 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.670
 think of how can this be the 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.580
 competitions that matter 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.750
 yes exactly and we have that together 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.670
 also talk to each other about that 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.640
 this the best matches and season 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.950
 are against top clubs 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.090
 a yes this is not what we expected 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.950
 had 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.319
 you must blame us a lot 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.960
 take the way lost because after 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.789
 55 minutes scored old PSV 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.869
 he sat he the goal came from the 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.280
 fall 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.170
 I don't think he's that much 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.380
 opportunities has turned the goal 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.460
 Let's face it, that's just one 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.500
 fluke 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.729
 and therefore of course ajax bit it 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.590
 would the helped and 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.600
 but he liked the hair that ball 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.010
 and mine and allowed him on purpose today 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.020
 Shooting Sata might also be one 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.840
 bit the difference in the so-called 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.190
 distance to the man with the ball 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.320
 defensively considering yes there would be 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.909
 may be shorter but I don't think so 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.270
 that he was the big bowls for me 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.810
 cross but look from that distance 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.360
 actually 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.399
 tree white there was in the game of psv 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.440
 powerless but above all unrecognizable 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.569
 compared to that of the last weeks 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.700
 yes i have no idea everyone was absent 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.630
 and that should not happen 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.870
 has that to do with tension 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.190
 diversity no not at all 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.070
 no to Heerenveen had to trudge 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.880
 win no I don't think so 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.040
 where did it go wrong in your eyes you think 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.680
 that they had the upper hand and the game 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.459
 and that we always respond and 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.319
 that that that that the pictures moment we 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.200
 conquered the balls or 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.299
 or the or later title ball then it is 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.579
 normally very strong point to also on 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.840
 to build our combination game too 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.700
 play around like that 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.060
 dig ajax to come play but that 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.799
 that did not work today yes that is already 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.799
 a downside 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.510
 sigh because it's gone differently 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.750
 then you had for center 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.579
 yes indeed everything was beautiful beautiful 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.340
 come back for your Heerenveen competition 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.840
 and then this breed as a pity you have to be on you 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.579
 bite the tongue 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.849
 yes it is it's heartache i want you 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.040
 want to do everything about it 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.930
 then did not work and then that is one 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.790
 sucks 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.680
 to express the marker plastically this 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.810
 had picked up the match Dries Mertens 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.069
 to his opponents 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.349
 and then also make a violation 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.150
 for which that gets yellow that means 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.099
 a suspension for the next game 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.069
 against VVV Venlo 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.049
 the same also applies to marcello see 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.269
 here he trumped the list and he sat down 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.400
 raising the leg raises the penalty kick 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.579
 takes care of the two zero and they determine 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.669
 of the collective on or day of 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.829
 the players and the technical staff 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.569
 much to write but competition 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.730
 deistic enough to know what these 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.949
 defeat means that we have four points 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.650
 stand behind and yes that their tops barge 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:01.079
 we just lost it 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.939
 continue working to vvv 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.319
 like next game to there 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.439
 make sure we get all the points here and 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.209
 so going to fight over in the title fight 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.530
 to stay to just have competitions 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.329
 watch the hope that the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.099
 competitors points out loud 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.859
 allowing us to take it seriously 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.509
 can do but yes how should I not 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.880
 far ahead certainly not after today 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.099
 and that is a firm conclusion after one 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.590
 topper in the Dutch league that 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.930
 so that word hardly deserved it 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.750
 it certainly became a match for PSV 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.699
 very quickly to be forgotten with 0 points back 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.680
 home and just take a seat in the 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.300
 battle for the league title and that applies then 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.280
 of course only for this weekend 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.889
 next week everything can be different again 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.330
 in that crazy Premier League 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.340
 these are the results by all on 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.520
 a row psv loses from a competitor 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.770
 Ajax leader AZ is struggling against RCC 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.780
 waalwijk feyenoord is doing good business 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.449
 doinchem and fc twente on the other hand 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.030
 loses valuable points with ads 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.990
 haag sc heerenveen finally to the top 6 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.240
 complete 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.469
 wind again in this time with four one of 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.909
 VVV Venlo 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.590
 and that is the next one again 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.900
 opponent of psv 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.060
 Saturday night in Eindhoven this is one 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.530
 position az in the lead with 56 points 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.050
 followed by ajax 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.600
 it 55 then there is a small hole after FC 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.790
 twente and psv in place 4 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.190
 five points from the leader in four 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:24.090
 points of place 2nd place that straight 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.830
 gives champions league and preliminary round 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.630
 then these are the top scorers from psv 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.190
 above all , of course, wanted nothing 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.140
 dries mertens remains in the lead with 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.710
 18 goals this season 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.710
