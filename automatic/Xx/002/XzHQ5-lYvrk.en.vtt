Charles<00:00:03.000> Darwin<00:00:03.449> noted<00:00:03.810> that<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.080> beaks<00:00:04.319> of

Charles Darwin noted that the beaks of

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.590 
Charles Darwin noted that the beaks of
various<00:00:05.069> birds<00:00:05.370> evolved<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.240> suit<00:00:06.450> the

various birds evolved to suit the

ecological niche or role that they fill

ecological niche or role that they fill
their<00:00:09.990> niche<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.440> defined<00:00:10.860> by<00:00:11.070> what<00:00:11.099> they<00:00:11.490> eat

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
their niche is defined by what they eat

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.910 
their niche is defined by what they eat
and<00:00:11.910> how<00:00:11.969> they<00:00:12.300> find<00:00:12.599> food<00:00:12.840> their<00:00:13.469> preferred

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
and how they find food their preferred

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.340 
and how they find food their preferred
habitat<00:00:14.000> where<00:00:15.000> they<00:00:15.179> nest<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.750> many<00:00:16.139> other

things

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.849 
things
which<00:00:23.880> helps<00:00:24.240> reduce<00:00:24.410> competition<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.650> food

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
which helps reduce competition for food

the<00:00:26.789> shape<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.180> their<00:00:27.330> beak<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:27.990> trait

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the shape of their beak is one trait

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.290 
the shape of their beak is one trait
that<00:00:28.529> evolved<00:00:28.980> based<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.460> filling<00:00:29.939> their<00:00:30.090> food

that evolved based on filling their food
niche<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.470> let's<00:00:31.710> take<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> look<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> shape

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
niche so let's take a look at the shape

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.790 
niche so let's take a look at the shape
of<00:00:32.850> various<00:00:33.270> bird<00:00:33.480> beaks<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.050> use<00:00:34.559> their

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
of various bird beaks and use their

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.680

shape as a link to determine what and
how<00:00:36.930> they<00:00:37.140> eat<00:00:37.520> let's<00:00:38.520> start<00:00:38.790> by<00:00:38.940> looking<00:00:39.120> at

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
how they eat let's start by looking at
