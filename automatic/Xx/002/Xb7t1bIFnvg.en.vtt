really make myself feel accountable was
to<00:00:46.079> create<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.530> challenge<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.730> I'm<00:00:48.149> always

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
to create a challenge because I'm always

to create a challenge because I'm always
up<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.840> challenge<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.469> feel<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.739> when

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

like Kate lives in my bedroom it gets
cluttered<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.480> quickly<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:20.380> easily<00:02:20.740> it's

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
cluttered so quickly and so easily it's

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.050 
cluttered so quickly and so easily it's
the<00:02:21.100> point<00:02:21.310> where<00:02:21.459> I'm<00:02:21.520> like<00:02:21.550> how<00:02:21.820> did<00:02:21.970> this

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
the point where I'm like how did this

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.490 
the point where I'm like how did this
even<00:02:22.180> happen<00:02:22.360> things<00:02:22.900> stack<00:02:23.140> up<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.380> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.660 
it's a little ridiculous so I kind of
want<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.450> just<00:02:28.480> focus<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:29.260> getting<00:02:29.650> all<00:02:30.070> areas

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.830 
you wanted to join along and clear your
clutter<00:04:33.580> as<00:04:33.820> well<00:04:34.000> like<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.330> said<00:04:34.390> I<00:04:34.540> want<00:04:34.780> to

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
clutter as well like I said I want to

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.080 
clutter as well like I said I want to
make<00:04:34.960> this<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.260> six-week<00:04:35.919> challenge<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.669> I

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
make this a six-week challenge and I

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.390 
make this a six-week challenge and I
figure<00:04:37.450> that<00:04:37.960> way<00:04:38.140> if<00:04:38.470> there's<00:04:38.680> 30<00:04:39.190> different

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
figure that way if there's 30 different

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.909 
figure that way if there's 30 different
areas<00:04:39.880> I'm<00:04:40.060> decluttering<00:04:40.510> that's<00:04:41.169> an<00:04:41.770> average

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
areas I'm decluttering that's an average

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.520 
areas I'm decluttering that's an average
of<00:04:42.430> five<00:04:42.850> areas<00:04:43.480> to<00:04:43.630> declutter<00:04:43.900> week<00:04:44.230> so<00:04:44.410> it's

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
of five areas to declutter week so it's

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.680 
of five areas to declutter week so it's
not<00:04:44.620> too<00:04:44.830> overwhelming<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.640> lot<00:04:46.120> of<00:04:46.150> them<00:04:46.419> are

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
not too overwhelming a lot of them are

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.040 
not too overwhelming a lot of them are
really<00:04:47.260> small<00:04:47.650> micro<00:04:48.100> areas<00:04:48.580> like<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.840> bench

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
really small micro areas like the bench

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.200 
really small micro areas like the bench
by<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.650> back<00:04:50.919> doors<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.520> that<00:04:51.669> can<00:04:51.820> take<00:04:51.850> long

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
by the back doors and that can take long

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.030 
by the back doors and that can take long
at<00:04:52.360> all<00:04:52.980> medicine

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
at all medicine

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.410 
at all medicine
cabinets<00:04:54.460> and<00:04:54.640> things<00:04:54.760> like<00:04:54.910> that<00:04:54.970> depending

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
cabinets and things like that depending

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.960 
cabinets and things like that depending
on the<00:04:55.570> size<00:04:56.040> shouldn't<00:04:57.040> take<00:04:57.280> terribly<00:04:57.670> long

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
on the size shouldn't take terribly long

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.540 
on the size shouldn't take terribly long
and<00:04:58.000> so<00:04:58.390> some<00:04:59.050> of<00:04:59.080> them<00:04:59.290> will<00:05:00.070> take<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.280> lot<00:05:00.490> more

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
and so some of them will take a lot more

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.940 
and so some of them will take a lot more
effort<00:05:01.150> than<00:05:01.480> others<00:05:01.930> well<00:05:02.200> and<00:05:02.440> so<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.800> wanted

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
effort than others well and so I wanted

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.770 
effort than others well and so I wanted
to<00:05:03.070> kind<00:05:03.250> of<00:05:03.370> Bounce<00:05:03.520> now<00:05:03.880> but<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.150> figured<00:05:04.660> at

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
to kind of Bounce now but I figured at

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.180 
to kind of Bounce now but I figured at
the<00:05:04.870> end<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.080> six<00:05:05.230> weeks<00:05:05.380> that<00:05:05.980> should<00:05:06.010> be

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
the end of six weeks that should be

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.860 
the end of six weeks that should be
plenty<00:05:06.400> of<00:05:06.640> time<00:05:06.940> to<00:05:07.270> get<00:05:07.420> all<00:05:07.630> these

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
plenty of time to get all these

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.540 
plenty of time to get all these
