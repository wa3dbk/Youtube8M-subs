00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 this is real pressure measured at least 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.720
 than after five minutes of rest on and if 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.859
 patient smokes after less than 30 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.290
 minutes after smoking 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.809
 tested traditions on the chair are paid 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.770
 relaxed hand on the table on his shoulder 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.420
 put on a cuff 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.140
 impose the cuff so as to 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.150
 it covers 80 percent of it 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.980
 circumference 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:31.769
 but it is the bottom edge of the cuff 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.790
 must defend from the elbow bend not 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.559
 less than one and a half centimeters 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.149
 checked that the cuff tightly covers 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.480
 surface of the forearm but with it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.829
 not healthy tissue 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.320
 Please note that the tubes 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.780
 pear and gauge cuffs 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.520
 should not be located in the cubital fossa and 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.329
 should not be under the shoulder 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.420
 the subject 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.890
 and should be on the side of all of you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.270
 tired after that attach and 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.670
 manometer cuff 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.650
 in order for it to be on one 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.450
 heart level in the cubital fossa 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.060
 palpable find pulsating 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.369
 brachial artery 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.119
 three fingers medial fossa are 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.310
 which put in the out of the elbow 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.820
 pits palpation finds pulsating 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.100
 brachial artery do it in three 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.439
 The fingers of the hotel are located medial 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.700
 Yankees 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:34.170
 on the artery by the old background 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.270
 air cuff until darley 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.710
 no I will not be higher than the maximum and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.710
 blood flow will stop 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.070
 then turns the valve 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.560
 and let the air out of the cuff will hear 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.479
 vascular tons of sound appearing 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.810
 called the first tone ram polo 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.370
 it corresponds to the systolic longtime 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.380
 continue to reduce the pressure tablet and 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.110
 obey the growing strength of tone 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.270
 which then weaken and disappear 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.270
 the moment the sounds disappear is called 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.440
 the second tone of the city and corresponds 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.350
 historical or minimal pressure 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.300
 after that without removing the cuff holds 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.300
 another dimension envied 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.550
 one three minutes after each measurement 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.260
 blood pressure air out 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.170
 compression cuff release 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.180
 completely when getting repetitive 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.460
 its pressure value is accepted 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.240
 source 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.150
 write the resulting value 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.150
 blood pressure and estimate levon 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.930
 the amount of arterial we measured 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.520
 pressure is 120 by 80 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.770
 millimeters of mercury 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.420
 making a choice what is arterial 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.420
 pressure is optimal
