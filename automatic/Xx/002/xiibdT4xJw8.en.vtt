00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:41.870
 the history of company life protection 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.200
 denotes to us we are born as breeders from 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.790
 my father was a breeder i 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.980
 French painters who later took over 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.650
 My brother and I started with 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.400
 the third party we have expanded with the 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.370
 third parties 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.320
 has done me a lot for that by a few 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.369
 pages will think you managed to give 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.750
 to the 5 trenches and or 25 tractors and let's go 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.310
 we went on like this 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.820
 now the two years we're coming back 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.729
 the farm cultivating for us 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.940
 we rent land we have rented two 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.740
 companies from 100 hectares but now we open 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.300
 a company in congo on our behalf 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.580
 we count back from having previously done 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.710
 on behalf of third parties we now aim the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.479
 new on the spot right on 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.670
 the small enough we did a 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.890
 shed that only two years three years e 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.630
 here to do the third account with 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.970
 the dress and all the exclusion for the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.040
 our machines we do 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.340
 we have a pig farm that 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.700
 are two thousand pigs know my 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.790
 gasco one of which is owned by 500 kg 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.310
 but and two other two in partnership at 30 per 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.080
 one hundred and one megawatt one from Milan and 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.530
 a scan with the fourth that we believe 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.780
 much in the back so the plant 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.700
 but young people like you who succeed in 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.369
 undertake this activity 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.520
 there is support at the level of 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.520
 funding as you see it now but 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.650
 customer the speech quite difficult 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.760
 in the sense that I think I support you 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.870
 it's always been enough 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.380
 let's say that even banking level a 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.520
 level 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.830
 This is your personal Us 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.840
 always still went very well had 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.600
 could have done a lot to have done the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.340
 biogas is by no means a photovoltaic from a 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.650
 mega we did a lot of things 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.070
 obviously as a financial support 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.320
 banking for which there has been need 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.190
 must be an agricultural entrepreneur 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.810
 surely you don't need time 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.640
 surely you can't stay there that is 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.860
 to hasten and what arrives 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.300
 certainly you always have to invent yourself 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.459
 something new you always have to be 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.130
 go ahead and you also have to risk yourself 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.050
 because if not if not if you always do everything 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.989
 on the flat the 6 laps had things 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.489
 guaranteed lets stay hd later in the 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.959
 meanwhile of the jobs we have done 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.579
 important by the however we have 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.860
 made the airport barely touches the snow 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.350
 the airport weighs 180 vehicles in 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.110
 Europe 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.360
 malpensa management a match that created 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.250
 formally on the work 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.710
 otherwise because it helped us a lot 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.280
 to understand the sculpture that employees do not 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:26.570
 so we did employees 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.940
 the machinery park as tractors I saw 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.700
 almost 100 300 john deere sure yes yes yes 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.210
 almost all john deere we have one 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.450
 old friend say passiongeek 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.850
 there is always from my father he had sent to 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.530
 John Deere and then gave you this 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.470
 here we have changed the trenches gone 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.620
 on crohnes and lately from new 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.940
 tractor 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.820
 let's say 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.610
 and you don't work only in this area 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:03.990
 you told me that in domodossola up to asti 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.300
 alessandria milano novara vercelli 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.420
 feel about northern Italy 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.460
 we have done five years of 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.910
 alterations of biomass in france in 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.900
 Spain 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.330
 we are in Sardinia and we do everything in 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.299
 these seas here and now made the 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.400
 mind that not 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.510
 according to what we have been the company in 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.880
 congo 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.280
 let's try, let's try, tell 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.150
 something when you return the cultures of 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.190
 in short, a bit of precision was spoken of 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.490
 even earlier with regards to driving 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.680
 parallel to you, variable hours instead 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.230
 what you adopted here 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.840
 we have seven parallel guides on the 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.700
 our tractors with 12 tractors 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.860
 predisposed for which we change jean todt 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.550
 valley satellite guide helps us 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.380
 very very much 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.300
 in fact also on the settings of the 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.760
 machines on one thing on the other is 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.680
 important to know the positions well 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.150
 of tractors to know all the i 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.220
 commands would still go 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.890
 a unification from the office of 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.840
 to be able to understand all the maneuvers that 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.700
 employees can do but not for 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.480
 check employee but to be able to 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.710
 help him perform well because 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.560
 of agriculture is not a job of 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.880
 factory that one starts to print one 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.680
 3 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.970
 a form of whatever and remains 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.550
 that all day to us 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.440
 we find in the same field three types of 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.990
 different terrain and therefore we need 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.480
 of people formed but here we are in series 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.120
 of ceresole of dawn we rent between 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.840
 rental owners have about 300 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.720
 330 has two other companies are a white 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.280
 and the other to trino we do everything 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.670
 first and second harvested corn 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.290
 we did we tried last year 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.900
 a part of combined file and this year 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.450
 we have accentuated a little more than of 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.240
 before last year on twin lines 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.570
 we arrived at an 80 90 hectares of 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.370
 file matched this year and we find ourselves 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.070
 pretty well we started the 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.260
 speech with the combined row this year 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:10.310
 as a contracting company and then later 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:13.610
 we have passed the agricultural seeder 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.240
 he sows all the seeds for others 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.330
 end is undermined 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.570
 we think that by intensifying the seed 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:25.240
 increasing the seed on the ground yes 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:28.090
 may be better even if on the line 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.810
 single becomes too too often for 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:34.240
 which according to us to falsify with a 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.280
 matched row is better or there was 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.490
 the other system of 50 centimeters but 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.980
 staggering all the yards became 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.170
 too difficult when we believe more 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.020
 then in the combined row 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.060
 especially of the paired row myself 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.450
 I think very determined to which even later 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:56.250
 in the second the crops in the soy and of the 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:59.290
 rowan the combined end you don't really have 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.420
 imbalances on a normal 75 yard 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.250
 in the sense that it is only a combined row 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.680
 for which it slightly tightens all the 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.720
 weeding equipment 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.850
 otherwise it is all equal to the whole 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.430
 the rest is 75 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:15.390
 therefore it involves absolutely no 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.770
 no discomfort in work or 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.260
 how many more could it be 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.870
 sow 50 or thirty or forty as 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.850
 it may be different but not 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.610
 creates no problems for which in my opinion 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:30.070
 it is an absolute advantage in the company 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.350
 have a single site to work on 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.910
 75 the combined row and especially 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.310
 this machine here that the first 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.830
 foldable with eight rows combined 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.040
 we have compared it with a 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:44.530
 I work several times for the needs 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.110
 all the issues is certainly a 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.410
 excellent collaboration and a comparison 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:53.020
 all giorgio do not say daily but 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:55.150
 weekly with these machines and then 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.430
 we are going on every day 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:01.200
 to improve to make matters for 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.200
 being able to use it as much as possible
