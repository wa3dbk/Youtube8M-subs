00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 well I logically happy the first 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.790
 very nervous meeting I feel like this 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.679
 totally nervous completely not 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.769
 I knew it was so much time on television 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.260
 so many years but I really did not know how 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.660
 this is a real academy a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.930
 professional academy a team 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.180
 awesome puts you none in one 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.650
 room then goes through another room after 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.900
 goes through an entire filter 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.830
 megaproduction that my life in history 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.480
 I have seen my life 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.540
 to a very intense training because it is 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.040
 rehearse from Monday to Friday and re 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.260
 accustomed to the body to a whole 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.760
 good transformation if it's good 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.180
 worried as I said because 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.530
 logically the bones are rusted and 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.350
 here you have to dance here you have to dance 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.660
 really then we're going with I have 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.730
 an age a little strong do not lose 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.500
 Well, two people enter precisely 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.480
 houses and that is a much bigger effort 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.000
 not because it's dividing you between this 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.790
 program and the other yes it is an effort 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.440
 because they are all live is much 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.700
 effort but with God's blessing 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.860
 come on let's try to achieve it this 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.380
 tumbes is that it is a great runner has it been 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.440
 has won several several various contests 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.950
 cups and this 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.390
 but you never know until I'm a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.490
 very demanding person not 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.490
 and this do not forget that apart 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.140
 I'm her I've never been so nervous 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.500
 because now I'm going to really dance 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.900
 can 35 years all the bones so 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.330
 rusty I say it again then it 's 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.060
 very difficult what we are living what 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.860
 I'm going to have a hard time even though the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.920
 enough pace is more identified and 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.650
 what pace would you say and if it's a challenge 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.570
 for me we would not love to dance music 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:58.350
 of the 60 70 music of the 80 flashdance 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.350
 those things you understand my disco music 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.080
 those things are fun because it's 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.180
 nostalgia people will like more 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.140
 that the current music the target audience 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.520
 are the signs is the whole country sees it not and 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.840
 I think that that will never happen 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.090
 Classical music fashion 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:22.769
 that's me and I love, I would never, ever, like 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.620
 reggaeton dancing is current things I do not 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.390
 like these duties also with no 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 kind of music I'm older and I 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.330
 I am more camilo sesto or for me 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.460

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.720
 omar 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.510

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.690

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.230

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.920
 I know that the only thing there are three 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.550
 choreographers who have hired and there's 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.110
 more, so I can ask for more 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.760

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.260
 be connected to social networks 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.010
 when they teach me so that little by little 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.010
 they are supporting me
