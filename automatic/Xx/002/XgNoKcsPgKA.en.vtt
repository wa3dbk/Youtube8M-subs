00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.550
 crawling through the internet we saw that in 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:21.550
 us there is an aquapark of people that a 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.150
 Once a year he lets dogs in and we believe 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.720
 we thought this would be a good idea to do 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.000
 a permanent aquapark for dogs 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.510
 the idea is that it's a cup for dogs 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.510
 not for people you can accompany the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 pet inside the water but without swimming 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.129
 The idea is that dogs can come 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.860
 can swim and those who have not stepped on 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.469
 never for this reason if you realize the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.899
 entrance is very soft very beach type 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.629
 gradual so there is dog that likes 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.699
 more to splash than to swim the dog what 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.820
 I like the most is to be in contact with the 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.820
 Water 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.130
 return 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.289
 the female 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.030
 in addition to the water that the other throws more 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.329
 soon and tastes good nothing a little better 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.100
 but hey it 's inside and they're all still 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.020
 the ones called a little bit and you're going 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.789
 running after having a good time because I 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.380
 I have come with my husband and with my two 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:25.149
 bitches a boxer to be called and a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.280
 bloodhound that is called vicky and now you 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.869
 love water more than bone 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.869
 but well we are there trying to 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.220
 see if he likes me I also love 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.899
 I have a dog a little bit with a 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.360
 weird character thought it's going to be 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.830
 complicated and for nothing are enjoying 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.720
 everyone each in his sauce and with his hair 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.119
 is enjoying that I was thinking of leaving before 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.520
 and look I'm still not here I love I think 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.880
 that we will come every week because I know 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.740
 The dog is better, but the owner knows 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.450
 It happens very well because you see that your pet 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.750
 does unusual things 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.360
 and has a great time and as a reward 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.399
 for the owner because we assure him that it is 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.960
 leaving here will be two days without 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.219
 dog because the dog will be 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.219
 sleeping for a couple of days
