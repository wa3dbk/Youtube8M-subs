 First, less processed meat is worse. 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.370
 was the American institute for 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.800
 cancer research 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.170
 meats processed as sausage by 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.820
 example are linked to an increased risk of 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.590
 cervical cancer 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.680
 these products also tends to have many 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.350
 fat and cholesterol targets and very little 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.940
 nutrients as children second worst 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.180
 food potato chips already know that at 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.450

 you may not know is that potato chips 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.040
 yesterday I ac milan me the amount of 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.140
 carcinogens or to form with the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.160
 foods are baked or fried at high 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.240
 temperatures 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:34.050
 then from the potatoes there 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.600
 third worst to me margarine advertise 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.069
 as a healthy alternative free of 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.830
 cholesterol in relation to butter 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.500
 margarine is the best source of fats 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.479
 are elevated blood levels of 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.090
 cholesterol and cause damage 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.899
 then of this false material and goes from 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.880
 other monounsaturated fats 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:58.770
 fourth worst food soda is one 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.580
 the easiest ways to increase 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.610
 your weight 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.720
 the can, for example, contains 10 tablespoons of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.280
 sugar tea 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.709
 he has only two soft drinks per 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 week may almost double the risk of a 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.080
 person to get pancreatic cancer 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.060
 consume more than 22 thousand soft drinks 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.730
 sugars could increase 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.280
 significantly reduced the risk of death 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.030
 cardiovascular disease as well as the risk 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.849
 of developing fifth worst diabetes 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.120
 food sweeteners 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.090
 every year every Brazilian consumes 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.519
 more granulated sweeteners and is also 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:42.370
 called sucrose fructose naturally 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.310
 so with artificial sweeteners also 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.290
 so - called non-nutritive sweeteners that 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.310
 are considered safe for beings 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.280
 acesulfame potassium 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.950
 aspartame neo- saccharin and 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.769
 sucralose some sugar substitute 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.629
 can leave with taste in the mouth but this 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.090
 it's not the only thing much about them 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.220
 while we go we sweeteners 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.879
 because they are zero low 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.099
 calorie 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.420
 we really do not know how they are 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.090
 bad for us 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.000
 at the end of the day these sweeteners in 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.040
 suzuka can increase significantly 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.569
 the risk of health problems such as 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.030
 great weight metabolic syndrome diabetes 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.989
 type 2 and cardiovascular diseases 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:34.299
 the sixth worst popcorn food of 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:37.239
 microwave an example and back taste 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.400
 butter that microwave really 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.319
 does not have a taste of butter itself 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.760
 this is a fact 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.030
 know how to hear from products 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.120
 chemicals and flavoring agents for days and 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.450
 uncle is the major problem for health and 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.519
 who have points in fields on day 7 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.380
 wellington jean and flavorings 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.870
 butter used in exchange for 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.109
 microwave 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.579
 but another additional concern is the 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.040
 it's in the bag 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.750
 in addition to popcorn in all products 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.060
 chemicals added 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.739
 there are many chemicals that coat 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.780
 the inside of the bag to keep the eyes 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.269
 products and the products 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.060
 chemicals for sex do not catch fire 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.250
 during the process of doing for some 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.570
 a form and microwave popcorn does not 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:29.099
 will be so much more seven worse food is 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.099
 obvious fried foods 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.310
 one of the problems with the ingestion of 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.250
 fried foods that cook the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.310
 high temperature foods can 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:46.210
 compound with the topics and then 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.870
 How do you see a lot of French fries? 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.640
 will not only increase your waistline and will 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.530
 as it is also connected to problems 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.810
 health such as stroke 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.150
 Brain increase a risk of certain 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.350
 types of cancer including breast cancer 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.150
 esophagus head and neck lung pancreas 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.580
 and prostate 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.940
 the man for example and eating less 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.190
 Beans chicken for me was perfect and 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.320
 other french fries one or more times 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.770
 per week increases risk of cancer 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.110
 own or fruit faith to 37% 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.140
 so if you eat these foods 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.920
 daily to avoid them as they 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.910
 can be a big problem for you 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.300
 in the future 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.620
 so I said ok if you liked the video see 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.620
 It plays down there yesterday.
