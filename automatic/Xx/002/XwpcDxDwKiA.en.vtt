excel<00:07:26.849> or<00:07:26.939> anything<00:07:27.119> last<00:07:27.389> I<00:07:27.869> guess<00:07:28.739> a<00:07:29.009> one<00:07:29.549> on

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 
excel or anything last I guess a one on

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.909 
excel or anything last I guess a one on
five<00:07:29.939> gives<00:07:30.239> us<00:07:30.389> an<00:07:30.539> overall<00:07:30.779> score<00:07:31.139> of<00:07:31.169> two

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 
five gives us an overall score of two

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.699 
five gives us an overall score of two
and<00:07:32.039> a<00:07:32.069> half<00:07:32.249> out<00:07:32.459> of<00:07:32.489> five<00:07:32.610> so<00:07:33.499> that's<00:07:34.499> why<00:07:34.679> I

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:34.709 
and a half out of five so that's why I

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:36.499 
and a half out of five so that's why I
think<00:07:34.799> three<00:07:35.159> test<00:07:35.519> wise<00:07:35.729> the<00:07:36.059> lemon<00:07:36.239> alone

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:36.509 
think three test wise the lemon alone

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.509 
think three test wise the lemon alone
runs<00:07:36.719> a<00:07:36.809> bit<00:07:36.989> yeah<00:07:37.439> oh<00:07:37.709> yeah<00:07:38.159> and<00:07:38.309> don't<00:07:38.369> forget

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:38.519 
runs a bit yeah oh yeah and don't forget

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.779 
runs a bit yeah oh yeah and don't forget
