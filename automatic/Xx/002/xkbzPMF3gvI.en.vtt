00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.799
 I thank you better, but I need 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.720
 know why he did not get mad at you 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.120
 bitkom to noa noa 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.660
 it's like that 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660
 but 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.020
 I have to go if you are going to take care of 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.730
 francs 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.730
 at kmart stores 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.160
 I tell you bossi to anyone else yes 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.680
 and he made me 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.920
 and I think it was not reciprocated if 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.600
 I may not know but that I did not see it 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.290
 anger 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.540
 22 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.630
 and now I am because I do what I do 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.390
 but 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.150
 it feels good you are experiencing the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.820
 human emotion 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.860
 I do not know 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.980
 but what I do know I want to be all 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.940
 the time with her and with her son tomÃ¡s 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.900
 like when I'm with them, 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.280
 way the body the soul I do not know everything is 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.030
 bad 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 but he's neglecting francs not if he 's 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.540
 what worries me and I'm sure that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.240
 your revelation has to do with my 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.920
 mission 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.690
 I do not say it that's why I'm weak or I say it 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.630
 because he's a friend who will listen to you and 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.720
 pay attention 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.550
