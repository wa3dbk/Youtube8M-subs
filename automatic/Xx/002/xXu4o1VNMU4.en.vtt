00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.860
 Greetings people here your company is blogger 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.230
 man bringing you an instant video 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.390
 I say instantaneous because I just saw the 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.190
 new steven cars and based on that 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.650
 I elaborated this video of theories and 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.599
 curiosities as indeed this revealed 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.419
 many secrets but before you start 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:27.009
 I want to send a greeting to word efe ji 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:29.230
 yoon jairo 345 death 67 tomÃ¡s 13 y 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.930
 sorrento aquarium so good people 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.180
 as I tell you, I just made this video like this 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.829
 we started because people finally 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.500
 revealed the new episode of the second 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.270
 sword season for the swordsman and 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.280
 I must say that it was indeed more than 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.660
 revealing as it showed us quite 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.610
 information not only about the great war 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.130
 that's not since the intro already 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.560
 they revealed certain curiosities so 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.990
 people let's start with this video the 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.180
 which will include theories and curiosities 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.250
 the first one can be said that since the intro 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.500
 a theory with and to the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.780
 seem to carry the rest of the series the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.880
 sword of rose so if it is so 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.619
 would fulfill my theory that I did in my video 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.630
 I'll leave the link in the 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.819
 description for them to check and it's 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.080
 that I proposed that with and take a more role 

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.300
 primary bone 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.340
 of being a secondary character and it would be 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.530
 a principal apparently in this 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.420
 episode shows that she lady the 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.640
 attack and steven the defense 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.100
 I basically feel that in the future 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.260
 steven will realize that coli is a lot 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.960
 better with the sword and that is the fittest 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.600
 to handle it so steven will give away 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.520
 with and the rose sword as it is 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.070
 mentioned in the chapter both will fight 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.500
 together one will protect the other so that 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.660
 will behave the sword rose which in 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.940
 electro looks great at the end 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.100
 fantasy then the size of the sword of 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.140
 rose is very large but in effect with and 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.820
 It looks good and is also shown in Cho 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.800
 chapter that few sessions of 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.020
 training with it dominates the high 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.270
 level of pearl combat to which she and 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.430
 steven will face pearl and almost the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.200
 defeat or that from this 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.450
 moment with him will become a 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.320
 main character and defender of 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.690
 planet Earth 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.210
 so let's hope that this bonus also 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.160
 master the art of the sword 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.810
 another important mega point is the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.209
 pearl souvenir during the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.400
 pearl training shows a memory 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.380
 of rose and she on the battlefield in 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.860
 this rose moment will be attacked by a 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.170
 gem 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.960
 but not any gem not ladies and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.090
 jasper gentlemen apparently jasper not only 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.340
 he was in the great war but she 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.560
 yes fought against rose although in the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.780
 chapter the return she mentions that 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.030
 I wanted to see Rose because I had heard 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.130
 of her and that although this one was in the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.830
 great war did not talk about some combat 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.990
 with rose so it's kind of confusing or 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.510
 Rebecca Sugar did this to mislead us 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.760
 or indeed jaspers and fought against rose 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.520
 quartz also look at the dimensions of 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.950
 rose and natalia super are huge almost 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.750
 the size of a merger is also seen 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.000
 that this gem carries the ax that 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.220
 found in the amethyst room 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.500
 that there is more than one jasper gem 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.750
 or indeed that age is there to make all 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.850
 we know what he theorized that in 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.190
 jasper effect not only participated in the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.530
 war but he almost faced rose 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.750
 I say almost because maybe your allies 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.330
 and came face to jasper 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.340
 which jasper did not fight against rose 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.070
 If he was not, he would have asked for revenge 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.410
 rose when it returned to the planet 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.049
 what I can tell you is that 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.880
 if rose faced such colossal gems 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.250
 she really is something 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.470
 not just very careful but a lot 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.230
 much force then to fight against 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.510
 gems so big this really should 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.880
 have a higher level of strength, that is, 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.160
 if it's that strong just imagine the 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.040
 merged not sure she will be able to finish 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.350
 with thousands of enemies merged the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.750
 third point is pearl and is that in this 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.370
 episode are revealed a few curiosities 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.680
 that clarify many things 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.780
 apparently pearl indeed went to the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.030
 very young war because in the memory it 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.430
 appreciates with its childish appearance and 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.440
 Another point to note is that it does not use 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.630
 his spear but a sword to which 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.790
 theorizing and apparently following 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.920
 reveals that pearl always defended rose 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.230
 and this one was fighting before rose 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.360
 will start a fight however this one 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.120
 she was always defeated to which pearl 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.160
 died according to this episode three times the 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.470
 first for an ax the of the possible and 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.660
 jasper the second by a rope with 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.489
 peaks and the third by lightning 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.100
 which he theorized that every time a 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.140
 gem recreates your physical form this can 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.270
 modify his weapon to which he would explain 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.340
 why that jasper has a helmet on 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.340
 semicircular shape and because the move 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.919
 jasper has a 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.080
 angular I also feel that every time 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.210
 pearl reappeared or rather it 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.790
 regenerated this octave by modifying its 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.010
 weapon not without first saving a copy of 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.169
 your previous weapon then remember that the 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.090
 gems are able to invoke more than one 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.040
 weapon as we saw in the gem of the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.260
 mirror when pearl fought against two 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.990
 water pearls and this one and its rigging two 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.060
 you throw so I feel that each sword 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.550
 who has fought some important combat 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.860
 and store some memory in it 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.870
 with her he defended rose quartz so 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.340
 I think that in this new season or 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.530
 well he will continue with his spear 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.540
 definitely choose your sword 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.400
 I also feel that pearl already gave him 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.919
 connie a sword however 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.570
 possibly in a future episode this one 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.880
 break and it will be at that moment that 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.800
 steven will give you the rose sword other 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.110
 important fact is that in one of the 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.570
 pearl deaths apparently lightning the 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.400
 impact this would show that possibly 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.470
 yellow diamond if it controls the 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.270
 electricity to which the theory that 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.940
 I took out long ago that diamonds 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.740
 they are elementary if it would be true and now 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.470
 you have to see if onion is a villain and 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.420
 I will die happy another curious fact is that at 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.970
 look like pearl had a 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.830
 child or that really should have 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.140
 be traumatic for her to go to war 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.480
 so young and see so many gems die 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.550
 fianl at the last point when pearl 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.890
 leads connie stevens to train at 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.260
 celestial sanctuary are appreciated the 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.140
 diamonds again but this time there's 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.840
 a new one a pink diamond to be like that 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.720
 this would show that the diamonds and rose 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.130
 Quartz could be related 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.110
 basically pearl at that time account 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.300
 that gems once trained there 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.890
 against the fiercest warriors 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.630
 that the humans of antiquity 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.660
 they could have fought against the 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.730
 diamond then look at the three diamonds and 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.860
 one rose to which each time it takes more 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.290
 force the theory that I put about that 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.180
 rose and the lovers are related 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.610
 just as I mentioned it in my pick of 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.800
 coliseum in addition to continue well so 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.200
 it is probably revealed that rose in 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.390
 effect was the queen of the planet gene and 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.090
 that at some point this was diamond 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.670
 pink and finally the last and most 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.830
 apparently steven already dominates the 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.930
 shield and force field of will or 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.120
 be that she has greater mastery about 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.200
 of his powers which would show that or 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.300
 well the training 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.430
 west account simply has a 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.410
 natural talent for now he is capable 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.750
 to make his shield appear at will 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.360
 as well as master the time and size of 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.670
 its force field basically being 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.980
 that if it continues like this, Steven will be so strong 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.290
 like rose and this will check the 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.420
 diamonds if the video you liked give me 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.700
 like and share it subscribe to my channel 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.860
 to know before anyone about my 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.780
 videos in addition every time a 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.660
 new chapter even in English 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.460
 I'll get out the curiosities and theories bush 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.860
 as we saw they are being more and more 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:22.750
 developers and especially have a great day 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.750
 his company schlÃ¶der man spoke to them
