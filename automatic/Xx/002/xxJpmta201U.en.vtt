goldfish<00:02:21.079> cracker<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:24.260> looks<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.799> lot<00:02:24.950> like

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
goldfish cracker and it looks a lot like

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.100 
goldfish cracker and it looks a lot like
a<00:02:25.220> real<00:02:25.489> goldfish<00:02:26.030> cracker<00:02:26.299> and<00:02:26.629> it<00:02:26.780> took<00:02:26.900> me<00:02:27.079> a

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
a real goldfish cracker and it took me a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.259 
a real goldfish cracker and it took me a
long<00:02:27.290> time<00:02:27.349> to<00:02:27.709> get<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.950> shape<00:02:28.189> right<00:02:28.220> but<00:02:29.180> it

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
long time to get the shape right but it

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:36.819 
long time to get the shape right but it
looks<00:02:29.450> like<00:02:29.599> this<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:34.870> then<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.900> made<00:02:36.319> this

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
looks like this and then I made this

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.110 
looks like this and then I made this
little<00:02:37.480> coconut<00:02:38.480> cookie<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.879> so<00:02:40.879> it's<00:02:41.030> a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
little coconut cookie and so it's a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.300 
little coconut cookie and so it's a
coconut<00:02:41.540> drink<00:02:41.780> cookie<00:02:42.079> and<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.739> don't<00:02:43.099> know

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
coconut drink cookie and I don't know

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.099 
coconut drink cookie and I don't know
where<00:02:43.609> I<00:02:43.640> got<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:44.000> inspiration<00:02:44.150> for<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.870> I

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
where I got the inspiration for this I

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.729 
where I got the inspiration for this I
just<00:02:45.409> randomly<00:02:46.540> got<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.780> idea<00:02:48.109> of<00:02:48.200> making<00:02:48.290> it

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
just randomly got the idea of making it

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.319 
just randomly got the idea of making it
so<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.310> looks<00:02:49.519> like<00:02:49.700> this<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.319> all<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:52.329> icing

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
so it looks like this and all the icing

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.720 
so it looks like this and all the icing
on<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:54.109> cookie<00:02:54.409> is<00:02:54.590> made<00:02:54.799> with<00:02:55.010> TLS<00:02:55.310> and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
on the cookie is made with TLS and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.030 
on the cookie is made with TLS and
there's<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.269> fruit<00:02:56.510> cane<00:02:56.750> slice<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.620> painted

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
there's a fruit cane slice and I painted

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.839 
there's a fruit cane slice and I painted
on<00:02:58.189> a<00:02:58.250> face<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.620> back<00:03:00.799> is<00:03:01.010> textured<00:03:01.459> as<00:03:01.670> well

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
on a face the back is textured as well

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.009 
on a face the back is textured as well
and<00:03:03.489> then<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.519> made<00:03:04.879> this<00:03:05.090> tiny<00:03:05.480> tiny<00:03:05.810> tiny

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
and then I made this tiny tiny tiny

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.559 
and then I made this tiny tiny tiny
charm<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.950> it's<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.459> tiny<00:03:08.359> little<00:03:08.510> glittery
