bicycles<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.570> fold<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.830> our<00:00:23.070> bikes<00:00:23.279> Fulton

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
bicycles that fold all our bikes Fulton

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.290 
bicycles that fold all our bikes Fulton
basically<00:00:24.689> after<00:00:24.869> size<00:00:25.670> to<00:00:26.670> fit<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.060> trunk

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
basically after size to fit in the trunk

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.439 
basically after size to fit in the trunk
or<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> closet<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.730> they<00:00:29.880> fall<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.390> you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
or in the closet and so they fall so you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.389 
or in the closet and so they fall so you
started<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> company<00:00:31.260> absolutely<00:00:31.949> how<00:00:32.219> many

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
started the company absolutely how many

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.330 
started the company absolutely how many
years<00:00:32.579> ago<00:00:32.759> uh<00:00:32.960> that's<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.050> good<00:00:34.170> question<00:00:34.350> 1987

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
years ago uh that's a good question 1987

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.110 
years ago uh that's a good question 1987
so<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> was<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.180> mess<00:00:37.160> 22<00:00:38.160> years<00:00:38.399> what<00:00:39.000> were

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so what it was a mess 22 years what were

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.440 
so what it was a mess 22 years what were
you<00:00:39.210> doing<00:00:39.480> before<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.989> are<00:00:40.140> folding<00:00:40.350> bikes<00:00:40.739> I

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
you doing before you are folding bikes I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
you doing before you are folding bikes I
was<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> student<00:00:42.870> at<00:00:43.140> MIT<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.610> that's<00:00:44.760> why

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
was a student at MIT and so that's why

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.880 
was a student at MIT and so that's why
we're<00:00:45.120> right<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.690> Cambridge<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.260> shadows

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
we're right here in Cambridge in shadows

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.549 
we're right here in Cambridge in shadows
of<00:00:47.010> energy<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.879> were<00:00:48.000> studying<00:00:48.559> bicycles

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
of energy and you were studying bicycles

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.950 
of energy and you were studying bicycles
or<00:00:49.860> computers<00:00:50.579> or<00:00:50.789> hot<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.690> don't<00:00:51.870> they

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
or computers or hot you they don't they

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750 
or computers or hot you they don't they
don't<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.230> bicycle<00:00:52.890> studies<00:00:53.190> although<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
don't have bicycle studies although and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.279 
don't have bicycle studies although and
at<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.090> time<00:00:54.149> they<00:00:54.510> didn't<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.750> don't<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.140> do

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
at that time they didn't I don't they do

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.060 
at that time they didn't I don't they do
now<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.739> aeronautics<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
now but the I was aeronautics and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.599 
now but the I was aeronautics and
astronautics<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.180> aerospace<00:01:00.539> engineering

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
astronautics so as aerospace engineering

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.549 
astronautics so as aerospace engineering
why<00:01:02.609> don't<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.879> make<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> shuttle

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
why don't you make it like a shuttle

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.609 
why don't you make it like a shuttle
instead<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.250> bicycle<00:01:06.170> bicycles<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.290> simply

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
instead of a bicycle bicycles are simply

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.490 
instead of a bicycle bicycles are simply
yes<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.270> did<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.780> worked<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.470> year

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
yes I actually did I worked a year

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.810 
yes I actually did I worked a year
before<00:01:11.210> MIT<00:01:12.210> yet<00:01:12.360> Boeing<00:01:12.840> making<00:01:13.820> airplanes

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
before MIT yet Boeing making airplanes

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.270 
before MIT yet Boeing making airplanes
but<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.650> big<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:16.920> me<00:01:17.250> I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
but it was a little bit big for me I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.390 
but it was a little bit big for me I
didn't<00:01:17.640> count<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.330> much

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.670 

we<00:01:23.400> make<00:01:23.640> full-sized<00:01:24.680> high-performance

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
we make full-sized high-performance

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.399 
we make full-sized high-performance
bicycles<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.310> fold<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:27.420> folding<00:01:27.869> bicycles

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
bicycles that fold not folding bicycles

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.440 
bicycles that fold not folding bicycles
to<00:01:28.920> wait<00:01:29.100> sorry<00:01:29.369> say<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.580> again<00:01:29.729> remake

to wait sorry say that again remake

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.780 
to wait sorry say that again remake
full-size<00:01:30.900> high-performance<00:01:31.710> bicycles<00:01:32.369> that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
full-size high-performance bicycles that

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.980 
full-size high-performance bicycles that
fold<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.360> all<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.690> bells<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
fold they have all the bells and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.469 
fold they have all the bells and
whistles<00:01:34.080> that<00:01:34.560> any<00:01:34.860> other<00:01:35.270> conventional<00:01:36.270> non

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
whistles that any other conventional non

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.980 
whistles that any other conventional non
folding<00:01:36.869> bike<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.909> also<00:01:39.210> fold

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
folding bike have but they also fold

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.200 
folding bike have but they also fold
they<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.619> added<00:01:41.009> feature<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.580> none<00:01:42.180> of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
they have one added feature that none of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.670 
they have one added feature that none of
the<00:01:42.360> other<00:01:42.509> bikes<00:01:42.690> have<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.289> is<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.560> they

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the other bikes have that is that they

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:55.840 
the other bikes have that is that they
fall<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.159> throw<00:01:44.640> them<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.789> that<00:01:44.940> closet

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.660 

so<00:01:56.850> actually<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.319> tell<00:01:58.619> me<00:01:58.710> how<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.130> fold

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so actually can you tell me how to fold

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.090 
so actually can you tell me how to fold
this<00:01:59.850> thing<00:02:00.090> how<00:02:00.240> easy<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.920> what's

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
this thing how easy or what so what's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.749 
this thing how easy or what so what's
the<00:02:02.220> deal<00:02:02.399> well<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:04.190> we've<00:02:05.190> invented<00:02:05.550> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the deal well so the we've invented a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.090 
the deal well so the we've invented a
new<00:02:05.789> system<00:02:06.300> called<00:02:06.330> clicks<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.500> allows<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
new system called clicks that allows you

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.559 
new system called clicks that allows you
to<00:02:08.190> take<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.519> front<00:02:08.670> wheel<00:02:08.759> off<00:02:09.060> very<00:02:09.360> easily

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
to take the front wheel off very easily

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.229 
to take the front wheel off very easily
you<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.560> unlock<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.489> quick<00:02:11.670> release<00:02:11.850> and

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
you just unlock the quick release and

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.770 
you just unlock the quick release and
then<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:14.610> wheel<00:02:14.790> comes<00:02:15.030> off<00:02:15.180> with<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> little

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
then the wheel comes off with a little

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.620 
then the wheel comes off with a little
basically<00:02:16.380> push<00:02:16.620> pull<00:02:17.299> so<00:02:18.299> that's<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.600> very

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
basically push pull so that's a very

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.160 
basically push pull so that's a very
simple<00:02:19.350> property<00:02:20.130> easy<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.760> know<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.480> then

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
simple property easy you know and then

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.500 
simple property easy you know and then
there's<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.920> frame<00:02:23.220> quick-release<00:02:23.670> right<00:02:24.030> here

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
there's a frame quick-release right here

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.080 
there's a frame quick-release right here
the<00:02:24.720> gun<00:02:25.019> lock<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.620> again<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.790> simple

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the gun lock and again it's a simple
