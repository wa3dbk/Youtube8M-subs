00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.910
 I'm going to fine-tune my bike and 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.050
 For this I'm going to make it even more 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.600
 Brazilian 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.990
 Let's change the front suspension for 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.420
 a unix board made here in Brazil in 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.880
 They are Joseph of the fields and with 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.410
 bike going is lighter 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.600
 this expression nothing then this here is 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.850
 a single the only suspension the top of 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.380
 prosoft line then side looks the part 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.660
 of the shock absorber is part of this type of 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.520
 energy side a is the fashion side then 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.649
 this side here is all the oil with a 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.380
 issue of getting underneath and a 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.390
 and on the other side you are 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.610
 for the whole question of the effect of the ball 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.440
 that you have a positive air camera and 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.330
 in the case of these specific people have 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.220
 also a negative-air camera 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.410
 the fact that you have both cameras with 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.440
 independent regulation allows one to 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.330
 adjusting range and adjust- 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.729
 suspension in accordance with the style 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.710
 weight or the terrain that you 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.710
 to use the took yesterday neighborhood 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 since the launch of it is a success is 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.650
 properly to the web system that 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.360
 allows this regulation and everyone who 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.390
 adjusts to suspension gets to the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.370
 optimal regulation does not change the fact that 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.810
 not correct can do 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.620
 that you believe the product does not 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.030
 is not good 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.100
 adjusted the two 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.950
 according to a table of 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.510
 according to the weight goes up on the bike 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.800
 tests quote according to your weight 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.960
 walking on the ground that has oscillations 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.000
 small and small but in the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.200
 land you will put a little more 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.479
 air in negative camera 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.920
 if you are going to use the suspension in a 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.170
 land that is freer has only 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.600
 big voucher you put a little more 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.759
 air in the positive and closes a camera 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.350
 little more then the return options 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.100
 adjustment of a hydraulic person are 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.869
 many 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.940
 The ideal is to understand how each 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.649
 one of these settings so that you 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.459
 can enjoy all that the product has 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.310
 offer you 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.330
 the return regulation it exists is to 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.770
 that you 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.600
 depending on the terrain your style of 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.050
 can leave the wheel in 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.630
 contact with the soil and now 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.630
 the hand in the mass the exchange of the suspension 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.190
 So she'll lose weight what I think 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.680
 I think in our case we are 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.080
 picking up aluminum aluminum 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.020
 content inside is the same as what we 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.530
 let's have that it would be work that is spring is 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.530
 immobile 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:20.350
 even before 160 grams 170 have 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:25.090
 Another lighter table turbine will not 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:29.170
 by the we go up to 110 grams that wins 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.230
 60 grams national since the original 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:38.560
 is 310 grams 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:40.960
 the isi flow will be 180 grams 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.610
 grammes and personnel here do not 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.890
 are weighing the suspension ready for 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.310
 be used at the correct size already 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.510
 adult by renata falzoni her weight 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:57.840
 860 380 grams lighter and is made in the 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.840
