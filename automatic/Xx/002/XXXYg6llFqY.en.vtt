00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.540 
i'm here today to talk to you about your
backyard<00:00:10.170> swimming<00:00:10.320> pool<00:00:10.590> but<00:00:11.280> i'm<00:00:11.370> going<00:00:11.490> to

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
backyard swimming pool but i'm going to

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.980 
backyard swimming pool but i'm going to
refer<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.090> chemical<00:00:12.599> soup<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.870> your

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
refer to it as the chemical soup in your

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.270 
refer to it as the chemical soup in your
backyard<00:00:13.170> because<00:00:13.530> that's<00:00:13.679> indeed<00:00:14.040> what<00:00:14.070> it

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
backyard because that's indeed what it

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.540 
backyard because that's indeed what it
is<00:00:14.509> your<00:00:15.509> pool<00:00:15.750> can<00:00:16.440> get<00:00:16.619> easily<00:00:16.830> contaminated

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
is your pool can get easily contaminated

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.480 
is your pool can get easily contaminated
with<00:00:17.640> things<00:00:17.910> like<00:00:18.080> algae<00:00:19.080> bacteria<00:00:19.490> fungus

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
with things like algae bacteria fungus

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.759 
with things like algae bacteria fungus
mold<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.600> very<00:00:21.869> easily<00:00:21.930> become<00:00:22.470> contaminated

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
mold can very easily become contaminated

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.349 
mold can very easily become contaminated
with<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.640> order<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.880> prevent<00:00:24.180> that

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
with that so in order to prevent that

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.179 
with that so in order to prevent that
from<00:00:24.420> occurring<00:00:24.600> pool<00:00:25.560> maintenance<00:00:25.740> people

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
from occurring pool maintenance people

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.710 
from occurring pool maintenance people
throw<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> bunch<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.820> chemicals<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.449> prevent

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
throw on a bunch of chemicals to prevent

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.970 
throw on a bunch of chemicals to prevent
that<00:00:27.840> we've<00:00:28.080> all<00:00:28.199> heard<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.410> chlorine<00:00:28.710> but
