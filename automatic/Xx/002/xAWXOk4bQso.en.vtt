why completing super hostile maps are so
hard<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.250> because<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.729> various<00:01:27.450> obstacles<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
hard is because of various obstacles and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.940 
hard is because of various obstacles and
monsters<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:31.079> will<00:01:31.200> soon<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.500> for
