00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.590
 the big ubisoft cosplay action at the 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.030
 We are passionate about the whole of Germany 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.080
 Visiting cosplayer will take us this time 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.240
 to karlsfeld 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.040
 there we met silvio marcel the 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.360
 Rely on assassin's creed costumes 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.130
 have specialized 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.660
 how they do it and what theirs 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.710
 next projects are in us 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.710
 betrayed interview itself 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.960
 20 years old 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.580
 starting with a lot of giving 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.400
 anime kos place and then it started 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.260
 in addition to altair the gamebranche purely 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.780
 and now it's stronger now 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.729
 just fixed on stocks the whole 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.360
 cosplay yourself now I'm mass 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:48.970
 and I am 25 and I did 2010 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.680
 cosplay but from the very beginning game 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.900
 So tell was the first free 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.400
 also did and etc and now 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.690
 nothing else since then 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.159
 except for the first time at unity example 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.650
 The trailer has now come out at 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.049
 the 3 was there so we got the 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.330
 trailer and then we have the 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.039
 looked through and looked which was 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.520
 Character fits and so from larger 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.829
 stature 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.869
 I look like the costume 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.070
 actually completely close it is first 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.630
 so I make my drawing 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.520
 first in the character 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.439
 to feel it in, that is what 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.799
 Layers are rather divided by shirt 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.689
 about the outfit just belt and what also 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.480
 everything is still there then can 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.220
 I'll work it out and then 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.200
 Next, it's just then 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.630
 fabric business and then first time 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.940
 Look which colors fit and so 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.980
 continue and buy for hours 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.960
 actually so if people will be mine 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.600
 photos do that really well because 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.490
 it has the recognition the costume sees 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.290
 good looking one puts the character well there 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.820
 People know when you eat 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.070
 recognize him immediately if you take him from 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.350
 distance it looks really great me 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.810
 I recently got the cosplay from 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.300
 multiplayer character of assassin's 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.040
 creed 4 black flag made the youth 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.410
 long or better known to you 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.510
 the cost already over weeks 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.160
 because you also work during the day 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.480
 and then come home in the evening 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.550
 Okay, I have to do something now 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.840
 so that it goes ahead 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.790
 Edward Kennedy, for example, were then 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.680
 already one and a half to two months one 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.710
 completely real but with intense 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.300
 work has consumed at the new 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.390
 character are not quite as much now 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.420
 because not so detailed and many 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.500
 things cancel so I think so 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.510
 fascinating another time 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.090
 to slip in the moment one man 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.770
 It can be very different 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.490
 then sometimes even more confident even 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.350
 the people recognize the photos 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.450
 and that's why it is 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.040
 It was all the work 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.290
 weeks sitting on such a costume 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.300
 It was really worth it and you 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.430
 is also appreciated by that then 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.600
 is that doing so well that that 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.600
 goes under the skin is really great
