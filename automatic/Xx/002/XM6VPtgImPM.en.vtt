00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:17.840
 This toy is the ruins and p looks bulldozer Robo 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.900
 It is an experimental technique of Fell Doza how 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:27.439
 Heavy machinery that seems to be in a mining site or construction site 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.250
 This design and coloring was drowning, but a bit of clutter and making is noticeable 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.840
 But 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:37.480
 At all than the sports series or the Den series 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.650
 Not be about impossible to not use some die-cast sounds good in heavily heavy to be in 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.020
 Sounds good 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.710
 I just do not understand this window a little 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.390
 I do not know well the logo emblem letter written 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.390
 It is heavy with bread 3 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.699
 Excavator part is movable 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:04.989
 Then I would like to transform Mars 8th 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.650
 Losing to whole grain why 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.479
 Processing part ends in 2 divisions from the root 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.479
 I will improve the tip of the swing 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.990
 Then the rear engine part is also expanded 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.640
 This part will be your foot 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.640
 Toe out 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:31.400
 Emblem will come out and spread as it is 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:35.570
 It looks like I 've seen it somewhere 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.650
 And just rotate it 90 degrees from the eyes 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.300
 Hmm 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.280
 Open the case, put out the head and close the plate 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.000
 It is part shovel part of the back here 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.219
 I do not bend 90 degrees but it's a bit hard 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.950
 Hmm 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.950
 I just fried it and think it was a townman 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:04.380
 Fix the plate of the city part and adjust the arm room 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.770
 This completes 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.920
 Bulldozer Robo It looks like this is good 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.540
 Hm 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.410
 It is a big time fun fingertips monotonous too large deformation 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.460
 I think I do not need to write if I can make such an original 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.630
 Ne 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:29.840
 No, I do not know I wonder if Tteyuu somewhere works countries 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:34.250
 It is pretty amazing if we're original 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.640
 After all it is good with the die-cast Zushiri feeling and a good deformation mechanism 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.360
 Quite this is ant 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.210
 Just because I said at the beginning there is a lot of urine 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.590
 U 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.590
 I have a time to say 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:54.000
 I think it should be cut or scraped 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:59.250
 This is it goes into quite a favorite of the class 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.250
 I because it is real-life form also vehicle mobile 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.140
 Chi 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.140
 By the way the package was like this 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:23.410
 And Buber 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.860
 Hmm
