00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
it's surprisingly tricky because while

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.260 
it's surprisingly tricky because while
we<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:19.770> lots<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.160> sort<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.490> military<00:00:20.760> esque

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
stuff it's all been pieced together over

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.700 
stuff it's all been pieced together over
the<00:00:24.150> years<00:00:24.180> from<00:00:24.720> value<00:00:24.990> villages<00:00:25.470> like

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the years from value villages like

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.460 
the years from value villages like
uniform<00:00:26.340> section<00:00:26.790> and<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.150> not<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> lot<00:00:28.110> of<00:00:28.350> it

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
uniform section and so not a lot of it

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.680 
uniform section and so not a lot of it
matches<00:00:28.950> and<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.370> like<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.270> a<00:00:30.450> lot<00:00:30.600> of

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
matches and we have like one of a lot of

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.100 
matches and we have like one of a lot of
things<00:00:30.930> like<00:00:31.590> we've<00:00:31.710> got<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:32.009> one<00:00:32.279> flak

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
things like we've got like one flak

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.029 
things like we've got like one flak
helmet<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:35.300> one<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.530> did<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
helmet and one you know and so did the

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.890 
helmet and one you know and so did the
different<00:00:38.400> pieces<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.180> camera<00:00:39.510> don't<00:00:39.630> quite

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
different pieces of camera don't quite

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.180 
different pieces of camera don't quite
match<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.350> stuff<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.650> we're<00:00:40.770> hoping<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.160> can

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
match and stuff so we're hoping we can

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.680 
match and stuff so we're hoping we can
put<00:00:41.460> together<00:00:41.579> something<00:00:41.970> that<00:00:42.150> looks<00:00:42.570> like

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
put together something that looks like

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.830 
put together something that looks like
uniforms<00:00:43.380> for<00:00:43.739> Matt<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:43.980> myself<00:00:44.510> at<00:00:45.510> least

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
uniforms for Matt and myself at least

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.049 
uniforms for Matt and myself at least
fairly<00:00:46.560> good<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.880> then<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.710> James<00:00:49.710> actually

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
fairly good and then and James actually

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.950 
fairly good and then and James actually
hopefully<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.120> looks<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> more

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
hopefully it looks like a more

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.130 
hopefully it looks like a more
commanding<00:00:52.230> officer<00:00:52.829> than<00:00:53.130> us<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.989> Andy<00:00:54.989> will

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.389 
so the Manila laughter is out of place
so<00:01:13.139> what<00:01:13.259> do<00:01:13.319> I<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.469> I<00:01:13.560> cry<00:01:14.069> the<00:01:14.490> beach<00:01:18.380> music

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.660 
day on a Saturday after school is over
which<00:02:28.079> we<00:02:28.200> thought<00:02:28.320> would<00:02:28.470> be<00:02:28.500> safe<00:02:28.829> which<00:02:29.579> is

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
which we thought would be safe which is

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.350 
which we thought would be safe which is
super<00:02:30.030> annoying

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
super annoying

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.810 
super annoying
so<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.110> tried<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.560> three<00:02:32.190> times<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.610> fill<00:02:32.760> in

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
so we tried like three times to fill in

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.009 
so we tried like three times to fill in
