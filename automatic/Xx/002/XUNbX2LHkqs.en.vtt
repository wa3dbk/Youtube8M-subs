for<00:05:37.200> quite<00:05:37.380> a<00:05:37.410> bit<00:05:38.210> Giovinco<00:05:39.210> let's<00:05:40.140> take

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
for quite a bit Giovinco let's take

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.490 
for quite a bit Giovinco let's take
where<00:05:41.070> is<00:05:41.220> he<00:05:41.370> Cavani<00:05:42.090> he<00:05:42.420> we've<00:05:42.990> got<00:05:43.200> this<00:05:43.230> guy

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
where is he Cavani he we've got this guy

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.320 
where is he Cavani he we've got this guy
so<00:05:43.710> many<00:05:43.890> times<00:05:44.100> impacts<00:05:44.520> it<00:05:44.880> just<00:05:45.060> shows<00:05:45.300> that

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
so many times impacts it just shows that

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.110 
so many times impacts it just shows that
his<00:05:45.690> card<00:05:46.020> weight<00:05:46.260> is<00:05:46.440> really<00:05:46.890> high<00:05:47.040> but<00:05:47.790> he's

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
his card weight is really high but he's

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.770 
his card weight is really high but he's
87<00:05:48.660> overall<00:05:49.230> but<00:05:49.620> only<00:05:50.010> goes<00:05:50.190> for<00:05:50.370> 4k<00:05:50.850> so<00:05:51.480> I

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
87 overall but only goes for 4k so I

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.080 
87 overall but only goes for 4k so I
think<00:05:52.110> we<00:05:52.410> solve<00:05:52.950> managed<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.670> get<00:05:53.790> quite<00:05:54.060> a

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
think we solve managed to get quite a

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.240
