I've been eating the wrong foods because

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.749 
I've been eating the wrong foods because
I<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:41.990> my<00:01:42.990> body's<00:01:43.020> been<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.799> exploding<00:01:44.549> it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
feels like I don't know I I just

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.690

remember<00:01:48.180> some<00:01:48.329> negative<00:01:48.750> effects<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.350> food

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
remember some negative effects to food

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.090 
remember some negative effects to food
but<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.909> think<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:52.049> food<00:01:52.770> that's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
but I think it's really like food that's
like<00:01:53.310> rich<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.119> has<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> lot<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.780> sauce<00:01:55.290> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
like rich and has a lot of sauce and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.429 
like rich and has a lot of sauce and
stuff<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.390> work<00:01:57.840> out<00:01:57.960> every<00:01:58.170> day
