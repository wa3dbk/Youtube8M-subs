 What we see now, so this week is best for us 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.579
 Start was 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.319

 after recording the refurbishment, the picture newspaper announced 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:59.799
 wants to be offended by the clubs 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.439
 the truth is very different 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.260
 In a radio interview, Tadic made it clear that sometimes it only sounds like it once 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.449
 to pause 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:10.339
 For five years a short film that had nothing to do with the carnage but this 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:11.599
 mean a lot 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.079
 but even they do not know any songs »Customers can all profit 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.889

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.460

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.560
 earlier he also had the red biplane but 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.560
 Pessimists slowly put seeds to put 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.969
 so they leave the beds 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:51.050

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.800

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.949
 Kerviel 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.949
 mipa as when falling asleep down there 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.860

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.279

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.650

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.120
 Heesen injured 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.689

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.219
 Duty only the food is always after the concert 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:27.210
 like a TV and stereo 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.919
 and then this measure so what and could pass it and so on 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.439

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.240
 I know that their fans notice something 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.340
 with Al Qaeda in the pub not that the garbage wandered at Bendig Pavelec 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.779
