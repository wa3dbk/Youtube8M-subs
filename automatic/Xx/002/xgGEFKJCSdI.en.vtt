00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 good morning friends from youtube soy goku x 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.919
 of 8 and today I come with a news that I 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.380
 It made a big impact on my favorite character 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.690
 Goku will have a new transformation in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.769
 the new movie dragon ball z the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.769
 resurrection of efe 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.220
 followers of dragon ball z may 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.290
 see the transformation of goku in the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.110
 new installment entitled the resurrection 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.850
 of frizer this time the protagonist of the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.070
 saga will become super god 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.710
 saiyans to face the evil frizer 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.780
 but this time the hair will be blue in 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.910
 instead of pink as we have seen in the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.739
 battle of the gods what I most 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.809
 worrying is how is it going to turn into 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.000
 blue god if we have seen it pink 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.129
 technically maybe they will explain us in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.410
 the movie the antagonist of the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.239
 freezer movie can revive thanks to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.830
 the dragonballs and returns to 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.530
 attack the mushroom warriors with their 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.510
 own army meanwhile in Japanese 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.220
 only a few weeks are left for their 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.870
 premiere and the magazine together 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.729
 published in its latest edition the 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.620
 first images of goku in what 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.900
 would be your expected transformation in the 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.420
 God super saiyans mode but in color 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.610
 blue not only him but also 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.190
 vegueta that will also be a super god 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 sayayin blue say that the theory that 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.450
 vegueta come back goodbye super sayayin 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.369
 be that goku has been beaten by frizer 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.290
 as in the last battle of vegueta and 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.540
 frizer in the met but you see that goku takes 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.770
 its place 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.700
 freezer was defeated by vegueta 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.980
 face with him 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.530
 vegueta will not be able to with him and in the end he will 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.540
 will become super sayayin god 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.670
 basically it could be that it's already 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.710
 we saw in the freezer saga but a little 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.840
 more different 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.299
 another news that has come out of dragonball 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.250
 z has been that they already showed scenes of the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.790
 movie in a hd video in four 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.890
 minutes 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.140
 I would love to show you but 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.110
 unfortunately those sons of bitches the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 copyright would block me the video though 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.460
 The only thing I can say is that those 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.890
 scenes is almost everything he showed in 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.080
 the manga of the movie that pillar 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.209
 and his gang and the old henchmen of 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.220
 frizer resuscitated him with the spheres and 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.220
 all that he showed us in the manga 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.360
 shit I think I'm waiting for you 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.880
 good friends is everything with dragon ball the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.130
 true dragon ball z the resurrection of 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.770
 efe is the movie that I most expect this 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.770
 year the second is the avengers 2 and the 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.110
 third is star wars episode 7 and if 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.150
 I said before that the Avengers 2 was the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.090
 what I expected most good is the one that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.480
 I hope marvel good that's all 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.480
