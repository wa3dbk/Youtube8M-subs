00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
on the one chord a lot of times you were

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.480 
on the one chord a lot of times you were
applying<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.200> seven<00:01:52.680> note<00:01:52.860> mixolydian

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
applying that seven note mixolydian

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.460 
applying that seven note mixolydian
scale<00:01:53.670> which<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.570> definitely<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.140> approach

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
scale which is definitely one approach

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.080 
scale which is definitely one approach
and<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:55.830> got<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.690> specific<00:01:57.690> sound<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:59.090> so

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and it's got a specific sound to it so

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.180 
and it's got a specific sound to it so
what<00:02:00.870> what<00:02:01.080> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.290> do<00:02:01.380> also<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.800> what<00:02:02.070> we

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
what what you can do also is what we

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.750 
what what you can do also is what we
talked<00:02:02.400> about<00:02:02.490> earlier<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:04.430> you<00:02:05.430> know<00:02:05.550> just

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
talked about earlier is you know just

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.399 
talked about earlier is you know just
kind<00:02:05.940> of<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.120> more<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.540> blue<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.020> mean<00:02:07.200> just

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
kind of like more of a blue I mean just

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.139 
kind of like more of a blue I mean just
another<00:02:07.620> option<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.820> do<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.119> is

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
another option that you can do there is

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.539 
another option that you can do there is
that<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.690> blues<00:02:10.470> approach<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
that like blues approach but with the

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.180 
that like blues approach but with the
hammer<00:02:12.299> down<00:02:12.540> major<00:02:12.780> third<00:02:13.140> because<00:02:14.010> that's

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
hammer down major third because that's

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.039 
hammer down major third because that's
really<00:02:14.820> still<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.570> need<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.900> call<00:02:16.019> that

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
really still you need to call that

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.789 
really still you need to call that
mixolydian<00:02:16.530> still<00:02:16.980> because<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:18.799> those

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
mixolydian still because of that those

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.479 
mixolydian still because of that those
notes<00:02:20.190> I'm<00:02:20.970> gonna<00:02:21.120> make<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:22.010> strong<00:02:23.010> notes<00:02:23.310> of

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
notes I'm gonna make it strong notes of

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.220 
notes I'm gonna make it strong notes of
mixolydian<00:02:26.330> which<00:02:27.330> would<00:02:27.510> be<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> seven

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
mixolydian which would be the a seven

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.380 
mixolydian which would be the a seven
arpeggio<00:02:28.530> actually<00:02:29.160> which<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.090> underneath

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
arpeggio actually which is underneath

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:41.930 
arpeggio actually which is underneath
that<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> mixolydian<00:02:31.320> seven<00:02:31.980> note<00:02:32.130> shape

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.660 

but<00:02:42.940> what<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.150> can<00:02:43.270> do<00:02:43.360> also<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:45.550> know

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670
