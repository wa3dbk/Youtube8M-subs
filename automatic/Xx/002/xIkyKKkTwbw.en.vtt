how<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.030> trim<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> fruit<00:00:09.750> tree<00:00:10.050> now<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
how to trim a fruit tree now the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.610 
how to trim a fruit tree now the
best-case<00:00:11.880> scenario<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.690> prune<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.380> fruit

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
best-case scenario is to prune the fruit

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.530 
best-case scenario is to prune the fruit
tree<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.280> right<00:00:14.490> way<00:00:14.670> from<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.120> very<00:00:15.299> first

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
tree the right way from the very first

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.689 
tree the right way from the very first
year<00:00:15.719> but<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.560> lot<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.890> people<00:00:17.130> look<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
year but a lot of people look at the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.550 
year but a lot of people look at the
Raby<00:00:17.940> apple<00:00:18.359> trees<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.750> children<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.410> it

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
Raby apple trees like children and it

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.140 
Raby apple trees like children and it
breaks<00:00:19.920> their<00:00:20.250> heart<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.730> give<00:00:20.880> them<00:00:21.000> that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
breaks their heart to give them that

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.630 
breaks their heart to give them that
first<00:00:21.359> haircut<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.439> most<00:00:22.680> people<00:00:23.010> end<00:00:23.250> up<00:00:23.400> like

to take a look at the overall shape you

each<00:00:36.390> branch<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.890> looking<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.489> build

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
each branch we are looking to build

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.180 
each branch we are looking to build
branches<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.660> scaffolding<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.649> so

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
branches that are scaffolding up so

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.889 
branches that are scaffolding up so
they're<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.520> start<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:42.149> least<00:00:42.329> 24

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
they're going to start at least 24

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.209 
they're going to start at least 24
inches<00:00:42.930> from<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> bottom<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:43.950> it's

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
inches from the bottom because it's

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.610 
inches from the bottom because it's
easier<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.579> work<00:00:44.850> underneath<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.629> step<00:00:46.410> up

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
easier to work underneath it and step up

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.729 
easier to work underneath it and step up
every<00:00:47.129> 8<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.610> 12<00:00:47.910> inches<00:00:48.469> ultimately<00:00:49.469> we're

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
every 8 to 12 inches ultimately we're

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.680 
every 8 to 12 inches ultimately we're
going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> end<00:00:50.129> up<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.520> five<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.030> seven<00:00:51.390> good

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
going to end up with five to seven good

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.830 
going to end up with five to seven good
branches<00:00:52.430> scaffold<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.670> around<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.510> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
branches scaffold it up around like that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.139 
branches scaffold it up around like that
on<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.260> tree<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.550> I'm<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> go

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
on the tree and this one I'm going to go

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.090 
on the tree and this one I'm going to go
with<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.420> central<00:00:57.840> leader<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:58.920> my

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
with the central leader just because my

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.760 
with the central leader just because my
husband<00:00:59.520> prefers<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.210> shape<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.770> it's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
husband prefers that shape so it's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.290 
husband prefers that shape so it's
really<00:01:02.010> hard<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> take<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.640> look<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> tree

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
really hard to take a look at the tree

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.390 
really hard to take a look at the tree
and<00:01:03.570> decide<00:01:04.080> which<00:01:04.650> ones<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.949> take<00:01:05.220> out

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and decide which ones to take out

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.950 
and decide which ones to take out
especially<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.270> they're<00:01:06.450> nice<00:01:06.630> mature

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
especially if they're nice mature

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.859 
especially if they're nice mature
branches<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.189> looking<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.150> we're

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
branches but looking at this one we're

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.510 
branches but looking at this one we're
going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> leave<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:10.799> because<00:01:11.280> it's

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
going to leave this one because it's

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
going to leave this one because it's
growing<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.970> fairly<00:01:12.420> horizontal<00:01:13.290> even

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
growing out fairly horizontal even

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
growing out fairly horizontal even
though<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.130> down<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> little<00:01:14.610> bit<00:01:14.790> more

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
though I like it down a little bit more

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.399 
though I like it down a little bit more
and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:16.290> probably<00:01:16.860> step<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.080> over

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and then probably step up to one over

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.670 
and then probably step up to one over
here<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.610> 10<00:01:21.390> inches<00:01:21.780> away<00:01:21.900> opposite

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
here it's all 10 inches away opposite

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.850 
here it's all 10 inches away opposite
side<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.360> step<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.930> next<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.500> coming

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
side I step up to this next one coming

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.300 
side I step up to this next one coming
out<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.600> looking<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:28.040> probably<00:01:29.040> leave

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
out and looking at this probably leave

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.359 
out and looking at this probably leave
this<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.180> not<00:01:30.390> my<00:01:30.540> ideal<00:01:30.990> situation

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
this one it's not my ideal situation

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.640 
this one it's not my ideal situation
since<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.549> over<00:01:32.880> top<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.470> now

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
since it's over top of this but for now

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.010 
since it's over top of this but for now
we're<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.750> one

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
we're going to go with that now this one

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.230 
we're going to go with that now this one
I<00:01:37.049> will<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.770> leave<00:01:38.100> even<00:01:38.670> though<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.000> might

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
I will not leave even though it might

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.929 
I will not leave even though it might
work<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.750> fine<00:01:40.320> because<00:01:41.250> there<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.670> some

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
work just fine because there is some

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.910 
work just fine because there is some
Southwest<00:01:42.450> damage<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
Southwest damage on it so I'm going to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
Southwest damage on it so I'm going to
take<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.399> one<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:46.079> you're<00:01:46.259> looking

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
take that one out so when you're looking

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.749 
take that one out so when you're looking
at<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> tree<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> things<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
at the tree one of the things that you

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.850 
at the tree one of the things that you
want<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> take<00:01:48.240> out<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.869> don't<00:01:49.049> want<00:01:49.170> branches

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
want to take out you don't want branches

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.429 
want to take out you don't want branches
growing<00:01:50.280> up<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:51.509> even<00:01:51.899> though<00:01:52.020> we're<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
growing up so even though we're going to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.789 
growing up so even though we're going to
leave<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.770> overall<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.610> I'm<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.899> take

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
leave this overall one I'm going to take

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.069 
leave this overall one I'm going to take
out<00:01:56.119> actually<00:01:57.119> cut<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> little<00:01:57.990> bit

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
out actually cut that a little bit

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.789 
out actually cut that a little bit
closer<00:01:58.290> take<00:01:59.189> out<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.610> main<00:01:59.909> one<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:01.530> then

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
closer take out that main one and then

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.450 
closer take out that main one and then
I'm<00:02:02.100> also<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> take<00:02:03.119> out<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.619> not

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
I'm also going to take out this one not

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.429 
I'm also going to take out this one not
only<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.210> too<00:02:06.420> close<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:06.930> but

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
only because it's too close here but

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.760 
only because it's too close here but
because<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.280> notch<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.849> way<00:02:09.209> too<00:02:09.270> tight<00:02:09.959> same

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
because this notch is way too tight same

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.080 
because this notch is way too tight same
with<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.310> one

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
with this one

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.020 
with this one
it<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.540> more<00:02:13.379> way<00:02:13.800> more<00:02:13.830> than<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> 45-degree

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
it is more way more than a 45-degree

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.210 
it is more way more than a 45-degree
angle<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.540> makes<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.200> tree<00:02:16.410> vulnerable<00:02:17.010> so

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
angle it makes the tree vulnerable so

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.089 
angle it makes the tree vulnerable so
those<00:02:17.459> have<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.730> come<00:02:17.879> out<00:02:18.150> as<00:02:18.330> well<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.890> want

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
those have to come out as well you want

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.809 
those have to come out as well you want
to<00:02:20.220> cut<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.849> tree<00:02:21.319> as<00:02:22.910> close<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.640> main

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
to cut the tree as close to the main

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.479 
to cut the tree as close to the main
branch<00:02:27.030> as<00:02:27.450> possible<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.860> don't<00:02:28.890> want<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> cut

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
branch as possible you don't want to cut

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.490 
branch as possible you don't want to cut
it<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.730> an<00:02:29.849> angle<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.900> want<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.140> keep<00:02:31.319> it

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
it in an angle and you want to keep it

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.020 
it in an angle and you want to keep it
as<00:02:31.709> tight<00:02:31.739> as<00:02:32.069> possible

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
as tight as possible

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.119 
as tight as possible
now<00:02:33.720> I'm<00:02:33.810> starting<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.200> make<00:02:34.379> a<00:02:34.410> few<00:02:34.739> cuts<00:02:34.950> on

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
now I'm starting to make a few cuts on

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.520 
now I'm starting to make a few cuts on
the<00:02:35.280> tree<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.760> took<00:02:36.299> out<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.720> vertical<00:02:37.260> branch

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the tree I took out this vertical branch

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.979 
the tree I took out this vertical branch
and<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.340> also<00:02:38.519> trimmed<00:02:38.879> back<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.390> main<00:02:39.660> branch

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
and I also trimmed back this main branch

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.990 
and I also trimmed back this main branch
a<00:02:40.140> little<00:02:40.410> bit<00:02:40.590> now<00:02:41.220> I'm<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.610> take<00:02:41.819> off

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
a little bit now I'm going to take off

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720 
a little bit now I'm going to take off
this<00:02:42.239> other<00:02:42.450> significantly<00:02:43.379> sized<00:02:43.739> one<00:02:44.160> at

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
this other significantly sized one at

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.530 
this other significantly sized one at
the<00:02:45.000> bottom<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:46.110> well<00:02:47.099> as<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.920> one

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
the bottom as well as this little one

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.020 
the bottom as well as this little one
keeping<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.660> close<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.319> main<00:02:52.530> main<00:02:53.489> trunk

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
keeping it close to the main main trunk

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.690 
keeping it close to the main main trunk
as<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.299> can<00:02:54.599> so<00:02:55.140> here's<00:02:55.470> our<00:02:55.620> scaffold<00:02:56.250> starting

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
as I can so here's our scaffold starting

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.960 
as I can so here's our scaffold starting
had<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.180> one<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.780> one<00:02:58.160> we<00:02:59.160> will<00:02:59.340> leave<00:02:59.579> this

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
had this one this one we will leave this

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.830 
had this one this one we will leave this
one<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.510> course<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.950> one<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:03.450> this

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
one of course and this one so this

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.500 
one of course and this one so this
little<00:03:04.200> guy<00:03:04.349> has<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.799> come<00:03:04.980> off<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:08.510> this

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
little guy has to come off and this

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.319 
little guy has to come off and this
little<00:03:09.840> guy<00:03:10.019> has<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.470> come<00:03:10.620> off<00:03:10.879> but<00:03:11.879> we'll

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
little guy has to come off but we'll

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.199 
little guy has to come off but we'll
leave<00:03:12.629> that<00:03:12.690> one<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:14.040> now<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.730> matter<00:03:14.760> of

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
leave that one so now it's a matter of

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.229 
leave that one so now it's a matter of
trimming<00:03:15.810> up<00:03:16.139> some<00:03:16.769> of<00:03:16.889> these<00:03:17.010> smaller<00:03:17.459> just

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
trimming up some of these smaller just

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.330 
trimming up some of these smaller just
to<00:03:18.359> trim<00:03:18.630> them<00:03:18.780> back<00:03:18.810> because<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.769> lot<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.130> times

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
to trim them back because a lot of times

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.270 
to trim them back because a lot of times
the<00:03:20.609> tips<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.420> branches<00:03:22.100> even<00:03:23.100> though

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
the tips of the branches even though

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.009 
the tips of the branches even though
they're<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.639> ones<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:24.000> want<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.239> keep<00:03:24.480> are

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
they're the ones you want to keep are

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.900 
they're the ones you want to keep are
productive<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:26.010> we<00:03:26.130> have<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.489> bring<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.880> back

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
productive so we have to bring it back

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.390 
productive so we have to bring it back
to<00:03:27.660> keep<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.049> production<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.920> tree<00:03:29.160> so

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
to keep that production in the tree so

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.099 
to keep that production in the tree so
we're<00:03:29.549> going<00:03:29.700> after<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.180> best<00:03:30.389> fruit<00:03:30.660> puzzle

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
we're going after the best fruit puzzle

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.229 
we're going after the best fruit puzzle
now<00:03:31.889> I'm<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.220> kind<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.639> looking<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:33.209> see

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
now I'm just kind of looking to see

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.479 
now I'm just kind of looking to see
where<00:03:33.780> we<00:03:34.019> can<00:03:34.170> trim<00:03:34.440> these<00:03:34.650> smaller<00:03:34.980> branches

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
where we can trim these smaller branches

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.520 
where we can trim these smaller branches
we've<00:03:35.970> trimmed<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.510> significant<00:03:37.079> amount<00:03:37.260> off

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
we've trimmed a significant amount off

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.860 
we've trimmed a significant amount off
the<00:03:37.769> tree<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.760> want<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.359> keep<00:03:39.540> as<00:03:39.690> much

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
the tree so I want to keep as much

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.470 
the tree so I want to keep as much
possible<00:03:40.470> for<00:03:40.769> production<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.609> year<00:03:41.940> so

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
possible for production this year so

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.349 
possible for production this year so
this<00:03:42.720> one's<00:03:42.930> really<00:03:43.470> not<00:03:43.620> doing<00:03:44.040> anything<00:03:44.359> so

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
this one's really not doing anything so

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.699 
this one's really not doing anything so
we<00:03:45.569> will<00:03:45.690> check<00:03:45.870> this<00:03:46.139> one<00:03:46.349> back<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:47.299> this<00:03:48.299> one

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
we will check this one back and this one

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.610 
we will check this one back and this one
I'll<00:03:49.709> trim<00:03:50.190> back<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.639> about<00:03:50.849> but<00:03:51.569> so<00:03:52.230> these<00:03:52.410> are

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
I'll trim back to about but so these are

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.990 
I'll trim back to about but so these are
looking<00:03:52.829> pretty<00:03:52.889> healthy<00:03:53.310> they<00:03:53.819> should

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
looking pretty healthy they should

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.420 
looking pretty healthy they should
produce<00:03:54.720> probably<00:03:55.440> pretty<00:03:55.799> well<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.220> year

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
produce probably pretty well this year

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.819 
produce probably pretty well this year
another<00:03:57.269> reason<00:03:57.720> why<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:58.019> good<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.260> prune

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
another reason why it's good to prune

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.349 
another reason why it's good to prune
the<00:03:59.010> fruit<00:03:59.220> trees<00:03:59.430> when<00:03:59.639> they're<00:03:59.760> little<00:04:00.000> is

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
the fruit trees when they're little is

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.150 
the fruit trees when they're little is
so<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.690> don't<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.169> to<00:04:01.319> have<00:04:01.470> ladders<00:04:01.769> or

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
so you don't have to have ladders or

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.010 
so you don't have to have ladders or
grab<00:04:03.000> milk<00:04:03.299> crates

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
grab milk crates

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.320 
grab milk crates
or<00:04:04.080> people<00:04:04.290> could<00:04:04.530> prune<00:04:04.800> them<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.820> top<00:04:06.090> on

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
or people could prune them so the top on

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.690 
or people could prune them so the top on
this<00:04:06.510> one<00:04:06.570> is<00:04:06.960> really<00:04:07.200> kind<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.530> wackadoo<00:04:08.070> I'm

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
this one is really kind of wackadoo I'm

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.750 
this one is really kind of wackadoo I'm
gonna<00:04:08.970> leave<00:04:09.210> this<00:04:09.480> little<00:04:09.900> branch<00:04:10.760> although

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
gonna leave this little branch although

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.380 
gonna leave this little branch although
I<00:04:11.970> do<00:04:12.030> want<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.960> back<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.220> bud<00:04:14.550> just

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
I do want it to back to that bud just

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.990 
I do want it to back to that bud just
because<00:04:15.690> it's<00:04:16.200> so<00:04:16.440> K<00:04:16.830> it's<00:04:17.160> within<00:04:17.340> our<00:04:17.580> plan

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
because it's so K it's within our plan

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.390 
because it's so K it's within our plan
at<00:04:18.270> this<00:04:18.450> moment<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.959> time<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.800> hate<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.190> cut

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
at this moment in time and I hate to cut

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.000 
at this moment in time and I hate to cut
much<00:04:20.640> more<00:04:20.910> off<00:04:21.120> but<00:04:21.989> I'm<00:04:22.200> going<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.560> take<00:04:22.800> off

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
much more off but I'm going to take off

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.420 
much more off but I'm going to take off
some<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.400> these<00:04:23.820> kind<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:24.990> wild<00:04:25.470> ones<00:04:25.650> all<00:04:26.400> I

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
some of these kind of wild ones all I

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.280 
some of these kind of wild ones all I
might<00:04:26.730> leave<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.300> think<00:04:27.510> I<00:04:27.630> might<00:04:27.840> leave<00:04:28.050> that

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
might leave I think I might leave that

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.230 
might leave I think I might leave that
one<00:04:28.440> for<00:04:28.680> now<00:04:28.860> too<00:04:28.920> but<00:04:29.820> I'm<00:04:29.910> going<00:04:30.090> to<00:04:30.120> leave

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
one for now too but I'm going to leave

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.000 
one for now too but I'm going to leave
these<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.780> then<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.020> have<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.500> really<00:04:31.710> came<00:04:31.890> to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
these and then I have to really came to

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.280 
these and then I have to really came to
look<00:04:32.220> at<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.460> top<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:32.940> figure<00:04:33.270> out<00:04:33.330> which<00:04:33.990> one

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
look at the top and figure out which one

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.410 
look at the top and figure out which one
I<00:04:34.320> want<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.740> keep<00:04:34.890> as<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.130> central<00:04:35.640> leader<00:04:35.820> they

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
I want to keep as a central leader they

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.990 
I want to keep as a central leader they
twist<00:04:36.960> up<00:04:37.290> there<00:04:37.680> which<00:04:38.250> is<00:04:38.460> really<00:04:38.790> difficult

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
twist up there which is really difficult

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.080 
twist up there which is really difficult
when<00:04:39.450> we<00:04:39.680> originally<00:04:40.680> got<00:04:40.950> this<00:04:41.250> tree<00:04:41.520> if<00:04:41.730> we

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
when we originally got this tree if we

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.490 
when we originally got this tree if we
would<00:04:42.270> have<00:04:42.360> taken<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.720> look<00:04:42.900> at<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.110> from<00:04:43.380> the

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
would have taken a look at it from the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.540 
would have taken a look at it from the
beginning<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:44.040> probably<00:04:44.310> would've<00:04:44.460> been

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
beginning it probably would've been

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.820 
beginning it probably would've been
easier<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.090> sort<00:04:45.360> out<00:04:45.600> but<00:04:46.170> right<00:04:46.380> now<00:04:46.590> they're

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
easier to sort out but right now they're

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.950 
easier to sort out but right now they're
both<00:04:46.980> kind<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.430> equal<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:48.330> I'll<00:04:48.420> take<00:04:48.600> a<00:04:48.660> closer

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
both kind of equal so I'll take a closer

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.500 
both kind of equal so I'll take a closer
look<00:04:49.140> at<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:49.890> trim<00:04:50.190> off<00:04:50.370> one<00:04:50.640> so<00:04:51.180> we<00:04:51.330> have

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
look at that and trim off one so we have

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.300 
look at that and trim off one so we have
a<00:04:51.540> good<00:04:51.810> strong<00:04:52.200> central<00:04:52.740> leader<00:04:52.980> on<00:04:53.160> this

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
a good strong central leader on this

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.850 
a good strong central leader on this
tree<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:54.540> here's<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.080> end<00:04:55.200> result<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.740> our

group tree pruning today it might look a

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.960 
group tree pruning today it might look a
little<00:04:58.200> bit<00:04:58.470> severe<00:04:58.980> but<00:04:59.220> keep<00:04:59.400> in<00:04:59.550> mind<00:04:59.580> this

little bit severe but keep in mind this

whack it out type of girl when it comes

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.160 
whack it out type of girl when it comes
to<00:05:07.770> pruning<00:05:07.980> but<00:05:08.880> I<00:05:09.060> know<00:05:09.120> in<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.540> end<00:05:09.720> it's

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
to pruning but I know in the end it's

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.960
