00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello my name is Alexei you 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.620
 see the program on heat engineering 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.000
 repair today will tell you how 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.710
 and why conduct technical 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.510
 Maintenance Maintenance 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.369
 necessary to carry out for timely 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.320
 identify deficiencies in the work water 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.439
 heat up normally during 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.540
 maintenance is carried out a number 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.669
 operations that avoid 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.950
 the consequences of costly repairs 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.520
 maintenance starts with 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:36.079
 inspection of the water part of the apparatus 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.140
 you remove the lining and check 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.289
 successively all connections 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.629
 water heater 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.420
 there should be no smudges any 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.030
 green dots no growths and so 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.579
 further if something like that is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.699
 need to unscrew the nut to replace 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.039
 seals and cleanse a friend in this place 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.559
 everything should be clean smooth and level 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.589
 be sure to check at the entrance 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.780
 there was a filter in front of the heater 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.260
 during technical service you will 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.420
 clean 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.270
 Generally the default filter is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.170
 here here in one node but as it shows 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.110
 practice 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.190
 These speakers have been working for a long time and 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.580
 filters already there is none so no 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.780
 need to take a filter at the entrance 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.390
 the water heater further just you 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.580
 checked all connections need to check 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.370
 are there leaks on the water stem 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.750
 need to check whether the collected 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.460
 here 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.380
 seal if something is wrong with 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.840
 water hub must be removed 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.200
 disassemble into a single node how it is done 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.130
 I have already told in the videos before and 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.340
 carry out preventive operations 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.350
 the wedding knot further go gas 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.090
 the connection must be checked for gas leaks 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.650
 the entire highway starting from the filing and 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.440
 finishing up 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.230
 take off the ignition burner seal 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.110
 further check the pen performance 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.330
 if she wedges walks badly then 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.980
 need to be removed and disassembled like this 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.890
 is done 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.910
 see also the videos that were previously 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.100
 after we cleaned the handle 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.170
 checked all the gas connections we 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.810
 necessarily 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.330
 blow through purge deadlift control 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.220
 the crosspiece of the pilot burner and the very 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.930
 ignite the burner for this we need 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.200
 remove from a memory burner like this 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.650
 done too i told earlier you can 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.500
 watch the videos we need and 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.010
 remove clean rinse and blow to 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.900
 the flame fell clearly on the main burner 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:44.360
 and smoke was blue and clear further we 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.030
 check the gap between the ignition electrode 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.209
 and for the guys burner he should be 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.110
 so exposed to the sparks 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.860
 passed through the jet year which 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.640
 normal ignition is in progress 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.280
 with a few keystrokes after that 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.459
 how we cleaned the group lit us 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.739
 it is necessary to remove the main burner and 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.720
 also wash and clean the nozzles 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.190
 collector how to remove the main burner I 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.930
 also told earlier you can 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.170
 look after we took off 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.040
 the main burner we check the status 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.320
 heat exchanger if it is not very 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.920
 polluted just clean not u brush 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:30.190
 if the heat exchanger wanders all wrong 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:32.810
 need to remove this dry cell cover 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.549
 take out heat exchanger and rinse 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.200
 him 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.450
 you need to do this if you 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.069
 want the water to be normal 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.659
 column temperature worked 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.489
 adequate day did you have any problems 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.499
 after you cleaned 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.650
 the heat exchanger you put in place 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:50.420
 further you clean without diverting 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.639
 device dust dust is the most 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.730
 the main enemy of this gas column 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.409
 be sure to check the seal 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.870
 heat exchanger leakage is one of 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.849
 the most painful places 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.609
 every year all these operations need to be done and 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.290
 annually, ideally of course it cause 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.560
 obscene master 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.389
 that he carried out these operations if 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.230
 there is no such possibility 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.620
 do it yourself 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.579
 but in no case need 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.680
 tightened by gas service 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.049
 columns what does this lead to first 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.169
 the column is no longer adequately included 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.259
 the second is the water starts either not 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.800
 heater for overheating column 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.560
 wrong turns off going on 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.039
 highlighting too much 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.830
 soot all overgrown with dust and in the end this 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.660
 the heater just fails well then 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.520
 no technical needed already 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.250
 full service , respectively 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.080
 as a rule on the most do it already 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.360
 hard to call 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.949
 masters is already replacing parts 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.050
 so better 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.780
 annually monitor and inspect your 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.590
 water heaters then no problem 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.020
 you will not be 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.009
 did you watch the academy program 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.169
 heat engineering 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.880
 today told how to conduct 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.460
 maintenance r headers 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.460
 neva 3208 in the next video I 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.039
 tell you about what are 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.620
 typical malfunctions of this gas 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:18.470
 speakers what to look at what to pay 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.810
 attention how to eliminate them subscribe 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.289
 on our videos put likes with you 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.220
 Alexey 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.220
 see you
