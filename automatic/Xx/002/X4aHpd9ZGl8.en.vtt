00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.640
 amman batman movie and finally 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.209
 we have spiderman welcome to low 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.209
 TV 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.940
 while Robert Reford said that 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.770
 I enter the one of Captain America 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.230
 simply because I wanted a bit of 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.750
 pasta and knowledge to be able to do 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.330
 his independent films here and 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.070
 michael douglas says to be delighted 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.660
 have made the movie of andy man 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.369
 because I had a lot of fun watching 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.079
 guardians of the galaxy and from 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.329
 then he wanted to join the universe of 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.030
 marvel what he said is this movie 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.309
 for diaz it was very exciting great 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.579
 I wanted to be inside the marvel universe 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.649
 I saw galaxy guardians in imax 3-d and 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.440
 He told the deceased I loved the meaning 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.719
 of humor I read the script of Amman and saw the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.699
 tone that has the sense of adventure 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.280
 with touches of comedy 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.640
 I have not seen the whole tape but I have 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.839
 quite sequences and it's very funny 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.879
 is very similar to guardians of the 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.499
 galaxy for the kind of humor is 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.390
 very funny 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.420
 beyond all the grandeur of a 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.800
 movie like this so I imagine that 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.330
 if they make a second part of anwar 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.670
 michael douglas will have no problem in 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.440
 accept to participate in it thing that is 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.270
 pretty good although the character that 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.520
 do not like me jumping 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.150
 has a bad reputation for some things that has 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.940
 done in the 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.310
 I imagine that in this movie I o 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.080
 they throw away or they will forget about them because 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.360
 as now the greatest william or I do not think 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.650
 to comment on any of that or perhaps if 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.540
 I would like that of course what 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.100
 you comment and you are already commenting if you are going to 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.180
 have a second part of this movie 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.920
 dead man 2 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.260
 at the moment of phase 3 we have already seen 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.750
 which is not programmed such sequel 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.670
 moment so I would surely go for the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.940
 phase 4 what clinton read said 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.680
 director of this movie is being 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.770
 these characters as their own 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.020
 Paul Rudd and I work a lot on them 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.210
 if we are lucky enough to shoot a 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.670
 sequel I would love to redirect 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.220
 Paula is also co-writer of the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.380
 tape and they did not worry just where 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.869
 learn or not the dialogues but that 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.270
 had a greater responsibility for the 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.070
 make this character so different 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.230
 lace in the cinematic universe of 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.540
 marvel is very important indeed in the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.100
 filming the civil war paul rudd called the 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.450
 petronic director to come to the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.670
 shoot and help him a bit with his 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.920
 character in this new movie that 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.260
 will debut in the next year so 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.940
 although it has not been directed by the worldwide 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.980
 it seems that the director that he has 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.959
 directed yes he has intruded a lot 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.090
 in it, it has gotten inside and yes 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.190
 that has done everything possible to make it 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.600
 a very good movie and soon 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.600
 we will discover if it is or not 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.510
 finally we know who is the new 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.850
 spiderman neither more nor less than tom 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.740
 holland and say who with holland 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.060
 He is a 19 year old actor that we have 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.070
 could see in the movie what 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.350
 impossible although he also made the 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.600
 movies of my life now and loc and 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.020
 exit in the world series 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.330
 amy pascal says they are and marvel kevin and me 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.920
 we knew that for peter parker we had 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.530
 than finding a young actor with 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.270
 talented and vibrant that was capable of 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.330
 interpret one of the characters more 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.880
 known all over the world with thom 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.860
 we have found the perfect actor to 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.170
 bring the story of spiderman to 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.760
 cinematographic universe of marc but 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.520
 I would have liked it to be more for 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.990
 say that the marvel appears that also 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.180
 he preferred a little more to him because 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.380
 I looked younger too 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.020
 we would have side that they had hired 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.760
 to everything and mandir to continue as 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.500
 if this were a quarter and then 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.600
 the other spiderman that was the fifth 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.670
 continue with his story and with the 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.650
 spiderman and growing the grown up we go 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.870
 already a little more greater has been 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.750
 interesting that also maybe one day 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.819
 in the future let's see such a thing his movie 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.670
 new solo will be for 28 d 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.879
 of 2017 and they have also said that the 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.670
 will direct jon watts director space 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:55.450
 of clown and with guard plus a 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.030
 sort of dried remake of robocop very 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.370
 very shabby and not worth it 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.069
 take a look I hope that spiderman 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.049
 do not let it live up to this theft like 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.909
 of course not for god so 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.700
 after 1,500 actors among those who 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.879
 they were safe you fall of duty 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.669
 lewis or marlins by charly plumet or 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.919
 Charlie Rose apparently does not decide 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.419
 between a few actors and for that 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.599
 they called robert downey junior and 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.820
 they did a kind of rehearsal with the 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.979
 actors and they would see juniors with those who 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.320
 it was better taken with tom holland 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.030
 and with charly road and to finish 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.770
 decide marvel said then since we have 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.930
 called an avenger we'll see the other and 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.240
 they took the captain america he did 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.979
 also another test with tom holland and 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.539
 It seems that they also took 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.940
 they did not even bother to call 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.520
 another and everything works also that 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.949
 they told the contracted 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.039
 and now comes the great doubt we will see you in 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.050
 civil ward at the beginning suggested the 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.569
 rumor that we'll only see a cameo in 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.509
 this movie of the actor and that will come out 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.190
 a lot that with a lot of rolling and a week 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:02.139
 but now that face has spoken and has 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.849
 said that is that you already have to be 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.550
 taking a plane and shitting milk to 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.409
 atlanta to shoot civil war holland 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.090
 will be called immediately to 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.669
 appear on the set of 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.159
 captain america civil war so get out 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.050
 it goes out in civil safe one hundred percent 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.319
 One hundred sure how much that comes out is what 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.789
 we do not know yet I do not think it's just 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.740
 a cameo because if they want to take him 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.740
 directly already filming in the middle of 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.909
 filming already so that its part begins 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.590
 I think it's just a change because for 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.900
 that could expect the shooting to end 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.240
 and then shoot your scene or they would have 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.979
 expected even a few months not 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.050
 They would have to have any kind of hurry 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.969
 but they have been in a hurry to choose you have 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.830
 chosen already and directly they are going to 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:43.900
 roll and roll so I do not think that 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.330
 be just for a scenario a second 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.669
 I think it will come out 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.729
 not very much here super the whole movie 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.439
 but an important part yes in that 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.300
 to the weight that marvel could have in the 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.620
 sony movie of spiderman that 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.830
 will join with the cinematographic universe 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.689
 from marvel it seems that everything will be the same 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.759
 that like any other movie and that 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:05.699
 there will be no problem with sony what 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:07.800
 says kevin feig is it is very exciting and 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.659
 We are treating it in the same way 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.400
 than with the rest of movies 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.770
 we want to get the best version of 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.840
 possible spiderman is definitely a 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.879
 sony pictures and marvel movie 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.099
 produces we have been working for several months 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:23.069
 and everything is working the same 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.419
 way that we do it internally is 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.190
 how to have new members in our 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.419
 team so those that have always been 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.860
 complained that marvel could not be 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.780
 order a spiderman movie 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.909
 finally they have that movie of 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.430
 marvel spiderman that you like it or not 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:37.469
 it's another thing but it's finally going to be done 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.370
 bird of course I loved how almost 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:40.370
 all of spiderman 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.630
 we have not seen any movie yet 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.330
 new from ben affleck's batman and I know 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.980
 is rumored that after the 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.950
 batman versus superman and squadron 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.870
 suicide for 2018 we could have a 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.500
 solo movie of this batman's 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.110
 ben affleck 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.850
 in fact, it seems that the 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.070
 own ben affleck this movie 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.690
 considering that warner had him 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.890
 for giving a superman kiss and they liked it 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.360
 so much so that they also had it for 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.070
 suicidal pictures would not be weird that 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.290
 I returned to a solo movie 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.450
 starring the same and directed 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.680
 for the same in humor it is also said 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.320
 what title would this new movie have 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.720
 of batman that would be called 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.790
 batman like that would have the difference of 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.460
 original spirit but it would still be a 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.650
 fairly simple title and having 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.140
 meaning but for now only a rumor and 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.129
 nothing is confirmed although it does not sound 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.709
 nothing weird
