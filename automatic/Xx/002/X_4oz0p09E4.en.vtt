00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
stretch it it'll damage the fibers and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.160 
stretch it it'll damage the fibers and
it<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.100> change<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> weight<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.930> yarn

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.520 
it will change the weight of your yarn
and<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> gauge<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:08.159> stitching<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.990> you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and the gauge of your stitching so you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.210 
and the gauge of your stitching so you
just<00:01:10.770> turn<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.930> you'll<00:01:13.590> find<00:01:13.890> several

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
just turn it and you'll find several

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.140 
just turn it and you'll find several
times<00:01:15.890> Xing<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> over<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.939> keep

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
times Xing it over and you just keep

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.800 
times Xing it over and you just keep
doing<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.909> as<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.119> gets<00:01:21.299> bigger<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
doing that and as it gets bigger and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.240 
doing that and as it gets bigger and
fills<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> slide<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> down<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.009> little

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
fills it up to slide it down a little

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.370 
fills it up to slide it down a little
bit<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> smaller<00:01:24.930> M&amp;M

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
bit you can use the smaller M&amp;M

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.749 
bit you can use the smaller M&amp;M
container<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.189> only<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> small

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
container if you only have a small

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.050 
container if you only have a small
amount<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.240> yarn<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.619> larger<00:01:29.130> in

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
amount of yarn but for your larger in

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.410 
amount of yarn but for your larger in
full<00:01:30.390> skeins<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.079> want<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.380> use<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> longer

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
full skeins you want to use the longer

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.060 
full skeins you want to use the longer
eminence<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.689> wine<00:01:37.500> time

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
eminence can here so you just wine time

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
eminence can here so you just wine time
and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.549> also<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.090> bigger<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> gets<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and then also the bigger it gets the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.889 
and then also the bigger it gets the
more<00:01:43.049> wrap<00:01:43.320> should<00:01:43.590> give<00:01:43.770> her<00:01:44.100> X<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:47.899> thought

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
more wrap should give her X so I thought

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:58.510 
more wrap should give her X so I thought
this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.439> six<00:01:49.740> or<00:01:49.920> seven<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.850> turn

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.530 

and<00:01:59.520> that's<00:01:59.850> how<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.590> I've<00:02:01.590> only<00:02:01.800> got

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
and that's how you do it I've only got

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.080 
and that's how you do it I've only got
about<00:02:03.540> two<00:02:03.870> feet<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.350> yarn<00:02:04.560> left<00:02:05.010> so<00:02:05.790> one<00:02:05.970> do

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
about two feet of yarn left so one do

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.880 
about two feet of yarn left so one do
one<00:02:06.270> more<00:02:06.510> wrap<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.140> then<00:02:07.350> I'll<00:02:07.470> kind<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.680> come

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
one more wrap and then I'll kind of come

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.800 
one more wrap and then I'll kind of come
up<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.310> back<00:02:08.340> into<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:09.060> middle<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.630> ball

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
up the back into the middle of the ball

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.630 
up the back into the middle of the ball
and<00:02:10.170> go<00:02:10.350> this<00:02:10.560> way<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.990> end<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.520> under<00:02:14.520> the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and go this way to the end and under the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.699 
and go this way to the end and under the
only<00:02:15.000> under<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.330> ones<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.660> go<00:02:15.780> horizontally

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
only under the ones that go horizontally

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.090 
only under the ones that go horizontally
you<00:02:17.459> could<00:02:17.670> tuck<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.030> little<00:02:18.330> end<00:02:18.540> under

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
you could tuck that little end under

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.170 
you could tuck that little end under
another<00:02:20.100> thing<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.490> can<00:02:20.610> do<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:20.940> take<00:02:21.150> a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
another thing you can do is just take a

another thing you can do is just take a
strip<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.630> paper<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.890> piece<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.070> tape<00:02:23.370> and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
strip of paper and a piece of tape and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.860 
strip of paper and a piece of tape and
tie<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.209> on<00:02:24.709> okay<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.480> what<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.720> do
