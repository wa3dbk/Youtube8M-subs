they're just a bunch of magnets on a
bicycle<00:00:04.920> tire<00:00:06.140> and<00:00:07.140> there<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.700> like<00:00:08.700> an<00:00:08.820> atv

the ignition coil they're not even
really<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.469> close<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.160> would<00:00:14.700> say<00:00:14.849> an<00:00:14.969> eighth

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
really that close I would say an eighth

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.029 
really that close I would say an eighth
of<00:00:15.299> an<00:00:15.389> inch<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:16.260> probably<00:00:16.470> get<00:00:16.650> much<00:00:16.830> better

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
of an inch we probably get much better

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
results if they were closer but

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.140

regardless<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.520> go<00:00:21.510> down<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:23.150> you

regardless you go down here and you
don't<00:00:24.300> see<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:24.660> there's<00:00:24.900> diodes<00:00:25.260> behind<00:00:25.710> that

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
don't see but there's diodes behind that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.160 

very<00:00:53.180> quickly

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.099 

attorneys<00:00:58.010> but<00:00:58.129> nonetheless<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:59.780> can<00:00:59.929> see

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
attorneys but nonetheless you can see

attorneys but nonetheless you can see
we're<00:01:00.260> up<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:00.739> about<00:01:00.940> 7.5<00:01:01.940> volts

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.380 

and<00:01:11.940> that's<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.360> ten<00:01:12.870> volts<00:01:13.200> there

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.990 

and<00:01:19.780> we're<00:01:19.990> currently<00:01:20.260> oh<00:01:20.500> please<00:01:21.000> 16:20

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000

and we're currently oh please 16:20
books<00:01:23.310> horizon<00:01:25.290> obviously<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.320> given<00:01:27.010> load<00:01:27.190> on

this<00:01:27.580> would<00:01:27.810> deplete<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:29.080> but<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:30.100> fact

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
this would deplete that but the fact

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.920 
this would deplete that but the fact
that<00:01:30.430> we<00:01:30.580> can<00:01:30.760> charge<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.210> giving<00:01:31.510> nothing<00:01:31.780> but

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
that we can charge it giving nothing but

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.750 
that we can charge it giving nothing but
a<00:01:31.960> magnet<00:01:32.550> magnets<00:01:33.550> on<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.730> foil<00:01:35.760> terrible

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
a magnet magnets on a foil terrible

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.710 
a magnet magnets on a foil terrible
would<00:01:37.750> easily<00:01:38.430> probably<00:01:39.430> easily<00:01:40.120> keep<00:01:40.479> up

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
would easily probably easily keep up

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.270 
would easily probably easily keep up
with<00:01:40.900> a<00:01:41.650> bank<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.580> led

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.510 

yeah<00:01:48.080> that's<00:01:49.080> almost<00:01:49.680> twice<00:01:50.040> what<00:01:50.340> we're

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
yeah that's almost twice what we're

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.480 
yeah that's almost twice what we're
getting<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.970> still<00:01:51.180> rising<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.750> means<00:01:51.990> it

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
getting it's still rising it means it

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:06.580 
getting it's still rising it means it
yeah<00:01:54.560> yeah<00:01:57.080> you<00:01:58.080> noticed<00:01:58.380> me<00:01:58.470> lose<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.830> faster

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.480 

well<00:02:07.189> let's<00:02:07.369> get<00:02:07.460> 20<00:02:07.610> volts

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:39.690 

yeah<00:02:12.850> it<00:02:13.540> really<00:02:13.690> is

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.330 

Wow

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
Wow

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.849 
Wow
we<00:02:43.340> were<00:02:43.459> only<00:02:43.549> able<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.879> get<00:02:43.999> ten<00:02:44.239> before<00:02:44.859> but

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
we were only able to get ten before but

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.050 
we were only able to get ten before but
we<00:02:47.439> you<00:02:48.439> put<00:02:48.469> the<00:02:48.709> coil<00:02:48.889> just<00:02:49.189> just<00:02:49.670> our<00:02:49.849> eighth

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
we you put the coil just just our eighth

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.300 
we you put the coil just just our eighth
inch<00:02:50.480> closer<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.170> magnets<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.010> now<00:02:52.159> we're

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
inch closer to magnets and now we're

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.690 
inch closer to magnets and now we're
getting<00:02:52.549> more<00:02:52.730> than<00:02:52.849> quite<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.859> which<00:02:54.859> would

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
getting more than quite that which would

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.069 
getting more than quite that which would
prove<00:02:55.969> that<00:02:56.299> another<00:02:56.900> joint<00:02:57.200> yeah
