 it's everybody knows how 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.960
 do you listen to me I really

 today for a new video 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.150
 this video will be a little you find 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.490
 to go back to B goes after 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.350
 the head patch for 1.65 really very 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.610
 very easily at first 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.920
 you must know that the update 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.150
 4.65 is available but she 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.130
 is not mandatory it's really the 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.240
 choice to do it or not in a first 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.310
 time you will need a usb key 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.810
 in the usb key is the root of the key 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.210
 usb you will have to create a new one 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.650
 folder you're going to call ps3 a 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.060
 times this folder create you're going to have to 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.500
 open it and in this folder created a 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.260
 new folder you are going to call 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.540
 upyd had pda t2 with an e end 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.800
 it's really very very important 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.540
 times this done now you're going 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.010
 have to open the folder is in this 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.120
 folder well you will have to put the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.560
 file that I put you from the 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.430
 description of the video that is named 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.530
 swallow everything 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.350
 you're going to have to rename it down 3 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.030
 hub date ipd tea with tea only 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.630
 and no in the end it's really very 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.580
 important 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.020
 once this is done now well 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.690
 you will have to glee this is precisely what 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.670
 file in the hub deit folder of the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.530
 usb normally if everything goes 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.060
 well it takes the loading finished you 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.380
 will of course have completed the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.030
 manipulation on the computer 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.190
 so I tell you now check 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.900
 still you the well formatted usb key in 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.320
 fat32 like that here you will not have the 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.210
 problem 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.409
 also check that there are not two 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.320
 files me I advise you when 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.729
 even 2 just before ben fits there 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.890
 you do not pause this format 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.659
 was completely the usb key at wholesale 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.040
 here are your records you put them on 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.650
 your computer and you format 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.180
 really thoroughly to the usb key in fat32 and 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.650
 you just put in just 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.600
 files you will need for alan 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.250
 b pass my god what did I do 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.240
 and like that, so that you do not have 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.290
 not those see too I want 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.240
 advise to do the same 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.420
 so here is the manipulation now 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.950
 on the computer and already 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.860
 twink I find you right now 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.299
 for the rest of the tutorial on my ps3 go to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.280
 right now so here is a 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.600
 times back on the ps3 and well you 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.369
 just have to put the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.899
 usb stick a port or in port left 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.860
 it's not important that level me 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.480
 I advise you anyway 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.860
 put in the right port as that's it 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.300
 nice start to do like me you 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.069
 you'll be sure you will not have any 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.510
 problem now you will go into the 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.980
 settings section then update 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.870
 system then now an update 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.160
 think for storage and now 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.110
 you will see that there will be a small seat 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.760
 now the ps3 I have everything going on 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.650
 well we will obviously find the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.060
 file that will be in your usb key 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.069
 now and well you will do 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.050
 chew you have to ask now 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.549
 if to simply accept the agreement 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.140
 of use I reassure you now 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.700
 I read well and there is nothing that 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.739
 mentions that we can not go to b 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.780
 now go right after that you 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.069
 ask of us is the console or 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.360
 mom do you want I'm not going tender 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.280
 because I'm defending the video and if 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.750
 I was unfairly the console the video 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.950
 is going to be too and it's going to be a 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.910
 little bit silly of my door so I'm going 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.410
 leave the console on 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.850
 I assure you it's really very 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.950
 fast is not this for that you see 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.049
 already that everyone I am 1 20% 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.220
 so here in fact you'll have two sets to 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.739
 day you will have a first update 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.810
 this one and then a second just after 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.040
 so also I admit said social gerard 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.440
 is not done yet I advise you 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.700
 really in the v it's a game if you 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.019
 have some inside because I 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.540
 made the mistake and I'm still going to a game 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.250
 in and you'll see that after that 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.450
 the game will directly launch it because 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.220
 we will not be able to take over from Europe 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.329
 is going to be a bit complicated if you 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.769
 have not removed it yet I you 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.140
 advise to cancel then 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.760
 to remove the games but also small 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.200
 parenthesis if you have questions 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.530
 about the lease because whatever it is 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.269
 is 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.920
 I recommend the same to me 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.970
 ask on twitter and not on facebook 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.280
 because I'm not hiding from you 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.290
 facebook currently i'm just getting 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.700
 a lot of messages over 140 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.590
 message currently not even two 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.060
 weeks to tell you more for 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.319
 questions loudly but passes and so 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.329
 I do not hide it's a little 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.910
 uncomplicated for me to answer I 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.319
 quote us here on twitter gdg 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.660
 a notification precisely on my 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.370
 phone only on facebook I do not have 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.510
 notification when I receive a 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.829
 message it's only when you do not 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.170
 have a publication that I have 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.670
 precisely a notification 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.440
 so that's true it's a little silly 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.420
 but I even concede to you 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.970
 deposit on twitter and on facebook or 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.920
 year 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.090
 do not be shocked if you have a 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.990
 answer after a week 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.030
 it's something I wanted 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.650
 tell you now here is now 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.210
 the first friends the first set to 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.470
 day is over sorry we will launch the 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.570
 second and you have nothing to do 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.890
 so I reassure you now the 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.480
 Research can be done alone pass 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.989
 also for that and you will be really 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.790
 nothing to do 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.500
 so I 'll find you as soon as 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.170
 precisely this update will be 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.610
 finished go to just now 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.560
 well, here we are now in 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.940
 back on the ps3 now the update 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.320
 day is obviously over we 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.420
 are currently pretty happening so 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.460
 as I wanted to say I hope you 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.320
 will not leave the video too early and 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.150
 Well, I advise you to remove the game 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.350
 if you have a game on your ps3 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.660
 did not work my land that you 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.740
 have removed does not make the drops if you 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.630
 take it off now you're going to do 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.980
 completely body the ps3 us that the 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.690
 it's still not very serious 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.550
 basically if you have a game of gold and well 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.230
 the ps3 will automatically go com 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.460
 over see him down right he had 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.940
 brands and playstation3 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.500
 7.65 mode demo so now 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.000
 badly if the game starts it's not very 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.050
 serious because me at the very least 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.250
 I still had eyes I was at 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.860
 holy it's true I do not really 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.400
 thought on the spot and well here it is 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.080
 not important 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.910
 I had to wait a few seconds for 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.830
 the whole game is loaded precisely because 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.690
 that especially gta5 is a game that 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.730
 still asks for time to load 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.320
 that these oars of which passed your g a 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.000
 Once the game is loaded you will have 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.320
 just to stay at the push of the button 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.840
 ps of the m 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.630
 ps3 you're just leaving the game 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.070
 just so now you 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.300
 will actually see that I can not do anything 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.800
 at all in fact me the modes 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.250
 demonstration there are two ways that I 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.560
 see things 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.210
 there is the way actually stuck is 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.040
 unblocked right now she's in the 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.050
 way of lautier and whenever 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.370
 you're just going to turn on the ps3 and 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.800
 well at the jump in the stuck way and 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.600
 you will always have to unlock it then 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.860
 how to unlock it there as you 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.450
 can see it we can really nothing 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.710
 do like goyer marc ayrault this 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.150
 operation can not be performed in 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.070
 demo mode you will have to go in 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.110
 security settings makes raid 1 then 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.300
 serves a more car and more select by its 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.860
 services then do either code 6 of 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.150
 5.8 or code 000063 recognize 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.770
 especially not put them in space 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.370
 comment from video 1 to help 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.020
 other people 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.310
 so now as we did not have 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.960
 it's simple you just have to go 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.730
 in the game data utility
