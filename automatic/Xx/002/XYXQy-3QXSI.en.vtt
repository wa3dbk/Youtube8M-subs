00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.780
 Hello, today I have a topic again 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.309
 same for old construction as 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:19.109
 ancestors built here I have a chimney 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:21.480
 old really want to show you here 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.119
 cross section as contact used thought 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.130
 I have a pipe here 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:30.560
 here is this pipe and now itâ€™s already like 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.329
 put it on her 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.430
 overlap here a little bit to elevate 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.460
 now will go my pad on top 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.590
 I don't really care about anything here 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.170
 I will channel solid fuel boiler 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.620
 I have a gas boiler here 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.449
 and here we have a hood here is the section we have 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.820
 the current cross section which was once here 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:04.320
 used once 9 in the stove it 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:13.979
 we have 2020 so here to see but here 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:20.600
 almost 20 centimeters for 15 this 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:23.850
 pipe if in the presence of height somewhere in 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.119
 67 meters is enough for 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.490
 heating wood 2 stoves that is no one 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.460
 there one stove did not turn off the second not 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.770
 included here were 2 ovens and both 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.320
 this boiler worked fine and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.720
 downstairs there is a gas boiler he already 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.000
 works for about a decade on this 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.350
 the pipe is also at the same height as 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.149
 times said before sometimes stew even 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.549
 boiler cicek too much traction here 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.619
 pipe to the boiler and I'm going to her 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.979
 reduce i.e. go smoothly 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.079
 less and here on the solid fuel boiler 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.880
 apparently I will leave the gilding not 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:10.200
 I will because 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:13.360
 inside the house there is a chimney and it is confused 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.330
 one downstairs it is a room and a kitchen upstairs 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.580
 somewhere two rooms will get from 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.370
 him some heat from gas too 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.420
 right here I have further if you 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.630
 look here further below 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.120
 emptiness here we will make another hole 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.000
 let's make one more hood on concrete 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:43.349
 overlap let's draw four channels 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.480
 pull the chimney further so we will build 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.769
 if everything is done initially never 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.690
 feel sorry for the hoods 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:56.290
 and channels at his home the same trust 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.959
 my experience they will always be useful to you 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.540
 superfluous you will never come 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.870
 sometime gas goes sometime gas 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.989
 service you start to think give me shock 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.269
 vent through wall 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:19.230
 it is somehow not serious and good luck 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.230
 work think combine for now
