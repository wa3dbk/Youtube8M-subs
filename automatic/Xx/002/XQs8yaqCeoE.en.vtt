recessed windows and I wanted to see if
you<00:00:28.680> could<00:00:28.800> give<00:00:28.949> us<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.099> little<00:00:29.220> tour<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.550> how

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you could give us a little tour of how

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.339 
you could give us a little tour of how
we<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.240> those<00:00:30.420> because<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.750> course<00:00:31.050> that's<00:00:31.230> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
we do those because of course that's a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.130 
we do those because of course that's a
tricky<00:00:31.740> detail<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:33.360> easy<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.870> do<00:00:33.960> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
tricky detail and it's easy to do it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.569 
tricky detail and it's easy to do it
wrong<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.710> end<00:00:34.829> up<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.130> window<00:00:35.370> leak

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
wrong and end up with a window leak

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.549 
wrong and end up with a window leak
later<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.690> do<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.170> house<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
later so what do we do on this house is

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.740 
later so what do we do on this house is
a<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:37.710> different<00:00:38.100> Robert<00:00:38.540> well<00:00:39.540> we

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
a little different Robert well we

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
a little different Robert well we
actually<00:00:40.170> installed<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.160> head<00:00:41.430> flashing<00:00:41.730> which

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
actually installed a head flashing which

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.299 
actually installed a head flashing which
is<00:00:42.450> kind<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.079> difficult<00:00:43.290> than<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.920> little<00:00:44.190> bit

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
is kind of difficult than a little bit

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.029 
is kind of difficult than a little bit
more<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.520> common<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.030> recessed<00:00:45.510> window<00:00:46.039> we

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
more in common with a recessed window we

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430 
more in common with a recessed window we
also<00:00:47.190> used<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.910> Tyvek<00:00:48.329> flex<00:00:48.899> trap<00:00:49.140> system

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
also used the Tyvek flex trap system

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.160 
also used the Tyvek flex trap system
which<00:00:49.890> creates<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.820> very<00:00:50.850> good<00:00:51.510> watertight

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
which creates a very good watertight

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.220 
which creates a very good watertight
seal<00:00:52.949> around<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.489> nailer<00:00:54.030> flanges<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> in

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
seal around the nailer flanges and in

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.049 
seal around the nailer flanges and in
fact<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> system<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:56.190> made<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.670> recessed

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
fact the system that's made for recessed

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.720 
fact the system that's made for recessed
windows<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.930> RW<00:00:58.649> branded<00:00:59.100> product

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
windows this is an RW branded product

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.670 
windows this is an RW branded product
from<00:00:59.820> dupont<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.480> robert<00:01:01.230> actually<00:01:01.350> made<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
from dupont and robert actually made a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.189 
from dupont and robert actually made a
sample<00:01:02.010> board<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.670> us<00:01:02.789> over<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
sample board for us over here on the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.990 
sample board for us over here on the
various<00:01:04.470> stages<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> stuff<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.700> let's<00:01:05.909> go

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
various stages of the stuff but let's go

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.980 
various stages of the stuff but let's go
over<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.210> take<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.360> look<00:01:06.510> at<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.630> real<00:01:06.810> quick

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
over and take a look at that real quick

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.080 
over and take a look at that real quick
come<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.200> around

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.630 

so<00:01:14.090> we<00:01:14.270> made<00:01:14.510> this<00:01:14.720> sample<00:01:15.200> board<00:01:15.440> up<00:01:16.190> ahead<00:01:16.610> of

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
so we made this sample board up ahead of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.580 
so we made this sample board up ahead of
time<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:16.940> that<00:01:17.210> our<00:01:17.450> crews<00:01:17.750> would<00:01:17.990> know<00:01:18.200> how<00:01:18.560> to

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
time so that our crews would know how to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.190 
time so that our crews would know how to
install<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.190> windows<00:01:19.490> correctly<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.360> it's

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
install the windows correctly and it's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.719 
install the windows correctly and it's
kind<00:01:21.440> of<00:01:21.470> a<00:01:21.560> neat<00:01:21.710> sample<00:01:22.100> because<00:01:22.370> it<00:01:22.490> really

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
kind of a neat sample because it really

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.000 
kind of a neat sample because it really
shows<00:01:23.030> all<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.720> stages<00:01:24.050> so<00:01:24.470> let's<00:01:24.650> start<00:01:24.890> down

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
shows all the stages so let's start down

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.920 
shows all the stages so let's start down
here<00:01:25.220> in<00:01:25.310> this<00:01:25.400> corner<00:01:25.729> you<00:01:26.090> can<00:01:26.600> see<00:01:26.780> we're

that<00:01:50.990> Robert<00:01:51.320> walk<00:01:51.500> us<00:01:51.680> through<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.979> rest<00:01:52.160> of

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
that Robert walk us through the rest of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:05.370 
that Robert walk us through the rest of
the<00:01:52.369> laughing<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:52.880> the<00:02:03.070> edge<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.369> window

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the laughing and the edge of the window

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.510 
the laughing and the edge of the window
once<00:02:06.380> that<00:02:06.619> was<00:02:06.800> in<00:02:06.950> place

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
once that was in place

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.100 
once that was in place
we<00:02:07.640> added<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:08.269> small<00:02:08.959> piece<00:02:09.229> of<00:02:09.440> foam<00:02:11.110> rather

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
we added a small piece of foam rather

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.390 
we added a small piece of foam rather
than<00:02:12.380> having<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.860> solid<00:02:14.769> material<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:16.340> it

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
than having a solid material and it

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.890 
than having a solid material and it
keeps<00:02:16.610> our<00:02:16.790> weight<00:02:17.030> down<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.750> minimizes

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
keeps our weight down and it minimizes

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.610 
keeps our weight down and it minimizes
start<00:02:18.650> cracking<00:02:19.190> right<00:02:19.840> then<00:02:20.840> we<00:02:21.230> went<00:02:21.470> in

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
start cracking right then we went in

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.840 
start cracking right then we went in
with<00:02:22.390> jumbo<00:02:23.390> Tech's<00:02:23.739> two<00:02:24.739> plies<00:02:25.010> 60-minute

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
with jumbo Tech's two plies 60-minute

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.030 
with jumbo Tech's two plies 60-minute
paper<00:02:26.060> which<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.989> bonded<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.829> edge<00:02:28.010> here

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
paper which we bonded to the edge here

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.030 
paper which we bonded to the edge here
and<00:02:28.700> then<00:02:29.660> we<00:02:29.780> put<00:02:29.959> in<00:02:30.049> our<00:02:30.170> corner<00:02:30.680> which<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:30.920> a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
and then we put in our corner which is a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.699 
and then we put in our corner which is a
bullnose<00:02:31.519> corner<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:33.019> then<00:02:33.290> we<00:02:33.380> went<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.680> with

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
bullnose corner and then we went in with

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.650 
bullnose corner and then we went in with
our<00:02:33.980> scratch<00:02:34.280> coat<00:02:34.579> where<00:02:34.880> we<00:02:35.000> filled<00:02:35.269> this<00:02:35.420> up

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
our scratch coat where we filled this up

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:44.220 
our scratch coat where we filled this up
and<00:02:36.200> then<00:02:37.130> we<00:02:37.220> went<00:02:37.370> over<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.640> our<00:02:37.910> brown<00:02:38.180> coat

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.050 

percent<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.320> our<00:02:45.470> mission<00:02:46.040> finish<00:02:46.400> which<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.820> a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
percent of our mission finish which is a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.229 
percent of our mission finish which is a
very<00:02:47.239> fine<00:02:47.540> aggregate<00:02:48.140> with<00:02:48.380> integral<00:02:48.769> color

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
very fine aggregate with integral color

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.520 
very fine aggregate with integral color
that<00:02:50.239> gives<00:02:50.570> it<00:02:50.720> very<00:02:50.840> beautiful<00:02:51.440> very<00:02:53.530> chic

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
that gives it very beautiful very chic

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.229 
that gives it very beautiful very chic
looking<00:02:55.010> yeah<00:02:55.280> it's<00:02:55.549> just<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:55.820> finished

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
looking yeah it's just like finished

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.330 
looking yeah it's just like finished
hero<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.690> then<00:02:56.780> we've<00:02:56.989> actually<00:02:57.170> hand<00:02:57.590> trowel

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
hero and then we've actually hand trowel

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.320 
hero and then we've actually hand trowel
Robert<00:03:00.340> one<00:03:00.460> of<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.610> thing<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.820> want<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.030> point

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
Robert one of the thing I want to point

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.910 
Robert one of the thing I want to point
out<00:03:01.510> up<00:03:01.690> here<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:02.020> is<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.230> head<00:03:02.500> flash

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
out up here this is the head flash

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.300 
out up here this is the head flash
that's<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:03.910> pretty<00:03:04.150> unusual<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.690> see<00:03:04.960> and

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
that's it's pretty unusual to see and

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.220 
that's it's pretty unusual to see and
this<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.520> a<00:03:06.550> tricky<00:03:07.000> detail<00:03:07.450> but<00:03:07.780> what<00:03:07.930> we<00:03:08.050> did

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
this is a tricky detail but what we did

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.470 
this is a tricky detail but what we did
actually<00:03:08.470> was<00:03:08.830> slid<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.520> head<00:03:09.760> flashing<00:03:10.090> in

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
actually was slid that head flashing in

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.900 
actually was slid that head flashing in
there<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.990> this<00:03:11.500> upper<00:03:12.070> section<00:03:12.430> here<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.760> is

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
there and this upper section here is is

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.240 
there and this upper section here is is
counted<00:03:13.540> is<00:03:13.720> actually<00:03:14.320> candid<00:03:14.680> back<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> little

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
counted is actually candid back a little

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.100 
counted is actually candid back a little
bit<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.640> head<00:03:15.790> flashing<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.450> it's<00:03:16.900> tough

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
bit to the head flashing and it's tough

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.690 
bit to the head flashing and it's tough
to<00:03:17.200> see<00:03:17.380> but<00:03:17.560> there<00:03:17.710> is<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:17.860> weep<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.370> there<00:03:18.550> and

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
to see but there is a weep in there and

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.430 
to see but there is a weep in there and
we<00:03:18.790> really<00:03:19.060> wanted<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.390> stucco<00:03:19.960> if<00:03:20.290> any

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
we really wanted that stucco if any

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.930 
we really wanted that stucco if any
water<00:03:20.650> gets<00:03:20.980> back<00:03:21.160> here<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.460> be<00:03:21.550> able<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.760> weep

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
water gets back here to be able to weep

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.360 
water gets back here to be able to weep
out<00:03:22.350> underneath<00:03:23.350> there<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.890> it's<00:03:24.010> tough<00:03:24.250> to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
out underneath there and it's tough to

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.770 
out underneath there and it's tough to
see<00:03:24.550> with<00:03:24.700> this<00:03:24.850> head<00:03:25.030> flush<00:03:25.270> but<00:03:25.540> there<00:03:25.660> is<00:03:25.750> a

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
see with this head flush but there is a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.540 
see with this head flush but there is a
weave<00:03:26.050> there<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.830> one<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.190> things<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.520> I

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
weave there and one of the things that I

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.160 
weave there and one of the things that I
really<00:03:27.880> appreciate<00:03:28.270> about<00:03:28.300> Roberts<00:03:28.840> crew<00:03:29.050> is

see he's got an upturn or apartment he's
got<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.130> kind<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.060> town<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:35.350> dam<00:03:35.590> on<00:03:35.860> these

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
got a kind of a town and dam on these

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.490 
got a kind of a town and dam on these
head<00:03:36.670> flashings<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:37.420> then<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:37.990> flashing<00:03:38.260> is

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
head flashings and then this flashing is

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.250 
head flashings and then this flashing is
a<00:03:38.530> really<00:03:38.860> nice<00:03:39.040> ham<00:03:39.790> on<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.150> end<00:03:40.300> here<00:03:40.600> so<00:03:41.050> any

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
a really nice ham on the end here so any

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.510 
a really nice ham on the end here so any
water<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.590> gets<00:03:41.740> on<00:03:42.040> there<00:03:42.190> is<00:03:42.280> going<00:03:42.430> to

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
water that gets on there is going to

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.100 
water that gets on there is going to
drip<00:03:42.700> out<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:42.970> side<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.210> and<00:03:43.570> drip<00:03:43.990> away

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
drip out the side and and drip away

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.350 
drip out the side and and drip away
harmlessly<00:03:44.710> without<00:03:45.070> getting<00:03:45.400> into<00:03:45.610> that<00:03:45.700> so

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
harmlessly without getting into that so

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.330 
harmlessly without getting into that so
we<00:03:46.510> we<00:03:46.780> basically<00:03:47.230> followed<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.800> main

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
we we basically followed the main

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.370 
we we basically followed the main
principle<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.060> flashing<00:03:49.690> around<00:03:50.080> windows

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
principle of flashing around windows

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.980 
principle of flashing around windows
which<00:03:50.740> is<00:03:50.770> down<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.460> out<00:03:51.580> down<00:03:51.970> an<00:03:52.120> outlet<00:03:52.750> and

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
which is down and out down an outlet and

if you do not follow that there's

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.910 
if you do not follow that there's
generally<00:03:54.580> problems<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.690> follow<00:03:55.960> we<00:03:56.320> also<00:03:56.500> use

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
generally problems to follow we also use

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.060 
generally problems to follow we also use
a<00:03:57.220> foam<00:03:58.000> backer<00:03:58.300> rod<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:58.990> that<00:03:59.140> we<00:03:59.260> don't<00:03:59.440> get<00:03:59.770> a

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
a foam backer rod so that we don't get a

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.400 
a foam backer rod so that we don't get a
very<00:04:00.310> thick<00:04:01.180> joint<00:04:01.540> because<00:04:02.140> if<00:04:02.290> you

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
very thick joint because if you

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.680 
very thick joint because if you
have<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.620> three<00:04:03.040> bond<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.700> three<00:04:03.970> sided<00:04:04.210> bond

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
have a three bond a three sided bond

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.440 
have a three bond a three sided bond
with<00:04:05.050> caulk<00:04:05.320> one<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:05.740> them<00:04:05.860> will<00:04:06.040> fail<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.670> we

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
with caulk one of them will fail so we

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.960 
with caulk one of them will fail so we
end<00:04:07.600> up<00:04:07.720> with<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.960> actually<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.620> shallow<00:04:09.160> caulk

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
end up with a actually a shallow caulk

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.110 
end up with a actually a shallow caulk
bond<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:11.440> is<00:04:11.620> glued<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.490> the<00:04:12.730> backer<00:04:12.940> rod
