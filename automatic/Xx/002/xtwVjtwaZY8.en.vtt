00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 Today we make mushrooms and that in 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.030
 daddy shape how do you feel with all sorts of things 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.460
 delicious cold and I'll show you now 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.010
 What she needs for that and to ten 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.699
 mushrooms some spinach leaf spinach 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.529
 Thawed because we have a fresh one 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.980
 Player did not make the pasta at all 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.640
 purely 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.970
 then you need some garlic 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.279
 Half an onion and some feta cheese 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.329
 I washed off the champignon and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.329
 now I can stop them you can too 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.760
 just aim at it in this style 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.100
 that one has but so you get it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.829
 I also have the others before 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:53.070
 prepared and now we feel that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.539
 a few nice things that's good 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.789
 that's why we start with it 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.320
 Sounds like a very small one is coming 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.769
 a little bit clean because you see there is 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.250
 not so much space then comes 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:13.380
 some onions that for this to 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.700
 taste some garlic very important 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.159
 Of course it can not 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:24.240
 then leave that out with something 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:28.740
 rosemary or other herbs take on 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.329
 fresh herbs a little pepper and then 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.350
 As topping we take sheep cheese in 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:42.450
 brussels we may quietly generously 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.220
 be ready and when our little ones 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.119
 Tapas I now give up in one 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.759
 I have run down with olive oil already 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.619
 prepared and who does not like spinach 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.340
 It can also be another variant 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.009
 do 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.479
 I cut tomatoes small here 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.920
 we just feel it with a few 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:09.360
 had great so are clear then almost 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:17.670
 small bruschetta champignon again 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:21.390
 to pursue the same procedure 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.840
 who knows me and here again 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.760
 sheep cheese roll on it and ready and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.879
 I do that with the others too 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:39.090
 then they come in the oven at 200 degrees 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:47.959
 circulated for about half an hour 20 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:47.959
 minutes are finished z
