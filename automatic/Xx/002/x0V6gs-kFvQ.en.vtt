I haven't played any deaf yam game so I

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.630 
I haven't played any deaf yam game so I
couldn't<00:02:15.569> tell<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:15.870> that's<00:02:16.050> true<00:02:16.319> or<00:02:16.440> not

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
difference to the main series is that

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.880 
difference to the main series is that
you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.090> switch<00:02:24.300> fighting<00:02:24.720> styles<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.319> level

up your main level and style level you
upgrade<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.350> experience<00:02:28.950> points<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:29.790> you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
upgrade the experience points but you

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.850

here<00:03:06.319> lastly<00:03:07.319> a<00:03:07.350> very<00:03:07.620> minor<00:03:07.920> thing<00:03:08.040> they

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
here lastly a very minor thing they

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.979 
here lastly a very minor thing they
improved<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:09.720> you're<00:03:09.840> holding

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
improved is that if you're holding

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.229 
improved is that if you're holding
something<00:03:10.200> at<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.739> end<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.040> fight<00:03:11.310> Tetsuo

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
something at the end of a fight Tetsuo

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.130 
something at the end of a fight Tetsuo
will<00:03:12.360> throw<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.720> away

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
will throw it away

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.140 
will throw it away
