have really thin curly hair it has

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.150 
have really thin curly hair it has
reached<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> state<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.230> does<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.739> even<00:00:56.039> look

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160

call level 5 or a level 6 from maybe

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.770 
call level 5 or a level 6 from maybe
like<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.300> level<00:03:38.630> two<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.550> then<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:41.030> purple

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
like a level two and then that purple

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.500 
like a level two and then that purple
wash<00:03:42.050> has<00:03:42.440> been<00:03:42.620> put<00:03:42.860> over<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.400> there<00:03:44.210> are

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
wash has been put over it there are

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.300 
wash has been put over it there are
certain<00:03:45.050> products<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.650> will<00:03:45.710> actually<00:03:45.860> lift

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
certain products that will actually lift

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.640 
certain products that will actually lift
and<00:03:46.640> deposit<00:03:47.150> colors<00:03:47.510> with<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:48.020> intensity

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
and deposit colors with this intensity

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.770 
and deposit colors with this intensity
but<00:03:49.340> it's<00:03:49.760> definitely<00:03:50.060> something<00:03:50.480> that<00:03:50.630> I

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
but it's definitely something that I

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.510 
but it's definitely something that I
would<00:03:50.960> recommend<00:03:51.260> for<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.650> professional<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
would recommend for a professional to

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.600 
would recommend for a professional to
handle<00:03:53.000> but<00:03:53.960> what<00:03:54.230> what<00:03:54.620> didn't<00:03:54.980> happen<00:03:55.130> here

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
handle but what what didn't happen here

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.730 
handle but what what didn't happen here
is<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:55.940> they<00:03:56.090> didn't<00:03:56.420> necessarily<00:03:56.560> make<00:03:57.560> it

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
is that they didn't necessarily make it

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.800 
is that they didn't necessarily make it
super<00:03:58.190> blonde<00:03:58.460> and<00:03:58.790> then<00:03:58.970> add<00:03:59.210> the<00:03:59.420> purple

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
super blonde and then add the purple

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.780 
super blonde and then add the purple
because<00:04:00.350> then<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.710> would<00:04:00.800> look<00:04:00.980> crazy<00:04:01.250> bright

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
because then it would look crazy bright

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.880 
because then it would look crazy bright
it's<00:04:02.300> been<00:04:02.540> brought<00:04:02.810> up<00:04:02.990> to<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.260> different

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
it's been brought up to a different

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.490 
it's been brought up to a different
level<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.340> then<00:04:04.550> I<00:04:04.790> think<00:04:05.270> I<00:04:05.420> personally<00:04:05.960> can

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.250 
level and then I think I personally can
tell<00:04:06.740> from<00:04:07.370> this<00:04:07.550> picture<00:04:07.670> that<00:04:08.420> there's<00:04:08.930> been
