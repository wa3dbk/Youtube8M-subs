cutters that has a round edge to it so

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.779 
cutters that has a round edge to it so
for<00:00:24.449> example<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:25.529> grape<00:00:26.160> or<00:00:26.400> pine<00:00:26.609> country

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
for example this grape or pine country

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.880 
for example this grape or pine country
I'm<00:00:27.150> not<00:00:27.300> sure<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:28.080> flower<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.590> and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I'm not sure and this flower one and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.519 
I'm not sure and this flower one and
some<00:00:29.670> polymer<00:00:29.970> clay<00:00:30.119> first<00:00:31.019> roll<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.500> your

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
some polymer clay first roll out your

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.950 
some polymer clay first roll out your
clay<00:00:32.099> into<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.610> thick<00:00:33.090> piece<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.719> one

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
clay into a thick piece like this one

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.709 
clay into a thick piece like this one
and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.370> want<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.149> cut

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
and then what you want to do is just cut

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.200 
and then what you want to do is just cut
your<00:00:36.840> piece<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.410> into<00:00:38.070> preferably<00:00:39.059> your

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
your piece out into preferably your

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.610 
your piece out into preferably your
square<00:00:39.510> piece<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.230> want<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.530> could

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
square piece but if you want you could

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.979 
square piece but if you want you could
also<00:00:40.800> cut<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.340> into<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> rectangle<00:00:42.780> piece

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
also cut it out into a rectangle piece

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
also cut it out into a rectangle piece
and<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.710> I'm<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> define<00:00:44.520> by<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
and then I'm just going to define by the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.380 
and then I'm just going to define by the
edges<00:00:45.750> by<00:00:46.050> pushing<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.460> blade<00:00:48.059> like

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
edges by pushing in with my blade like

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.410 
edges by pushing in with my blade like
so<00:00:49.070> after<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.399> take<00:00:50.640> any<00:00:50.879> sign<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so after that just take any sign you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.189 
so after that just take any sign you
want<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.899> cut<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> circular<00:00:53.129> piece<00:00:54.199> and

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
want and cut out a circular piece and

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.380 
want and cut out a circular piece and
don't<00:00:55.920> throw<00:00:56.219> away<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.760> leftover<00:00:57.120> piece

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
don't throw away the leftover piece

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.349 
don't throw away the leftover piece
because<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.809> will<00:00:57.989> use<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.230> also<00:00:59.149> so<00:01:00.149> now

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
because you will use it also so now

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.630 
because you will use it also so now

currently with what we have we're just
going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.910> use<00:01:03.120> our<00:01:03.390> fingernails<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.409> make<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
going to use our fingernails to make the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190 
going to use our fingernails to make the
edges<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.640> more<00:01:05.939> softer<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:06.659> pushing<00:01:06.900> in

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
edges a bit more softer by pushing in

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.020 
edges a bit more softer by pushing in

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
piece of polymer clay that you had just

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
piece of polymer clay that you had just
cut<00:01:15.210> out<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.780> then<00:01:16.049> attach<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.950> other

cut out and then attach it to the other
side<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.780> blend<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.320> um<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:20.070> have

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
side and to just blend it um just have

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.990 
side and to just blend it um just have
to<00:01:21.290> carefully<00:01:22.290> smudge<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.890> everything<00:01:23.580> using

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
to carefully smudge in everything using

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.200 
to carefully smudge in everything using
your<00:01:24.210> fingers<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.810> course<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:26.100> one<00:01:26.460> side<00:01:26.820> of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
your fingers of course so if one side of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.660 
your fingers of course so if one side of
the<00:01:27.810> block<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.229> thicker<00:01:28.500> than<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> other<00:01:28.979> then

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the block is thicker than the other then

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
the block is thicker than the other then
move<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.030> fingers<00:01:30.600> from<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.020> thicker<00:01:31.380> side

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
move your fingers from like thicker side

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
move your fingers from like thicker side
to<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> inner<00:01:32.220> side<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.549> example<00:01:33.000> nice<00:01:33.270> cut

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
to the inner side for example nice cut

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.929 
to the inner side for example nice cut
small<00:01:33.960> piece<00:01:34.170> was<00:01:34.350> thinner<00:01:34.619> than<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.220> piece

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
small piece was thinner than the piece

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.149 
small piece was thinner than the piece
that<00:01:36.180> originally<00:01:36.930> was<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:37.979> going

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that originally was there so I'm going

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.920 
that originally was there so I'm going
to<00:01:38.189> start<00:01:38.280> from<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.299> go<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> there

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
to start from here and then go to there
