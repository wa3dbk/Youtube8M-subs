00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.810
 is the disappointment for you too 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.790
 deep kenneth vermeer 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.130
 certainly sure because if you look the 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.510
 was expired 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.280
 you simply combine from 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.900
 minute 1 now give 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.119
 everyone was practically nothing and 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.090
 Then it is actually sour because you yourself 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.140
 creates the opportunities but even more so 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.490
 not in friborg 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.200
 hey I've never known it 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.200
 experienced that feyenoord in amsterdam 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.430
 but which was so dominant and it 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.020
 our own qualities with our own 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.759
 game to play with have 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.090
 done 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.370
 save i think i are where we share we 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.660
 have been the boss and that is that you know 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.430
 not end up yourself 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.380
 predominates in you also also a 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.150
 sure kind of frustration you see that 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.610
 you as you walk down the field jordy 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.620
 Clasie it says and that it is also 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.420
 the social reasons that they 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.240
 dominated and they indicate nothing 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.090
 away you create the opportunity yourself and then it is 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.710
 acid that is not one of going in there 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.480
 is also another plus in to 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.970
 Rotterdam lost this port and that 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.600
 spin right but disappointment about it 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.189
 first time 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.780
 it felt a bit like a defeat 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.159
 a tip tray to our day do not much 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.509
 especially after his defeat 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.310
 you still have to act a container too 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.170
 occur where you are very sparing 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.909
 opportunities serve warmer but then you are there 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.859
 well what was it somewhere else separate this 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.119
 afternoon for you 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.789
 it is and yes it is quite 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.159
 especially because you have dillema for 10 years 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.539
 but beyond that I found it 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.340
 under normal competition 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.259
 why also reach the laptop normally 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.030
 what do you get with the hot bite 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.759
 what is called what 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.109
 we dear in this microphone 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.210
 yes i think i don't want it either 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.310
 but your mother needs to talk 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.810
 spoken text I don't have either 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.100
 just continue everything but we don't do that 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.139
 so many brakes purely focused on the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.209
 you had a bit of a competition there 

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:45.920
 keep in mind how sad that is 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.630
 that's what it thought 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.979
 we know for sure because I have sensitive 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.240
 made a switch 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.100
 you know it can happen we knew 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.380
 is it going to happen but I 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.630
 don't worry about me 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.759
 it's a long time ago what a 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.109
 to be a Feyenoord goalkeeper in Amsterdam 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.939
 goal clean new then we must again 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.100
 back to the 70s is that still 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.689
 something that you take very positively with you 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.060
 or if you don't feel like it at all 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.250
 to hear positive things now that it is 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.410
 always nice and good if you are fine as a team 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.370
 that it now holds 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.230
 but is still nice at home three 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.060
 take home items there as 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.700
 you look at it on the wall was a 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.550
 defeat and boots little positive 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.840
 weird to talk about 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.760
 the only bright spot that we just quite 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.140
 played well and that is not before 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.480
 a big one for the first time this season 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.520
 trailing on psv how is that possible 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.840
 so you might be the best 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.430
 play football in feyenoord of the latter 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.050
 years and the backlog of all those people 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.640
 where is it then 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.569
 is that sec the lack of scoring 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.360
 power for example in this 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.890
 matches well I think we yes we 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.320
 were with some can she goes whole 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.670
 good chances 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.959
 was row one in go then you know 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.180
 just that you are going to win a competition 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.300
 and that is now because nuns stay 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.220
 it remains exciting but the next 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.220
 just have to start winning success again
