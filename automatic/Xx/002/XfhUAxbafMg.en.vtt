00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.180
 holy odile 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.910
 we will introduce you during 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.860
 this video the journey of a patient 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.660
 when taken care of by 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.660
 rapid recovery after surgery 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.980
 I was operated on Friday so in 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.800
 Late morning I returned to work 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.050
 Monday morning at 8am gt gt operational with 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.300
 some inconvenience obviously this 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.920
 that he reaches the crutches so 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.879
 obviously it's not always easy 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.790
 but without water without pain without any 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.920
 apprehension and with a lot of 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.870
 facilitated the purpose of recovery 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.160
 fast is trying to do 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 understand to patients that the act 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.390
 Surgical will go to the background 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.880
 that is, what will count is 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.720
 before all the recovery he's going 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.699
 to have 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.590
 after his surgery the act 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.040
 surgical is only a step in 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.200
 the evolution of his hospitalization there is 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.649
 before there is the surgical act there is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.649
 after 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.760
 pre operative information 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.580
 something important 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.770
 already you know exactly the schedule 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.540
 and how things are going to happen 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.820
 you also have the protocol of 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.070
 operation and protocol 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.080
 postoperative are elements that 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.750
 are very important for your management 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.200
 everyday and know in what you 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.190
 you launch and what will be the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.320
 steps to go 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.610
 the patient who arrives at the clinic is 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.040
 first supported by the services 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.340
 completely 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.910
 classic and is then admitted into 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.890
 room or preparation of the operation 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.220
 is done quite 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.220
 town 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.240
 this preparation for and relatively 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.250
 fast and lasts about an hour and 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.600
 halfway between the moment of his arrival the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.280
 when she will arrive at the block 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.160
 operative fast recovery after 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.560
 surgery in anesthesia that means 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.640
 mainly a maximum comfort for 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.130
 our patients ie a 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.950
 optimization of our techniques so that 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.690
 surgery is the minimum impact on 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.330
 the everyday life of our patients indeed 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.709
 our patients can hydrate up 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.750
 two hours before the intervention 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.770
 after the intervention we resume the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.150
 as quickly as possible 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.010
 normal diet 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.440
 the surgical procedure lasts between 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.300
 30 and 40 minutes and the patient will be 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.440
 excluded b wake up in the hour that 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.150
 will follow the intervention 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.830
 she will then be reassembled very 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.000
 quickly in his room from the middle 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.940
 of the afternoon the patient 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.800
 will be demedicalized will be infused 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.020
 will offer a snack and a 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.500
 normal diet will be resumed as soon as 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.470
 evening 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.120
 you do not eat everything not very 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.660
 hungry me you drank chocolate that's 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.170
 already better 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.350
 you drank water if you allow 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.100
 the patient to stand up according to 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.660
 his desires 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.110
 she can go freely to 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.790
 toilets for example or wander in 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.760
 his room in the hallway according 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.440
 of this possibility and its desires to 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.510
 the outcome of this day the recovery 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.100
 fast after surgery allows the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.989
 passion to be autonomous for gestures 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.760
 of everyday life and if she 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.770
 wish may allow the return to 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.070
 home the same evening if everything happens 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.930
 well 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.400
 four hours after a time when you 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.350
 have a snack you come back 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.290
 at home it's settled the next day 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.860
 of the intervention a nurse will pass 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.480
 at the patient's home to organize the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.580
 reinjection of analgesics into 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.160
 the joint that was operated on and 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.480
 redo the first dressing the message 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.959
 that you will not pass on to patients 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.260
 as for fast care and that 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.340
 by experience patients with 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.320
 benefited from this support 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.000
 recovers much faster than 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.510
 patients who remain hospitalized the 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.160
 major benefits it saves time 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.709
 clearer support more 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.180
 effective faster a management of the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.150
 pain that is still via the 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.010
 new treatments not comparable 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.570
 it's just not comparable I 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.190
 feel better is undeniable 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.420
