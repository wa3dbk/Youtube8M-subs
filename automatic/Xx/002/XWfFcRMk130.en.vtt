00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:05.450 

okay<00:00:02.909> today<00:00:03.270> I'm<00:00:03.629> going<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.200> do<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.040> little

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
okay today I'm going to do a little

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.370 
okay today I'm going to do a little
trial<00:00:05.879> with<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.330> level<00:00:06.810> virtual<00:00:07.639> lab<00:00:09.200> just<00:00:10.200> to

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
trial with the level virtual lab just to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.890 
trial with the level virtual lab just to
see<00:00:10.740> how<00:00:11.130> good<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.849> interface<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.570> for

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
see how good this interface is for

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.539 
see how good this interface is for
running<00:00:13.259> through<00:00:13.440> some<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.920> experiments

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
running through some of the experiments

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.269 
running through some of the experiments
that<00:00:14.610> they<00:00:14.910> do<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.240> we're<00:00:15.450> doing<00:00:15.780> syncs

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.920 

basically<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:21.750> can

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
basically you have to have you can

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.509 
basically you have to have you can
download<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.350> software<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:22.920> free<00:00:22.949> from<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
download the software for free from the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.980 
download the software for free from the
leadbolt<00:00:23.939> website<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:27.060> then<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.660> need<00:00:27.840> to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
leadbolt website and then you need to

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.140 
leadbolt website and then you need to
have<00:00:28.170> either<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.529> USB<00:00:29.070> dongle<00:00:29.310> or<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.699> networked

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
have either a USB dongle or a networked

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.170 
have either a USB dongle or a networked
dongle<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:33.320> make<00:00:34.320> sure<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.520> been

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
dongle to make sure that the it's been

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.040 
dongle to make sure that the it's been
paid<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.480> basically<00:00:38.420> I'll<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.480> check<00:00:39.809> that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
paid for basically I'll just check that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
paid for basically I'll just check that
is<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.040> okay<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.760> Australia<00:00:42.210> we've<00:00:42.360> got

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
is right now okay in Australia we've got

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
is right now okay in Australia we've got
240<00:00:42.930> volts

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.610 

sometimes<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.820> rendering<00:00:48.750> takes<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> lot

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
sometimes the rendering takes up a lot

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.500 
sometimes the rendering takes up a lot
of<00:00:49.649> CPU<00:00:50.190> processing<00:00:52.879> so<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.180> click<00:00:54.329> on

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
of CPU processing so we can click on

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.479 
of CPU processing so we can click on
hardware<00:00:54.719> acceleration<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.340> also

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
hardware acceleration and you can also

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
hardware acceleration and you can also
reduce<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:58.129> level<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.219> detail<00:00:59.640> here<00:01:00.199> just<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
reduce the level of detail here just to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.300 
reduce the level of detail here just to
try<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.660> speed<00:01:03.660> things<00:01:03.930> up

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:27.240 

yep<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.520> I'll<00:01:12.640> just<00:01:12.790> restart<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.510> again

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.200 

okay<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.979> that<00:01:31.100> should<00:01:31.250> operate<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.579> lot<00:01:31.729> faster

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
okay so that should operate a lot faster

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.910 
okay so that should operate a lot faster
now<00:01:33.159> just<00:01:34.159> check<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:34.609> security<00:01:35.329> as<00:01:35.659> well

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
now just check this security as well

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.880 
now just check this security as well
options<00:01:37.569> security<00:01:38.569> device<00:01:38.899> that<00:01:39.619> should<00:01:39.770> be

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
options security device that should be

00:01:39.890 --> 00:02:01.830 
options security device that should be
network

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.450 

okay<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.439> hopefully<00:02:03.799> that's<00:02:03.979> worked<00:02:04.340> out<00:02:06.460> now

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
okay so hopefully that's worked out now

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.250 
okay so hopefully that's worked out now
going<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.820> drop<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:08.929> some<00:02:09.140> components<00:02:11.980> Dino<00:02:14.260> we

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
going to drop in some components Dino we

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.479 
going to drop in some components Dino we
might<00:02:15.470> do<00:02:15.620> DC<00:02:16.129> motor<00:02:16.370> first<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:19.069> can<00:02:19.190> get<00:02:19.340> them

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
might do DC motor first you can get them

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:29.090 
might do DC motor first you can get them
off<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.910> list<00:02:20.450> here<00:02:20.750> as<00:02:20.840> well

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:40.160 

power<00:02:30.100> supply<00:02:34.380> okay<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:37.569> I'll<00:02:37.660> just<00:02:37.690> save<00:02:38.020> that

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
power supply okay so I'll just save that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.110 
power supply okay so I'll just save that
it<00:02:41.170> could<00:02:41.410> be<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:42.280> security<00:02:42.670> device<00:02:42.940> is

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
it could be that the security device is

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.940 
it could be that the security device is
only<00:02:43.270> accessible<00:02:43.690> off<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.140> student<00:02:44.530> subnet

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
only accessible off the student subnet

00:02:44.950 --> 00:03:00.309 
only accessible off the student subnet
and<00:02:45.070> not<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.550> staff<00:02:45.790> subnet<00:02:48.810> which<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.990> fine

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.900 

just<00:03:01.319> means<00:03:01.500> I'll<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:01.890> make<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.700> next

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
just means I'll have to make the next

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.760 
just means I'll have to make the next
part<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.270> video<00:03:03.450> off<00:03:04.440> one<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.650> the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
part of this video off one of the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.190 
part of this video off one of the
student<00:03:05.130> computers<00:03:08.510> but<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.569> can<00:03:09.780> still<00:03:09.989> set

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
student computers but I can still set

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.059 
student computers but I can still set
everything<00:03:10.500> else<00:03:10.709> up<00:03:10.890> for<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.220> experiment<00:03:16.069> or

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
everything else up for the experiment or

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.820 
everything else up for the experiment or
acquisition<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:20.930> let's<00:03:21.930> put<00:03:22.140> some<00:03:22.319> loads<00:03:22.590> in

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
acquisition and let's put some loads in

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.190 
acquisition and let's put some loads in
here

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.140 

synchronizing<00:03:31.200> module<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.760> basically

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
synchronizing module so basically

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.420 
synchronizing module so basically
setting<00:03:33.420> up<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.599> same<00:03:33.840> way<00:03:34.050> we<00:03:34.349> have<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
setting up the same way we have in the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:47.460 
setting up the same way we have in the
actual<00:03:35.730> lab

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:04:19.200 

fall<00:03:48.070> say<00:03:48.760> they's

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:28.430 

lap

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:37.460 

okay<00:04:29.440> DC<00:04:30.100> motor

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.410 

and<00:04:38.470> you<00:04:38.740> can<00:04:38.860> zoom<00:04:38.890> in<00:04:39.310> on<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:40.360> window

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
and you can zoom in on that window

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.170 
and you can zoom in on that window
so<00:04:43.420> just<00:04:43.630> zoom<00:04:43.840> in<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.730> then<00:04:45.730> I'll<00:04:45.880> reduce

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
so just zoom in and then I'll reduce

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.360 
so just zoom in and then I'll reduce
that<00:04:47.310> point<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.490> right-click<00:04:49.980> lower<00:04:50.980> front

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
that point a right-click lower front

00:04:51.370 --> 00:05:00.240 
that point a right-click lower front
panels<00:04:52.380> join<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.530> belt<00:04:53.740> together<00:04:57.720> okay<00:04:59.250> and

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
panels join the belt together okay and

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.920 
panels join the belt together okay and
that's<00:05:00.490> as<00:05:00.610> far<00:05:00.670> as<00:05:01.030> I<00:05:01.120> can<00:05:01.180> go<00:05:01.420> for<00:05:01.810> now<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:03.930> can

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
that's as far as I can go for now I can

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:13.190 
that's as far as I can go for now I can
actually<00:05:05.170> make<00:05:05.320> some<00:05:05.500> hookup<00:05:06.100> everything

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.550 

okay<00:05:14.200> I've<00:05:14.290> got<00:05:14.470> to<00:05:14.710> figure<00:05:15.010> 2-3<00:05:16.000> 1<00:05:16.560> separately

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
okay I've got to figure 2-3 1 separately

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.320 
okay I've got to figure 2-3 1 separately
excited<00:05:17.680> DC<00:05:17.950> generator<00:05:18.580> coupled<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:19.120> the

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
excited DC generator coupled to the

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:27.540 
excited DC generator coupled to the
prime<00:05:20.200> mover<00:05:22.890> no<00:05:23.890> electrical<00:05:24.460> load<00:05:25.560> so<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:27.430> get

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
prime mover no electrical load so to get

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:38.660 
prime mover no electrical load so to get
this<00:05:27.700> right<00:05:34.920> just<00:05:35.920> make<00:05:36.130> all<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.430> connections

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
this right just make all the connections

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:45.300 
this right just make all the connections
talk<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:41.350> talk<00:05:42.630> speed<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:43.840> speed<00:05:44.230> and<00:05:44.560> in<00:05:45.190> the

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
talk the talk speed the speed and in the

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.640 
talk the talk speed the speed and in the
common<00:05:45.700> and<00:05:46.150> it's<00:05:46.660> really<00:05:46.960> pretty<00:05:47.110> much<00:05:47.320> wired

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
common and it's really pretty much wired

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.510 
common and it's really pretty much wired
up<00:05:47.800> exactly<00:05:48.310> how<00:05:48.520> the<00:05:48.580> actual<00:05:49.320> LED<00:05:50.320> bulb<00:05:50.620> 8006

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
up exactly how the actual LED bulb 8006

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.770 
up exactly how the actual LED bulb 8006
system<00:05:51.910> is<00:05:52.060> wired<00:05:52.300> up<00:05:53.760> we've<00:05:54.760> got<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:55.030> 24<00:05:55.570> volt

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
system is wired up we've got the 24 volt

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:11.840 
system is wired up we've got the 24 volt
AC<00:05:55.960> power

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:39.060 

and

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:46.720 

okay<00:06:40.070> yes<00:06:40.730> what's<00:06:40.970> just<00:06:41.180> the<00:06:41.330> prime<00:06:41.810> mover<00:06:45.730> one

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
okay yes what's just the prime mover one

00:06:46.730 --> 00:07:05.679 
okay yes what's just the prime mover one
and<00:06:46.850> two<00:06:47.030> guys<00:06:47.450> two<00:06:47.840> voltage

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:05.689 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:19.209 

and<00:07:06.689> fix<00:07:07.289> DC<00:07:07.710> supply<00:07:09.770> goes<00:07:10.770> through<00:07:11.249> I<00:07:11.669> to<00:07:15.199> five

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:19.219 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:25.249 

six<00:07:20.219> goes<00:07:20.490> to<00:07:20.639> seven<00:07:23.449> to<00:07:24.449> the<00:07:24.569> night<00:07:24.749> and<00:07:25.020> then

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.259 
six goes to seven to the night and then

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:35.120 
six goes to seven to the night and then
return

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.130 

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:41.510 

okay<00:07:37.190> now<00:07:39.380> my<00:07:40.380> let<00:07:40.590> me<00:07:40.710> turn<00:07:40.920> everything<00:07:41.250> on

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 
okay now my let me turn everything on

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.520 
okay now my let me turn everything on
and<00:07:41.850> turn<00:07:42.660> on<00:07:42.810> that<00:07:42.900> I<00:07:42.960> can't<00:07:43.170> take<00:07:43.350> any

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:43.530 
and turn on that I can't take any

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.770 
and turn on that I can't take any
measurements<00:07:43.830> because<00:07:44.190> uh<00:07:44.630> it's<00:07:45.630> not

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:45.780 
measurements because uh it's not

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.120 
measurements because uh it's not
detecting<00:07:46.290> the<00:07:46.470> security<00:07:46.980> device<00:07:49.010> but<00:07:50.010> that's

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.130 
detecting the security device but that's

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:58.760 
detecting the security device but that's
taken<00:07:50.700> as<00:07:50.820> far<00:07:51.030> as<00:07:51.180> I<00:07:51.300> can<00:07:51.360> get<00:07:51.660> they<00:07:57.410> but<00:07:58.410> when

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:58.770 
taken as far as I can get they but when

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.740 
taken as far as I can get they but when
I<00:07:58.800> got<00:07:58.980> that<00:07:59.160> security<00:07:59.550> device<00:07:59.910> tax<00:08:00.300> then<00:08:00.660> I

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:00.750 
I got that security device tax then I

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:07.280 
I got that security device tax then I
will<00:08:00.900> be<00:08:01.020> able<00:08:01.230> to<00:08:01.320> get<00:08:01.440> all<00:08:01.560> this<00:08:01.680> running<00:08:06.290> so

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:07.290 
will be able to get all this running so

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.980 
will be able to get all this running so
I'll<00:08:07.380> just<00:08:07.500> leave<00:08:07.650> it<00:08:07.800> there
