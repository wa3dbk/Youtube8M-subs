 these goals the merina andoc states of cc oo one and that seconded local what 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.980
 Let's do 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.870
 and change it 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.830
 trias we specify or the ends transferred from that point furthermore we 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.970
 exhausted 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.660
 we say yes 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.060
 for me it's a big pressure now let's go the second goal does exactly what 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.840
 same 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.969
 abc cooperation and now the master instructor the same 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.300
 annual meola inn 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.479
 Thistle drivers are nc solids and drivers

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.159
 what to apply now 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.430

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.079
 pass the level of the team is that the domain 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.429
 let's go the right button abounded 2008 native 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:19.119
 with deafness access of the greens in the user city was active in 2008 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:20.879

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.699
 a change in the personality of the domain 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.699
 modified hurst 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.869
 now he is telling us that we can not do it yet because he 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.999
 we have a domain trio like in 2003 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:42.409
 let's hoist the migration the degree of mastery and exposures to climb 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.109
 assessed the level of functionality 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.569
 with this ending this video the stake invites you to watch the next video in the
