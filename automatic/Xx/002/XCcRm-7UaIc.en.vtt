the good pronation be able to rotate the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.630 
the good pronation be able to rotate the
forearm<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> wrist<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.560> and<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.489> going

forearm the wrist up and out it's going

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
forearm the wrist up and out it's going
to<00:00:50.700> give<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.060> height<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.570> speed<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
to give you the height the speed the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
to give you the height the speed the
spins<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.130> need<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> good<00:00:53.730> serve<00:00:54.000> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
spins that you need on a good serve so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.330 
spins that you need on a good serve so

it starts with that good grip another

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.240 
it starts with that good grip another
way<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.700> can<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.180> grip<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.720> by<00:00:58.200> using<00:00:58.500> the

way we can get that grip is by using the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.910 
way we can get that grip is by using the
pen<00:00:59.520> okay<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.710> writing

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
pen okay we just like in a writing

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.070 
pen okay we just like in a writing
motion<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.550> put<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.880> on<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.420> grip<00:01:03.660> itself

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
motion we put it on the grip itself

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.350 
motion we put it on the grip itself
leave<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.009> right<00:01:05.160> there<00:01:05.489> under<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.759> under<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
last thing we talk about is maybe

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.230 
last thing we talk about is maybe
sliding<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.010> little<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:39.210> a

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
sliding down just a little bit for a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.690 
sliding down just a little bit for a
little<00:01:39.479> more<00:01:39.659> leverage<00:01:39.960> off<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.770> edge<00:01:40.920> most

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
little more leverage off the edge most

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.310 
little more leverage off the edge most
really<00:01:42.030> good<00:01:42.210> servers<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.900> do<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
really good servers are going to do that

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.840 
really good servers are going to do that
just<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> helps<00:01:44.340> them<00:01:44.580> give<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> little

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
just because it helps them give a little

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.530 
just because it helps them give a little
bit<00:01:45.270> more<00:01:45.330> pronation<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.530> little<00:01:47.009> bit<00:01:47.159> more

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
bit more pronation a little bit more

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.999 
bit more pronation a little bit more
racket<00:01:48.540> speed<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:49.080> go<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> serve

racket speed as they go up on the serve

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.700 
racket speed as they go up on the serve
now<00:01:50.640> let's<00:01:50.880> show<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.299> few<00:01:51.409> serves<00:01:52.409> with

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
now let's show you a few serves with

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.969
