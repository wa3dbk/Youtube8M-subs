 norm that everything is fine all good if 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.740
 here preparing things for him and he was 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.170
 easy for family day seen 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.599
 that you prepared some early cupcakes 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 and because I think mom deserves what 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.630
 best 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.430

 with all the heart of the world yes good 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.129
 let's explain then the three I'm going to 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.109
 do so that the ladies are encouraged to 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.359
 do it because they are very simple but 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.559
 they are very pretty very striking price and 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.440
 that is the most important thing 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.859
 very sure that mom will be very 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.500
 happy with these threads and of course 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.510
 we hear you thanks normal good I'll 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.250
 make an explanation about the three 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.019
 so that the ladies have the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.359
 possibility of being able to perform them 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.370
 remember that they choose a rich cupcake one 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.260
 with good stuffing that mommy likes 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.909
 with chocolate with candy that day is 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.799
 permitted 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.130
 good what we are going to do for example 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:15.969
 in the case where he is with the rosita 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.810
 It is a mass that I stretch it stretched 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.030
 with a stick texture dore 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.610
 what we are going to do is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.500
 cut it out with the circle depends on 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.450
 circumference of our cupcake and with 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.240
 this is almost systems start what 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.299
 I'm going to do is try to perform well 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.729
 all the edges landmarks of this this 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.970
 circle if what I did once 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.800
 I had a white paste with a powder 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 for for cakes what I do is I'm going 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.500
 brushing and I'm giving color and then 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.509
 with another polvito more brightness cited more 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.780
 nacre powder I can put it in shape 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.780
 round to also give color and give 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.440
 a different aspect with this I what 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.970
 would do is cover the cupcake and once 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.350
 I have done this free to explain something very 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.780
 simple at this time in many 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.159
 cameos being sold or is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.580
 many molds what we're going to 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.530
 do is take the mold with pasta come on 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.720
 to remove it from the mold and what we do 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.590
 it is in the central part what I did 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.480
 here I put a little vegetable inah 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.810
 of manteros that swims in the central part 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.850
 so that I would stick a little more 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.340
 nacre powder yes then what I do 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:32.050
 so look, it's like a little magical me 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.910
 and there it starts to shine 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.910
 if I'm going to let it dry 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.520
 well in what nice brightness it takes and if 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.260
 I have a little pink or some 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.780
 the brush he gives a little bit a little 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.220
 more clarito I know that it is precious a 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.320
 Once it is finished what I am going to 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.590
 to do is place him on the edge of 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.570
 golden powder and I insert a stick 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.600
 a stick to later to be able 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.580
 introduce it inside the cupcake 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.080
 little flowers in the market there are a lot of 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.990
 molds with different types of 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.390
 little flowers that I can put paste 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.030
 inside and look at the demolding and 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.200
 simply following the same step of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.090
 just with the edge quoted I go and step nothing 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.560
 more than on the outgoing remember that if 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.630
 the dough is dry 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.240
 we're just going to moisten a little 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.370
 the edges then when I pass 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.790
 to be shiny and without any problem 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.410
 if in this way we have there so that 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.630
 you can perform those two that you 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.990
 indicate how we are going to do the one that has 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.069
 the black and white flower we're just going 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.010
 shorten 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.219
 they have to simple let's cut 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.560
 little flowers of different sizes in white 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.180
 and in black we stretch finite and what 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.819
 let's do is paste one over the other 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.380
 come here I have a white 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.020
 and I'll put that black one on top 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.670
 in this way and I would stay this 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.760
 is here and here I go back to do 3 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.160
 same all of different sizes 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.630
 I'm riding one over the other what 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.260
 I can do if I want to give it a little 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.480
 of form is with the bobbin 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.340
 to look for a little bit to be able to give 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.730
 a little bit more in shape then I do 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.709
 one on the other I'm riding and I 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.560
 would be the three little flowers that is the 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.680
 little flower that you see there in black if 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.090
 what I did and down was a stencil 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.590
 that is what I will explain again 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.690
 because it is a very nice technique for 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.539
 be able to perform in class 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.970
 now as I did with the other the other 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.220
 lady is extremely simple and 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.380
 easy we just have to so that 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.760
 those ladies who do not dare not 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.010
 they have a lot of practice 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.889
 simply balls we are going to take 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.740
 balls we are going to put ourselves 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.639
 and butter in hand we're going to do 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.280
 small balls of different sizes 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.740
 there 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.270
 we make a smaller one bigger 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.930
 the colors we can make that 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.860
 we like it more 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.379
 and we're just going to put 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.780
 something 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:10.530
 bright here in a container placed 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.620
 the balls in this way and what I do 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.509
 I'm turning them then what I can 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.370
 to do is to have prepared a lot of 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.349
 these balls of different sizes and 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.240
 When I need them, I'm going to 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.969
 use without any problems 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.370
 then you can use them blank in 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:29.009
 violet in the color that I that to me more 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.719
 I like it more then it is important of everything 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.949
 this is that you can have all 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.569
 the elements prepared with 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.789
 before or flowers with 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.669
 anterioridad cameos with 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.379
 before the balls prepare 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.449
 before and a little secret that I want to give you 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.490
 these balls can be the little balls 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.860
 of chocolate that you are going to 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.240
 line a little with pasta and then the 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.520
 it goes through a face then when the 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.219
 mom is going to eat dies for those little balls and 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.110
 well in which he does not like chocolate 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:06:00.210
 sure secured soft for more and the 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.219
