top I'm going to accelerate through the

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.369 
top I'm going to accelerate through the
section<00:04:04.450> but<00:04:05.450> I<00:04:05.510> want<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.690> be<00:04:05.780> focusing<00:04:06.290> on

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
section but I want to be focusing on

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.050 
section but I want to be focusing on
what's<00:04:06.590> down<00:04:06.799> at<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:06.980> bottom<00:04:07.160> where<00:04:07.430> they're

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
what's down at the bottom where they're

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.699 
what's down at the bottom where they're
quite<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.239> tidy<00:04:08.510> compression<00:04:09.260> down<00:04:09.440> there

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
quite a tidy compression down there

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.259 
quite a tidy compression down there
which<00:04:10.129> is<00:04:10.280> probably<00:04:10.489> more<00:04:10.700> worrying<00:04:11.060> than<00:04:11.090> the

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
which is probably more worrying than the

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.059 
which is probably more worrying than the
roots<00:04:11.480> themselves<00:04:12.109> so<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.620> need<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:12.980> be

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
roots themselves so I need to be

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.309 
roots themselves so I need to be

is going to try and scream my name and

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.940 
is going to try and scream my name and
draw<00:04:17.269> my<00:04:17.419> attention<00:04:17.450> into<00:04:18.139> it<00:04:18.260> rather<00:04:18.709> than

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
draw my attention into it rather than

draw my attention into it rather than
looking<00:04:19.280> through<00:04:19.579> it<00:04:19.700> after<00:04:20.389> that

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
looking through it after that

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.089 
looking through it after that
compression<00:04:20.930> if<00:04:21.229> I'm<00:04:21.349> looking<00:04:21.650> into<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.039> and

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
compression if I'm looking into it and

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.350 
compression if I'm looking into it and
I'll<00:04:22.220> make<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.520> through<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.789> look<00:04:23.060> up<00:04:23.210> and
