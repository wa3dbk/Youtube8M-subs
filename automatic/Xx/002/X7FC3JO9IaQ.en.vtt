00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
yes I understand this is the PlayStation

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.819 
yes I understand this is the PlayStation
1<00:01:02.180> but<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.480> PlayStation<00:01:03.020> 1<00:01:03.140> is<00:01:03.290> capable<00:01:03.739> of

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
1 but the PlayStation 1 is capable of

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.039 
1 but the PlayStation 1 is capable of
much<00:01:04.070> more<00:01:04.129> than<00:01:04.579> this<00:01:04.759> now<00:01:05.420> I<00:01:05.449> could<00:01:05.719> let<00:01:05.899> go

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
much more than this now I could let go

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.810 
much more than this now I could let go
of<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.290> lame<00:01:06.500> visuals<00:01:06.979> if<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.310> game<00:01:07.460> played

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
of the lame visuals if the game played

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.149 
of the lame visuals if the game played
well<00:01:08.090> but<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:08.780> doesn't<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.439> combat<00:01:09.860> isn't<00:01:10.009> a

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
well but it doesn't the combat isn't a

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.880 
well but it doesn't the combat isn't a
word<00:01:10.369> awkward<00:01:10.790> moving<00:01:11.719> attacking<00:01:12.380> jumping

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
word awkward moving attacking jumping

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.980 
word awkward moving attacking jumping
flying<00:01:13.340> doing<00:01:13.939> special<00:01:14.450> moves<00:01:14.689> and<00:01:14.899> just

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
flying doing special moves and just

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.330 
flying doing special moves and just
trying<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.439> make<00:01:15.560> contact<00:01:15.829> with<00:01:16.189> your

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
trying to make contact with your

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.090 
trying to make contact with your
opponent<00:01:16.399> it's<00:01:17.149> all<00:01:17.360> very<00:01:17.749> very<00:01:18.350> awkward<00:01:18.649> and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
opponent it's all very very awkward and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.099 
opponent it's all very very awkward and
to<00:01:19.280> be<00:01:19.369> blunt<00:01:19.639> it's<00:01:19.850> just<00:01:20.090> not<00:01:20.359> fun<00:01:20.719> if<00:01:21.020> the

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
to be blunt it's just not fun if the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.449 
to be blunt it's just not fun if the
games<00:01:21.289> not<00:01:21.499> fun<00:01:21.770> then<00:01:22.039> there's<00:01:22.219> really<00:01:22.340> no

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
games not fun then there's really no

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.090 
games not fun then there's really no
point<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:23.539> game<00:01:23.689> presents<00:01:23.869> no<00:01:24.289> story<00:01:24.649> for<00:01:24.950> you

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
point the game presents no story for you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.949 
point the game presents no story for you
which<00:01:25.369> makes<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.850> terrible<00:01:26.270> combat<00:01:26.689> even

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
which makes the terrible combat even

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.480 
which makes the terrible combat even
more<00:01:27.139> so<00:01:27.409> because<00:01:27.709> there's<00:01:27.920> nothing<00:01:28.069> to<00:01:28.219> gain

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
more so because there's nothing to gain

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.279 
more so because there's nothing to gain
from<00:01:28.549> it<00:01:28.909> although<00:01:29.240> be<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:29.779> that<00:01:29.899> this<00:01:30.079> is<00:01:30.259> a

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
from it although be it that this is a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.139 
from it although be it that this is a
Dragonball<00:01:30.770> Z<00:01:31.009> game<00:01:31.039> it<00:01:31.429> would<00:01:31.520> probably<00:01:31.759> be

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
Dragonball Z game it would probably be

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.910 
Dragonball Z game it would probably be
the<00:01:32.329> same<00:01:32.539> rehash<00:01:33.020> thing<00:01:33.319> over<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.679> over

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
the same rehash thing over and over

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.739 
the same rehash thing over and over
again<00:01:34.039> but<00:01:34.429> even<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.479> would<00:01:35.630> have<00:01:35.689> been

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
again but even so it would have been

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:36.279 
again but even so it would have been
nice

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
nice

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.289 
nice
no<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.380> suppose<00:01:36.679> one<00:01:37.130> decent<00:01:37.399> aspect<00:01:37.939> about<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
no I suppose one decent aspect about the

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.029 
no I suppose one decent aspect about the
game<00:01:38.479> might<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.139> music<00:01:39.619> one<00:01:39.829> or<00:01:39.950> two

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
game might be the music one or two

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.769 
game might be the music one or two
tracks<00:01:40.340> were<00:01:40.520> decent<00:01:40.880> enough<00:01:41.090> although<00:01:41.659> the

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:41.779 
tracks were decent enough although the

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:43.870 
tracks were decent enough although the
Japanese<00:01:41.990> dub<00:01:42.469> of<00:01:42.499> DBZ<00:01:42.889> sounds<00:01:43.399> extremely

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
Japanese dub of DBZ sounds extremely

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.789 
Japanese dub of DBZ sounds extremely
weird<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.479> me<00:01:44.630> because<00:01:44.929> I'm<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.289> used<00:01:45.529> to<00:01:45.649> the

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
weird to me because I'm so used to the

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.830 
weird to me because I'm so used to the
American<00:01:45.979> dub<00:01:46.429> plus<00:01:46.819> Goku<00:01:47.450> sounding<00:01:47.719> like

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
American dub plus Goku sounding like

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.050 
American dub plus Goku sounding like
he's<00:01:47.990> five<00:01:48.259> years<00:01:48.289> old<00:01:48.709> really<00:01:49.399> never<00:01:49.759> set

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
he's five years old really never set

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.179 
he's five years old really never set
