welcome back to another mod showcase and
today<00:00:18.020> it's<00:00:18.320> going<00:00:18.440> to<00:00:18.500> be<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:18.710> rings<00:00:18.980> of

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
today it's going to be the rings of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.760 
today it's going to be the rings of
power<00:00:19.550> mod<00:00:19.970> it<00:00:20.390> adds<00:00:20.930> in<00:00:21.140> a<00:00:21.230> bunch<00:00:21.439> of<00:00:21.529> rings

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
power mod it adds in a bunch of rings

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.230 
power mod it adds in a bunch of rings
that<00:00:21.890> give<00:00:22.070> you<00:00:22.160> special<00:00:22.369> abilities<00:00:22.970> like

that give you special abilities like
flying<00:00:23.660> in<00:00:23.960> teleporting<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.340> I<00:00:25.370> figured<00:00:25.730> to

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
flying in teleporting so I figured to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.120 
flying in teleporting so I figured to
make<00:00:26.060> this<00:00:26.210> review<00:00:26.420> interesting<00:00:27.170> I<00:00:27.320> made<00:00:28.039> an

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
make this review interesting I made an

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.770 
make this review interesting I made an
obstacle<00:00:28.550> course<00:00:28.700> and<00:00:29.210> I'll<00:00:29.300> put<00:00:29.450> it<00:00:29.539> up<00:00:29.600> for

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
obstacle course and I'll put it up for

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.139 
obstacle course and I'll put it up for
download<00:00:30.110> like<00:00:30.260> I<00:00:30.380> normally<00:00:30.770> do<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.220> yeah

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
download like I normally do and yeah

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.160 
download like I normally do and yeah
we're<00:00:32.270> going<00:00:32.390> to<00:00:32.419> try<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.629> get<00:00:32.809> through<00:00:33.050> the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
we're going to try to get through the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.110 
we're going to try to get through the
rings<00:00:33.440> of<00:00:33.649> power<00:00:33.890> obstacle<00:00:34.610> course

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
rings of power obstacle course

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.000 
rings of power obstacle course
so<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.719> first<00:00:35.899> recipe<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:36.469> really<00:00:36.770> need<00:00:36.920> to

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
so the first recipe you really need to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.099 
so the first recipe you really need to
know<00:00:37.190> because<00:00:37.640> it's<00:00:37.820> like<00:00:37.910> using<00:00:38.629> every

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:39.109 
know because it's like using every

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:41.350 
know because it's like using every
single<00:00:39.140> ring<00:00:39.770> recipe<00:00:40.310> is<00:00:40.520> how<00:00:41.060> to<00:00:41.120> make<00:00:41.270> the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
single ring recipe is how to make the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.150 
single ring recipe is how to make the
common<00:00:41.660> ring<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.500> need<00:00:42.620> a<00:00:42.680> bucket<00:00:42.920> of<00:00:43.130> lava

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
common ring you need a bucket of lava

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.660 
common ring you need a bucket of lava
and<00:00:43.640> iron<00:00:44.090> ingots<00:00:44.570> around<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.350> guys<00:00:46.340> for

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
and iron ingots around it and guys for

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.700 
and iron ingots around it and guys for
the<00:00:46.880> Rings<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.300> actually<00:00:47.750> work<00:00:47.960> you<00:00:48.230> need<00:00:48.380> fuel

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
the Rings to actually work you need fuel

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.950 
the Rings to actually work you need fuel
so<00:00:49.670> there's<00:00:49.910> a<00:00:49.970> few<00:00:50.090> different<00:00:50.360> choices<00:00:50.540> you

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
so there's a few different choices you

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.310 
so there's a few different choices you
can<00:00:51.170> use<00:00:51.320> coal<00:00:51.620> charcoal<00:00:52.660> glowstone<00:00:53.660> dust<00:00:53.719> and

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
can use coal charcoal glowstone dust and

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.620 
can use coal charcoal glowstone dust and
redstone<00:00:55.250> dust<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.059> can<00:00:56.180> actually<00:00:56.329> use

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
redstone dust and you can actually use

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.569 
redstone dust and you can actually use
their<00:00:56.809> block<00:00:57.020> forms<00:00:57.410> as<00:00:57.559> well<00:00:57.770> which<00:00:58.340> lasts

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
their block forms as well which lasts

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.790 
their block forms as well which lasts
longer<00:00:59.030> so<00:00:59.270> a<00:00:59.300> block<00:00:59.540> of<00:00:59.690> redstone<00:00:59.870> glowstone

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
longer so a block of redstone glowstone

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.369 
longer so a block of redstone glowstone
and<00:01:01.040> a<00:01:01.399> block<00:01:01.640> of<00:01:01.670> coal<00:01:02.000> but<00:01:02.840> yeah<00:01:02.960> first<00:01:03.200> thing

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
and a block of coal but yeah first thing

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.550 
and a block of coal but yeah first thing
we<00:01:03.590> got<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.739> do<00:01:03.980> is<00:01:04.219> avoid<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:04.969> lava<00:01:05.380> so<00:01:06.380> for

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
we got to do is avoid the lava so for

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.380 
we got to do is avoid the lava so for
that<00:01:06.649> we<00:01:06.920> are<00:01:07.070> going<00:01:07.219> to<00:01:07.340> need<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:07.880> teleport

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.260 
that we are going to need the teleport
ring<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.409> make<00:01:09.560> this<00:01:09.770> for<00:01:10.490> diamonds<00:01:10.939> the

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
ring and to make this for diamonds the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.430 
ring and to make this for diamonds the
common<00:01:11.630> ring<00:01:11.810> which<00:01:12.020> I<00:01:12.140> showed<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.409> guys

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
common ring which I showed you guys

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.340 
common ring which I showed you guys
before<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:13.159> for<00:01:13.880> any<00:01:14.030> pearls<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.110> I'll<00:01:15.200> put

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
before and for any pearls so I'll put

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.469 
before and for any pearls so I'll put
this<00:01:15.440> in<00:01:15.590> my<00:01:15.710> inventory<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.460> whenever<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:17.150> use

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
this in my inventory and whenever I use

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.890 
this in my inventory and whenever I use
it<00:01:17.659> it's<00:01:17.840> going<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.080> use<00:01:18.260> some<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:18.820> fuel

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900

so all we got to do is avoid this lava
so<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.060> know<00:01:23.240> aim<00:01:23.450> right<00:01:24.020> click<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.560> we<00:01:24.950> can

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
so you know aim right click and we can

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.940 
so you know aim right click and we can
easily<00:01:25.340> make<00:01:26.299> it<00:01:26.360> over<00:01:26.630> this<00:01:26.780> really<00:01:27.650> cool<00:01:27.799> for

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
easily make it over this really cool for

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.830 
easily make it over this really cool for
getting<00:01:28.130> around<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.180> last<00:01:29.390> part<00:01:29.720> of<00:01:29.780> the

getting around the last part of the
obstacle<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.200> tried<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.770> make<00:01:30.920> harder<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:31.400> we

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
obstacle I tried to make harder so we

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.130 
obstacle I tried to make harder so we
have<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.640> aim<00:01:31.760> it's<00:01:32.000> like<00:01:32.150> perfectly<00:01:32.570> play<00:01:32.990> is

checkpoints and for this we are going to
need<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:46.250> flying<00:01:46.640> ring<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.720> make<00:01:47.869> this

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
need the flying ring and to make this

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.140 
need the flying ring and to make this
for<00:01:48.530> diamonds<00:01:48.920> once<00:01:49.100> again<00:01:49.400> with<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.790> common

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
for diamonds once again with the common

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.080 
for diamonds once again with the common
ring<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:50.570> for<00:01:51.229> feathers<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:51.979> guys<00:01:52.880> it's

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
ring and for feathers and guys it's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.969 
ring and for feathers and guys it's
pretty<00:01:53.240> obvious<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.869> recipes<00:01:54.320> are<00:01:54.530> not<00:01:54.680> cheap

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
pretty obvious the recipes are not cheap

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.069 
pretty obvious the recipes are not cheap
you<00:01:55.130> know<00:01:55.159> diamonds<00:01:55.490> are<00:01:55.759> not<00:01:56.210> exactly<00:01:56.780> cheap

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
you know diamonds are not exactly cheap

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.740 
you know diamonds are not exactly cheap
materials<00:01:57.530> but<00:01:58.310> definitely<00:01:58.790> worth<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.119> so<00:01:59.600> all

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
materials but definitely worth it so all

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.450 
materials but definitely worth it so all
we<00:01:59.869> need<00:02:00.020> is<00:02:00.200> this<00:02:00.290> in<00:02:00.500> our<00:02:00.650> inventory<00:02:00.920> and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
we need is this in our inventory and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.340 
we need is this in our inventory and
when<00:02:01.909> we<00:02:02.000> fly<00:02:02.270> it's<00:02:02.630> going<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.840> use<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.140> up

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
when we fly it's going to use this up

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.380 
when we fly it's going to use this up
over<00:02:03.680> time<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.640> now<00:02:04.850> just<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.180> there<00:02:05.299> in

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
over time so now just like there in

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.529 
over time so now just like there in
create<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.659> double<00:02:06.500> tap<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.909> are<00:02:08.209> in<00:02:08.420> the

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
create a double tap and you are in the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.509 
create a double tap and you are in the
air<00:02:08.659> that<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.289> checkpoint<00:02:09.590> number<00:02:09.950> one<00:02:10.250> and

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
air that is checkpoint number one and

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.059 
air that is checkpoint number one and
also<00:02:11.390> as<00:02:11.629> you<00:02:11.810> could<00:02:11.989> probably<00:02:12.260> guess<00:02:12.560> you

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
also as you could probably guess you

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.160 
also as you could probably guess you
don't<00:02:13.250> take<00:02:13.459> any<00:02:13.730> fall<00:02:14.090> damage<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.079> we're

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
don't take any fall damage so we're

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.239 
don't take any fall damage so we're
going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.319> try<00:02:15.499> to<00:02:15.559> go<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.739> these<00:02:15.919> different

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:16.249 
going to try to go to these different

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.009 
going to try to go to these different
checkpoints<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.909> tried<00:02:17.659> to<00:02:17.779> make<00:02:17.900> this

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
checkpoints I tried to make this

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.569

the<00:03:00.469> ring<00:03:00.620> actually<00:03:01.010> tracks<00:03:01.370> snow<00:03:01.669> and<00:03:01.849> ice<00:03:02.000> as

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
the ring actually tracks snow and ice as

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.869 
the ring actually tracks snow and ice as
well<00:03:02.449> which<00:03:02.689> is<00:03:02.719> pretty<00:03:03.109> cool<00:03:03.319> so<00:03:04.219> this<00:03:04.370> one<00:03:04.669> is

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
well which is pretty cool so this one is

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.659 
well which is pretty cool so this one is
the<00:03:05.150> ice<00:03:05.329> ring<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.049> to<00:03:06.530> make<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:06.949> you<00:03:07.489> guys

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:07.669 
the ice ring and to make it you guys

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:08.800 
the ice ring and to make it you guys
probably<00:03:07.879> already<00:03:08.030> noticed<00:03:08.480> everything

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
probably already noticed everything

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.689 
probably already noticed everything
requires<00:03:09.290> diamonds<00:03:09.859> in<00:03:09.949> a<00:03:10.069> common<00:03:10.459> ring<00:03:10.579> in

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
the middle and this one can be made two

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.159 
the middle and this one can be made two
different<00:03:12.949> ways<00:03:13.250> blocks<00:03:13.849> of<00:03:14.030> snow<00:03:14.209> or<00:03:14.810> blocks

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:15.169 
different ways blocks of snow or blocks

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.259 
different ways blocks of snow or blocks
of<00:03:15.349> ice<00:03:15.530> all<00:03:16.459> right<00:03:16.609> so<00:03:16.669> I'm<00:03:16.730> gonna<00:03:16.849> grab<00:03:17.060> this

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
of ice all right so I'm gonna grab this

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.789 
of ice all right so I'm gonna grab this
it<00:03:17.510> does<00:03:17.689> a<00:03:17.719> couple<00:03:17.989> different<00:03:18.319> things<00:03:18.530> like
