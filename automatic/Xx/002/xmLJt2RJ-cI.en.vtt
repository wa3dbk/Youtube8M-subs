but<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.930> my<00:03:27.930> feeling<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:29.690> she<00:03:30.690> was<00:03:30.870> caught

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
but I my feeling is that she was caught

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.870 
but I my feeling is that she was caught
an<00:03:31.350> accomplice<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:34.640> compromising<00:03:35.640> situation

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.690 

she<00:03:38.880> was<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.330> lesbian<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.900> FBI<00:03:43.550> put<00:03:44.550> the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
she was a lesbian and the FBI put the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.930 
she was a lesbian and the FBI put the
pressure<00:03:44.910> on<00:03:45.090> us<00:03:45.209> she<00:03:46.580> yeah<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.760> was<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
pressure on us she yeah and so it was a

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.440 
pressure on us she yeah and so it was a
shock<00:03:51.360> when<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.900> happened<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:53.880> think<00:03:54.030> it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
shock when that happened and I think it

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.600 
shock when that happened and I think it
was<00:03:54.600> very<00:03:54.900> sad<00:03:55.230> because<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.069> many<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.430> the
