hey<00:00:05.940> everybody<00:00:06.420> it's<00:00:06.600> Jason<00:00:07.020> blaha<00:00:07.290> here<00:00:07.589> and

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
hey everybody it's Jason blaha here and

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.530 
hey everybody it's Jason blaha here and
today<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.189> thought<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.460> would<00:00:08.519> answer<00:00:09.000> another

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
today I thought I would answer another

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.150 
today I thought I would answer another
little<00:00:09.840> question<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.349> got<00:00:10.530> asked<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.950> be<00:00:11.130> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
little question that I got asked to be a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.490 
little question that I got asked to be a
very<00:00:11.340> brief<00:00:11.610> video<00:00:12.049> someone<00:00:13.049> asked<00:00:13.320> earlier

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
very brief video someone asked earlier

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.200 
very brief video someone asked earlier
was<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> deal<00:00:14.040> oh<00:00:14.190> but<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.429> mentioned<00:00:14.820> v<00:00:14.940> load

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
was a deal oh but I mentioned v load

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.380 
was a deal oh but I mentioned v load
yesterday<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.250> in<00:00:17.250> short<00:00:17.580> d<00:00:17.820> loading<00:00:18.210> is

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
yesterday and in short d loading is

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.730 
yesterday and in short d loading is
something<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.140> do<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.470> where<00:00:19.619> you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
something that you do to where you

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.980 
something that you do to where you
reduce<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.220> workload<00:00:20.600> reduce<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.810> weight

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
reduce the workload reduce the weight

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.179 
reduce the workload reduce the weight
reduce<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> intensity<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.070> you're

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
reduce the intensity of what you're

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.679 
reduce the intensity of what you're
doing<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.490> your<00:00:23.519> training<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.119> facilitate

programming it works in what we call

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
programming it works in what we call
dual<00:00:49.710> factor<00:00:50.129> recovery<00:00:50.670> which<00:00:51.329> means<00:00:51.570> where

dual factor recovery which means where

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
dual factor recovery which means where
you<00:00:51.870> take<00:00:52.050> periods<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> time<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.770> where<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.250> do

week<00:00:59.879> or<00:01:00.120> several<00:01:00.750> weeks<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> row<00:01:01.910> you<00:01:02.910> train

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
week or several weeks in a row you train

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.719 
week or several weeks in a row you train
more<00:01:03.899> frequently<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:04.830> more<00:01:05.070> workload<00:01:05.549> than

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
more frequently with more workload than

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.429 
more frequently with more workload than
your<00:01:05.850> body<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.150> actually<00:01:06.659> recover<00:01:06.990> from<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
your body can actually recover from it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.350 
your body can actually recover from it
so<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.619> never<00:01:07.830> actually<00:01:08.220> recover<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.180> all

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
so you never actually recover it all

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.690 
so you never actually recover it all
during<00:01:09.810> those<00:01:09.960> weeks<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.590> accordingly<00:01:11.549> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
during those weeks and accordingly you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.580 
during those weeks and accordingly you
reach<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.030> state<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:13.110> where<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.470> are

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
reach a state of where you are

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.550 
reach a state of where you are
overreaching<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.960> chronic<00:01:15.960> overreaching

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
overreaching and chronic overreaching

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
overreaching and chronic overreaching
can<00:01:16.680> eventually<00:01:16.920> lead<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.280> overtraining<00:01:17.939> but

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
can eventually lead to overtraining but

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
can eventually lead to overtraining but
if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> chronic<00:01:19.979> point<00:01:20.220> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
if you don't get to the chronic point it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
if you don't get to the chronic point it
doesn't<00:01:20.610> lead<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.119> overtraining<00:01:21.900> what<00:01:22.530> ends

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
doesn't lead to overtraining what ends

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.020 
doesn't lead to overtraining what ends
up<00:01:22.770> happening<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.460> start<00:01:23.640> pushing

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
up happening is that you start pushing

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
up happening is that you start pushing
your<00:01:24.150> body<00:01:24.270> beyond<00:01:24.780> its<00:01:24.960> ability<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.680> recover

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
your body beyond its ability to recover

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.310 
your body beyond its ability to recover
and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.030> if<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> back<00:01:27.450> off<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.840> d<00:01:27.960> load<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
and then if you back off and d load it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.600 
and then if you back off and d load it
in<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.439> case<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> lot<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.159> my<00:01:29.220> programs

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
in the case of like a lot of my programs

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.010 
in the case of like a lot of my programs
I<00:01:29.700> tell<00:01:29.850> people<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.479> cut<00:01:30.689> some<00:01:30.900> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
I tell people that you know cut some of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.960 
I tell people that you know cut some of
their<00:01:31.110> sets<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> cut<00:01:32.520> down<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.820> work

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
their sets out and cut down and work

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.249 
their sets out and cut down and work
with<00:01:33.119> fifty<00:01:33.390> percent<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.720> their<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.020> rep<00:01:34.229> max

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
with fifty percent of their one rep max

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
with fifty percent of their one rep max
so<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:35.189> you've<00:01:35.340> been<00:01:35.430> working<00:01:35.759> meeting<00:01:36.000> with

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
so if you've been working meeting with

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.819 
so if you've been working meeting with
eighty<00:01:36.329> percent<00:01:36.570> four<00:01:37.020> sets<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.350> five<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
eighty percent four sets of five you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.130 
eighty percent four sets of five you
will<00:01:37.920> cut<00:01:38.159> down<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.520> fifty<00:01:38.820> percent<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.990> if

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
will cut down to fifty percent so if

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.780 
will cut down to fifty percent so if
your<00:01:40.259> max<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.710> 200<00:01:41.130> pounds<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> might<00:01:41.640> drop

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
your max is 200 pounds you might drop

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.700 
your max is 200 pounds you might drop
down<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> 100<00:01:42.420> pounds<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.899> lift<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
down to 100 pounds on that lift and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.190 
down to 100 pounds on that lift and
maybe<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.220> eight<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.729> ten<00:01:44.909> reps<00:01:44.939> with<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.570> but

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
maybe do eight to ten reps with it but

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.859 
maybe do eight to ten reps with it but
it<00:01:46.470> nothing<00:01:46.920> anywhere<00:01:47.430> near<00:01:47.970> failure<00:01:48.420> fatigue

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
it nothing anywhere near failure fatigue

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.859 
it nothing anywhere near failure fatigue
so<00:01:49.409> you're<00:01:49.560> still<00:01:49.799> stimulating<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.570> neural

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
so you're still stimulating the neural

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.060 
so you're still stimulating the neural
pathways<00:01:52.320> from<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> lift<00:01:52.770> you're<00:01:52.890> still

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
pathways from the lift you're still

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.380 
pathways from the lift you're still
getting<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.369> muscle<00:01:53.640> protein<00:01:53.970> synthesis

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
getting the muscle protein synthesis

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.969 
getting the muscle protein synthesis
increase<00:01:54.840> which<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.229> important<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.890> you

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
increase which is important that you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.789 
increase which is important that you
keep<00:01:56.630> those<00:01:57.630> training<00:01:58.020> pathways<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.590> because

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
keep those training pathways up because

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.260 
keep those training pathways up because
they'll<00:01:58.920> let<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.189> adapt<00:01:59.490> faster<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.149> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
they'll let you adapt faster to that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.550 
they'll let you adapt faster to that
extra<00:02:00.570> work<00:02:00.719> because<00:02:00.780> all<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.170> work<00:02:01.380> that

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
extra work because all that work that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.020 
extra work because all that work that
you<00:02:01.680> did<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.100> are<00:02:02.219> not<00:02:02.369> recovering<00:02:02.880> from

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
you did that you are not recovering from

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.730 
you did that you are not recovering from
and<00:02:03.270> not<00:02:03.390> adapting<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.899> your<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:04.290> getting

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and not adapting to your not getting

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.490

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.639 
with you during the deal of the week
so<00:02:09.210> at<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.720> end<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.020> deal<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.350> week<00:02:10.530> if

so at the end of that deal of week if

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.020 
so at the end of that deal of week if
you<00:02:10.740> time<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.070> right<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.490> do<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.700> correctly

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
you time it right and do it correctly

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.860 
you time it right and do it correctly
you<00:02:12.390> fully<00:02:13.130> recover<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.910> adapt<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.690> all

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
you fully recover and you adapt to all

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.750 
you fully recover and you adapt to all
that<00:02:16.230> training<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.890> was<00:02:17.010> pushing<00:02:17.400> yourself

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
that training that was pushing yourself

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.430 
that training that was pushing yourself
beyond<00:02:18.060> which<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.450> get<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.690> recover<00:02:18.960> from<00:02:19.050> you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
beyond which you get to recover from you

beyond which you get to recover from you
weren't<00:02:19.650> making<00:02:20.070> gains<00:02:20.400> from<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.790> will

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
weren't making gains from and it will

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.520 
weren't making gains from and it will
let<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.120> make<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> lot<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.750> gains<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.260> week

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
let you make a lot of gains in that week

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.500 
let you make a lot of gains in that week
you'll<00:02:23.250> jump<00:02:23.550> back<00:02:23.730> into<00:02:23.940> making<00:02:24.300> progress

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
you'll jump back into making progress

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.780 
you'll jump back into making progress
again<00:02:24.930> after<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.920> how<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.670> a

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
again after that so how you get to a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.340 
again after that so how you get to a
point<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.060> where<00:02:27.120> again<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.480> overreach<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.320> a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
point to where again you overreach to a

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.720 
point to where again you overreach to a
point<00:02:28.620> where<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:29.040> no<00:02:29.130> longer<00:02:29.340> recover

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
point where you can no longer recover

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.280 
point where you can no longer recover
because<00:02:29.880> you're<00:02:30.090> training<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.720> hard<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.140> you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
because you're training so hard and you

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.350 
because you're training so hard and you
back<00:02:31.500> off<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:31.950> recover<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.580> grow<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.180> make<00:02:33.330> a

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
back off and recover and grow you make a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.300 
back off and recover and grow you make a
pretty<00:02:33.930> good<00:02:34.110> games<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.740> growth<00:02:35.040> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
pretty good games and growth and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.850 
pretty good games and growth and
strength<00:02:35.640> overall<00:02:36.060> from<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.410> Saudi<00:02:37.410> loads<00:02:37.650> are

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
strength overall from it Saudi loads are

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.360 
strength overall from it Saudi loads are
really<00:02:38.310> important<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.770> training<00:02:40.770> programming

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
really important in training programming

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.410 
really important in training programming
for<00:02:41.520> people<00:02:41.700> who<00:02:41.790> really<00:02:42.030> know<00:02:42.240> what<00:02:42.390> they're

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
for people who really know what they're

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.420 
for people who really know what they're
doing<00:02:42.840> not<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.380> for<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> injury<00:02:44.070> prevention

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
doing not just for the injury prevention

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.610 
doing not just for the injury prevention

and but also to help you make extra

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.100 
and but also to help you make extra
games<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.190> lets<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.630> overreach<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.870> then

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
games and it lets you overreach and then

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.900 
games and it lets you overreach and then
recover<00:02:49.530> from<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.010> adapt<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.670> over
