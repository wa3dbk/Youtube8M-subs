stand easy just gonna try a little
second-year<00:00:11.200> pool<00:00:11.500> to<00:00:11.680> see<00:00:11.860> what<00:00:11.980> happens

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:31.650 

there's

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.299 

so<00:00:32.200> that<00:00:32.430> was<00:00:33.430> expecting<00:00:33.850> a<00:00:33.910> loud<00:00:34.059> pop<00:00:34.390> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
so that was expecting a loud pop and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.119 
so that was expecting a loud pop and
nuclear<00:00:36.309> host<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:36.579> be<00:00:36.670> missing<00:00:37.090> but<00:00:38.129> didn't

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
nuclear host to be missing but didn't

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.280 
nuclear host to be missing but didn't
happen<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.510> I<00:00:40.690> thought<00:00:40.899> that<00:00:41.019> they<00:00:41.110> could<00:00:41.199> be

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
happen and I thought that they could be

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.470 
happen and I thought that they could be
around<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.590> camera<00:00:41.980> but<00:00:42.129> fluff<00:00:42.879> have<00:00:43.149> let<00:00:43.360> off

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
around the camera but fluff have let off

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
around the camera but fluff have let off
a<00:00:43.510> nice<00:00:43.840> little<00:00:44.110> or<00:00:44.829> Longwood<00:00:46.019> it's<00:00:47.019> a<00:00:47.110> company

a nice little or Longwood it's a company

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.280 
a nice little or Longwood it's a company
of<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:48.329> linear<00:00:49.329> power<00:00:49.510> that<00:00:49.780> was<00:00:49.870> coming<00:00:50.110> on

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:07.679 

I'm<00:00:52.650> gonna<00:00:52.770> give<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.950> another<00:00:53.220> try<00:00:53.340> soon

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.779 

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.490 

that<00:01:11.789> was<00:01:11.969> I<00:01:12.509> don't<00:01:13.020> know<00:01:13.079> if<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.259> be<00:01:13.380> seen

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that was I don't know if you can be seen

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.709 
that was I don't know if you can be seen
as<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:13.770> roots<00:01:14.159> gauge<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:15.329> about<00:01:15.539> 10

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
as these roots gauge but that about 10

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.810 
as these roots gauge but that about 10
psi<00:01:16.079> right<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.469> I'm<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:16.710> doing<00:01:17.640> full

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
psi right there I'm not doing full

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.279 
psi right there I'm not doing full
throttle<00:01:18.270> or<00:01:18.329> anything<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.750> most<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.200> say

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
throttle or anything at most I would say

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:25.730 
throttle or anything at most I would say
60%<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:21.140> I<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.469> already<00:01:22.619> say<00:01:24.740> dangerously

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
60% and I can already say dangerously

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.580 
60% and I can already say dangerously
close<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.909> felt<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:28.110> second<00:01:28.500> good

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
close to what I felt my second good

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
close to what I felt my second good
before<00:01:28.920> full<00:01:29.220> throttle

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
before full throttle

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.940 
before full throttle
could<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.620> little<00:01:32.100> exaggeration<00:01:33.650> that<00:01:34.650> was

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
could be a little exaggeration that was

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.560 
could be a little exaggeration that was
oh<00:01:35.450> sorry<00:01:36.450> I'm<00:01:36.540> just

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
oh sorry I'm just

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.310 
oh sorry I'm just
buzzer<00:01:38.200> one<00:01:38.380> more

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
buzzer one more

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:57.320 
buzzer one more
this<00:01:41.320> truck

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.630 

all<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:58.980> enough<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
all right I think that's enough for that

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.380 
all right I think that's enough for that
we<00:02:00.150> go<00:02:00.300> back<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.540> our<00:02:00.660> hands

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
we go back to our hands

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.450 
we go back to our hands
I'm<00:02:02.660> going<00:02:03.020> by<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.200> shop<00:02:03.620> which<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:04.010> back<00:02:04.190> there

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
I'm going by a shop which is back there

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.550 
I'm going by a shop which is back there
so

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.580 

yeah<00:02:08.130> well<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.350> for<00:02:10.500> now

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
yeah well we have it that's it for now

on<00:02:11.090> State<00:02:12.090> Street<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:13.140> really<00:02:13.350> don't<00:02:13.470> want<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
on State Street we really don't want to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.580 
on State Street we really don't want to
test<00:02:14.520> my<00:02:14.640> limits<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:15.030> my<00:02:15.150> motor<00:02:15.530> stucking<00:02:16.530> on

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
test my limits on my motor stucking on

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.550 
test my limits on my motor stucking on
the<00:02:16.650> air<00:02:16.800> with<00:02:17.010> stop<00:02:17.520> fueling<00:02:17.819> them<00:02:18.060> -<00:02:18.560> that's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
the air with stop fueling them - that's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.620 
the air with stop fueling them - that's
all<00:02:19.740> for<00:02:19.920> today<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.670> hopefully<00:02:21.360> I'll<00:02:21.569> have

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
all for today and hopefully I'll have

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.740 
all for today and hopefully I'll have
