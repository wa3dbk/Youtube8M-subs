00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.429
 Welcome to tactics number one 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.860
 Tactics will be a few small ones 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.730
 tactics no this pack 1 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.920
 now just a few tactics how to 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.270
 more or less cheap one and 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.070
 especially easy 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.150
 useful things get here for example 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:30.170
 an automatic I would say 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.149
 So electricity drive a current generator 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.530
 co2 runs free this is 15 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:44.370
 watermill from industrial power must 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:50.520
 be her and here a diploma of red 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:55.140
 power here retriever has been built 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.539
 through these solar cells down here with 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.829
 the klo matic with tubes from with power 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.470
 but I will not so long up there 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.850
 We want this machine action 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:16.530
 I hope so a bucket is here 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.210
 be pumped out here in the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.830
 network and the network is one 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.420
 intelligent network she is looking for me 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.420
 always a free spot and then will 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.670
 every machine doing enough home 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.240
 built at the same time you hear it already 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.240
 light 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.210
 and 4 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.570
 to 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.570
 so 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:56.060
 in this area is the teacher of one 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.060
 on splits the empty bucket out of the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.120
 Here is the full on the full one time 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:07.060
 a sea from the 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.060
 new house the partial setting 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:15.200
 a switch needs just current 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.380
 So you can see right here in the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.420
 turned on he makes 12 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.660
 below 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.959
 city â€‹â€‹parliament 26 eu project that is 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.959
 but nice 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.480
 if you set the on when I finally 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.480
 first found 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.550
 around the 3rd 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.370
 you have to wait a bit until the 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.740
 have charged batteries 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.610
 but after that 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.610
 it tastes good 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.090
 and 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.239
 let's see 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.239
 a lot of 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.209
 Report 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.910
 an electrician 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:16.440
 1 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:29.770
 that's how we say it is 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:33.490
 behind that the server load is known 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.490
 overclocker upgrade 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.720
 because for shop 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.050
 the 28 glued well 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.750
 Wow 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.670
 I believe that 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.590
 he creates 4 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.590
 one finally overclocking 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.150
 this one 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.750
 the recipes are 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.750
 reasonably cheap 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.410
 stop like this 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:24.370
 okay is alot of times but now we come 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.280
 to the recipes 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:32.740
 yes it works solar panel exists 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:36.880
 a blu ray will get you 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:44.330
 e-mails one silver and 4 nikoleit 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:47.120
 melts and then eight blood sacrifices for it 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.520
 you have to have a silicone wafer and 1 nicolai 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.650
 tim 11 fans burn the Zilliken raver 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.840
 16 of them make one of his 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.590
 silicon.de and had diamond 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.139
 First someone finally has to be ensor 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.870
 I hope someone knows everyone 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:15.490
 Silicone boule is simply coal eight 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:15.490
 Sand is not the cheapest but I am 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.390
 were also relatively easy generator 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:29.979
 place and sticks you can even get two of 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:34.669
 the diploma is also pretty easy 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:38.780
 piste redstone and 6 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.180
 there everyone can see how retrievers are 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.020
 we already a little more expensive 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:47.090
 The two ender pearls need a leather 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.030
 you also play two pressing 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:53.150
 anyway ml iphone it here with one 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.950
 child and three suitcases as well as bronze only 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.760
 So something else melted 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:02.510
 not offended and a duel of 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:06.669
 filter she follows a red dog wafer 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:10.970
 investor christian blum praises wafer 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:14.229
 nicolai to redstone burned gold 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.229
 piste stones 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:30.860
 and if the solarpanels I had blue 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:33.020
 l olivia is how to make three wool 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:40.460
 and I had three blu-rays 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:42.650
 right here with silicone sista is 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.180
 also quite simply three rizzello ingalls 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:49.840
 that 's still that's iron or kopper 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.840
 with matt stone 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:07:07.220
 That was exactly the time of our time 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:10.789
 Looks like in 50 everything actually exists 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.449
 only from cooked stone and bit 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.639
 wettstein 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:18.229
 this is for example insertion 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:27.460
 boiled stone or cooked stone 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:27.460
 will already have a stone heart from 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:37.159
 but then yes you have his own here 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:41.900
 infinite source of water and then you have 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:44.530
 I hope you can do it with your 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:47.659
 Friends impress that you are so 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.740
 climate-friendly since I got me to 

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:49.419
 example on the server the motto 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.690
 set 

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:56.509
 climate-friendly to stay and yes me 

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.400
 really need everything with this one 

00:07:56.509 --> 00:08:00.830
 and there something else I contribute to you 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.400
 tek tek tek tek tek number 2 show 

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.659
 will 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.659
 bye bye
