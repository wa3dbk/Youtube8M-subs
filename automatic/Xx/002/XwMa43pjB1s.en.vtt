move all the way around the north of
this<00:00:37.420> map<00:00:37.660> if<00:00:37.780> I<00:00:37.870> was<00:00:38.020> going<00:00:38.140> to<00:00:38.230> speed<00:00:38.440> it<00:00:38.470> up

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
this map if I was going to speed it up

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.830 
this map if I was going to speed it up
because<00:00:39.130> this<00:00:39.280> is<00:00:39.520> if<00:00:39.730> fairly<00:00:40.239> large<00:00:40.420> map<00:00:40.660> and

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
because this is if fairly large map and

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.240 
because this is if fairly large map and
takes<00:00:40.989> a<00:00:41.110> decent<00:00:41.380> amount<00:00:41.560> of<00:00:41.620> time<00:00:41.829> to<00:00:41.860> get

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
takes a decent amount of time to get

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.430 
takes a decent amount of time to get
into<00:00:42.520> any<00:00:42.880> kind<00:00:43.150> of<00:00:43.300> action<00:00:43.480> so<00:00:44.080> just<00:00:44.230> going<00:00:44.350> to

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
so just got a circle around this tiger P

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.449 
so just got a circle around this tiger P
now<00:03:46.230> there's<00:03:46.470> pretty<00:03:46.620> much<00:03:46.709> nothing<00:03:47.010> he<00:03:47.310> can

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
now there's pretty much nothing he can

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.550 
now there's pretty much nothing he can
do<00:03:47.610> as<00:03:47.819> he<00:03:47.880> gets<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.450> shot<00:03:48.690> on<00:03:48.870> one<00:03:49.140> of<00:03:49.260> them<00:03:49.410> the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
do as he gets a shot on one of them the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.250 
do as he gets a shot on one of them the
other<00:03:49.590> one<00:03:49.860> will<00:03:50.069> be<00:03:50.569> shooting<00:03:51.569> into<00:03:51.870> him<00:03:52.080> and

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
other one will be shooting into him and

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.770 
other one will be shooting into him and
if<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.069> decided<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.670> switch<00:03:53.970> targets<00:03:54.269> and

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
if you decided to switch targets and

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.670 
if you decided to switch targets and
they're<00:03:54.989> just<00:03:55.050> going<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.260> keep<00:03:55.440> running

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
they're just going to keep running

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.960 
they're just going to keep running
circles<00:03:56.190> around<00:03:56.280> them<00:03:56.550> there's<00:03:56.760> pretty<00:03:56.910> much

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
circles around them there's pretty much

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.910 
circles around them there's pretty much
nothing<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.569> can<00:03:57.750> do<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:57.900> he<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:58.709> doesn't

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
nothing you can do here he just doesn't

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.620 
nothing you can do here he just doesn't
have<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.160> turret<00:03:59.610> Traverse<00:03:59.910> all<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.360> speed

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
have the turret Traverse all the speed

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.540 
have the turret Traverse all the speed
so<00:04:01.230> we'd<00:04:01.350> be<00:04:01.470> able<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.739> do<00:04:01.860> anything<00:04:02.250> about

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
so we'd be able to do anything about

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.270 
so we'd be able to do anything about
both<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.239> these<00:04:03.540> t52<00:04:04.230> as<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.829> can<00:04:04.890> see<00:04:05.070> just

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
both of these t52 as you can see just

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.060 
both of these t52 as you can see just
easily<00:04:06.030> even<00:04:06.299> on<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.570> bank<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.230> hill<00:04:07.500> easily

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
easily even on a bank on a hill easily

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.970 
easily even on a bank on a hill easily
able<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.610> get<00:04:08.880> around<00:04:09.090> them<00:04:09.320> maneuver<00:04:10.320> faster

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
able to get around them maneuver faster

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.530 
able to get around them maneuver faster
than<00:04:11.100> this<00:04:11.190> turret<00:04:11.549> Traverse<00:04:11.880> could<00:04:12.120> go<00:04:12.299> and

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
than this turret Traverse could go and

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.229 
than this turret Traverse could go and
then<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.350> is<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.920> just<00:04:14.130> comes<00:04:14.370> in<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:14.820> mops

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
then the is to just comes in and mops

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.380 
then the is to just comes in and mops
him<00:04:15.570> up<00:04:16.100> so<00:04:17.100> there's<00:04:17.280> four<00:04:17.310> heavy<00:04:17.789> tanks<00:04:18.180> now

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
him up so there's four heavy tanks now

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.120 
him up so there's four heavy tanks now
left<00:04:18.690> for<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.229> enemy<00:04:19.560> in<00:04:19.650> fact<00:04:19.890> what<00:04:20.100> are

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
left for the enemy in fact what are

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.909 
left for the enemy in fact what are
those<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.150> giving<00:04:21.930> three<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.530> medium

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
those is is giving three and the medium

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.930 
those is is giving three and the medium
tank<00:04:23.160> of<00:04:23.310> VK<00:04:23.640> 3001<00:04:24.440> also<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.470> 360<00:04:26.280> one<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:26.760> was

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
tank of VK 3001 also a 360 one it was

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.520 
tank of VK 3001 also a 360 one it was
indeed<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.240> 360<00:04:27.900> 1<00:04:29.630> i'm<00:04:30.630> not<00:04:30.720> sure<00:04:31.020> where<00:04:31.289> they

indeed a 360 1 i'm not sure where they

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.260 
indeed a 360 1 i'm not sure where they
are<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:32.010> be<00:04:32.039> honest<00:04:32.370> there<00:04:32.550> are<00:04:32.700> probably

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
are to be honest there are probably
