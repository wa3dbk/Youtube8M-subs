00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
I saw this the first thing I thought of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.630

was<00:00:27.529> that<00:00:27.589> it<00:00:27.859> would<00:00:27.949> be<00:00:28.009> really<00:00:28.189> cute<00:00:28.429> for

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
Valentine's Day dinner and I thought

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.170 
Valentine's Day dinner and I thought
shrimp<00:00:31.339> would<00:00:31.429> look<00:00:31.550> good<00:00:31.669> on<00:00:31.730> top<00:00:31.999> because

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
shrimp would look good on top because

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.260 
shrimp would look good on top because
it's<00:00:32.390> kind<00:00:32.630> of<00:00:32.689> pink<00:00:33.050> or<00:00:33.230> red<00:00:33.320> or<00:00:33.470> whatever<00:00:33.829> and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
it's kind of pink or red or whatever and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.630 
it's kind of pink or red or whatever and
i<00:00:35.270> went<00:00:35.449> ahead<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:35.660> plated<00:00:36.020> some<00:00:36.170> up<00:00:36.640> two

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
i went ahead and plated some up two

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.069 
i went ahead and plated some up two
different<00:00:37.879> ways<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:38.390> let<00:00:38.570> me<00:00:38.660> show<00:00:38.840> them<00:00:39.020> to

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
blog for you it really turned out to

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.319 
blog for you it really turned out to
look<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.070> much<00:00:55.219> better<00:00:55.460> just<00:00:55.609> leaving<00:00:56.210> the

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
look so much better just leaving the

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.630

shrimp<00:00:56.600> in<00:00:56.780> its<00:00:56.989> natural<00:00:57.140> shape<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:57.949> trying

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
shrimp in its natural shape and trying

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.340 
shrimp in its natural shape and trying
to<00:00:58.699> pick<00:00:58.850> ones<00:00:59.089> that<00:00:59.329> fit<00:00:59.510> well<00:00:59.690> on<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.140> heart

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
to pick ones that fit well on the heart

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.560 
to pick ones that fit well on the heart
so<00:01:00.530> of<00:01:00.800> course<00:01:00.999> you<00:01:01.999> could<00:01:02.149> probably<00:01:02.300> serve

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
so of course you could probably serve

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.930 
so of course you could probably serve
three<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:02.989> these<00:01:03.220> for<00:01:04.220> dinner<00:01:04.430> or<00:01:04.760> something

three of these for dinner or something

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.490 
three of these for dinner or something
like<00:01:05.150> that<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:05.870> could<00:01:05.960> put<00:01:06.140> more<00:01:06.290> sauce

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
like that you could put more sauce

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.050 
like that you could put more sauce
around<00:01:06.800> them<00:01:07.159> on<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.400> plate<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:07.880> would<00:01:07.970> be

okay so you might want to let this sit
for<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.940> few<00:03:08.090> minutes<00:03:08.150> my<00:03:09.019> experience<00:03:09.290> has<00:03:09.680> been

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
for a few minutes my experience has been

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.680 
for a few minutes my experience has been
that<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.280> releases<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.239> holds<00:03:11.480> its<00:03:11.600> shape

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
that it releases and holds its shape

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.590 
that it releases and holds its shape
really<00:03:12.109> nicely<00:03:12.290> even<00:03:12.709> without<00:03:13.040> sitting<00:03:13.400> um

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
really nicely even without sitting um

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.319 
really nicely even without sitting um
and<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:16.010> think<00:03:16.250> two<00:03:16.430> of<00:03:16.639> your<00:03:16.760> rice<00:03:16.910> like<00:03:17.180> this

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
and I think two of your rice like this

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.819 
and I think two of your rice like this
rice<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.569> a<00:03:17.720> little<00:03:17.959> bit<00:03:18.049> cool<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:18.709> your

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
rice is a little bit cool so if your

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.020 
rice is a little bit cool so if your
