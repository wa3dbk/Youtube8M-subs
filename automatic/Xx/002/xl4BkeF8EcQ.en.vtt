00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.300
 the accused imam 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.900
 luisito loved the lesson on magnetism to see how the magnets 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.999
 they lifted pins and also by other magnets 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:22.179
 indeed the magnets are fantastically sticky but only 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.179
 metal things that turn into images 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.509
 he was so interested in the subject luisito 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.609
 that the library shakes a book about magnetism until it had a magnet 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.080
 drawn in the trap 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.520
 but it was not so much fun this one did not hit anything 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.140
 that it was a real magnet 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.350
 he exclaimed 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.480
 One day he kept one of the ones he had in class in his pocket when nobody 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.570
 I looked 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.440
 I was kind of scared but nobody shouted 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.440
 luege this time the one of the magnet srta 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.250
 he whistled to the gate, the Chancellor touching 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.870
 it was easy to steal 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.200
 maybe he was serious and he made a living 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.019
 when lying on the lawn of the park he did it next to a nail 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.010
 he sat on it but it did not hurt him because they were under his pocket 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.860
 where was the magnet 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.259
 when he got up 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.130
 the nail was still attached to the magnet 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.360
 through the fabric of the pants 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.450
 and even if I had seen it, I could not have taken it off so hard that 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.420
 I was 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.220
 what followed was a pipe tobacco can 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.890
 the tin jumped out of a park wastebasket and hung on the nail 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.860
 to luisito he was very embarrassed people could think that he smoked 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.460
 titov and struggled operated the can was invented and did not take off 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.920
 also the wastepaper basket was detached from its cement base that have been given 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.900
 tumbles 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.799
 luisito 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.799
 tried to run but the trash was faster 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.670
 It stuck to the tobacco can that was stuck to the nail that had stuck to the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.880
 magnet 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.860
 luisito raised the collar of his jacket so no one would recognize him 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.840
 but when passing by the milkman's van 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.490
 this turned around and 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.889
 cabada inc stuck to the trash 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.409
 the milkman who had fallen out of the van started screaming 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.479
 luisito got scared 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.670
 and ran 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.129
 but it was not easy with the nail 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.739
 can the trash can 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.519
 in the van stuck to him 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.429
 but it turned out 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:32.259
 when the bus number 14 stuck I also have crowded 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.190
 luisito 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.959
 He left the city to see if he took them off 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.399
 but he only managed to attract the 5:30 train that passed was that the moment 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:47.339
 he left the rails cg with bus number 14 the van 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:48.569
 the trash can 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.249
 the cat and the nail 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:52.749
 at that moment 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:56.759
 a Russian spacecraft fell to earth apparently attracted 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.369
 powerful magnetic force 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:05.679
 luisito crawled painfully with the jacket over his head so he would not 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.729
 they saw 10 it was not easy to advance the nail 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:17.419
 the sagra high the ballot the van the bus number 14 the train of the 5 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.229
 30 inspire 20 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.629
 the spaceship with the sickle and the hammer painted in red 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.389
 they would be after him 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.479
 so 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.479
 just when he arrived at the door of his house 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.789
 His trouser pocket was torn 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:34.219
 the pocket magnet 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:35.540

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.319
 a lot of organized metal 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.180
 but there in the middle of the street 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.229
 and later on 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.769
 the city council had to send some cranes to remove it 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.230
 luisito's mom punished him for breaking his pants his success 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:09.229
 decided that he would not earn Roman life 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:19.099
