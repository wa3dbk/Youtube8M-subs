00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
thing there but I thinking actually do

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.100 
thing there but I thinking actually do
those<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.640> well<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.240> overall<00:01:27.600> feel<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.869> them

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
those as well but overall feel of them

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.210

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
though and I'm a bass lover but there

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.530

it's not as thumping as your
boom-boom-boom<00:02:14.939> like<00:02:15.090> you're<00:02:15.269> probably

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
boom-boom-boom like you're probably

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.059 
boom-boom-boom like you're probably
finding<00:02:15.689> another<00:02:15.959> type<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.230> headsets<00:02:17.010> like

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
finding another type of headsets like

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.979 
finding another type of headsets like
triton<00:02:17.519> hisses<00:02:17.819> as<00:02:17.970> well<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.750> sound

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
triton hisses as well but the sound

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.110 
triton hisses as well but the sound
sounds<00:02:19.319> really<00:02:19.590> awesome<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:20.879> really

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
sounds really awesome and it just really

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.839 
sounds really awesome and it just really
puts<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.200> environment<00:02:22.769> in<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.670> game

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
puts you in the environment in the game

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.190 
puts you in the environment in the game
in<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.060> vine<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.450> really<00:02:24.720> it's<00:02:24.870> just<00:02:24.900> true

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
in the vine and really it's just true

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.720 
in the vine and really it's just true
immersive<00:02:25.680> feeling<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.220> actually<00:02:26.430> get

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
immersive feeling that you actually get

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.149 
immersive feeling that you actually get
with<00:02:26.909> these<00:02:27.060> headsets<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:28.680> pick<00:02:28.860> up<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
with these headsets you can pick up the

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.309 
with these headsets you can pick up the
well<00:02:29.970> first<00:02:30.150> before<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.900> pricing<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
well first before I go to pricing and

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.930 
well first before I go to pricing and
everything<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.519> quick<00:02:32.790> little

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
everything so this is a quick little

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.819 
everything so this is a quick little
comparison<00:02:33.390> between<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.959> Twite<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.440> Tritton

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
comparison between the Twite the Tritton

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.789 
comparison between the Twite the Tritton
ax<00:02:35.640> pros<00:02:36.599> between<00:02:36.959> these<00:02:37.110> particular<00:02:37.470> types

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
ax pros between these particular types

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.890 
ax pros between these particular types
of<00:02:37.920> headsets<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.609> Astros<00:02:39.329> now<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
of headsets you have the Astros now the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.390 
of headsets you have the Astros now the
triteness<00:02:40.409> are<00:02:40.680> definitely<00:02:41.069> as<00:02:41.129> far<00:02:41.310> as

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
triteness are definitely as far as

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.800 
triteness are definitely as far as
design<00:02:41.549> are<00:02:41.909> definitely<00:02:42.239> heavier<00:02:42.569> and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
design are definitely heavier and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.839 
design are definitely heavier and
bulkier<00:02:43.230> than<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.620> Astros

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
bulkier than the Astros

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.069 
bulkier than the Astros
I<00:02:44.909> thought<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.420> trade-ins<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.870> first

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
I thought the trade-ins for the first

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.750 
I thought the trade-ins for the first
using<00:02:46.379> there<00:02:46.500> weren't<00:02:46.680> too<00:02:46.799> bad<00:02:46.950> at<00:02:47.129> all<00:02:47.340> but

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
using there weren't too bad at all but

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.190 
using there weren't too bad at all but
once<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.030> put<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.269> Astros<00:02:48.629> on<00:02:48.870> you

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
once you put the Astros on you

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
once you put the Astros on you
definitely<00:02:49.590> try<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:49.950> feel<00:02:50.190> very

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
definitely try it and just feel very

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.339 
definitely try it and just feel very
clunky<00:02:50.849> on<00:02:51.180> your<00:02:51.329> head<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.780> feel<00:02:52.319> like

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
clunky on your head and you feel like

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.539 
clunky on your head and you feel like
there's<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.680> lot<00:02:52.799> heavier<00:02:53.190> than<00:02:53.280> what<00:02:53.430> they

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
there's a lot heavier than what they

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.970 
there's a lot heavier than what they
actually<00:02:53.700> need<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.060> be<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:55.230> design<00:02:55.530> wise<00:02:55.769> I'll

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
actually need to be so design wise I'll

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.559 
actually need to be so design wise I'll
get<00:02:56.129> that<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.459> Astros<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.120> also<00:02:57.359> my

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
get that to the Astros and also my

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.180 
get that to the Astros and also my
microphone<00:02:58.109> in<00:02:58.230> my<00:02:58.260> Trident<00:02:58.829> headsets

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
microphone in my Trident headsets

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.789 
microphone in my Trident headsets
actually<00:02:59.489> broke<00:02:59.700> off<00:02:59.849> I<00:03:00.750> can<00:03:01.200> still<00:03:01.379> put<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.680> in

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
actually broke off I can still put it in

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.920 
actually broke off I can still put it in
there<00:03:02.010> but<00:03:02.579> it's<00:03:02.700> not<00:03:02.760> secure<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.659> doesn't

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
there but it's not secure it doesn't

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.379 
there but it's not secure it doesn't
it's<00:03:04.019> not<00:03:04.139> as<00:03:04.290> tight<00:03:04.609> and<00:03:05.609> hopefully<00:03:06.180> that's

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
it's not as tight and hopefully that's

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.899 
it's not as tight and hopefully that's
not<00:03:06.540> what<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.810> said<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.530> um<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.579> still<00:03:08.730> put

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
not what you said but um I can still put

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.490 
not what you said but um I can still put
it<00:03:09.030> put<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.329> in<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.480> headset<00:03:09.930> jack<00:03:10.170> but<00:03:10.349> it's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
it put it in the headset jack but it's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.319 
it put it in the headset jack but it's
just<00:03:10.620> not<00:03:10.889> a<00:03:10.920> title<00:03:11.190> anyway<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.760> broke<00:03:12.000> off<00:03:12.180> and

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
just not a title anyway it broke off and

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.819 
just not a title anyway it broke off and
I'm<00:03:12.420> not<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.569> wasn't<00:03:12.810> too<00:03:12.989> rough<00:03:13.019> on<00:03:13.409> it<00:03:13.530> at<00:03:13.680> all

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
I'm not I wasn't too rough on it at all

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.039 
I'm not I wasn't too rough on it at all
it<00:03:14.280> also<00:03:14.519> take<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> little<00:03:15.299> look<00:03:15.840> at<00:03:15.930> these

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
it also take a little look at these

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.509 
it also take a little look at these
side-by-side<00:03:16.680> comparisons<00:03:17.250> between<00:03:17.310> the

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
side-by-side comparisons between the

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.059 
side-by-side comparisons between the
setup<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.090> these<00:03:18.209> things<00:03:18.449> as<00:03:18.599> well<00:03:19.040> both<00:03:20.040> of

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
setup of these things as well both of

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.270 
setup of these things as well both of
these<00:03:20.280> devices<00:03:20.849> need<00:03:21.410> need<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> mix<00:03:22.829> ample<00:03:23.160> what

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
these devices need need a mix ample what

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.039 
these devices need need a mix ample what
you'll<00:03:23.430> call<00:03:23.669> it<00:03:23.849> and<00:03:24.000> basically<00:03:24.810> what<00:03:24.959> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
you'll call it and basically what the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.809 
you'll call it and basically what the
mix<00:03:25.230> amp<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.889> basically<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.489> get<00:03:26.669> that

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
mix amp is is basically to get that

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.030 
mix amp is is basically to get that
signal<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.449> surround<00:03:27.780> sound<00:03:28.019> signal<00:03:28.470> I'm

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
signal that surround sound signal I'm

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.559 
signal that surround sound signal I'm
not<00:03:29.190> too<00:03:29.489> technical<00:03:29.669> in<00:03:29.970> there<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.209> get<00:03:30.449> it

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
not too technical in there but get it

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.909 
not too technical in there but get it
from<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.810> Xbox<00:03:31.019> through<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.440> hair<00:03:31.620> says<00:03:31.829> to

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
from the Xbox through the hair says to

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.680 
from the Xbox through the hair says to
be<00:03:32.040> able<00:03:32.129> to<00:03:32.250> translate<00:03:32.519> oh<00:03:32.669> yeah<00:03:32.849> maybe<00:03:33.480> when

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
be able to translate oh yeah maybe when

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.119 
be able to translate oh yeah maybe when
they<00:03:33.780> both<00:03:33.959> need<00:03:34.169> that<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:34.590> plus<00:03:34.859> they<00:03:34.980> have<00:03:35.069> a

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
they both need that and plus they have a

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.189 
they both need that and plus they have a
plethora<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:36.060> course<00:03:36.480> coming<00:03:36.750> from<00:03:36.900> each<00:03:37.079> of

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
plethora of course coming from each of

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.229 
plethora of course coming from each of
the<00:03:37.290> devices<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:37.949> can<00:03:38.340> see<00:03:38.459> here<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:38.760> Astros

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
the devices you can see here the Astros

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.479 
the devices you can see here the Astros
the<00:03:39.510> setup<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.079> a<00:03:40.199> lot<00:03:40.379> more<00:03:40.530> cleaner<00:03:40.889> it's<00:03:41.400> a

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the setup is a lot more cleaner it's a

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.250 
the setup is a lot more cleaner it's a
little<00:03:41.699> bit<00:03:41.819> less<00:03:41.970> cables<00:03:42.540> then<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
little bit less cables then the the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.599 
little bit less cables then the the
Triton<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.739> just<00:03:43.859> riding<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.220> there's<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.430> lot

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
Triton is just riding this there's a lot

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.490 
Triton is just riding this there's a lot
of<00:03:44.760> mess<00:03:44.970> going<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.389> there<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.959> think<00:03:46.290> some

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
of mess going on there I think some

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.809 
of mess going on there I think some
people<00:03:46.590> actually<00:03:46.829> said<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.190> MLG<00:03:47.579> gaming

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
people actually said the MLG gaming

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.729 
people actually said the MLG gaming
League<00:03:48.060> actually<00:03:48.389> banned<00:03:48.599> trains<00:03:48.900> because<00:03:49.169> I

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
League actually banned trains because I

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.740 
League actually banned trains because I
think<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.340> they<00:03:50.459> had<00:03:50.760> too<00:03:50.970> many<00:03:51.090> cables<00:03:51.629> too

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
think that they had too many cables too

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.629 
think that they had too many cables too
many<00:03:51.900> own<00:03:52.139> complexity<00:03:52.769> to<00:03:52.919> just<00:03:53.129> putting<00:03:53.549> on

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
many own complexity to just putting on

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.610 
many own complexity to just putting on
some<00:03:53.669> hiss<00:03:53.940> as<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.269> gaming<00:03:54.629> but<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:55.379> is<00:03:55.500> try

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
some hiss as in gaming but this is try

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.780 
some hiss as in gaming but this is try
style<00:03:55.889> I<00:03:55.949> think<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.220> little<00:03:56.459> bit<00:03:56.549> too<00:03:56.669> much

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
style I think a little bit too much

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.069 
style I think a little bit too much
cables<00:03:57.269> for<00:03:57.419> it<00:03:57.540> but<00:03:57.659> the<00:03:57.750> one<00:03:57.870> thing<00:03:57.989> the

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
cables for it but the one thing the

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.930 
cables for it but the one thing the
trains<00:03:58.319> do<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.739> those<00:03:58.949> as<00:03:59.220> an<00:03:59.370> advantage<00:03:59.639> is

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
trains do have those as an advantage is

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.089 
trains do have those as an advantage is
that<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.480> controls<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.319> inline<00:04:01.650> controls

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
that the controls the inline controls

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.069 
that the controls the inline controls
for<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.909> know<00:04:03.060> controlling<00:04:03.659> the<00:04:03.750> volume

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
for you know controlling the volume

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.839 
for you know controlling the volume
rocker<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.560> bass<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:04.919> all<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.220> stuff<00:04:05.400> it's

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
rocker the bass and all that stuff it's

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.309 
rocker the bass and all that stuff it's
closer<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.389> you<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:06.959> don't<00:04:07.079> have<00:04:07.230> to

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
closer to you so you don't have to

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.159 
closer to you so you don't have to
actually<00:04:07.470> in<00:04:07.949> the<00:04:08.639> case<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> Astros<00:04:09.569> the

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
actually in the case of the Astros the

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.020 
actually in the case of the Astros the
actual<00:04:10.590> box<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:11.040> control<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.699> some<00:04:11.879> right<00:04:12.000> on

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030
