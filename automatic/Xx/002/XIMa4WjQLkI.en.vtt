00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
trim off the edge and that's actually

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.780 
trim off the edge and that's actually
nice<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.170> tight<00:02:15.680> up<00:02:15.860> against<00:02:16.280> there<00:02:16.460> if<00:02:16.670> you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
nice and tight up against there if you

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.330 
nice and tight up against there if you
do<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.570> wire<00:02:18.140> which<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.470> poking<00:02:19.010> out<00:02:19.160> and

do have a wire which is poking out and
it<00:02:19.430> looks<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:19.850> going<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.120> actually

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
it looks like it's going to actually

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.270 
it looks like it's going to actually
hurt<00:02:20.780> your<00:02:21.020> finger<00:02:21.320> go<00:02:21.770> ahead<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.070> take<00:02:22.190> your

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
chain nose and just push it in a little

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.600 
chain nose and just push it in a little
bit<00:02:24.350> but<00:02:24.560> that's<00:02:24.740> up<00:02:24.950> there<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.280> that's<00:02:25.430> nice

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.680 
and tight and then it will spin and that
