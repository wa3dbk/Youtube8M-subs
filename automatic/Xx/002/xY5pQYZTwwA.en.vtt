 well let's get started 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.910
 The first thing we should do is extract all the folders from the first boot 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.910
 in the folder from intel to psp 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.970
 then copy and paste the saw in the next race 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.210
 Question 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.570
 prob 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.810
 tertsch ready the emulator is already installed in society now the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 games get into the next folder 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
 remember that the games must be in the following formats 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.300
