may find it useful I'm going over how to

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.879 
may find it useful I'm going over how to
stack<00:00:08.670> objects<00:00:09.240> or<00:00:09.510> props<00:00:09.990> on<00:00:10.290> top<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.830> each

interesting<00:00:16.560> structures<00:00:17.720> right<00:00:18.720> now<00:00:18.900> I'm

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
interesting structures right now I'm

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.689 
interesting structures right now I'm
going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> make<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> large<00:00:19.740> ramp<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.220> jump<00:00:20.520> onto

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
going to make a large ramp to jump onto

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.640 
going to make a large ramp to jump onto
an<00:00:20.910> elevated<00:00:21.330> position<00:00:23.570> start<00:00:24.570> by<00:00:24.750> placing<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
an elevated position start by placing a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.350 
an elevated position start by placing a
large<00:00:26.310> ramp<00:00:31.669> behind<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.969> we're<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.239> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
large ramp behind it we're going to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.090 
large ramp behind it we're going to
place<00:00:33.690> one<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.170> more<00:00:34.260> objects<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> same

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
place one or more objects of the same

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
place one or more objects of the same
height<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.300> case<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.780> are<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.200> use

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
height in this case we are going to use

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.500 
height in this case we are going to use
the<00:00:37.590> float<00:00:37.950> pile<00:00:38.190> found<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> crates<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the float pile found in the crates and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.750 
the float pile found in the crates and
boxes<00:00:39.660> category<00:00:40.320> since<00:00:41.040> they're<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> perfect

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
boxes category since they're the perfect

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.290 
boxes category since they're the perfect
height<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.360> flat<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.840> top<00:00:43.760> place<00:00:44.760> six<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.149> them

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
height and flat on top place six of them

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.080 
height and flat on top place six of them
so<00:00:45.570> there<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.840> enough<00:00:46.079> space<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> ramp<00:00:53.090> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so there is enough space for a ramp the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.540 
so there is enough space for a ramp the
key<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> next<00:00:54.899> step<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.829> not<00:00:56.190> attempt

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
key to the next step is to not attempt

transparent you cannot place it you may
have<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.900> some<00:01:24.930> reshuffling<00:01:25.470> or<00:01:26.009> use

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
have to do some reshuffling or use

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.260 
have to do some reshuffling or use
different<00:01:26.850> props<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:29.310> final<00:01:29.759> part<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.090> my

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
different props the final part of my

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.179 
different props the final part of my
ramp<00:01:30.600> uses<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> same<00:01:31.500> technique<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
ramp uses the same technique as the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.429 
ramp uses the same technique as the
previous<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.820> only<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.600> time<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:34.140> need<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
previous one only this time I need to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
previous one only this time I need to
create<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.829> second<00:01:35.430> stack<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.729> float<00:01:35.939> piles<00:01:36.240> on

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
create a second stack of float piles on

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.590 
create a second stack of float piles on
top<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.750> first

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.210 

once<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.780> done<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.140> create<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.620> ramp<00:01:46.890> nearby

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
once it's done I create the ramp nearby

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:58.820 
once it's done I create the ramp nearby
edit<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.000> place

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830
