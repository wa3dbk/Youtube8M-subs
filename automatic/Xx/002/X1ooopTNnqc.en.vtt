let's<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.769> go<00:02:19.950> ahead<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.190> dive<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.519> here<00:02:20.700> so

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
let's just go ahead and dive in here so

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.940 
let's just go ahead and dive in here so

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
a search engine for offers so let's do a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.130 
a search engine for offers so let's do a
search<00:02:25.409> for<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:26.700> very<00:02:27.390> popular<00:02:27.900> niche

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.400 
search for a very popular niche
weight-loss<00:02:29.129> niche<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:30.019> let's<00:02:31.019> look<00:02:31.140> at<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
weight-loss niche and let's look at the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.890
