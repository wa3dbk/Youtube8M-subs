three<00:01:09.910> rcmp<00:01:10.910> would<00:01:13.420> start<00:01:14.420> off<00:01:14.539> with

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
three rcmp would start off with

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.160 
three rcmp would start off with
whichever<00:01:15.410> take<00:01:15.710> more<00:01:19.000> so<00:01:20.000> every<00:01:20.660> deck<00:01:20.960> comes

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
whichever take more so every deck comes

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.790 
whichever take more so every deck comes
with<00:01:21.350> things

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
with things

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.270 
with things
RCA<00:01:22.700> cables<00:01:23.179> and<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.600> ground<00:01:23.810> chemo<00:01:24.280> you

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
RCA cables and the ground chemo you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.639 
RCA cables and the ground chemo you
connect<00:01:27.940> connect<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.060> Weibull<00:01:29.450> first<00:01:29.720> into

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
connect connect the Weibull first into

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.350 
connect connect the Weibull first into
analog<00:01:31.250> in<00:01:31.429> one<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:34.520> then<00:01:34.610> you<00:01:34.700> will<00:01:34.819> find<00:01:35.090> one

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
analog in one and then you will find one

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.890 
analog in one and then you will find one
of<00:01:35.390> your<00:01:35.509> mixer<00:01:35.869> connect<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.950> ground

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
of your mixer connect the ground

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.820 
of your mixer connect the ground
I'm<00:01:38.990> just<00:01:39.500> around<00:01:39.770> channel<00:01:40.730> one<00:01:41.650> get<00:01:42.650> the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
I'm just around channel one get the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.460 
I'm just around channel one get the
other<00:01:42.980> side<00:01:45.040> same<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:47.060> I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:06.950 

they're<00:01:50.470> getting<00:01:50.650> four<00:02:00.480> separate<00:02:01.480> cable<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
they're getting four separate cable to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.930 
they're getting four separate cable to
goes<00:02:07.960> in<00:02:08.110> first

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.440 

goes<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.120> first<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.970> your<00:02:16.090> mixer<00:02:16.240> you're

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
goes in first and on your mixer you're

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.120 
goes in first and on your mixer you're
gonna<00:02:16.540> connect<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.900> two<00:02:17.310> channel<00:02:19.260> one<00:02:20.260> bangle

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
gonna connect the two channel one bangle

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.560 
gonna connect the two channel one bangle
so<00:02:24.130> it's<00:02:24.310> basically<00:02:24.730> corresponding<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
so it's basically corresponding to the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.410 
so it's basically corresponding to the
first<00:02:25.810> one<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.680> I'll<00:02:27.100> get<00:02:27.250> one<00:02:27.489> this<00:02:27.640> make

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
first one and I'll get one this make

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:39.600 
first one and I'll get one this make
sure<00:02:28.600> this<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:29.730> party

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:55.200 

three<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.730> four

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:09.869 

fixin<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:56.480> go<00:02:57.080> on<00:02:57.200> line<00:02:57.440> one<00:02:57.770> okay

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.800 

so<00:03:10.879> I<00:03:10.909> should<00:03:11.090> be<00:03:11.120> that's<00:03:11.480> everything

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
so I should be that's everything

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.819 
so I should be that's everything
connected<00:03:12.700> from<00:03:13.700> there<00:03:13.959> I'm<00:03:14.959> gonna<00:03:15.230> get<00:03:15.709> the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
connected from there I'm gonna get the

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.170 
connected from there I'm gonna get the
