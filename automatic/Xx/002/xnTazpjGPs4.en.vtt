00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.340
 from this month who will take the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.340
 driver's license will have to pass 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.039
 also by simulator lessons relaying 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.730
 new legislation will leave the CNH 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.890
 less 200 reais more expensive but in Manaus 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.710
 students will also have to wait for a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.539
 little more to get the document 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.449
 because no auto school in the capital 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.910
 still complied with the requirement 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.640
 of the counter 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.910
 at the age of 18, Julia prepares to take 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.059
 the driver 's license the course on 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.219
 legislation is the first step but it has already 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.219
 know that now complete this process 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.020
 will be more time consuming because of the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.020
 new requirement 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.530
 look I have nothing against now a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.469
 simulator in science the issue here 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.449
 Manaus does not have and simulators and will 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.379
 take four months to get here in 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.110
 manaus 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.600
 that is, it will delay the entire process 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.000
 It's already taking four months, so I 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.990
 I 'm not in favor without it I'm not 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.530
 very happy 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.299
 I'm not much in favor because you can 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.670
 fully delay 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.930
 not just me as my late brother 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.900
 he already has 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.170
 already the example he's been there for four 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.210
 months already, and who are already waiting 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.119
 has approved the new 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 legislation would be very good for the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:38.299
 people were better able to drive and 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.700
 Who is the person who directs you? 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.939
 would be safer at the time of transit 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.340
 manaus the stimulator and should only 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.340
 arrive in Manaus in March this because 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.940
 only three plants in Brazil 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.190
 provides the equipment 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.730
 suppliers ask for approximately three 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.560
 months to manufacture the 36 auto 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.390
 Manaus schools are already adapting 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.610
 to the new requirement 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.610
 but according to the union of the class 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.830
 they have problems 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.020
 she had a logistics problem 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.210
 manufacturers are located in the south of the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.280
 fans or is a manufacturer 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.750
 manufacturer in mines general and another in 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.330
 rio grande do sul santa maria 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.510
 this one imagines the equipment north of the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.800
 country has to give maintenance has to see 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.480
 the internet issue 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.600
 so we have a logistics problem 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.210
 every school will need a 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.300
 15- meter structure to mount the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.300
 simulator that costs on average 45 thousand 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.700
 will be compulsory and five lessons 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.010
 the idea is to end the lack of practice 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.680
 of the students and make them pass 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.620
 adverse situations such as 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.750
 driving in the rain and fog the new 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.300
 legislation has been in force since the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.190
 first day of January tonight to 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.040
 of the detran and the owners of the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.200
 must meet to arrive 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.300
 an agreement that does not harm the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.250
 candidates schedule 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.170
 even if students who enter 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.380
 in the process of qualification 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.320
 They will need to wait, we can give 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.850
 continuity with 76 nodes first in 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.600
 first and second stages the third 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.450
 step will depend on each cfc bring 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.459
 the simulator 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.430
 however we have to be consistent 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.350
 for that really requirement aa 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.500
 detran inspection to see if they are 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.000
 doing if they were adapted implemented 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.170
 the requirements of the counter 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.850
 we have to give a deadline really 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.590
 for existing services can not 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.519
 get away from it is because of this logistics 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.709
 all 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.569
 the candidate can only take classes 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.790
 steering practices right 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.420
 after completing the workload of the 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.420
 simulator
