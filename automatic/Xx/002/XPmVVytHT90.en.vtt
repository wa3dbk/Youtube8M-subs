has it I don't know if his focus is
still<00:03:53.500> within<00:03:53.950> hip-hop<00:03:54.220> what<00:03:54.579> I<00:03:54.609> hope<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.120> is

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
still within hip-hop what I hope it is

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.030 
still within hip-hop what I hope it is
that<00:03:55.450> he<00:03:55.540> could<00:03:55.690> provide<00:03:56.049> us<00:03:56.260> with<00:03:56.739> at<00:03:56.889> least
