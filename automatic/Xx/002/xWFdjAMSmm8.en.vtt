00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 welcome 15 where we are at shell 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.660
 the well-known german keyboard market the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.950
 originally came from america now 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.349
 Here is a new mechanical keyboard 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.630
 presented with reality technology that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.549
 you see here are on it and, of course, 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.340
 in a mechanical keyboard that means 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.510
 clacking handsome man is now sitting up 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.560
 every case instead of it 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.029
 Write because we have five instead 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.869
 milliseconds now one second 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.189
 reaction time so we can still 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.599
 faster tap even more tip if we 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.580
 so we want and we make a good one 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.289
 quality of the installed 50 million 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 Keystrokes are guaranteed as well 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.750
 over 100 million should definitely be 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.160
 be possible we have here again 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.530
 Of course, a cup will be settled 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.780
 and here you see the switch 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.040
 of course, very much 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.450
 professional of jerry we have 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.440
 of which already five billion worldwide 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.789
 sold so far 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.129
 and now they still have it 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.660
 made faster here with the reality 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.800
 technology we see and there is 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.899
 a few can change colors like that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.730
 the windows key, the key to sport 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.199
 umlaut key and for example the caps 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.640
 lock button you can also do that here 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.260
 you get them by appropriate color 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.629
 let change and the small step 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.649
 scans any gaming taste, so to speak because 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.809
 if we press that is for example 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.010
 windows have switched off what, of course 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.580
 Practically , you are not 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.630
 looked 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.920
 for example, then we come on it 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.439
 the child sing a few more multimedia 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.900
 keys that we are still in use 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.950
 can and otherwise i believe it here 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.420
 a very long time looks a bit 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.759
 bit too bright but look at us 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.380
 keyboard just a little closer 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.060
 or see there are a few more 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.970
 keys is also for brightness 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.220
 rules maximum or minimum 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.920
 we can do all this out here 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.210
 if we can know everything by 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.450
 I with which button we combine 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.450
 have to 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.550
 So we can do it all a bit 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.350
 further down if otherwise 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.830
 but the whole thing comes in too bright 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.080
 autumn then out in the spring for 220 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.340
 euro then with stone but you look 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.070
 we can see a bit of neighbors 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.570
 The metal is too thick 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.720
 built so really high quality 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.280
 here from cherry and found for us 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.360
 can see the whole look 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.950
 of course a bit plastic as well 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.540
 that is also an engineering sample though 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.369
 here as you can see if the usb 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.619
 Camera should go broke that's even 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.690
 also interchangeable of course one more 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.979
 Fold up a bit in the packaging 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.750
 It's also in here that we're like that 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.070
 have a small rubber stock itself 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.989
 so that you can write even more convenient 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.670
 so we accordingly on a 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.800
 right height then what can be but 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.510
 It is also very easy to get out of here 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.660
 Actually, that only holds itself magnetically 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.820
 whole here in place the whole as I said 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 available from spring this year for 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.540
 22 euros 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.430
 In the case of packaging that's almost it 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.340
 whole search should be 189 sorry 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.700
 but it was 20 dollars and yes that 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.860
 here was the mx keyboard number 6 of 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.989
 cherry until the next hurried to the 15th 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.560
 my name is pascal unforgettable and 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.560
 sony
