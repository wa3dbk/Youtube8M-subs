00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
to work with and volume I usually spray

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.359 
to work with and volume I usually spray
it<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> little<00:01:16.290> bit<00:01:16.470> throughout<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:16.950> hair<00:01:17.130> or

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
it a little bit throughout my hair or

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
it a little bit throughout my hair or
comb<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.000> through<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> ends<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:22.560> I'm

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
comb it through to the ends and now I'm

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.499 
comb it through to the ends and now I'm
going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> tease<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.850> use<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> brush

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
going to tease it so I use a brush

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.719 
going to tease it so I use a brush
instead<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> comb<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.490> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
instead of a comb for this because it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.319 
instead of a comb for this because it
just<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.210> kind<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.600> gives<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.900> softer<00:01:28.530> um

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
just it kind of gives you a softer um

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.539 
just it kind of gives you a softer um
look<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.570> also<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.890> concentrated

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
look and also it's not as concentrated

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.319 
look and also it's not as concentrated
so<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.979> easier<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.610> general<00:01:36.000> it's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
so it's just easier in general it's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.929 
so it's just easier in general it's
easier<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> take<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.650> once<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.579> take<00:01:38.820> your

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
easier to take it out once you take your

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.999 
easier to take it out once you take your
hair<00:01:39.090> down<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.259> naughty<00:01:40.530> as<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.890> is

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
hair down it's not as naughty as it is

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.600 
hair down it's not as naughty as it is
just<00:01:41.280> kind<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.700> messy<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> take<00:01:44.159> your<00:01:44.280> hair<00:01:44.490> at

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
just kind of messy so take your hair at

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.190 
just kind of messy so take your hair at
the<00:01:44.700> top<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.210> head<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.829> pull<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
the top of your head and pull it up and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.109 
the top of your head and pull it up and
then<00:01:49.200> you're<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> gently<00:01:50.220> brush

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
then you're just going to gently brush

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.840 
then you're just going to gently brush
down

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.640 

so<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:00.910> gives<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:02.250> big<00:02:03.250> volume<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:05.590> a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
so it gives you that big volume do a

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.320 
so it gives you that big volume do a
little<00:02:05.890> bit<00:02:06.040> on<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.370> sides<00:02:06.610> too<00:02:07.000> but

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
little bit on the sides too but

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.270 
little bit on the sides too but
underneath<00:02:08.110> so<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.680> it<00:02:08.770> doesn't<00:02:09.070> show

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
underneath so that it doesn't show

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.740 
underneath so that it doesn't show
because<00:02:09.580> you're<00:02:09.700> going<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.910> kind<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.479> comb

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
because you're going to kind of comb

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.800 
because you're going to kind of comb
this<00:02:10.900> out<00:02:11.080> so<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.070> won't<00:02:12.190> see<00:02:12.520> any<00:02:12.790> knots

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.060 

well<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.140> bottom<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.500> your<00:02:17.560> hair<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:17.830> also

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
well the bottom of your hair is also

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.120 
well the bottom of your hair is also
probably<00:02:18.580> going<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.270> pretty<00:02:19.840> limp<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.500> do

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
probably going to be pretty limp so do

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.680 
probably going to be pretty limp so do
the<00:02:21.250> same<00:02:21.460> thing<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:22.620> very<00:02:23.620> very<00:02:24.070> gently

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
the same thing just very very gently

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.820 
the same thing just very very gently
combing<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:26.020> making<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.950> just<00:02:27.000> fluffy<00:02:28.000> and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
combing it up making it just fluffy and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.910 
combing it up making it just fluffy and
generally<00:02:29.830> frizzy<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:31.120> now<00:02:31.740> we're<00:02:32.740> going<00:02:32.830> to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
generally frizzy and now we're going to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.030 
generally frizzy and now we're going to
put<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.160> up<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:34.140> think<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.260> us<00:02:35.380> like<00:02:35.410> putting<00:02:35.920> up

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
put it up so think of us like putting up

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.680 
put it up so think of us like putting up
a<00:02:36.130> ponytail<00:02:36.430> I'm<00:02:37.000> going<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.210> flip<00:02:37.390> my<00:02:37.420> head

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.550 
over and that's how I like to do my
ponytails<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.880> comb<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.990> that<00:02:47.200> there's<00:02:47.410> not

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
ponytails and comb so that there's not

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.940 
ponytails and comb so that there's not

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
but not too sloppy looking now just pull

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.020 
but not too sloppy looking now just pull
the<00:03:13.060> elastic<00:03:16.020> like<00:03:17.020> you're<00:03:17.200> doing<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.590> ponytail

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the elastic like you're doing a ponytail

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.130 
the elastic like you're doing a ponytail
pull<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.120> all<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.360> way<00:03:19.510> through<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.989> first

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
pull it all the way through the first

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.580 
pull it all the way through the first
time<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.739> then<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.820> second<00:03:22.239> time<00:03:22.590> you're

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
time and then the second time you're

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.490 
time and then the second time you're
going<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.770> flip<00:03:24.070> it<00:03:24.310> like<00:03:25.200> you're<00:03:26.200> doing<00:03:26.440> a

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
going to flip it like you're doing a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.680 
going to flip it like you're doing a
ponytail<00:03:26.770> again<00:03:27.160> but<00:03:27.550> instead<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.180> pulling<00:03:28.510> it

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
ponytail again but instead of pulling it

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.990 
ponytail again but instead of pulling it
all<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.080> way<00:03:29.170> through<00:03:29.370> leave<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.550> ends<00:03:30.910> out

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
all the way through leave the ends out

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.280 
all the way through leave the ends out
like<00:03:31.270> this<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:31.660> you're<00:03:31.780> going<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.930> have<00:03:32.080> this

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
like this so you're going to have this

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.400 
like this so you're going to have this
little<00:03:32.640> thing<00:03:33.640> up<00:03:33.790> here<00:03:34.000> if<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.720> have<00:03:34.930> shorter

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
little thing up here if you have shorter

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.080 
little thing up here if you have shorter
hair<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.620> can<00:03:35.920> just<00:03:35.950> fan<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.670> out<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.000> you're

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
hair you can just fan it out and you're

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.470 
hair you can just fan it out and you're
done

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
done

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.890 
done
but<00:03:37.989> since<00:03:38.170> my<00:03:38.260> hair<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.530> long<00:03:39.660> I'm<00:03:40.660> going<00:03:40.810> to

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
but since my hair is long I'm going to

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:52.949 
but since my hair is long I'm going to
pull<00:03:41.350> it<00:03:41.470> through<00:03:41.500> again

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.470 

and<00:03:54.629> so<00:03:55.629> it's<00:03:56.250> again<00:03:57.250> pulled<00:03:57.609> only<00:03:57.849> partially

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
and so it's again pulled only partially

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.479 
and so it's again pulled only partially
through<00:03:58.659> and<00:03:58.930> then<00:03:59.620> fan<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.159> out<00:04:05.099> you<00:04:06.099> can<00:04:06.280> move

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
through and then fan it out you can move

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.319 
through and then fan it out you can move
the<00:04:06.760> ends<00:04:07.239> around<00:04:07.299> to<00:04:07.840> your<00:04:07.959> liking<00:04:09.329> now

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
the ends around to your liking now

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.830 
the ends around to your liking now
almost<00:04:10.870> done<00:04:11.459> because<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.849> don't<00:04:13.209> like<00:04:13.389> it<00:04:13.629> to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
almost done because I don't like it to

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.629 
almost done because I don't like it to
be<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.170> tight<00:04:14.439> over<00:04:14.829> here<00:04:14.859> so<00:04:15.219> I<00:04:15.280> put<00:04:15.519> my

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
be so tight over here so I put my

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.699 
be so tight over here so I put my
fingers<00:04:16.949> through<00:04:17.949> here<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.459> just<00:04:18.549> gently

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
fingers through here and just gently

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.300 
fingers through here and just gently
loosen<00:04:20.709> up<00:04:21.270> the<00:04:22.270> sides<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:22.990> top<00:04:23.310> you

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
loosen up the sides and the top you

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.909 
loosen up the sides and the top you
might<00:04:24.490> have<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.699> tighten<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.090> top<00:04:25.270> again<00:04:25.919> but

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
might have to tighten the top again but

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.779 
might have to tighten the top again but
just<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.780> it's<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:29.289> little<00:04:29.349> looser<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.479> little

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
just so it's a little looser a little

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:40.740 
just so it's a little looser a little
less<00:04:33.789> deliberate<00:04:34.690> looking<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:39.300> that's<00:04:40.300> it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
less deliberate looking and that's it

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.990 
less deliberate looking and that's it
so<00:04:41.110> super<00:04:41.919> easy<00:04:42.099> and<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.490> can<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:42.789> play

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
so super easy and you can just play

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.029 
so super easy and you can just play
around<00:04:43.120> with<00:04:43.330> it<00:04:43.419> until<00:04:43.570> you<00:04:44.139> get<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.889> way
