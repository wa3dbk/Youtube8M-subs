00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
showed the school and then basically the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
showed the school and then basically the
ending<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.649> his

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
ending is that we have to go to like his

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
ending is that we have to go to like his
realm<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.610> fight<00:00:50.820> him<00:00:51.000> which<00:00:51.180> I'm<00:00:51.629> assuming<00:00:51.780> is

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
so yeah when you get to the end here it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.540 
so yeah when you get to the end here it
pretty<00:02:15.110> much<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:15.530> stops<00:02:15.830> but<00:02:16.160> we<00:02:16.220> realize

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
pretty much just stops but we realize

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.860 
pretty much just stops but we realize
that<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.790> break<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.210> floor<00:02:17.480> here<00:02:17.690> and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
that if you break the floor here and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.870 
areas that really messed with us and
video<00:03:12.530> wise<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:13.070> wasn't<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.400> great<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.730> make

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
video wise it wasn't that great to make

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.030 
video wise it wasn't that great to make
videos<00:03:13.910> on<00:03:14.390> in<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.660> dark<00:03:14.900> areas<00:03:15.350> mm-hmm<00:03:15.950> ah

videos on in the dark areas mm-hmm ah
the<00:03:16.490> storyline<00:03:17.060> was<00:03:17.240> awesome<00:03:17.750> apart<00:03:18.350> from<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
the storyline was awesome apart from the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.410 
the storyline was awesome apart from the
ending<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.160> preferred<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.550> story<00:03:19.910> line<00:03:20.120> at

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
ending so I preferred the story line at

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.780 
ending so I preferred the story line at

in<00:03:28.070> single<00:03:28.430> player<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:28.940> I'll<00:03:29.150> probably<00:03:29.330> give

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
in single player so I'll probably give

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.140 
in single player so I'll probably give
that<00:03:29.780> like<00:03:30.050> a<00:03:30.080> nine<00:03:30.740> as<00:03:30.890> well<00:03:31.040> I'd<00:03:31.370> also<00:03:31.610> say<00:03:31.940> in

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
that like a nine as well I'd also say in

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.270 
that like a nine as well I'd also say in
terms<00:03:32.330> of<00:03:32.540> diversity<00:03:32.840> like<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.650> diversity<00:03:34.250> of

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
terms of diversity like the diversity of

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.100 
terms of diversity like the diversity of
the<00:03:34.459> different<00:03:35.030> areas<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.450> went<00:03:35.690> through<00:03:35.900> yeah

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
the different areas we went through yeah

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.350 
the different areas we went through yeah
that<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.709> do<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.430> I'd<00:03:37.580> give<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:37.940> 10<00:03:38.209> to

that I do that it I'd give that a 10 to

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.670 
that I do that it I'd give that a 10 to
be<00:03:38.450> honest<00:03:38.690> because<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.320> was<00:03:39.440> very

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
be honest because it was very

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.830 
be honest because it was very
adventuring<00:03:40.400> there<00:03:40.910> was<00:03:41.030> like<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.209> forest<00:03:41.660> type

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
yeah so yeah so I give the diversity of

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.860 
yeah so yeah so I give the diversity of
just<00:03:48.500> locations<00:03:49.190> 10<00:03:49.490> out<00:03:49.610> of<00:03:49.640> 10<00:03:49.850> also<00:03:50.690> the

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
just locations 10 out of 10 also the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.990 
just locations 10 out of 10 also the
idea<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.500> floating<00:03:52.100> thing<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:52.520> give<00:03:52.790> that

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
idea of the floating thing I give that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.090 
idea of the floating thing I give that
like<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.180> nine<00:03:53.480> or<00:03:53.510> ten<00:03:53.840> out<00:03:54.020> of<00:03:54.050> ten<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.500> all<00:03:54.950> the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
like a nine or ten out of ten so all the

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.740 
like a nine or ten out of ten so all the
way<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.400> was<00:03:55.550> annoying<00:03:56.000> for<00:03:56.270> the<00:03:56.360> sort<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.660> a

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
way it was annoying for the sort of a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.320 
way it was annoying for the sort of a
kind<00:03:56.990> of<00:03:57.050> thing<00:03:57.260> yeah<00:03:57.790> but<00:03:58.790> that's<00:03:59.209> pretty
