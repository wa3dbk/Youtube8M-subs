00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 good staff to fix the brushes 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.859
 So I usually use a body and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.980
 glass is but can use any 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.690
 container and liquid soap 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:23.900
 I put average three for not visiting 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.900
 so stay put, I'll put it here and 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:34.110
 I leave all n water but not less a finger 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.469
 and I feel it 's the cord 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.809
 both common bristle brushes and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:48.420
 the synthetic ones I put of sauce here a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:53.610
 little synthetic is in the sauce 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.949
 the sponges I usually put that I 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.730
 directly or soap it is also difficult're here 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:10.710
 ready for me I got the joke here 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:15.840
 I leave here in the sauce so let me 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.729
 Like this in the sink and the sponges this 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.180
 What talent did I just get to explain 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.860
 It's good for you, Rosinha. 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.710
 any type of sponge I usually 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.130
 use this same sauce that I have 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.979
 example the sky only that a stump in the case a 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.200
 new a little more in the soap and puts 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.090
 If you have to face, you usually use 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.110
 a little venice along with this 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.390
 mixture 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 so I miss just the same sauce 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.479
 doing with the brushes and then I go there 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.079
 walk like that, and then she's ready to 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.439
 to use just rinse let dry 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.520
 I usually leave drying and dezinho 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:04.770
 and well then the hotel cvv 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.759
 usually I just do this to release 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.600
 huh 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.600
 all the makeup 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.349
 there the conflict if it stays clean 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.580
 if you did not have a tango 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:24.810
 left more sauce to sit on there 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.660
 Look at a shot to find water, right? 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.660
 Good, I'll leave this sauce in here. 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:45.130
 after I arrived I put it happy 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:49.930
 here for a minute just for power 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.930
 It's my time to come and go. 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.020
 normally synthetic bristles are the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.320
 more difficult to clean because I use 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:05.360
 creamy products or else they react 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.570
 It is fairer to soak or spoil the 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.290
 my hand but she 's too fake this at 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.290
 cup background 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:27.410
 best left to live and when to end the 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:33.950
 Look, I 'm going to do the same thing here. 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:36.020
 I'm boring I use the montage of 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.670
 practicing excess soap and tried 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:49.790
 hold the camera to record everything has 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:54.530
 How to like it rolled to dry 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:59.270
 here if no one bathroom you have 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.300
 I put it in my room in the 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:08.170
 my desk and leave anything if it did not 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:10.190
 way with certain and in the natural format 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.160
 sponge that from that way 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.740
 My little foot and that's it 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.669
 Now I'm going to wash you sponge 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:26.139
 they see less or less what to do with them 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:30.789
 they also had everything on a rock 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:33.909
 the sponge has easy going there 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.129
 hey, I squeezed out, the rest is 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.860
 in the water 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:41.949
 I put it to dry this way too. 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.490
 it serves at ease the makeup is where I 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:49.389
 I like to wear two on a cross one 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.330
 creamy and biphasic the creamy I like to 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:55.150
 People are make-up on the face and a biphasic 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.020
 From the eyes 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:02.409
 so I always have a little square I 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.270
 I could believe people like him 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.270
 Shoot the first is this 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:16.620
 I put here my song and she takes it out 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.620
 first eye makeup 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:38.930
 so I guess it's always easier 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:41.779
 involves masking pencil with a 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.710
 two-phase make-up remover so I 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.710
 I like to use 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.460
 and I get that little bit played 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:11.919
 We take makeup off. 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.919
 in the face case now 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.030
 so here too 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.440
 and to finalize this process of withdrawing 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.070
 the makeup 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.620
 I always like washing my face to 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.230
 name of maikon milk because it is the leader in 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:43.340
 classification leaving the oily custom 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.600
 This is not cool so this is how 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.660
 I do 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.150
 And then I only take August in the shower or I 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.320
 I use line 11 purifying the o boticario 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.760
 Do you know who I am? 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.310
 This is what I hope you enjoyed. 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.190

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.450

 hangout then keep an eye on me

 advertise on fanpage and here year channel 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.510
 what time is the gaucho is good if 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.480
 you have questions about anything 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:20.210
 makeup is just you enter this renault 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:24.280
