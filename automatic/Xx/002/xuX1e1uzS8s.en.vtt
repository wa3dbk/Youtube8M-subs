00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
trial form has been brilliant and she'll

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.590 
trial form has been brilliant and she'll
sit<00:00:56.109> on<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.379> pace<00:00:56.609> and<00:00:57.609> give<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:57.940> great<00:00:58.210> kick<00:00:58.449> on

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
sit on the pace and give a great kick on

sit on the pace and give a great kick on
the<00:00:58.629> corner<00:00:59.079> and<00:00:59.199> should<00:00:59.620> be<00:00:59.739> very

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
the corner and should be very

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.889 
the corner and should be very
competitive<00:01:00.280> fam<00:01:00.850> she's<00:01:01.449> had<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.629> wind

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
competitive fam she's had a wind

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.689 
competitive fam she's had a wind
operation<00:01:02.469> and<00:01:02.649> I<00:01:02.829> think<00:01:03.100> she's<00:01:03.250> improved

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
operation and I think she's improved

drawn out in 13 yeah I actually looks
about<00:01:30.880> barrier<00:01:31.299> but<00:01:31.479> not<00:01:31.689> for<00:01:31.869> her<00:01:31.990> she'd<00:01:32.439> like

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
about barrier but not for her she'd like

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.710 
about barrier but not for her she'd like
tracing<00:01:33.009> outside<00:01:33.549> horses<00:01:34.060> doesn't<00:01:34.630> like

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
tracing outside horses doesn't like

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.990 
tracing outside horses doesn't like
being<00:01:34.930> boxed<00:01:35.170> up<00:01:35.470> we've<00:01:36.310> taken<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.700> blinkers

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
being boxed up we've taken the blinkers

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.950 
being boxed up we've taken the blinkers
off<00:01:37.119> because<00:01:37.360> you've<00:01:37.479> been<00:01:37.509> missing<00:01:37.869> the

start<00:01:38.259> put<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.979> winkers<00:01:39.310> on<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:40.659> think<00:01:41.259> she<00:01:41.470> is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
start put the winkers on I think she is

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.929 
start put the winkers on I think she is
about<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.579> strike<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:43.329> very<00:01:43.990> very<00:01:44.500> even<00:01:45.399> race<00:01:45.610> of
