watch the MPC's um video i did before
this<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:47.340> how<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> got<00:00:47.910> these<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.450> this

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
this one and how I got these like this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.590 
this one and how I got these like this
is<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.350> place<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.070> grass<00:00:50.309> when<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.390> place

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
is if you place the grass when you place

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.380 
is if you place the grass when you place
the<00:00:51.930> NPC<00:00:52.530> block<00:00:52.829> underneath<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.820> spawns

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the NPC block underneath it it spawns

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.720 
the NPC block underneath it it spawns
them<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.840> above<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.500> top<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> grass<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.670> you

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
them to above on top of the grass so you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.360 
them to above on top of the grass so you
don't<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.449> face<00:00:57.870> block

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.860 
and kill spiders and you will probably
run<00:02:15.659> out<00:02:15.719> of<00:02:15.900> arrows<00:02:16.349> like<00:02:16.859> I<00:02:17.069> ran<00:02:17.340> out<00:02:17.519> twice

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
run out of arrows like I ran out twice

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.270 
run out of arrows like I ran out twice
it's<00:02:18.870> alright<00:02:19.109> if<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.439> buy<00:02:19.590> some<00:02:19.829> more<00:02:19.950> arrows

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
it's alright if you buy some more arrows

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.080 
it's alright if you buy some more arrows
just<00:02:20.310> because<00:02:20.909> you<00:02:21.540> don't<00:02:21.659> have<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.290> have<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
just because you don't have to have the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.520 
just because you don't have to have the
crafted<00:02:24.090> arrows<00:02:24.390> after<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.870> already<00:02:25.019> craft

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
crafted arrows after you already craft

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.880 
crafted arrows after you already craft
layers<00:02:25.829> and<00:02:26.489> after<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.719> game<00:02:27.959> play<00:02:28.200> i<00:02:28.439> will

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
layers and after that game play i will

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.619 
layers and after that game play i will
show<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.099> what's<00:02:29.370> new<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.060> what<00:02:30.299> we<00:02:30.450> will

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
show you what's new and what we will

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
tower I'll show you real quick how the

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.190 
tower I'll show you real quick how the
tower<00:02:58.349> view<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.950> how<00:02:59.129> big<00:02:59.609> the<00:03:00.120> kingdom<00:03:00.569> is<00:03:00.719> so

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
tower view of how big the kingdom is so

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.000 
tower view of how big the kingdom is so
far<00:03:01.500> which<00:03:02.250> hopefully<00:03:02.689> will<00:03:03.689> soon<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.829> getting

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
far which hopefully will soon be getting

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.490 
far which hopefully will soon be getting
bigger<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.700> bigger<00:03:05.939> and<00:03:06.120> bigger<00:03:06.329> that's<00:03:07.319> how

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
bigger and bigger and bigger that's how

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.830 
bigger and bigger and bigger that's how
big<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.919> is<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.340> far<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:10.010> we<00:03:11.010> should<00:03:11.310> nets<00:03:11.840> next

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
big it is so far and we should nets next

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.440 
big it is so far and we should nets next
time<00:03:13.019> we<00:03:13.260> should<00:03:13.290> be<00:03:13.799> spanning<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:15.239> way

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
time we should be spanning that way

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.020 
time we should be spanning that way
hopefully<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:16.079> think<00:03:16.439> yeah<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.400> think<00:03:17.489> will<00:03:17.819> span

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
hopefully I think yeah I think will span

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.089 
hopefully I think yeah I think will span
that<00:03:18.209> way<00:03:18.419> or<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:20.310> way<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:21.829> that<00:03:22.829> probably

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
that way or that way I that probably

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.259 
that way or that way I that probably
won't<00:03:23.220> be<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.489> Nets<00:03:23.699> video<00:03:24.030> because<00:03:24.239> we've

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
won't be in the Nets video because we've

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.119 
won't be in the Nets video because we've

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
hundred stacks yeah alright and how I go

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.670 
hundred stacks yeah alright and how I go
by<00:03:44.400> doing<00:03:44.849> this<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.419> usually<00:03:45.810> go<00:03:45.959> for<00:03:45.989> square

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
by doing this is I usually go for square

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.979 
by doing this is I usually go for square
kind<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.159> shape<00:03:47.400> for<00:03:48.620> for<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:50.239> places<00:03:51.239> we'll

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
kind of shape for for the places we'll

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:59.809 
kind of shape for for the places we'll
just<00:03:52.169> go<00:03:52.349> like<00:03:53.720> this<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:56.509> I<00:03:57.509> guess<00:03:58.669> that<00:03:59.669> will

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
just go like this and I guess that will

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.819 
just go like this and I guess that will
be<00:04:00.269> one<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.569> our<00:04:00.720> buildings<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.909> about<00:04:03.829> this

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
be one of our buildings and about this

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:12.059 
be one of our buildings and about this
far<00:04:05.430> back<00:04:06.030> right<00:04:07.519> about<00:04:08.519> there

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.930 

right<00:04:16.199> read<00:04:17.199> about<00:04:17.350> theirs<00:04:17.680> were<00:04:18.130> actually<00:04:18.880> I

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
right read about theirs were actually I

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:27.840 
right read about theirs were actually I
wanted<00:04:19.150> one<00:04:19.329> more<00:04:25.530> as<00:04:26.530> we<00:04:27.039> move<00:04:27.250> is<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:27.759> I'm

basically what I do is for the square
shape<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:31.210> build<00:04:31.539> it<00:04:31.599> off<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.750> square<00:04:32.199> shape

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
shape and build it off a square shape

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.950 
shape and build it off a square shape
about<00:04:33.520> up<00:04:34.300> three<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:36.479> we're<00:04:37.479> just<00:04:37.599> kind<00:04:37.780> of<00:04:37.810> a

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
about up three and we're just kind of a

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.180 
about up three and we're just kind of a
kind<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:38.650> window<00:04:38.979> right<00:04:39.310> there<00:04:39.660> door<00:04:40.660> will<00:04:40.960> be

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
kind of window right there door will be

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.560 
kind of window right there door will be
right<00:04:43.259> here<00:04:44.940> we'll<00:04:45.940> put<00:04:46.150> that<00:04:46.180> right<00:04:46.509> there

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
right here we'll put that right there

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.120 
right here we'll put that right there
didn't<00:04:47.110> move<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.259> place<00:04:47.500> that<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:49.919> think<00:04:50.919> I

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
didn't move the place that I think I
