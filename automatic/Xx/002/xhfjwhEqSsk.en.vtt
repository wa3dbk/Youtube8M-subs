skiing really good access back in the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.130 
skiing really good access back in the
stern<00:02:49.950> here<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.880> scuppers<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.510> either<00:02:51.720> side<00:02:52.110> of

the<00:02:52.319> cockpit<00:02:52.530> rapid<00:02:53.340> drainage<00:02:53.819> makes<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
the cockpit rapid drainage makes the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.640 
the cockpit rapid drainage makes the
boat<00:02:54.390> more<00:02:54.540> seaworthy<00:02:55.049> it<00:02:55.140> also<00:02:55.290> makes<00:02:55.560> it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
boat more seaworthy it also makes it

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.590 
boat more seaworthy it also makes it
easier<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:55.980> clean<00:02:56.310> up<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.299> works<00:02:57.480> really

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
easier to clean up so that works really

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.400 
easier to clean up so that works really
nicely<00:02:57.959> also<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.980> fish<00:02:59.190> box<00:02:59.840> it's<00:03:00.840> probably

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
nicely also the fish box it's probably

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.800 
nicely also the fish box it's probably
the<00:03:01.500> largest<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:02.010> its<00:03:02.160> class<00:03:02.400> 256<00:03:03.269> quarts<00:03:03.660> it's

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
the largest in its class 256 quarts it's

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.559 
the largest in its class 256 quarts it's
huge<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.590> it's<00:03:05.220> divided<00:03:05.580> off<00:03:05.819> into<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.120> second

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
huge and it's divided off into a second

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.229 
huge and it's divided off into a second
section<00:03:07.200> over<00:03:07.470> here<00:03:07.590> on<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.830> port<00:03:08.160> side<00:03:08.239> so

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
section over here on the port side so

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.780 
section over here on the port side so
you<00:03:09.299> can<00:03:09.390> use<00:03:09.569> this<00:03:09.780> for<00:03:10.019> for<00:03:10.290> bait<00:03:10.830> or<00:03:11.040> for

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
you can use this for for bait or for

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.970 
you can use this for for bait or for
whatever<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.420> want<00:03:12.600> over<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.019> side<00:03:13.230> it

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
whatever you want over on this side it

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.460 
whatever you want over on this side it
divides<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.489> up<00:03:14.580> nicely<00:03:14.819> it's<00:03:15.510> insulated<00:03:16.110> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
divides it up nicely it's insulated and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.680 
divides it up nicely it's insulated and
it<00:03:17.040> also<00:03:17.190> drains<00:03:17.580> directly<00:03:17.940> overboard<00:03:18.570> so

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
it also drains directly overboard so

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.849 
it also drains directly overboard so
there's<00:03:18.870> no<00:03:18.959> plumbing<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.380> worry<00:03:19.530> about<00:03:19.709> no

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
there's no plumbing to worry about no

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.920 
there's no plumbing to worry about no
macerator<00:03:20.340> pumps<00:03:20.760> or<00:03:20.880> anything<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.720> break
