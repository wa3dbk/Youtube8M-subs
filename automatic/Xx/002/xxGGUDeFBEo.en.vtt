took<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.030> board<00:02:22.270> out<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.720> my<00:02:22.840> tombstone<00:02:23.080> and

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
took the board out of my tombstone and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.630 
took the board out of my tombstone and
flipped<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.860> upside<00:02:24.160> down

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
flipped it upside down

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.640 
flipped it upside down
no<00:02:25.030> modifications<00:02:25.720> look<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.020> everett<00:02:26.380> fit

no modifications look so everett fit

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.100 
no modifications look so everett fit

actually<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.280> had<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.459> lock<00:04:09.700> button<00:04:09.940> with

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
actually you had a lock button with

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.270 
actually you had a lock button with
these<00:04:10.329> it<00:04:10.750> actually<00:04:11.470> wasn't<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.799> button<00:04:12.070> it<00:04:12.190> was

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
these it actually wasn't a button it was

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.750 
these it actually wasn't a button it was
a<00:04:12.310> switch<00:04:12.840> what<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:14.079> did<00:04:14.410> was<00:04:14.680> it<00:04:14.890> shut<00:04:15.430> power

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
a switch what this did was it shut power

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.190 
a switch what this did was it shut power
off<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.570> receiver<00:04:17.850> so<00:04:18.850> if<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.900> were<00:04:19.989> going

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
off to the receiver so if you were going

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.900 
off to the receiver so if you were going
away<00:04:20.320> on<00:04:20.440> vacation<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:21.220> receiver<00:04:21.580> wouldn't

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
away on vacation the receiver wouldn't

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.070 
away on vacation the receiver wouldn't
work<00:04:22.030> but<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.330> wall<00:04:22.479> button<00:04:22.690> would<00:04:22.870> still

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
work but the wall button would still

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.510 
work but the wall button would still
work<00:04:23.260> I

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
work I

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:32.730 
work I
this<00:04:24.819> liftmaster<00:04:26.370> 973<00:04:27.370> LM<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.479> think<00:04:29.910> yeah<00:04:31.740> 973

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
this liftmaster 973 LM I think yeah 973

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.399 
this liftmaster 973 LM I think yeah 973
Ln<00:04:33.099> this<00:04:33.789> busted<00:04:34.509> it<00:04:34.690> doesn't<00:04:35.020> work<00:04:35.139> anymore

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
Ln this busted it doesn't work anymore

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.379 
Ln this busted it doesn't work anymore
so<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.740> just<00:04:35.800> figured<00:04:36.460> why<00:04:36.610> not<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:36.970> labeled<00:04:37.270> it

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
so I just figured why not and labeled it

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:44.670 
so I just figured why not and labeled it
up<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:38.740> have<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.879> 971<00:04:40.750> LM<00:04:41.580> no<00:04:42.580> tags<00:04:43.500> with<00:04:44.500> the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
up I have the 971 LM no tags with the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.920 
up I have the 971 LM no tags with the
older-style<00:04:45.069> security<00:04:45.879> plus<00:04:46.120> logo<00:04:46.569> so<00:04:46.750> that's

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
older-style security plus logo so that's

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.480 
older-style security plus logo so that's
the<00:04:47.080> only<00:04:47.169> reason<00:04:47.319> I'm<00:04:47.650> keeping<00:04:47.830> this<00:04:48.129> remote

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
the only reason I'm keeping this remote

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.689 
the only reason I'm keeping this remote
I<00:04:49.319> i've<00:04:50.319> tried<00:04:50.650> cleaning<00:04:50.979> this<00:04:51.220> it<00:04:51.370> was<00:04:51.490> in<00:04:51.639> a
