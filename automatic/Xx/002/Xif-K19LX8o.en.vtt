00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
you get to the forest area if you go

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.820 
you get to the forest area if you go
down<00:00:21.010> to<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.310> bottom<00:00:21.660> left<00:00:22.660> corner<00:00:23.529> of<00:00:23.679> the

your your finger will I is when you come

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.510 
your your finger will I is when you come
to<00:00:29.349> it<00:00:29.789> if<00:00:30.789> you<00:00:30.910> come<00:00:31.119> down<00:00:31.150> here<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:33.340> will

to it if you come down here you will

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.240 
to it if you come down here you will
find<00:00:33.550> 9<00:00:34.150> canners<00:00:34.660> now<00:00:35.079> don't<00:00:35.350> worry<00:00:35.590> cannons

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
find 9 canners now don't worry cannons

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.130 
find 9 canners now don't worry cannons
yeah<00:00:36.820> now<00:00:37.329> don't<00:00:37.510> worry<00:00:37.719> about<00:00:37.899> the<00:00:37.989> way

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
yeah now don't worry about the way

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.959 
yeah now don't worry about the way
they're<00:00:38.620> set<00:00:38.829> up<00:00:38.890> they<00:00:39.340> usually<00:00:39.520> set<00:00:39.910> up

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
they're set up they usually set up

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.850 
they're set up they usually set up
differently<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.719> what<00:00:40.870> let's<00:00:41.379> set<00:00:41.559> up<00:00:41.590> here

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
differently to what let's set up here

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.680 
differently to what let's set up here
it's<00:00:42.340> because<00:00:42.489> I<00:00:42.699> fiddled<00:00:43.030> around<00:00:43.210> with<00:00:43.480> them

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
it's because I fiddled around with them

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.160 
it's because I fiddled around with them
beforehand<00:00:44.500> so<00:00:45.539> I'm<00:00:46.539> just<00:00:46.780> going<00:00:46.899> to<00:00:46.989> take<00:00:47.109> it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
beforehand so I'm just going to take it

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.200 
beforehand so I'm just going to take it
toward<00:00:47.530> towards<00:00:48.460> to<00:00:49.059> my<00:00:49.949> village<00:00:50.949> or<00:00:51.430> kingdom

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
toward towards to my village or kingdom

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.920 
toward towards to my village or kingdom
yes<00:00:53.079> it's<00:00:53.320> my<00:00:53.530> kingdom<00:00:53.980> mine<00:00:54.989> mine<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.390> this

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
yes it's my kingdom mine mine and this

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.450 
yes it's my kingdom mine mine and this
this<00:00:59.350> all<00:00:59.530> this<00:00:59.680> achievement<00:01:00.010> requires<00:01:00.219> you

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
this all this achievement requires you

to do is watch a calf ling bounced

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.730 
to do is watch a calf ling bounced
through<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.269> cannons<00:01:04.900> would<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:05.290> say<00:01:05.470> bounce

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
through the cannons would you say bounce

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.390 
through the cannons would you say bounce
or<00:01:06.100> anything<00:01:06.400> its<00:01:06.820> jump<00:01:07.090> through<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.420> cannons

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
or anything its jump through the cannons

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.840 
or anything its jump through the cannons
you<00:01:09.400> have<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.610> watch<00:01:09.790> them<00:01:10.150> yeah<00:01:10.750> I<00:01:10.930> know<00:01:11.850> so

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
here is me putting a calf ling in the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.899 
here is me putting a calf ling in the
cannons<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.799> doesn't<00:01:18.159> actually<00:01:18.280> specify

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
cannons now it doesn't actually specify

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.450 
cannons now it doesn't actually specify
how<00:01:19.180> many<00:01:19.240> times<00:01:19.689> a<00:01:19.960> kev<00:01:20.170> link<00:01:20.380> has<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:20.770> jump

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
how many times a kev link has to jump

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.749 
how many times a kev link has to jump
out<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.850> cannon<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.009> countered<00:01:24.640> I

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
out of a cannon but I countered I

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.620 
out of a cannon but I countered I
countered<00:01:24.820> this<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:25.750> it's<00:01:26.530> 100<00:01:27.460> times<00:01:27.759> so<00:01:28.570> you

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
countered this and it's 100 times so you

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.840 
countered this and it's 100 times so you
could<00:01:29.140> if<00:01:29.409> you<00:01:29.470> wanted<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.950> just<00:01:30.189> put<00:01:30.820> a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
could if you wanted to just put a

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.859 
could if you wanted to just put a
filling<00:01:31.360> in<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.840> just<00:01:32.500> walk<00:01:32.740> away<00:01:32.890> as<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.630> you

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
filling in and just walk away as and you

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.719 
filling in and just walk away as and you
can<00:01:35.020> all<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.200> could<00:01:35.590> as<00:01:35.799> well<00:01:35.890> just<00:01:36.340> put<00:01:36.520> two

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
can all you could as well just put two

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.940 
can all you could as well just put two
cannons<00:01:37.060> together<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.689> then<00:01:37.810> they'll<00:01:38.799> just

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
cannons together and then they'll just

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.700 
cannons together and then they'll just
bounce<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.549> each<00:01:39.700> other<00:01:39.909> I<00:01:40.060> suppose<00:01:40.259> I'd<00:01:41.259> know

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
bounce to each other I suppose I'd know

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.630 
bounce to each other I suppose I'd know
I<00:01:41.740> had<00:01:41.920> tried<00:01:42.159> it<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:45.310> has<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.490> be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
I had tried it but it has to be

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.480 
I had tried it but it has to be
continuous<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:47.079> can't<00:01:47.290> just<00:01:47.469> sort<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.710> go<00:01:47.890> one

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
continuous you can't just sort of go one

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.609 
continuous you can't just sort of go one
two<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.119> then<00:01:49.180> stop<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:49.990> then<00:01:50.079> do<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.409> rest

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
two and then stop and then do the rest

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.139 
two and then stop and then do the rest
do<00:01:50.979> with<00:01:51.159> 98<00:01:52.079> later<00:01:53.490> they<00:01:54.490> have<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.790> be<00:01:54.909> 100

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
do with 98 later they have to be 100

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.100 
do with 98 later they have to be 100
continuous<00:01:56.020> so<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.229> can't<00:01:56.439> stop<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:01.110> that's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
continuous so it can't stop so that's

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.109 
continuous so it can't stop so that's
all<00:02:02.259> its<00:02:02.409> achievement<00:02:02.770> equality<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.219> do<00:02:03.369> and

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
all its achievement equality to do and

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.719 
all its achievement equality to do and
it<00:02:04.210> does<00:02:04.360> say<00:02:04.539> you<00:02:04.600> have<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.899> watch<00:02:05.170> but

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
it does say you have to watch but

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.950 
it does say you have to watch but
apparently<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.880> don't<00:02:07.090> have<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.570> watch<00:02:07.750> the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
apparently you don't have to watch the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.810 
apparently you don't have to watch the
calf<00:02:08.170> ling<00:02:08.380> jump<00:02:08.619> out<00:02:08.740> of<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:08.890> cannon<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.670> can

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
calf ling jump out of a cannon you can

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.640 
calf ling jump out of a cannon you can
just<00:02:09.940> walk<00:02:10.149> away<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.720> just<00:02:11.230> wait<00:02:11.440> for<00:02:11.470> the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
just walk away and just wait for the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.440 
just walk away and just wait for the
team<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.890> pop<00:02:12.190> up<00:02:12.220> apparently<00:02:13.120> that's<00:02:13.270> all

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
team to pop up apparently that's all
