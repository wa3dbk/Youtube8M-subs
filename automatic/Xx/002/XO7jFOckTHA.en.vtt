00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that I'm going to show you is really

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.139 
that I'm going to show you is really
nothing<00:00:40.800> new<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.430> been<00:00:41.610> around<00:00:41.850> for

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
nothing new it's been around for

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.970 
nothing new it's been around for
hundreds<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> years<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.590> kind<00:00:43.860> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
hundreds of years but I'm kind of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.889 
hundreds of years but I'm kind of
surprised<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.760> how<00:00:45.149> few<00:00:45.420> people<00:00:45.750> know

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
surprised really how few people know

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.350 
surprised really how few people know
about<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.920> think<00:00:47.219> after<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.579> teach<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
about it and I think after I teach it to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.510 
about it and I think after I teach it to
you<00:00:48.539> you'll<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.140> very<00:00:49.410> pleased<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.100> try<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.340> out

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
you you'll be very pleased to try it out

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.069 
you you'll be very pleased to try it out
in<00:00:50.700> your<00:00:50.820> garden<00:00:51.270> because<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:51.960> to

this<00:01:05.199> variety<00:01:05.770> that<00:01:06.460> I'm<00:01:06.580> using<00:01:06.880> here<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.570> one

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
this variety that I'm using here is one

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.650 
this variety that I'm using here is one
of<00:01:08.170> david<00:01:08.560> austin's<00:01:09.100> roses<00:01:09.700> i<00:01:09.880> like<00:01:10.390> the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
of david austin's roses i like the

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.810 
of david austin's roses i like the
strong<00:01:11.020> vigorous<00:01:11.650> growing<00:01:11.950> ones<00:01:12.310> that<00:01:12.640> we'll

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
strong vigorous growing ones that we'll

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.180 
strong vigorous growing ones that we'll
get<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.270> about<00:01:13.450> five<00:01:13.750> or<00:01:13.960> six<00:01:14.110> foot<00:01:14.440> because

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
get to about five or six foot because

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.240 
get to about five or six foot because
you<00:01:15.430> can<00:01:15.700> train<00:01:16.090> them<00:01:16.390> as<00:01:16.630> many<00:01:17.410> climbers

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
you can train them as many climbers

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.820 
you can train them as many climbers
there<00:01:19.030> are<00:01:19.210> climbing<00:01:19.840> roses<00:01:20.050> that<00:01:20.500> will<00:01:20.619> grow

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
there are climbing roses that will grow

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.340 
there are climbing roses that will grow
twelve<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.490> fifteen<00:01:21.670> foot<00:01:22.240> maybe<00:01:22.570> even<00:01:23.080> 30

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
twelve to fifteen foot maybe even 30

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.050 
twelve to fifteen foot maybe even 30
foot<00:01:23.680> tall<00:01:23.710> some<00:01:24.160> of<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.310> really<00:01:24.490> big<00:01:24.760> strong

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
foot tall some of the really big strong

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.410 
foot tall some of the really big strong
ones

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
ones

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.140 
ones
but<00:01:26.229> in<00:01:26.380> today's<00:01:26.590> gardens<00:01:27.340> we're<00:01:27.580> looking<00:01:27.940> for

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
but in today's gardens we're looking for

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.840 
but in today's gardens we're looking for
smaller<00:01:28.450> growing<00:01:28.900> varieties<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.800> these<00:01:30.430> are

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
smaller growing varieties and these are

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.510 
smaller growing varieties and these are
ideal<00:01:31.570> because<00:01:31.630> they<00:01:32.500> will<00:01:32.710> make<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.920> climbing

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
ideal because they will make a climbing

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.359 
ideal because they will make a climbing
rose<00:01:33.729> that's<00:01:34.300> about<00:01:34.690> five<00:01:35.170> or<00:01:35.470> six<00:01:35.710> foot<00:01:36.040> tall

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
rose that's about five or six foot tall

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.730 
rose that's about five or six foot tall
and<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.540> much<00:01:37.990> more<00:01:38.259> in<00:01:38.380> scale<00:01:38.680> with

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
and that is much more in scale with

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.450 
and that is much more in scale with
today<00:01:39.250> as<00:01:39.369> gone<00:01:39.640> by<00:01:40.509> what<00:01:40.750> I'm<00:01:40.990> doing<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.710> in

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
today as gone by what I'm doing is in

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.340 
today as gone by what I'm doing is in
training<00:01:42.759> these<00:01:43.210> plants<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:43.869> you<00:01:43.960> can<00:01:44.110> see

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
training these plants and you can see

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.280 
training these plants and you can see
from<00:01:44.590> this<00:01:44.770> chute<00:01:45.100> that<00:01:45.340> I<00:01:45.700> have<00:01:46.450> trained<00:01:47.080> in

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
from this chute that I have trained in

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.770 
from this chute that I have trained in
from<00:01:47.590> last<00:01:47.830> year<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:48.729> what<00:01:49.000> we're<00:01:49.210> doing<00:01:49.479> is

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
from last year that what we're doing is

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.770 
from last year that what we're doing is
we're<00:01:50.410> redirecting<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.460> growth

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
we're redirecting the growth

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.480 
we're redirecting the growth
horizontally<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.590> then<00:01:53.890> we<00:01:54.190> have<00:01:54.430> a

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
horizontally so that then we have a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.120 
horizontally so that then we have a
patient<00:01:55.180> on<00:01:55.390> ins<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:55.990> all<00:01:56.320> of<00:01:56.560> these<00:01:56.740> chutes

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
patient on ins and all of these chutes

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.310 
patient on ins and all of these chutes
and<00:01:57.369> these<00:01:57.940> were<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.330> chutes<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.930> carried

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
and these were the chutes that carried

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.120 
and these were the chutes that carried
the<00:01:59.500> flowers<00:01:59.800> for<00:02:00.190> last<00:02:00.399> year

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.880 

so<00:02:04.090> we're<00:02:04.360> channeling<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.170> growth<00:02:05.409> instead

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
so we're channeling the growth instead

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.029 
so we're channeling the growth instead
of<00:02:06.009> been<00:02:06.159> up<00:02:06.310> high<00:02:06.610> on<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.850> plant<00:02:07.240> down

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
of been up high on the plant down

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.889 
of been up high on the plant down
horizontally<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.819> we<00:02:10.000> get<00:02:10.240> many<00:02:10.600> more

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
horizontally so that we get many more

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.370 
horizontally so that we get many more
shoots<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.530> many<00:02:12.130> more<00:02:12.459> flowers<00:02:12.930> by<00:02:13.930> tying

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
shoots and many more flowers by tying

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.820 
shoots and many more flowers by tying
them<00:02:14.770> down<00:02:15.010> horizontally<00:02:15.870> you're<00:02:16.870> taking<00:02:17.440> the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
them down horizontally you're taking the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.610 
them down horizontally you're taking the
natural<00:02:18.209> process<00:02:19.209> which<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.660> called<00:02:19.720> facial

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
natural process which is called facial

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.000 
natural process which is called facial
dominance<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.630> turning<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.810> into<00:02:23.010> growing

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
dominance and turning it into growing

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.210 
dominance and turning it into growing
all<00:02:24.670> these<00:02:25.150> little<00:02:25.510> shoots<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.709> when<00:02:27.010> they

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
all these little shoots that when they

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.120 
all these little shoots that when they
grow<00:02:27.489> up<00:02:27.520> each<00:02:28.030> produce<00:02:28.660> flowers<00:02:29.319> on<00:02:29.709> their

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
grow up each produce flowers on their

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.100 
grow up each produce flowers on their
tips<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:31.270> end<00:02:31.540> result<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.520> get<00:02:33.730> a

year<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.170> what<00:03:08.440> we're<00:03:08.650> going<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:09.010> do<00:03:09.250> in

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
year so what we're going to do in

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.060 
year so what we're going to do in
pruning<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.239> training<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.900> plant<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.440> cut

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
pruning and training this plant is cut

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.430 
pruning and training this plant is cut
out<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.459> old<00:03:12.489> wood<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.299> then<00:03:13.810> leave<00:03:14.140> the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
out the old wood and then leave the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.800 
out the old wood and then leave the
young<00:03:14.680> shoots<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.579> that<00:03:15.880> we<00:03:16.030> can<00:03:16.269> train<00:03:16.540> those

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
young shoots so that we can train those

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.979 
young shoots so that we can train those
back<00:03:17.140> in<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.519> with<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.970> pruners<00:03:19.239> we're<00:03:19.720> going

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
back in so with the pruners we're going

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.590 
back in so with the pruners we're going
to<00:03:20.170> start<00:03:20.530> by<00:03:20.829> cutting<00:03:21.280> out<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.670> old<00:03:22.150> shoots

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
to start by cutting out the old shoots

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.030 
to start by cutting out the old shoots
from<00:03:22.840> last<00:03:23.170> year<00:03:23.500> they<00:03:23.769> have<00:03:23.859> already

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
from last year they have already

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.000 
from last year they have already
finished<00:03:24.390> flowering<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.989> wood<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.440> not<00:03:26.680> so

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
finished flowering the wood is not so

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.940 
finished flowering the wood is not so
Grothe<00:03:27.609> so<00:03:28.239> that's<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.109> stuff<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:29.769> want

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
Grothe so that's the stuff that we want

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.069 
Grothe so that's the stuff that we want
to<00:03:30.160> get<00:03:30.340> rid<00:03:30.549> of<00:03:30.609> so<00:03:31.329> we<00:03:31.600> cut<00:03:31.900> them<00:03:33.810> right<00:03:34.810> back

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
to get rid of so we cut them right back

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.830 
to get rid of so we cut them right back
just<00:03:35.410> removing<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.370> old<00:03:36.730> string<00:03:37.239> from<00:03:37.600> last

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
just removing the old string from last

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
year that we had them tied in and then

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.610 
year that we had them tied in and then
just<00:03:42.519> getting<00:03:42.760> rid<00:03:43.060> of<00:03:43.209> those<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.750> leaving

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.310 
we're left with these young fresh
flexible<00:03:54.310> shoots<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.390> time<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:56.019> tie

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
flexible shoots and it's time to tie

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.220 
flexible shoots and it's time to tie
those<00:03:56.680> in<00:03:56.980> decide<00:03:57.790> which<00:03:58.120> ones<00:03:58.480> are<00:03:58.780> going<00:03:58.959> to

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
those in decide which ones are going to

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.190 
those in decide which ones are going to
go<00:03:59.380> best<00:03:59.709> along<00:04:00.459> at<00:04:00.880> whatever<00:04:01.209> levels<00:04:01.930> and

looking at this one here I've tied it in
at<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.200> side<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.799> now<00:04:06.420> it's<00:04:07.420> time<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.810> take<00:04:08.319> it

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
at the side and now it's time to take it

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.390 
at the side and now it's time to take it
and<00:04:09.090> train<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.350> horizontally<00:04:11.350> bending<00:04:12.220> it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
and train it horizontally bending it

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.689 
and train it horizontally bending it
down<00:04:12.669> as<00:04:12.940> low<00:04:13.570> as<00:04:13.600> you<00:04:13.989> can<00:04:14.380> without<00:04:14.919> breaking

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
down as low as you can without breaking

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:16.650 
down as low as you can without breaking
it<00:04:15.850> and

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
it and

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.570 
it and
would<00:04:16.900> be<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.050> good<00:04:17.290> level<00:04:17.530> here<00:04:17.980> for<00:04:18.190> this<00:04:18.340> one

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
would be a good level here for this one

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.630 
would be a good level here for this one
so<00:04:19.330> holding<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:19.930> in<00:04:20.110> place<00:04:20.320> then<00:04:21.040> just<00:04:21.070> with<00:04:21.610> a

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
so holding it in place then just with a

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.040 
so holding it in place then just with a
piece<00:04:21.940> of<00:04:22.180> twine<00:04:22.450> tie<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.210> trellis<00:04:25.780> or

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
piece of twine tie it to the trellis or

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.360 
piece of twine tie it to the trellis or
the<00:04:26.710> frame<00:04:27.390> like<00:04:28.390> so<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:31.740> then<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.950> can<00:04:33.130> put

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
the frame like so and then you can put

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.340 
the frame like so and then you can put
another<00:04:33.640> tie<00:04:34.000> in<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.360> middle<00:04:34.390> just<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.080> neaten

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
another tie in the middle just to neaten

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:43.830 
another tie in the middle just to neaten
it<00:04:35.650> up<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.100> keep<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:36.550> in<00:04:37.330> place<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:42.630> then<00:04:43.630> when

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
it up and keep it in place and then when

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.290 
it up and keep it in place and then when
you've<00:04:43.990> got<00:04:44.200> that<00:04:44.410> one<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:44.770> place<00:04:45.070> then<00:04:45.880> take<00:04:46.270> a

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
you've got that one in place then take a

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.080 
you've got that one in place then take a
look<00:04:46.600> at<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.900> other<00:04:47.200> stems<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:48.130> see<00:04:48.760> where

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
look at the other stems and see where

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.150 
look at the other stems and see where
they're<00:04:49.330> going<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.840> work<00:04:50.020> so<00:04:50.290> I<00:04:50.320> see<00:04:50.650> this<00:04:50.920> one

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
they're going to work so I see this one

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.610 
they're going to work so I see this one
here<00:04:51.580> is<00:04:51.760> going<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:52.690> be<00:04:52.810> pretty<00:04:53.080> low<00:04:53.380> on<00:04:53.410> the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
here is going to be pretty low on the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.950 
here is going to be pretty low on the
bush<00:04:53.890> so<00:04:54.160> I'm<00:04:54.430> going<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:54.940> try<00:04:55.180> to<00:04:55.210> get<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:55.750> as

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
bush so I'm going to try to get it as

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.680 
bush so I'm going to try to get it as
low<00:04:56.230> as<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.590> can<00:04:56.890> and<00:04:57.190> then<00:04:57.700> I'll<00:04:57.940> come<00:04:58.390> back<00:04:58.540> to

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
low as I can and then I'll come back to

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.060 
low as I can and then I'll come back to
you<00:04:58.780> in<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.900> minute<00:04:59.020> when<00:04:59.290> I<00:04:59.320> get<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.680> job<00:04:59.890> done

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
you in a minute when I get the job done

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.870 
you in a minute when I get the job done
so<00:05:00.510> as<00:05:01.510> you<00:05:01.660> see<00:05:01.900> I<00:05:02.140> have<00:05:02.230> no<00:05:02.650> built<00:05:03.070> a<00:05:03.400> series

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
so as you see I have no built a series

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.780 
so as you see I have no built a series
of<00:05:03.910> horizontal<00:05:04.420> layers<00:05:05.260> each<00:05:06.070> one<00:05:06.460> of<00:05:06.640> these

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
of horizontal layers each one of these

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.090 
of horizontal layers each one of these
will<00:05:07.180> no<00:05:07.360> produce<00:05:07.900> shoots<00:05:08.260> with<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.770> facial

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
will no produce shoots with a facial

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.240 
will no produce shoots with a facial
dominance<00:05:09.790> that<00:05:10.330> as<00:05:10.540> they<00:05:10.870> grew<00:05:11.170> up<00:05:11.380> each<00:05:11.860> of

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
dominance that as they grew up each of

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.670 
dominance that as they grew up each of
these<00:05:12.400> then<00:05:12.910> we'll<00:05:13.210> carry<00:05:13.510> flower<00:05:13.990> stems<00:05:14.440> and

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
these then we'll carry flower stems and

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.670 
these then we'll carry flower stems and
so<00:05:15.250> this<00:05:15.580> will<00:05:15.880> become<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.510> wall<00:05:17.140> of<00:05:17.380> flowers

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
so this will become a wall of flowers

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.460 
so this will become a wall of flowers
and<00:05:18.070> this<00:05:18.640> technique<00:05:19.180> will<00:05:19.510> work<00:05:19.810> on<00:05:20.080> a

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
and this technique will work on a

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.300 
and this technique will work on a
trellis<00:05:20.950> on<00:05:21.280> a<00:05:21.340> fence<00:05:22.210> on<00:05:22.480> a<00:05:22.570> wall<00:05:23.290> on<00:05:23.590> an<00:05:23.920> arbor

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
trellis on a fence on a wall on an arbor

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.520 
trellis on a fence on a wall on an arbor
