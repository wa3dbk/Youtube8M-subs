00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.430
 as a guru 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.989
 a brown 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:10.089
 berlin 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.089
 ben 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.979
 if we want 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:39.930
 copy 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.090
 our audio recordings made 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.090
 the way to do it is very simple 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.780
 for this then it does not happen that we want copies on our computer 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.160
 if we are connected to the internet 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.920
 automatically if it will not be added 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.600
 the group 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 the title of the tracks 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.690
 and the name of the album 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.860
 we have previously created a playlist 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.650
 with the name of the group 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.840
 and we are going to select 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.840
 all the tracks 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.710
 and when dragging them to the playlist 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 the cedÃ© 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 start copying 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.790
 the viewer 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790
 we will see the information of the track that is being imported 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.430
 and the speed 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.760
 on the track 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.860
 we will see a symbol 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.530
 orange waves 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.530
 that shows us which of these clues is the one that is being imported 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.100
 if we go to the playlist 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.560
 we will see 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.610
 that the first clue 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.610
 is about to be completed 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.919
 we already have the first 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.069
 and so it will continue to matter 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.459
 the rest of the songs 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.339
 all those tracks imported correctly will be marked 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:26.769
 with an icon 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.709
 in green 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 the time will depend on the team 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.019
 the speed of our team 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.909
 i like you say 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.909
 ceesi been a little bit scratched we have it 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.819
 we have it a bit damaged in the tracks will take a long time to copy 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:51.699
 If the cb is in good condition on this machine it is 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.529
 a little bit powerful the process will be done quickly
