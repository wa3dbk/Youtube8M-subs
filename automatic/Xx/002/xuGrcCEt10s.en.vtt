00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
and it was a little bit tricky because

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.300 
and it was a little bit tricky because
you<00:04:19.079> want<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.380> make<00:04:19.530> sure<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.130> don't

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
you want to make sure that you don't

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.490 
you want to make sure that you don't
have<00:04:20.430> any<00:04:20.579> holes<00:04:20.910> in<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.480> meat<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:24.140> think<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.350> got

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
have any holes in the meat I think I got

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.300 
have any holes in the meat I think I got
to<00:04:25.620> do<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.890> other<00:04:25.920> way

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.210 

push<00:04:29.310> instead<00:04:29.670> of<00:04:29.790> pull<00:04:29.970> okay<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:32.280> we<00:04:32.370> all<00:04:32.490> see

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
you can do it it just takes a little bit

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:46.610 
you can do it it just takes a little bit
of<00:04:36.900> time<00:04:44.570> then<00:04:45.570> just<00:04:45.750> kind<00:04:45.930> of<00:04:45.990> squish<00:04:46.230> it<00:04:46.410> back

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620

all<00:05:19.750> right<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:23.260> way<00:05:23.410> I<00:05:23.710> met<00:05:24.370> that<00:05:24.550> must<00:05:24.820> be

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
all right that way I met that must be

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:36.080

hit<00:05:25.210> people<00:05:25.720> watching<00:05:26.170> me<00:05:26.350> I<00:05:26.560> can't<00:05:26.860> do<00:05:27.100> it<00:05:27.310> I

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.880 

don't<00:05:37.090> know<00:05:37.300> no<00:05:37.810> wouldn't<00:05:38.200> what's<00:05:38.350> this<00:05:38.530> part

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
don't know no wouldn't what's this part

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.800 
don't know no wouldn't what's this part
but<00:05:39.580> it's<00:05:39.730> gonna<00:05:39.850> taste<00:05:40.180> it

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
but it's gonna taste it

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.930 
but it's gonna taste it
I<00:05:40.840> think<00:05:41.800> I<00:05:41.890> did<00:05:42.070> that<00:05:42.100> at<00:05:42.340> home<00:05:42.490> I<00:05:42.700> don't<00:05:42.760> know

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
I think I did that at home I don't know

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.760 
I think I did that at home I don't know
why<00:05:43.060> I<00:05:43.090> didn't<00:05:43.810> I<00:05:43.960> guess<00:05:44.230> I<00:05:44.350> followed<00:05:44.680> the

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
why I didn't I guess I followed the

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:52.890 
why I didn't I guess I followed the
recipe<00:05:49.170> no<00:05:50.170> no<00:05:51.150> no<00:05:52.150> it's<00:05:52.300> harder<00:05:52.600> to<00:05:52.720> roll

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
recipe no no no it's harder to roll

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.570 
recipe no no no it's harder to roll
because<00:05:53.200> I<00:05:53.320> should<00:05:53.800> have<00:05:53.830> picked<00:05:54.010> up<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.340> foil

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
because I should have picked up the foil

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.250 
because I should have picked up the foil
whenever<00:05:55.120> you<00:05:55.270> roll<00:05:55.480> something<00:05:55.840> you<00:05:56.080> should

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
whenever you roll something you should

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.870 
whenever you roll something you should
pick<00:05:56.410> up<00:05:56.530> the<00:05:56.650> foil<00:05:56.830> and<00:05:56.980> I<00:05:57.100> didn't<00:05:57.370> do<00:05:57.460> that<00:05:57.640> I

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
pick up the foil and I didn't do that I

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.560 
pick up the foil and I didn't do that I
had<00:05:58.420> people<00:05:58.660> watching<00:05:58.960> me<00:06:00.630> okay<00:06:01.630> I<00:06:03.360> don't<00:06:04.360> know

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
had people watching me okay I don't know

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.690 
had people watching me okay I don't know
I<00:06:04.600> guess<00:06:04.870> I<00:06:05.020> didn't<00:06:05.560> put<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:05.770> I<00:06:06.040> guess<00:06:06.220> I<00:06:06.250> don't

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
I guess I didn't put the I guess I don't

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.130 
I guess I didn't put the I guess I don't
know<00:06:06.790> what<00:06:06.940> happened<00:06:07.270> with<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:07.480> salsa<00:06:07.720> I

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
know what happened with the salsa I

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.130 
know what happened with the salsa I
think<00:06:09.070> it's<00:06:09.190> going<00:06:09.310> to<00:06:09.340> be<00:06:09.430> better<00:06:09.640> inside

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
think it's going to be better inside

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.420 
think it's going to be better inside
actually<00:06:13.290> see<00:06:14.290> it's<00:06:14.470> one<00:06:14.620> of<00:06:14.740> those<00:06:14.830> things<00:06:15.220> I

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
actually see it's one of those things I

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.700
