gank in case you get counter gauge so
idea<00:03:25.079> here<00:03:25.349> is<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.470> land<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.980> small<00:03:26.340> circle<00:03:26.609> on

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
idea here is to land a small circle on

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.349 
idea here is to land a small circle on
whether<00:03:27.180> I'm<00:03:27.389> gonna<00:03:27.599> gank<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.489> then<00:03:29.489> has<00:03:30.120> it
