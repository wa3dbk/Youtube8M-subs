00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.270
 that is, the computer is turned off 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.520

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.019
 In general, I will show everything clearly and you 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.079
 see how it all works the main thing for you 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.679
 need in the bios settings and enable this 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.620
 an option 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.899
 that is, it is called inclusion 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.899
 turning off the computer on 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:56.199
 computer signature and express 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.640
 Well let's start here it is a program because 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.449
 century not 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.710
 online this is how it looks now 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:09.210
 show all remote remote enable 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.450
 computer here she wake me on lan 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.930
 turn on this program here it is here 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.300
 so it looks in general it spent departure 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.130
 scan fully enabled 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.340
 able to computer and you have it 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.010
 tune so do not need kung turn 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.110
 computer is important that your computer was 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.890
 whether connected by cable 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.360
 that is, by cable computer and mold 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.410
 you can turn on wifi 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.510
 let's say at night you turn on the computer 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.270
 you need in front of him some documents with 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.490
 computers and you don't want to go to another 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.430
 room and your computer is in 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.390
 another room you have a laptop for this 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.210
 we go into the program itself, so he at 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.210
 me aypishnik important that you write 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.890
 tie that is you can to the people and 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.200
 bind to the mac-address so that it generally 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.390
 reinforced concrete insisted on it my stove-set 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.819
 so as not changed and stove for 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.730
 dynamic and you could easily go into 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.970
 it very well here is to see here 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:22.150
 wake up the computer and be smart in it 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:28.910

 computer turned on here computer 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.280
 The main thing that he was connected 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.989
 to power that is if you with 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.989
 pull out sockets you cannot enter 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.420
 the computer turns on as we see here 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.560
 turned on 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.320
 let's say i turn off this computer

 all I'm completely chopping off this one 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.620
 computer and most importantly if you suddenly 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.739
 accidentally you turn off the computer that is 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.750

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.910
 the main thing that you yourself have completed this 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.950
 work so much so that he was twisted 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.900
 electrical networks 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:26.950
 let's say right now the matrix 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:31.880
 by what gets it off 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.019

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:06.900
 this figure and here is the recording device 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.500
 power is it that is the inclusion of a signature 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.870
