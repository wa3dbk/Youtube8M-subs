one point 0 release so a future update
could<00:00:49.370> easily<00:00:49.730> fix<00:00:49.940> this<00:00:50.059> issue<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:50.480> nothing

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
could easily fix this issue it's nothing

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.750 
could easily fix this issue it's nothing
to<00:00:50.899> be<00:00:51.020> over<00:00:51.620> critical<00:00:51.980> about<00:00:52.129> but<00:00:52.370> i<00:00:52.399> do<00:00:52.489> want

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
to be over critical about but i do want

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.970 
to be over critical about but i do want
