I'd<00:00:06.689> like<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.109> think<00:00:07.439> that<00:00:07.500> they<00:00:07.710> do<00:00:07.769> and<00:00:08.370> I

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
I'd like to think that they do and I

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.039 
I'd like to think that they do and I
guess<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.849> generally<00:00:09.389> do<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.600> mean<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.900> don't

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:10.049 
guess I generally do I mean I don't

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.709 
guess I generally do I mean I don't
think<00:00:10.349> farmers<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:11.639> stupid<00:00:12.360> i<00:00:12.450> think<00:00:12.629> they

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
think farmers are stupid i think they

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
think farmers are stupid i think they
want<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.139> sustain<00:00:13.530> their<00:00:13.980> livelihood<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.910> if

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
want to sustain their livelihood and if

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.630 
want to sustain their livelihood and if
they're<00:00:15.209> damaging<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:17.070> earth<00:00:17.220> or<00:00:17.490> their

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
they're damaging the earth or their

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.700 
they're damaging the earth or their
animals<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.330> it's<00:00:18.450> not<00:00:18.810> gonna<00:00:18.930> last<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.529> so

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
animals and it's not gonna last is it so

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.650 
animals and it's not gonna last is it so
do<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.669> farmers<00:00:21.029> care<00:00:21.270> about<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
do the farmers care about the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.630 
do the farmers care about the
environment<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.260> they'd<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.070> yeah

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
environment I think they'd have to yeah

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.130 
environment I think they'd have to yeah
without<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> healthy<00:00:24.269> environment<00:00:24.480> how<00:00:24.990> can

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
without a healthy environment how can

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.290 
without a healthy environment how can
they<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.410> their<00:00:25.679> their<00:00:26.490> hog<00:00:26.699> farms<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
they have their their hog farms and the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.679 
they have their their hog farms and the
other<00:00:27.420> thing<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:27.900> grow<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.140> probably

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
other thing is they grow up probably

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.240 
other thing is they grow up probably
they<00:00:30.689> want<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> be<00:00:31.080> around<00:00:31.289> forever<00:00:31.589> they<00:00:32.040> want

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
they want to be around forever they want

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.040 
they want to be around forever they want
to<00:00:32.339> be<00:00:32.460> able<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.820> use<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> natural<00:00:33.390> resource<00:00:33.900> I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
to be able to use the natural resource I

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.490 
to be able to use the natural resource I
would<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.850> almost<00:00:35.850> definitely<00:00:36.500> without

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
would think so almost definitely without

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.619 
would think so almost definitely without
the<00:00:37.650> environment<00:00:38.220> without<00:00:38.400> clean<00:00:38.879> water<00:00:38.909> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the environment without clean water and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.890 
the environment without clean water and
clean<00:00:39.690> land<00:00:40.140> without<00:00:40.970> without<00:00:41.970> controls<00:00:42.540> on

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
clean land without without controls on

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.259 
clean land without without controls on
on<00:00:43.290> their<00:00:43.530> ways<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.100> control<00:00:44.460> diseases<00:00:44.879> we

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
on their ways to control diseases we

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:51.920 
on their ways to control diseases we
wouldn't<00:00:45.540> have<00:00:45.629> healthy<00:00:45.960> food

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.390 

third<00:00:52.080> generation<00:00:52.110> pork<00:00:52.920> producer<00:00:53.280> in

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
third generation pork producer in

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.790 
third generation pork producer in
Minnesota<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.200> when<00:00:55.200> comes<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
Minnesota and when comes to the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.470 
Minnesota and when comes to the
environment<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.370> comes<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> clean<00:00:56.910> air<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
environment it comes to clean air and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.930 
environment it comes to clean air and
clean<00:00:57.540> water<00:00:58.280> when<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.370> comes<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> clean

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
clean water when it comes to the clean

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.540 
clean water when it comes to the clean
water<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.690> feel<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.620> an<00:01:01.770> excellent<00:01:02.130> job<00:01:02.280> of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
water I feel we do an excellent job of

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.510 
water I feel we do an excellent job of
protecting<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:03.810> environment<00:01:03.979> what<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
protecting the environment what we do is

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.150 
protecting the environment what we do is
utilize<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.450> resource<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.170> manure<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
utilize a resource of manure to

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.800 
utilize a resource of manure to
fertilize<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.700> coming<00:01:09.090> years<00:01:09.300> crop<00:01:09.570> ground

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
fertilize the coming years crop ground

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.700 
fertilize the coming years crop ground
and<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:11.190> use<00:01:12.110> starfire<00:01:13.110> receivers

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and so we use starfire receivers

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.490 
and so we use starfire receivers
satellite<00:01:14.160> receivers<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.850> use<00:01:15.180> radar<00:01:15.810> guns<00:01:16.229> we

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
satellite receivers we use radar guns we

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.680 
satellite receivers we use radar guns we
use<00:01:16.830> flow<00:01:17.670> meters<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.300> so<00:01:18.479> we're<00:01:18.660> very

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
use flow meters and so we're very

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.690 
use flow meters and so we're very
accurate<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.619> very<00:01:19.710> precise<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.430> where<00:01:20.550> we

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
accurate and very precise and where we

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.400 
accurate and very precise and where we
apply<00:01:20.940> that<00:01:21.150> men<00:01:21.330> are<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.660> so<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> feel<00:01:22.380> very

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
apply that men are and so I feel very

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.560 
apply that men are and so I feel very
comfortable<00:01:22.770> about<00:01:23.190> that<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.850> society<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
comfortable about that that society and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.540 
comfortable about that that society and
trusting<00:01:24.869> us<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.649> resource<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.399> we

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
trusting us with that resource that we

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.219 
trusting us with that resource that we
do<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.940> best<00:01:27.090> advantage<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.020> best

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
do the best advantage and best

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
do the best advantage and best
capabilities<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.340> when<00:01:30.149> it<00:01:30.240> comes

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
capabilities that we can when it comes

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.630 
capabilities that we can when it comes
to<00:01:30.509> clean<00:01:30.720> air<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.500> obviously<00:01:31.649> realize<00:01:32.310> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
to clean air we obviously realize that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.740 
to clean air we obviously realize that
there's<00:01:32.880> an<00:01:33.000> older<00:01:33.210> comes<00:01:33.390> from<00:01:33.570> livestock

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
there's an older comes from livestock

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.570 
there's an older comes from livestock
production<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.009> those<00:01:35.160> production

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
production and we do those production

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.389 
production and we do those production
practices<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.630> best<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.080> can<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.160> we

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
practices as best we can so that we

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.580 
practices as best we can so that we
minimize<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:39.180> by<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> practices<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.380> we

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
minimize that by the practices that we

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
minimize that by the practices that we
do<00:01:40.740> by<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.979> cleanliness<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.910> the
