tips<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.820> tricks<00:00:15.030> which<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:15.780> use<00:00:15.960> for

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
tips and tricks which you can use for

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.380 
tips and tricks which you can use for
building<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:17.279> let's<00:00:17.520> take<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> look<00:00:18.029> at<00:00:18.180> these

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
building so let's take a look at these

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.750 
building so let's take a look at these
rectangles<00:00:19.230> which<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.070> these<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.730> you

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
rectangles which one of these do you

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.380 
rectangles which one of these do you
like<00:00:20.910> best<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:22.850> this<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:24.119> or

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
like best is it this one this one or

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.759 
like best is it this one this one or
this<00:00:24.449> one

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
this one

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.029 
this one
let's<00:00:26.039> take<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> look<00:00:26.550> at<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:27.090> more<00:00:27.150> time<00:00:27.539> so

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
let's take a look at it one more time so

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.999 
let's take a look at it one more time so
one<00:00:29.039> two<00:00:29.609> or<00:00:29.880> three<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.679> number

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
one two or three if you like number

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.430 
one two or three if you like number
three<00:00:32.340> best<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> very<00:00:33.660> fine<00:00:33.960> taste<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
three best you have a very fine taste of

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.950 
three best you have a very fine taste of
rectangles<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.520> building<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.059> general<00:00:36.390> but

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
rectangles and building in general but

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.500 
rectangles and building in general but
why<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.700> you're<00:00:38.879> making<00:00:39.090> shapes

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
why is that so when you're making shapes

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.330 
why is that so when you're making shapes
it's<00:00:39.780> best<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.170> keep<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.500> golden<00:00:40.800> ratio<00:00:41.160> in

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
it's best to keep the golden ratio in

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.720 
it's best to keep the golden ratio in
mind<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.800> seen<00:00:44.070> as<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
mind but what is it it is seen as the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.639 
mind but what is it it is seen as the
perfect<00:00:44.969> ratio<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.020> defined<00:00:46.410> by<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
perfect ratio and is defined by the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.250 
perfect ratio and is defined by the
Fibonacci<00:00:47.460> sequence<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:48.149> you've<00:00:48.629> never<00:00:48.960> heard

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
Fibonacci sequence if you've never heard

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.229 
Fibonacci sequence if you've never heard
of<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.559> before<00:00:49.710> let's<00:00:50.489> take<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> look<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.090> these

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
of it before let's take a look at these

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.330 
of it before let's take a look at these
numbers<00:00:51.449> 1<00:00:52.410> 1<00:00:52.649> 2<00:00:53.160> 3<00:00:53.430> 5<00:00:54.239> 8<00:00:54.510> 13<00:00:54.629> 21<00:00:55.760> 33<00:00:57.289> 54<00:00:58.289> etc<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
numbers 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 33 54 etc is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.029 
numbers 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 33 54 etc is
there<00:01:00.120> anything<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.960> notice<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.859> these

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
there anything you can notice with these

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.329 
there anything you can notice with these
numbers<00:01:02.600> if<00:01:03.600> not<00:01:03.930> let<00:01:04.290> me<00:01:04.379> explain<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.129> if

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
numbers if not let me explain to you if

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.280 
numbers if not let me explain to you if
you<00:01:05.670> take<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.060> first<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.810> second<00:01:07.170> number

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you take the first and the second number

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.580 
you take the first and the second number
you<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.580> add<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.750> gives<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
you can add it and then it gives you the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.710 
you can add it and then it gives you the
third<00:01:10.830> number<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.970> case<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.420> would<00:01:12.689> be

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
third number so in this case it would be

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
third number so in this case it would be
1<00:01:13.260> plus<00:01:13.770> 1<00:01:14.040> which<00:01:14.250> would<00:01:14.880> equal<00:01:15.240> 2<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.590> on

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
1 plus 1 which would equal 2 and so on

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.749 
1 plus 1 which would equal 2 and so on
so<00:01:17.040> let's<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> next<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:17.970> 1<00:01:18.390> plus<00:01:18.780> 2<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.229> 3<00:01:19.759> 2

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
so let's do the next one 1 plus 2 is 3 2

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.859 
so let's do the next one 1 plus 2 is 3 2
plus<00:01:21.060> 3<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.450> 5<00:01:21.659> 3<00:01:22.409> plus<00:01:22.799> 5<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.340> 8<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
plus 3 is 5 3 plus 5 is 8 and so on and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
plus 3 is 5 3 plus 5 is 8 and so on and
that<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.500> what<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.070> want<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> keep<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.610> mind

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that is what you want to keep in mind

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.050 
that is what you want to keep in mind
when<00:01:27.119> building<00:01:27.330> shapes<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.100> great<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
when building shapes so a great way to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.719 
when building shapes so a great way to
get<00:01:30.390> dimensions<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.320> shape<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.549> take

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
get dimensions for a shape is to take

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
get dimensions for a shape is to take
two<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> these<00:01:33.270> numbers<00:01:33.659> next<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> each<00:01:34.170> other

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
two of these numbers next to each other

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.940 
two of these numbers next to each other
for<00:01:35.070> example<00:01:35.100> 5<00:01:36.000> PI<00:01:36.299> 8<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.710> one

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
for example 5 PI 8 which is this one

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.109 
for example 5 PI 8 which is this one
right<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:39.079> 13<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.350> 21<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.880> this

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
right here or 13 and 21 which is this

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.749 
right here or 13 and 21 which is this
one<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:43.110> makes<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.890> golden<00:01:44.549> rectangle

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
one and that makes a golden rectangle

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.620 
one and that makes a golden rectangle
which<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.840> regarded<00:01:46.049> as<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> most<00:01:47.250> appealing

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
which is regarded as the most appealing

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.389 
which is regarded as the most appealing
rectangle<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.110> keep<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:49.890> mind<00:01:50.009> when

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
rectangle so keep that in mind when

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.340 
rectangle so keep that in mind when
building<00:01:50.610> things<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.390> also<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.079> want<00:01:52.259> to
