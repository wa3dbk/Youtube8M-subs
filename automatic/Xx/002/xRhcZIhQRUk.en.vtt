00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello maeva so today we're going 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.880
 explain how they use the pacr 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.500
 we leave it to sew the garment ready to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.599
 sew the facts what is it you 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.660
 receive the leaves with the cut fabric 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.920
 either you receive the placement so 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.050
 what is an investment 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.260
 is a unit printing one 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.390
 note that the ranking is 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.670
 in a rectangle because the lee of the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.650
 wider paper so we'll already cut 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.869
 this rectangle you unfold your 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.329
 placement the particularity versus 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.610
 to the bosses is that he is in the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.700
 size you ordered 6 and 1 40 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.800
 and he is in the tissue leze in 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.920
 which one you ordered the kit you 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.140
 unfold your boss who will go on the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.239
 fabric here the fabric is in rolls you 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.129
 you will receive a bridge that will be the size 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.530
 job placement and 240 141 cm for 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.440
 this size 7 comfortable so you will receive 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.090
 a coupon that will be a little over 145 cm 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.579
 the first thing is that you go 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.010
 cut out the rectangle in which 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.560
 fits the boss you see this 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.860
 rectangle here that go back up until 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.750
 top 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.310
 so the boss is enrolled in this 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.530
 rectangle while cutting them out 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.530
 this excess paper that he serves you to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.420
 nothing is passed brilliantly this is not 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.240
 not the crazy city of switzerland is just 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.770
 remove the paper which placed him 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.950
 classification on the fabric and work in 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950
 city 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.030
 so here's our actors so there we 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.870
 cut out now positions our 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.820
 placement on the fabric so the fabric on 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.220
 saw how she positions her 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.160
 it's the actor and that's the width 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.710
 So the lèze then lèze wood Cobourne 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.600
 at the edge in this sense there so a 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.670
 position in the right wire it's up to 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.320
 to say we're just the rectangle on the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.229
 fabric rectangle as the placement 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.570
 come folded we can spend a very light 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.060
 iron shot on the folds so a 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:08.869
 little bit light without just pressing for 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:09.979
 straighten the line so we fit well 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.290
 his rectangle 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.510
 that's still the same distance 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.370
 Toulon which is also the same 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.190
 distance to the side so we start 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.560
 by putting some pins already on the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.830
 rectangle to fix it course that remains 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.600
 well in the fabric rectangle 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.130
 then we are not the rock of the pieces 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.470
 paper but for now it's 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.220
 just to keep the rectangle 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.220
 rectangles one inside the other 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.450
 there it will not move we are now the 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.400
 rectangle 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.749
 we will start with the tag is 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.090
 now unique pieces 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:54.530
 we will start with this leg or is 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:56.840
 not here we go in the placement we have the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.730
 sewing line on the screen we have everything 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.939
 that should be agreements relate to our 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.769
 fabric when we cut them out it takes 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.659
 do not hurt to portray more the fabric 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.919
 move his taxes lists left no 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.659
 a lot but you still have to 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:15.980
 maintain everywhere for that eight lens 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.419
 cantons cut goode right not leave 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.909
 too many lengths between the ehpad there 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.549
 either we make a first cut 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:26.829
 coarse then we will refine either siona 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.829
 the habit nor to live so that gives that 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.209
 and otherwise we can do because I 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.389
 believe that they have globally made a 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.060
 click like that will make you every room 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.949
 that plumb will come back tomorrow vital for 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.519
 that it's better when we lose because 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.030
 kappa beta on mans and sarthe 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.459
 and dormouse 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.259
 so we will cut in pro d2 so if we 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.849
 has adjustments to make for the 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:58.370
 hip for the length etc 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.709
 it takes the boss marketing before 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.180
 cut out of course so we have legs 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.280
 very long we want to add a 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.419
 centimeter it takes power so we have 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.759
 do our first leg of pants 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.530
 now we will put some 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:11.299
 pins to block before cutting 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.250
 the other leg to compete a little south 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.930
 here we are careful that it does not 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.000
 do not move under you put some steps 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.039
 to block everything that we start to 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.090
 pin it down so that's the second leg 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.219
 pants 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.990
 so we check that the fabric and that did not 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:26.360
 not move so you first put some 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.550
 ehpad the corner at the tip 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.080
 and then in the middle by putting 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.789
 not bad there in the parties that are a 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.400
 little bit at an angle we cut everything 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:36.400
 overall my brother is a plus 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.250
 so that's the last of my 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.580
 legs 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.689
 we will have less belt or 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.740
 meaning so for the future is really 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.509
 they have a lot of pinned 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.580
 so there you have to really put a lot 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.080
 a lot because this belt she 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.659
 is not there if we start to see the 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.430
 fabric that is going right that will be 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.530
 left towards your your belt 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.020
 result will never be right pulled for that 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.479
 that's fine parallel to the tissues and 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.789
 you put spoken to you here and so 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.620
 you put on both sides a top and 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.389
 at the bottom of the belt in the line of 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.879
 culture we put a lot of pinned to 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.129
 every 10 cm and on each side it can 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.719
 to be in staggered stare so oddo is 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.819
 now we will be able to cut his 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.680
 belt and then it will be easy to 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.840
 cut and right that when we have all our 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.150
 pieces that are roughly cut and 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.370
 we will now cut precisely 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.500
 so there we had the rectangle in 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.419
 which fits the belt and there 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.949
 now the couple to belt so we 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.949
 can get on the edge it's easier 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.259
 it takes a little time but it relaxes 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.240
 so we put the pins close to the 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.969
 edge a maximum end of the edge in 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.089
 the interval between the cutting line and 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:52.639
 the sewing line so close to the 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:54.680
 edge so if we pay ourselves near the edge that 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.099
 built well there should not be any 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.099
 problem 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.909
 here he goes so everything is cut off he has 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.249
 you have reported the whole screen we are going 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.389
 able to remove the boss's pieces and 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:20.259
 start editing 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.259
 see you soon
