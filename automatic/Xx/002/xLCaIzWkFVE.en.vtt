has gotten progressively easier over

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.619 
has gotten progressively easier over
time<00:00:54.110> like<00:00:55.110> consider<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:56.629> runescape

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
time like consider you know runescape

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.860 
time like consider you know runescape
classic<00:00:58.039> you<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.070> back<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.399> 2001<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.270> 2002

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
classic you know back in 2001 and 2002

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.139 
classic you know back in 2001 and 2002
it<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.500> super<00:01:01.980> super<00:01:02.129> hard<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.760> had<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.940> do

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it was super super hard you had to do

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.690 
it was super super hard you had to do
multiple<00:01:03.600> clicking<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.920> mine<00:01:05.189> I've<00:01:05.460> heard

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
multiple clicking and to mine I've heard

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
multiple clicking and to mine I've heard
that<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> had<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.299> click<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.630> 13<00:01:07.229> times<00:01:07.530> or

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that you had to click like 13 times or

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.859 
that you had to click like 13 times or
something<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.310> mine<00:01:08.460> once<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.000> mean<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.720> might

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
something to mine once I mean that might

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.899 
something to mine once I mean that might
be<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.310> exaggeration<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
be a little exaggeration but that's I

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.399 
be a little exaggeration but that's I
mean<00:01:12.299> that's<00:01:12.360> probably<00:01:12.659> pretty<00:01:13.020> close<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
mean that's probably pretty close to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
mean that's probably pretty close to
what<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.100> now<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:15.000> click<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
what it was and now you just click the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.539 
what it was and now you just click the
rock<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.900> you're<00:01:16.170> fine<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.590> mean<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.430> really

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
rock and you're fine I mean that really

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.980 
rock and you're fine I mean that really
isn't<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.000> bad<00:01:18.119> thing<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:18.869> think

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
isn't a bad thing if you really think

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.300 
isn't a bad thing if you really think
about<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.470> mean<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.830> made<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> game

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
about it I mean it just made the game

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.620 
about it I mean it just made the game
more<00:01:20.600> easy<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.810> use<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.500> not<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.460> annoying<00:01:23.820> but

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
more easy to use and not as annoying but

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.969 
more easy to use and not as annoying but
there<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.170> there's<00:01:25.500> sometimes

there is you know there's sometimes
you're<00:01:26.820> annoyed<00:01:27.060> about<00:01:27.210> runescape<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.990> do

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you're annoyed about runescape and do

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
that could I mean that could be right I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.930 
that could I mean that could be right I
mean<00:02:43.080> that's<00:02:43.260> fine<00:02:43.440> but<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.220> mean<00:02:44.610> there<00:02:44.820> is

mean that's fine but I mean there is

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.930 
mean that's fine but I mean there is
some<00:02:45.360> reasons<00:02:45.750> why<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.140> easier<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
some reasons why it's easier and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.820 
some reasons why it's easier and
honestly<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.120> isn't<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.870> much<00:02:49.170> easier<00:02:49.590> in

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
honestly it isn't that much easier in

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.400 
honestly it isn't that much easier in
terms<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.520> AAK<00:02:50.910> afk<00:02:51.270> skills<00:02:51.750> yes<00:02:51.960> it's<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.290> lot

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
terms of AAK afk skills yes it's a lot

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.140 
terms of AAK afk skills yes it's a lot
easier<00:02:52.590> there's<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.010> lot<00:02:53.160> more<00:02:53.280> afk<00:02:53.640> skills<00:02:53.940> I

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
easier there's a lot more afk skills I

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.260 
easier there's a lot more afk skills I
mean<00:02:54.690> they<00:02:55.020> made<00:02:55.200> runecrafting<00:02:55.940> afk<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:56.970> I've

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
mean they made runecrafting afk and I've

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.090 
mean they made runecrafting afk and I've
heard<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.630> they<00:02:57.780> might<00:02:58.080> be<00:02:58.290> making<00:02:58.470> agility

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
heard that they might be making agility

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.560 
heard that they might be making agility
more<00:02:59.370> afk<00:02:59.820> than<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> already<00:03:00.270> is

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
more afk than it already is

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.500 
more afk than it already is
even<00:03:01.410> though<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.800> really<00:03:02.250> isn't<00:03:02.550> at<00:03:02.820> all<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.450> I

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
even though it really isn't at all so I

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.980 
even though it really isn't at all so I
said<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.020> but<00:03:05.000> combat<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.210> mean<00:03:06.450> actually

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
said that but combat I mean actually

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.170 
said that but combat I mean actually
didn't<00:03:07.500> get<00:03:07.620> more<00:03:07.770> afk<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:08.700> better<00:03:08.940> to

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
didn't get more afk it's it's better to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.780 
didn't get more afk it's it's better to
actually<00:03:09.390> pay<00:03:09.930> attention<00:03:09.960> so<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.460> kind

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
actually pay attention so that is kind

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.080 
actually pay attention so that is kind
of<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:12.000> misstep<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.780> their<00:03:13.400> accusation<00:03:14.400> but

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
of a misstep in their accusation but

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.030 
of a misstep in their accusation but
yeah<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.360> new<00:03:15.480> skill<00:03:15.750> definitely<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.620> pretty

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
yeah the new skill definitely is pretty

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.100 
yeah the new skill definitely is pretty
much<00:03:17.250> afk<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.790> mean<00:03:18.090> it's<00:03:18.240> kind<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.450> half<00:03:18.630> afk

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
much afk I mean it's kind of half afk

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.380 
much afk I mean it's kind of half afk
but<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:19.740> still<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.850> leave<00:03:21.120> for<00:03:21.330> a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
but it's still you can just leave for a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.460 
but it's still you can just leave for a
few<00:03:21.510> minutes<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:21.930> you'll<00:03:22.080> still<00:03:22.350> be

like<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.560> skills<00:03:31.860> in<00:03:32.010> general<00:03:32.190> have<00:03:32.550> gotten

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
like the skills in general have gotten

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.300 
like the skills in general have gotten
easier<00:03:33.240> to<00:03:33.390> Train<00:03:33.660> there's<00:03:34.140> more<00:03:34.350> methods<00:03:34.770> but

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
easier to Train there's more methods but

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.110 
easier to Train there's more methods but
what's<00:03:35.520> bad<00:03:35.670> about<00:03:35.700> that

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
what's bad about that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.880 
what's bad about that
I<00:03:36.240> mean<00:03:36.420> think<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.690> oh<00:03:36.810> seven<00:03:37.170> when<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.590> have

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
I mean think of oh seven when you have

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.610 
I mean think of oh seven when you have
to<00:03:38.010> do<00:03:38.130> mining<00:03:38.730> back<00:03:39.300> then<00:03:39.630> or<00:03:39.870> whatever<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
to do mining back then or whatever the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.350 
to do mining back then or whatever the
highest<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:41.040> really<00:03:41.280> can<00:03:41.400> do<00:03:41.520> is<00:03:41.640> grant<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.180> in

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
highest you really can do is grant it in

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.080 
highest you really can do is grant it in
terms<00:03:42.810> of<00:03:43.020> XP<00:03:43.320> per<00:03:43.500> hour<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.920> an<00:03:44.520> hour<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:44.940> you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
terms of XP per hour and an hour so you

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.670 
terms of XP per hour and an hour so you
have<00:03:45.270> you<00:03:45.840> know<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.020> have<00:03:46.080> living<00:03:46.410> Rock

master it with the abilities that's why

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.339 
master it with the abilities that's why
I<00:04:29.250> kind<00:04:29.430> of<00:04:29.520> like<00:04:29.669> it<00:04:29.699> but<00:04:30.030> yeah<00:04:30.990> but<00:04:31.169> that's

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
why I don't really see how the game has

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.499 
why I don't really see how the game has
gotten<00:04:33.629> easier<00:04:33.930> in<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:35.039> aspect<00:04:35.699> but<00:04:36.030> yes<00:04:36.240> in

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
gotten easier in that aspect but yes in

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.469 
gotten easier in that aspect but yes in
scaling<00:04:37.139> obviously<00:04:37.710> it's<00:04:37.860> been<00:04:38.479> supercharged

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
scaling obviously it's been supercharged

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.600 
scaling obviously it's been supercharged
really<00:04:39.810> fast<00:04:40.020> in<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.919> lot<00:04:41.069> of<00:04:41.099> skills<00:04:41.370> I<00:04:41.460> mean

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
really fast in a lot of skills I mean

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.429 
really fast in a lot of skills I mean
look<00:04:41.759> it's<00:04:41.909> layered<00:04:42.210> just<00:04:42.659> for<00:04:42.810> example<00:04:43.259> it's

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:43.439 
look it's layered just for example it's

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.830 
look it's layered just for example it's
like<00:04:43.469> 100k<00:04:44.039> an<00:04:44.129> hour<00:04:44.250> like<00:04:44.879> almost<00:04:45.270> constant

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
like 100k an hour like almost constant

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.110 
like 100k an hour like almost constant
now<00:04:45.960> and<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.800> used<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.009> be<00:04:47.099> 30k<00:04:47.550> an<00:04:47.669> hour<00:04:47.789> like

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
now and it used to be 30k an hour like

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.010 
now and it used to be 30k an hour like
pretty<00:04:48.810> decent<00:04:49.229> speed<00:04:49.439> so<00:04:49.710> yeah<00:04:50.669> max<00:04:51.150> maxing

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
pretty decent speed so yeah max maxing

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.749 
pretty decent speed so yeah max maxing
is<00:04:52.139> a<00:04:52.169> lot<00:04:52.439> more<00:04:52.620> private<00:04:52.889> elevant<00:04:53.610> now

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
is a lot more private elevant now

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.450 
is a lot more private elevant now
