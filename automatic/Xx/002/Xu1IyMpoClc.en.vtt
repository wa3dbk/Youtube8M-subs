kind<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.870> differently<00:04:34.290> even<00:04:34.500> though<00:04:34.710> it's<00:04:34.860> the

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
kind of differently even though it's the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.550 
kind of differently even though it's the
same<00:04:35.160> exact<00:04:35.520> size<00:04:35.960> but<00:04:36.960> maybe<00:04:37.140> just<00:04:37.470> because

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
same exact size but maybe just because

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.350 
same exact size but maybe just because
it's<00:04:37.830> not<00:04:37.950> broken<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.520> yet<00:04:38.700> but<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.060> really<00:04:39.120> like

to drink water before I go to practice

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.150 
to drink water before I go to practice
even<00:07:18.020> if<00:07:18.110> it's<00:07:18.260> like<00:07:18.410> in<00:07:18.560> the<00:07:18.680> car<00:07:18.890> there

even if it's like in the car there

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160 
even if it's like in the car there
because<00:07:19.580> I<00:07:19.820> don't<00:07:20.330> want<00:07:20.510> to<00:07:20.600> like<00:07:20.720> faint<00:07:20.990> or

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.170 
because I don't want to like faint or

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.590 
because I don't want to like faint or
something<00:07:21.200> when<00:07:22.100> I'm<00:07:22.280> at<00:07:22.640> practice<00:07:22.850> you<00:07:23.570> have
