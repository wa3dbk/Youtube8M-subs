00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.149 
than the other 2 i've had in this series
but<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.560> probably<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.100> a

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
but as you can see it probably was a

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.710 
but as you can see it probably was a
foul<00:01:47.490> should<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.119> been<00:01:48.210> doing<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.509> there

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
foul should have been doing that there

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.990 
foul should have been doing that there
but<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.320> definitely<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.920> red<00:01:50.159> we're

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
but it was definitely not red we're

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.480 
but it was definitely not red we're
going<00:01:51.149> half<00:01:51.420> time<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.960> I've<00:01:52.229> had<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> great

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
going half time and I've had a great

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.120 
going half time and I've had a great
tale<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.299> shot<00:01:54.630> he<00:01:55.140> has<00:01:55.290> had<00:01:55.439> nine<00:01:55.680> shots

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
tale of one shot he has had nine shots

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.149

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.399 
and possessions 5050 and his past
accuracy<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.759> better<00:02:00.030> than<00:02:00.180> mine<00:02:00.329> so

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
accuracy is better than mine so

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.130
