00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.019
 starters flourish after the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.590

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.730
 quinté quarté test relatively 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.109
 open like most quintés 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.969
 at this meeting deauvillais 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.500
 but we seem to have good points 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.700
 of support pulled out that should be 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.410
 relaxed again because as 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.020
 you can see it this Sunday at 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.399
 noon the showers are at the rendezvous 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020
 terra who had somehow to these people 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.820
 there could have noticed Saturday but if they 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.539
 back them by Tuesday we should have a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.940
 again having attracted 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.140
 probably flexible after you know what 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.710
 are new vehicles counted in 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.360
 your choice 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.430
 what this movement prefer him flank 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.309
 so first of all number 5 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.739
 is fine followed by cices prince ul the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.379
 mirror blue panis the two ladies in date 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.239
 number 4 paul deloy on the 8th request 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.780
 not to the number 9 angry and finally the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.670
 number 7 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.280
 john city then what I propose to you 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.720
 florence and detail 5th competitors 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.580
 among your selection will start with 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.170
 the number 5 which is filmed outside the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.640
 fact that it was necessary that tories in 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.380
 saddle he still has other arguments 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.729
 yeah it's a sack race it looked 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.439
 stays on two excellent outings at this 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.700
 level it was longchamp where he was taking 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.110
 a good third place last 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.100
 place in Chantilly where has long done 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.630
 illusion for victory in a 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.640
 neighborhood that can serve as a reference 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.170
 that day he was dominated the cases the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.670
 end by some blue panis he's going 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.869
 find but for panis had been able to spin 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.009
 in the straight line he came 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.750
 to assist him to finish but he 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.130
 beautifully defended thierry thulliez 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 can not be associated with him because he is 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.970
 restrained on a nicolas boarder 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 Clement and if we believe that ettore who 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.540
 will be associated with him certainly should 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.740
 adapt to this horse from their first 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.310
 association it looks like solid 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.439
 fulcrum 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.850
 you mentioned blue panis but just 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.920
 before we will mention the candidacy of the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.640
 number 6 prince ul the training or in 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.170
 great shape 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.340
 that's a fit training and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.600
 always formidable in the events 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.909
 they stay on the excellent exit on 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.439
 the sand as he discovered this 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.880
 surface he will be new equipped 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.399
 Blinkers for his return to the grass 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.320
 it's a confirmation so on the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.610
 line of your first film blue panis 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.170
 irreproachable since spring 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.129
 here he has aligned the good rankings 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.690
 he just found a fair 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.370
 compensation by carrying his notebook he has 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.930
 logically it has been penalized 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.440
 three and a half pounds but that should 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.640
 not prevent it 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.720
 again to very well defend himself his 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.250
 place and again at the finish 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.990
 okay now we're going to talk about two 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.400
 nominations that are a little bit 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.810
 speculative starting with number 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.830
 four flights of Loire is a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.240
 boarder in the bona that is 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.530
 confirmed on softened tracks he 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.550
 had blown hot and cold these 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.780
 last weeks but they stay on 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.030
 a very good fourth place on the 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.800
 sand he's no longer confirmed on the turf 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.390
 will be bobigny elsewhere as when 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.830
 his most recent exit to boarder 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.870
 of alain bonnave are in shape we could 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.250
 see from the beginning of the meeting and 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.090
 seems to have a very good chance 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.830
 regular for the places 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.000
 and then as we live a choice that does not 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.980
 will not be the one that everyone knows the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.900
 number 9 angry before explaining to us 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.840
 why this choice flourish will listen to his 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.940
 coach doumen doumen is the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.250
 field that requires me a little tight there 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.770
 had to run today on the test 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.600
 100 meters usual seen the ground I 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.190
 favorite push back hoping that does not 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 not deceive because anyway in this 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.990
 moment nobody foresees the ground of 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.860
 deauville 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.020
 it is rather a cata good I layer of 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.600
 2000 but you have foal missing a 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.640
 little bit of courage as much as before and 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.890
 to spend on 2000 may be 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.200
 over 1000 dominant in the race 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.610
 and then it keeps such a form that 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.080
 happened to him is that he had all the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.330
 woes of the world throughout 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.890
 season staying in shape 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.290
 impeccable and if it was not the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.770
 field this was the number to the rope 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.690
 or the jockey or finally after exchange 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.520
 so far but he stays himself 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.270
 he remains quite capable of being at 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.340
 the then enraged arrival that lengthen and 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.510
 we who will discover the 2000 meters 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.620
 is that part of the arguments 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.900
 who pleads in his favor 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.070
 down especially but it's a subject horse 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.510
 on what he calls it will take a 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.260
 good luck he especially won his 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.840
 handicap 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.830
 put varnish already on this racecourse of 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.330
 Deauville is straight it 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.160
 also has references of on 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.030
 plots with turning he blew the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.959
 hot and cold since the beginning of 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.459
 the year but it often has better for 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.380
 retain blackcurrant ranked 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.720
 now name first name 34 he inherited the 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.400
 number 3 the rope and I think that's 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.820
 a very funny outsider in this 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.320
 test 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.840
 here you have understood it must be 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.890
 be wary of number 9 rageur florange no 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.269
 thank you for this analysis 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.269
 thank you to Lille and good game to all 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.650
 we
