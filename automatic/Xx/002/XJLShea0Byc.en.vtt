like this is I mean it's a fantastic

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.609 
like this is I mean it's a fantastic
thing<00:00:28.920> because<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.400> not<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:30.720> not<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.260> not

do or how to behave it's just being
being<00:00:36.210> there<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> end<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.020> firm<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
being there in the end of the firm the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.720 
being there in the end of the firm the
danger<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.680> imagine<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.129> somehow<00:00:41.489> you'll

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
danger is to imagine that somehow you'll

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.900 
danger is to imagine that somehow you'll
ring<00:00:41.910> up<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.570> you'll<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.230> told<00:00:43.860> how<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> solve

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
ring up and you'll be told how to solve

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.910 
ring up and you'll be told how to solve
all<00:00:45.090> your<00:00:45.120> problems<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.140> think<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.860> very

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
all your problems and I think it's very

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.889 
all your problems and I think it's very
important<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.579> emphasize<00:00:47.940> that's<00:00:48.570> not<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
important to emphasize that's not the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.139 
important to emphasize that's not the
case<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.000> much

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
case because it's it's just as much

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.779 
case because it's it's just as much
service<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.890> families<00:00:53.370> who<00:00:53.670> are

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
service for for the families who are

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.160 
service for for the families who are
coming<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> terms<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.809> maybe<00:00:54.989> their

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
coming to terms with it maybe their

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.760 
coming to terms with it maybe their
children<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.620> come<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.370> or

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
children have just come out to them or

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.130 
children have just come out to them or
mothers<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:59.010> husbands<00:00:59.430> who<00:00:59.730> knows<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.809> entire

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
mothers or husbands who knows the entire

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.520 
mothers or husbands who knows the entire
spectrum<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.399> training<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.480> very<00:01:04.140> fairer

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
spectrum the training is is very fairer

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.530 
spectrum the training is is very fairer
and<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.460> makes<00:01:05.640> people<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.360> good

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and it makes people it's a good

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990 
and it makes people it's a good
listeners<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> end<00:01:08.250> we

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
listeners and and I think in the end we

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.130 
listeners and and I think in the end we
all<00:01:09.150> know<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.479> that's<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> most

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
all know that's that's the most

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
all know that's that's the most
important<00:01:10.650> thing<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.400> problem<00:01:11.939> shared<00:01:12.299> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
important thing that a problem shared is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.120 
important thing that a problem shared is
a<00:01:12.450> problem<00:01:12.510> halved<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.560> amazing<00:01:14.010> what<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
a problem halved and it's amazing what a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.469 
a problem halved and it's amazing what a
difference<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.670> makes<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.210> able<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
difference it makes just to be able to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.390 
difference it makes just to be able to
offload<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> complete<00:01:17.220> stranger

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
offload it on to a complete stranger

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.020 
offload it on to a complete stranger
actually<00:01:18.090> much<00:01:18.360> easier<00:01:18.600> than<00:01:19.700> them<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
actually much easier than them to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.730 
actually much easier than them to
perhaps<00:01:21.390> an<00:01:21.570> intimate<00:01:21.960> friend<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.470> would<00:01:22.619> be

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
perhaps an intimate friend you would be

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.249 
perhaps an intimate friend you would be
a<00:01:22.770> bit<00:01:22.950> more<00:01:23.130> cautious<00:01:23.490> well<00:01:24.030> some<00:01:24.840> countries

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
a bit more cautious well some countries

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
a bit more cautious well some countries
which<00:01:25.409> were<00:01:25.950> once<00:01:26.189> quite<00:01:26.640> progressive<00:01:26.880> our

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
which were once quite progressive our

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.899 
which were once quite progressive our
back<00:01:28.259> pedaling<00:01:28.740> into<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> dark<00:01:29.340> ages<00:01:29.490> Russia

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
back pedaling into the dark ages Russia

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
back pedaling into the dark ages Russia
particularly<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> look<00:01:31.920> at<00:01:32.040> places

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
particularly and then you look at places

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.640 
particularly and then you look at places
like<00:01:32.430> Nigeria<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:33.900> Uganda<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
like Nigeria and there are Uganda and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.950 
like Nigeria and there are Uganda and
there's<00:01:35.340> anti-gay<00:01:36.000> legislation<00:01:36.150> just

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
there's anti-gay legislation just

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.050 
there's anti-gay legislation just
sliding<00:01:37.530> through<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> statute<00:01:38.220> book<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
sliding through the statute book so the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
sliding through the statute book so the
idea<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:40.049> could<00:01:40.200> take<00:01:40.259> someone<00:01:40.920> from

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
idea that you could take someone from

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.300 
idea that you could take someone from
Uganda<00:01:41.970> or<00:01:42.000> Nigeria<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.740> put<00:01:43.950> them<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
Uganda or Nigeria and put them on the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.910 
Uganda or Nigeria and put them on the
pride<00:01:44.549> march<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.329> they<00:01:46.320> would<00:01:46.500> discover

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
pride march and and they would discover

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.850 
pride march and and they would discover
that<00:01:47.189> no<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:48.090> judging<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.439> an

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
that no one was judging would be an

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.999 
that no one was judging would be an
amazing<00:01:50.549> wonderful<00:01:50.790> thing<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.590> able<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.799> do

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
amazing wonderful thing to be able to do

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.420 
amazing wonderful thing to be able to do
but<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.909> makes<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.390> very<00:01:55.350> aware<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.799> afar

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
but it makes you very aware of afar
