00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.360 

and<00:03:55.350> that's<00:03:55.530> what<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.709> was<00:03:55.800> when<00:03:56.040> someone

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
and that's what that was when someone

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.100 
and that's what that was when someone
doesn't<00:03:56.700> take<00:03:56.940> surrender<00:03:57.330> kills<00:03:57.540> gonna<00:03:57.870> shoot

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
and that would have worked as well bad

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.430 
and that would have worked as well bad
attempt<00:04:05.480> that's<00:04:06.480> what<00:04:06.720> happens<00:04:07.020> when<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.230> run

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
the main thing you actually got in there

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.970 
the main thing you actually got in there
base<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.989> was<00:04:16.230> about<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.470> take<00:04:16.739> their

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
base and was about to take their

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.259 
base and was about to take their
reflective<00:04:17.940> jacket<00:04:18.720> their<00:04:18.930> objective<00:04:20.269> yeah

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
reflective jacket their objective yeah

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.210 
reflective jacket their objective yeah
flag<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.660> wet<00:04:21.840> there<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.860> go

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
flag is wet there you go

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.030 
flag is wet there you go
and<00:04:23.460> all<00:04:23.640> he<00:04:23.730> did<00:04:23.910> was<00:04:23.940> walk<00:04:24.240> down<00:04:24.540> and<00:04:25.040> they

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
and all he did was walk down and they

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.680 
and all he did was walk down and they
should<00:04:26.220> have<00:04:26.310> been<00:04:26.430> more<00:04:26.550> observant<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:27.210> shot

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
should have been more observant and shot

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.330 
should have been more observant and shot
the<00:04:27.810> guy<00:04:27.960> but<00:04:28.230> he<00:04:28.350> walked<00:04:28.530> straight<00:04:28.919> in<00:04:29.130> there

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
the guy but he walked straight in there

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.409 
the guy but he walked straight in there
so<00:04:29.669> it<00:04:29.760> works<00:04:31.640> where<00:04:32.640> he<00:04:32.700> was<00:04:32.850> also<00:04:33.150> saying

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
so it works where he was also saying

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.570 
so it works where he was also saying

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.940 
that walking with the gun by this side
shows<00:04:36.150> that<00:04:36.390> if<00:04:36.510> they're<00:04:36.690> play<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:36.930> doesn't<00:04:37.290> if
