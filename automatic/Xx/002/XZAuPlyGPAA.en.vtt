00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.920
 Curtain lift 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.280

 - Juan Antonio. - Hello. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.380
 What are you doing here, by the way? 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.860
 We are here to demand the expulsion of Israeli apartheid from FIFA, 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.320
 and any international competition. 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.240
 - Where are you from? - I come from the Czech Republic, I'm from Prague. 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.700
 I'm a fan of Chelsea and of course I support Chelsea, but I also support what you do. 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160
 - You are against apartheid, right? - Against apartheid, exactly. 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.180
 Chelsea fans are among the best activists. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.800
 Is there a movement against apartheid in your country? 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.380
 Yes, yes, but it is not as developed as in England. 

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.495
 We are "Football against apartheid", 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.840
 and we are trying to make the supporters unite against apartheid. 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.280
 - Hello. What's your name? - Mohamed. 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.660
 What do you think of what we are doing? 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.320
 - Do you think what we're doing is good? - Yes. 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.200
 Do you know what we are doing? We are trying to expel Israeli apartheid 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.580
 football, okay? - Yes? 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.575
 - Do you agree with that? - Yes. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.540
 I am among those rare American Jews who agree with you. 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.160
 The solution is a democratic state. All together, 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.180
 Neither an Israeli Jewish state nor a Muslim state. 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.475
 Absolutely. 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.740
 That's the only way, that's how it's going to be. 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.274
 Thank you. 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.800
 Let's stay together. We are united, so I am for people to be united. 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.280
 Israel, Palestine, should be united, we are all the same. 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.880
 Thank you so much. 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.340
 "Football against apartheid" wishes to thank all football fans 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.140
 who stopped to talk and wish us good luck in our project 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.740
 to expel Israel from FIFA 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.720
 as we expelled South Africa from apartheid in 1976 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.960
 thus marking the end of apartheid in South Africa.
