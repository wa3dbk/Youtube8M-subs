00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 in the cicca I hope you are super well 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.980
 I'm going to be talking about the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.220
 extensions that are using the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.190
 last three months and it's the company's 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.070
 british fashion and they sent me and 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.980
 They decided to collaborate with me. 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.869
 they are going to send some extensions and I 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.900
 I obviously accepted permission extensions and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.900
 I was looking for extensions for the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 hair I had told them in the video 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.240
 super fast I'm going to question the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.310
 bottom part on some extensions 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.449
 that I used and I was looking for 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.350
 had told this video that he was going to 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.000
 look for other extensions because I do not 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.020
 they liked the ones I had because they are 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.790
 using so nothing 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.410
 they contacted me and then 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.820
 I agreed to then be able to treat them and 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.990
 just talk to you because I know 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.690
 that many of you ask me questions 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.120
 related to my songs to what 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.440
 Use and receipts amount buttons 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.989
 questions all the time so then 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.750
 magnificent and they asked me this 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.100
 distension in July the reason why 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.739
 I just given because I was testing 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.750
 three months I was testing it and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.239
 I really like why that's why I'm 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.619
 making this video, no, they do not pay me 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.680
 or nothing, I'm just talking to you 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.250
 because the product is very good that way 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.340
 that nothing will start fast enough that 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.190
 with the extensions came in this 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.000
 box division 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.280
 valentine gÃ³mez fashion inside the box 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.920
 they came in this 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 in this plastic they have good turns 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.450
 tied and I love that because that 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.420
 have a good presentation ok then 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.680
 he also brings you the piece of paper with everything 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.450
 the description of the extensions that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.440
 you asked in mine the model is that 0 0 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.210
 2 2 2 the hair color is number 2 and 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.280
 is the texture is smooth and they were 22 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.950
 inches ok so keep that in mind 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.479
 my hair color go round and if not 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.070
 that the whole description is going to be 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.530
 bottom part with everything with the link 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.420
 direct with the direct link to the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.780
 decision is that I bought ok and now 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.390
 You can yourself 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.490
 you can leave that with this link that 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.620
 did he bring you 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.320
 it brings you four eclipses what it uses 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.230
 the back four clips two of 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.780
 they are four quarrelsome clips four 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.069
 rocks excuse me are four racks that 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.920
 are the ones that he used to the back 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.239
 ok two of them are four clicks but 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.510
 one of the pictures that you see that I think 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.510
 is this is half an inch longer than 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.040
 the other so one of the four 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.950
 eclipses longer than the other one that 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.340
 then two the other two remaining are 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.510
 from three clips ok to the back 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.510
 so it looks like that 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.690
 and I ask that pique by Miguelas 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.350
 If so, then it brings you four of a 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.330
 inch 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.980
 what are the ones that go to the sides that I 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.130
 I put two on one side and two on the other 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.130
 key 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.380
 although then the texture I have to 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.819
 say the texture is super charm the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.819
 texture of these extensions I have them 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.400
 past iron I have passed you from nothing 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.970
 because I hard my hair pretty 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.819
 and believe me, it's super super good 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.130
 quality I love for that hair 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.989
 natural that they sincerely saw for 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.340
 I've been told I have told people 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.810
 have extensions when I tell them that 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.730
 has functions can not believe it as 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.739
 that not sincerely, it looks good 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.330
 natural hair and it feels good natural 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.100
 I am using extensions for 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.200
 enough time as for in four years 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.489
 more or less use more off his voice 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.590
 white because they did not like all the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.760
 time to number I'm using because what 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.180
 that my hair grows because of me but 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.519
 it's around here but 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.540
 if I treated extensions and believe me 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:55.260
 they are very good 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.260
 ok I love them because then 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.630
 The shipping they sent shipments to all 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.100
 the world so its extensions are going to 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.100
 come in for sure 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.030
 to your destination to the destination that where 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:13.250
 So live to get there because they do 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.930
 shipping everywhere then then another 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.109
 thing I want to talk about the 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.500
 extensions are the clicks 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.870
 the clips are super as I do not know the way 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.729
 of the clips of them until 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.969
 you practically feel the extensions 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:31.840
 because I use the ones that I use 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:33.310
 used if the clips are metal and 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.699
 well feel the clips sometimes we 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.349
 they bother or sometimes they sting I do not know 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.650
 like it gives you stress sometimes because the 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.689
 teeth in the head but these I do not know is 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.900
 that do not feel shield are not metal 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:48.819
 they are like plastic is not a plastic is 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.729
 as fine metal but it is covered as 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:56.349
 of an ice something I do not know of super comfortable 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.330
 when you put it on it in your hair and not 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:01.449
 they leave ok there are not the attentions that 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.310
 see my hair is quite thin and do not go 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.500
 to leave because so I like that 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.779
 the descriptions that are very comfortable 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.460
 because in already if the 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.979
 arrests then have extensions 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:17.069
 are not comfortable but believe me 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.069
 these clips are super good I love them 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.169
 and what can I see are the extensions 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.380

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.680

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.780
 the quality has gone down and the amount of 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.870
 hair has also come down these are 125 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:08.050
