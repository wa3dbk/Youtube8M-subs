this<00:00:00.390> is<00:00:00.570> five<00:00:00.840> year<00:00:01.079> mark<00:00:01.230> what<00:00:01.469> do<00:00:01.530> you<00:00:01.620> want

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
this is five year mark what do you want

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.309 
this is five year mark what do you want
to<00:00:01.920> know<00:00:02.070> what<00:00:02.790> happened<00:00:03.240> at<00:00:03.360> ten<00:00:03.720> years<00:00:04.020> right

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
to know what happened at ten years right

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.740 
to know what happened at ten years right
yeah<00:00:05.279> well<00:00:05.640> that's<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.910> one<00:00:06.210> thing<00:00:06.480> that<00:00:06.629> we

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
yeah well that's the one thing that we

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.500 
yeah well that's the one thing that we
were<00:00:06.870> never<00:00:07.109> able<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.710> find<00:00:07.950> out<00:00:08.130> at<00:00:09.059> ten<00:00:09.269> years

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
time which isn't very long and you can

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.310 
time which isn't very long and you can
see<00:03:43.090> from<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:43.390> graph<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.690> there<00:03:43.989> was<00:03:44.110> no

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
see from this graph that there was no

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.960 
see from this graph that there was no

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
and the low PUFA diet in the incidence

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.509 
and the low PUFA diet in the incidence
of<00:03:49.060> heart<00:03:49.269> disease<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:50.709> we<00:03:50.920> look<00:03:51.190> at<00:03:51.370> the

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
of heart disease but if we look at the

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.340 
of heart disease but if we look at the
survival<00:03:51.940> curves<00:03:52.330> we<00:03:52.570> can<00:03:52.600> see<00:03:52.870> something<00:03:53.230> a

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
survival curves we can see something a

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.110 
survival curves we can see something a
little<00:03:53.380> bit<00:03:53.680> disturbing<00:03:54.220> on<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.760> left<00:03:54.970> you

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
little bit disturbing on the left you

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.759 
little bit disturbing on the left you
see<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.299> cardiovascular<00:03:56.140> disease<00:03:56.470> free

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
see the cardiovascular disease free

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.380 
see the cardiovascular disease free
survival<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.519> can<00:03:57.640> see<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:57.910> these<00:03:58.000> two

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
survival and you can see that these two

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.060 
survival and you can see that these two
lines<00:03:58.420> basically<00:03:58.989> mesh<00:03:59.440> with<00:03:59.620> one<00:03:59.799> another

there's<00:04:00.640> no<00:04:00.940> difference<00:04:01.390> corroborating<00:04:02.080> the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920

right you see there's no statistically
significant<00:04:06.610> difference<00:04:06.640> but<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:07.570> can<00:04:07.720> see

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
significant difference but you can see

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.720 
significant difference but you can see
that<00:04:08.080> after<00:04:08.230> about<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.739> year<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.190> half<00:04:09.400> when

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
that after about a year and a half when

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.009 
that after about a year and a half when
there's<00:04:09.910> a<00:04:09.970> substantial<00:04:10.630> number<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.930> people

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
there's a substantial number of people

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.660 
there's a substantial number of people
who<00:04:11.350> have<00:04:11.470> been<00:04:11.620> on<00:04:11.769> these<00:04:11.920> diets<00:04:12.220> for<00:04:12.610> at

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
who have been on these diets for at

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.940 
who have been on these diets for at
least<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.970> year<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.900> lines<00:04:14.140> do<00:04:14.470> begin<00:04:14.799> to

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
least a year the lines do begin to

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.789 
least a year the lines do begin to
emerge<00:04:15.910> from<00:04:16.209> one<00:04:16.359> another<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:17.470> can<00:04:17.620> see

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
emerge from one another and you can see

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.190 
emerge from one another and you can see
the<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.489> dotted<00:04:19.000> line<00:04:19.209> on<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.479> top<00:04:19.720> which<00:04:20.049> is

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
the the dotted line on the top which is

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.070 
the the dotted line on the top which is
the<00:04:20.350> saturated<00:04:20.859> fat<00:04:21.220> diet<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.570> PUFA<00:04:22.900> line

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
the saturated fat diet and the PUFA line

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.140 
the saturated fat diet and the PUFA line
on<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.289> bottom<00:04:23.710> which<00:04:24.220> is<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.550> solid<00:04:24.729> line

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
on the bottom which is the solid line

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.220 
on the bottom which is the solid line
and

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
and

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.080 
and
you<00:04:26.740> can<00:04:26.860> see<00:04:27.010> that<00:04:27.100> these<00:04:27.220> begin<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.790> diverge

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
you can see that these begin to diverge

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.060 
you can see that these begin to diverge
from<00:04:28.390> one<00:04:29.020> another<00:04:29.260> so<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.500> there<00:04:29.710> seems<00:04:29.980> to

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
from one another so that there seems to

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.650 
from one another so that there seems to
be<00:04:30.220> better<00:04:30.400> survival<00:04:31.090> among<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.390> people

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
be better survival among the people

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.140 
be better survival among the people
eating<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:32.050> saturated<00:04:32.560> fat<00:04:32.860> diet<00:04:33.130> now<00:04:33.940> this

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
eating the saturated fat diet now this

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.630 
eating the saturated fat diet now this
the<00:04:34.510> y-axis<00:04:35.170> starts<00:04:35.500> around<00:04:35.740> 80<00:04:36.070> or<00:04:36.340> 90

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
the y-axis starts around 80 or 90

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.950 
the y-axis starts around 80 or 90
percent<00:04:36.790> so<00:04:37.270> this<00:04:37.480> makes<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:37.810> look<00:04:37.840> like

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
percent so this makes it look like

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.750 
percent so this makes it look like
everyone's<00:04:38.470> dying<00:04:38.800> but<00:04:39.070> really<00:04:39.370> only<00:04:39.580> about

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
everyone's dying but really only about

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.690 
everyone's dying but really only about
20%<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:40.540> people<00:04:40.810> are<00:04:40.900> dying<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.980> keep<00:04:42.550> that

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
20% of the people are dying so keep that

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.910 
20% of the people are dying so keep that
in<00:04:42.760> mind<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:43.960> this<00:04:44.110> difference<00:04:44.470> is<00:04:44.710> pretty

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
in mind so this difference is pretty

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.100 
in mind so this difference is pretty
small<00:04:45.280> but<00:04:45.520> it<00:04:45.610> makes<00:04:45.790> us<00:04:45.970> wonder<00:04:46.180> what<00:04:46.420> would

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
small but it makes us wonder what would

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.690 
small but it makes us wonder what would
have<00:04:47.200> happened<00:04:47.620> if<00:04:47.740> these<00:04:47.950> people<00:04:48.220> were<00:04:48.490> on

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
have happened if these people were on

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.760 
have happened if these people were on
this<00:04:48.850> diet<00:04:49.120> for<00:04:49.510> two<00:04:49.540> years<00:04:50.050> three<00:04:50.290> years<00:04:50.320> four

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
this diet for two years three years four

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.560 
this diet for two years three years four
years<00:04:50.800> five<00:04:51.040> years<00:04:51.220> six<00:04:51.610> years<00:04:51.700> and<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.150> on<00:04:52.210> and

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
years five years six years and so on and

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.180 
years five years six years and so on and
we're<00:04:53.110> never<00:04:53.350> going<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.590> know<00:04:53.680> that<00:04:53.800> in<00:04:54.070> this

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
we're never going to know that in this

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.760 
we're never going to know that in this
study<00:04:54.460> but<00:04:55.030> we<00:04:55.120> can<00:04:55.270> get<00:04:55.390> an<00:04:55.510> inkling<00:04:55.960> of<00:04:56.290> what

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
study but we can get an inkling of what

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.230 
study but we can get an inkling of what
may<00:04:57.010> have<00:04:57.220> happened<00:04:57.250> by<00:04:57.730> looking<00:04:58.060> at<00:04:58.150> the

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
may have happened by looking at the

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.490 
may have happened by looking at the
results<00:04:58.390> of<00:04:58.810> Yelle<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.140> Veterans

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500

results of Yelle a Veterans
Administration<00:04:59.640> Hospital<00:05:00.640> study<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.150> this

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
Administration Hospital study and this

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.690 
Administration Hospital study and this
was<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.140> other<00:05:02.350> of<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.830> two<00:05:02.860> double-blind

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
was the other of the two double-blind

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.570 
was the other of the two double-blind
studies<00:05:04.180> and<00:05:04.840> it<00:05:05.230> is<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.890> longest<00:05:06.250> trial

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
studies and it is the longest trial

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.550 
studies and it is the longest trial
lasting<00:05:07.150> over<00:05:07.300> eight<00:05:07.570> years<00:05:07.900> with<00:05:08.170> most<00:05:08.410> of

the<00:05:08.650> subjects<00:05:09.040> being<00:05:09.190> followed<00:05:09.610> for<00:05:09.760> over<00:05:09.790> six

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
the subjects being followed for over six

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.270 
the subjects being followed for over six
years<00:05:10.240> this<00:05:10.840> is<00:05:10.990> very<00:05:11.230> informative<00:05:11.710> there's

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
years this is very informative there's

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.680 
years this is very informative there's
also<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.670> only<00:05:12.910> trial<00:05:13.150> where<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.390> mean<00:05:13.540> age

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
also the only trial where the mean age

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.020 
also the only trial where the mean age
was<00:05:13.720> over<00:05:14.080> 60<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:14.770> what<00:05:15.250> does<00:05:15.340> that<00:05:15.370> help<00:05:15.790> us

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
was over 60 and what does that help us

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.070 
was over 60 and what does that help us
look<00:05:16.810> at<00:05:17.070> what<00:05:18.070> disease<00:05:18.430> can<00:05:18.730> we<00:05:18.850> see<00:05:19.060> get<00:05:20.020> a

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
look at what disease can we see get a

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.680 
look at what disease can we see get a
better<00:05:20.260> better<00:05:20.800> idea<00:05:21.070> of<00:05:21.130> their<00:05:21.340> cancer<00:05:22.240> right

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
better better idea of their cancer right

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.990 
better better idea of their cancer right
so<00:05:23.230> this<00:05:23.350> is<00:05:23.410> especially<00:05:24.190> interesting<00:05:24.790> to

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
so this is especially interesting to

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.320 
so this is especially interesting to
study<00:05:25.450> cancer<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:27.340> design<00:05:27.700> was<00:05:27.970> they<00:05:28.180> took

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
study cancer the design was they took

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.140 
study cancer the design was they took
850<00:05:29.080> patients<00:05:29.590> randomly<00:05:30.340> allocated<00:05:30.760> them<00:05:30.940> to

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
850 patients randomly allocated them to

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.390 
850 patients randomly allocated them to
one<00:05:31.330> of<00:05:31.360> two<00:05:31.600> dining<00:05:31.930> halls<00:05:32.110> in<00:05:32.380> dining<00:05:33.100> hall<00:05:33.250> a

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
one of two dining halls in dining hall a

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.630 
one of two dining halls in dining hall a
they<00:05:34.090> ate<00:05:34.810> butter<00:05:35.230> and<00:05:35.560> other<00:05:35.890> animal<00:05:36.370> fats

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
they ate butter and other animal fats

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.270 
they ate butter and other animal fats
they<00:05:37.540> ate<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:37.870> small<00:05:38.320> amount<00:05:38.470> of<00:05:38.560> hydrogenated

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
they ate a small amount of hydrogenated

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.400 
they ate a small amount of hydrogenated
vegetable<00:05:39.460> oils<00:05:39.970> as<00:05:40.150> well<00:05:40.180> dining<00:05:41.080> hall<00:05:41.200> B

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
vegetable oils as well dining hall B

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.340 
vegetable oils as well dining hall B
they<00:05:41.620> had<00:05:41.770> one<00:05:42.010> egg<00:05:42.160> per<00:05:42.190> day<00:05:42.720> and<00:05:43.720> they<00:05:44.170> had<00:05:44.320> a

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
they had one egg per day and they had a

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.090 
they had one egg per day and they had a
mix<00:05:44.800> of<00:05:44.980> different<00:05:45.070> vegetable<00:05:45.730> oils<00:05:46.950> if<00:05:47.950> we

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
mix of different vegetable oils if we

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.920 
mix of different vegetable oils if we
take<00:05:48.250> a<00:05:48.280> superficial<00:05:48.940> analysis<00:05:49.570> of<00:05:49.810> this

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
take a superficial analysis of this

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.700 
take a superficial analysis of this
study<00:05:50.260> it<00:05:50.560> seems<00:05:51.190> that<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:52.690> vegetable<00:05:53.590> oil

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
study it seems that the vegetable oil

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.230 
study it seems that the vegetable oil
diet<00:05:53.980> reduced<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:54.730> risk<00:05:54.880> of<00:05:55.030> heart<00:05:55.210> disease

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
diet reduced the risk of heart disease

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.480 
diet reduced the risk of heart disease
but<00:05:55.900> increased<00:05:56.350> the<00:05:56.530> risk<00:05:56.710> of<00:05:56.860> other<00:05:57.070> diseases

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
but increased the risk of other diseases

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.850 
but increased the risk of other diseases
we're<00:05:58.330> going<00:05:58.450> to<00:05:58.540> criticize<00:05:58.990> that<00:05:59.260> finding<00:05:59.770> in

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
we're going to criticize that finding in

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.100 
we're going to criticize that finding in
a<00:05:59.920> couple<00:06:00.190> minutes<00:06:00.460> but<00:06:01.270> that<00:06:01.450> that<00:06:01.750> is<00:06:01.810> what

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
a couple minutes but that that is what

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.630 
a couple minutes but that that is what
appears<00:06:02.530> to<00:06:02.590> be<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.830> case<00:06:03.010> at<00:06:03.190> first<00:06:03.400> glance

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
appears to be the case at first glance

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.390 
appears to be the case at first glance
and<00:06:04.060> if<00:06:04.840> we<00:06:04.960> look<00:06:05.200> at<00:06:05.380> the<00:06:05.620> total<00:06:05.830> survival

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
and if we look at the total survival

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.340 
and if we look at the total survival
curve<00:06:06.670> we<00:06:07.210> can<00:06:07.240> see<00:06:07.720> that<00:06:08.020> they<00:06:08.170> basically

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
curve we can see that they basically

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.350 
curve we can see that they basically
line<00:06:08.920> up<00:06:09.100> with<00:06:09.250> one<00:06:09.400> another<00:06:09.640> there<00:06:10.180> is<00:06:10.330> a

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
line up with one another there is a

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.120 
line up with one another there is a
slight<00:06:10.720> divergence<00:06:11.320> that<00:06:11.500> seems<00:06:11.740> to<00:06:11.920> favor

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
slight divergence that seems to favor

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.190 
slight divergence that seems to favor
the<00:06:12.490> saturated<00:06:12.970> fat<00:06:13.300> group<00:06:13.570> at<00:06:13.810> the<00:06:13.930> end<00:06:14.050> of

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
the saturated fat group at the end of

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.500 
the saturated fat group at the end of
the<00:06:14.290> study<00:06:14.530> but<00:06:15.370> it<00:06:15.490> only<00:06:15.640> goes<00:06:15.970> on<00:06:16.210> for<00:06:16.420> about

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
the study but it only goes on for about

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.870 
the study but it only goes on for about
three<00:06:16.600> months<00:06:17.020> and<00:06:17.410> you<00:06:17.860> we<00:06:18.370> really<00:06:18.640> can't

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
three months and you we really can't

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.460 
three months and you we really can't
conclude<00:06:19.270> anything<00:06:19.630> without<00:06:19.720> seeing<00:06:20.170> a<00:06:20.230> study

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
conclude anything without seeing a study

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.140 
conclude anything without seeing a study
go<00:06:20.620> on<00:06:20.710> for<00:06:20.920> longer<00:06:21.100> but<00:06:21.700> we'll<00:06:21.820> come<00:06:21.970> back<00:06:22.000> to

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
go on for longer but we'll come back to

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.670 
go on for longer but we'll come back to
this<00:06:22.420> because<00:06:22.630> there<00:06:22.900> are<00:06:22.930> some<00:06:23.170> reasons<00:06:23.350> to

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
this because there are some reasons to

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.730 
this because there are some reasons to
wonder<00:06:23.950> about<00:06:24.040> it<00:06:24.510> but<00:06:25.510> we<00:06:25.960> have<00:06:26.080> to<00:06:26.110> wonder<00:06:26.560> so

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
wonder about it but we have to wonder so

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.230 
wonder about it but we have to wonder so
what<00:06:27.070> was<00:06:27.250> this<00:06:27.400> increase<00:06:27.850> in<00:06:28.030> non

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
what was this increase in non

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.630 
what was this increase in non
cardiovascular<00:06:29.170> mortality<00:06:29.350> well<00:06:30.250> if<00:06:30.340> we<00:06:30.460> look

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
cardiovascular mortality well if we look

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.310 
cardiovascular mortality well if we look
at<00:06:30.760> the<00:06:30.880> cancer<00:06:31.120> curve<00:06:31.510> we<00:06:31.720> can<00:06:31.750> see<00:06:32.020> that<00:06:32.140> for

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
at the cancer curve we can see that for

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.930 
at the cancer curve we can see that for
the<00:06:32.410> first<00:06:32.440> two<00:06:32.950> years<00:06:32.980> of<00:06:33.280> the<00:06:33.460> study<00:06:33.520> there

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
the first two years of the study there

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.180 
the first two years of the study there
was<00:06:34.030> no<00:06:34.090> difference<00:06:34.210> in<00:06:34.720> cancer<00:06:34.930> but<00:06:35.770> after

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
was no difference in cancer but after

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.610 
was no difference in cancer but after
that<00:06:36.340> -<00:06:36.940> -<00:06:37.090> in<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.510> two<00:06:37.720> to<00:06:37.870> five<00:06:38.080> year<00:06:38.350> range

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
that - - in the two to five year range

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.990 
that - - in the two to five year range
we

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
we

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.840 
we
to<00:06:39.240> see<00:06:39.420> the<00:06:40.080> lines<00:06:40.440> diverged<00:06:41.400> from<00:06:41.430> one

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
to see the lines diverged from one

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.130 
to see the lines diverged from one
another<00:06:42.090> so<00:06:42.150> if<00:06:42.390> there's<00:06:42.540> a<00:06:42.600> higher<00:06:42.840> incidence

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140 
another so if there's a higher incidence

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.530 
another so if there's a higher incidence
of<00:06:43.410> cancer<00:06:43.860> on<00:06:44.190> the<00:06:44.340> vegetable<00:06:44.850> oil<00:06:45.030> diet<00:06:45.240> and

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
of cancer on the vegetable oil diet and

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.080 
of cancer on the vegetable oil diet and
we<00:06:45.930> see<00:06:46.140> that<00:06:46.260> after<00:06:46.410> the<00:06:47.100> six<00:06:47.430> or<00:06:47.580> seven<00:06:47.910> year

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
we see that after the six or seven year

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.930 
we see that after the six or seven year
mark<00:06:48.360> this<00:06:48.840> difference<00:06:49.290> gets<00:06:49.560> much<00:06:49.800> larger<00:06:50.370> so

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
mark this difference gets much larger so

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.060 
mark this difference gets much larger so
that's<00:06:51.090> very<00:06:51.360> concerning<00:06:52.260> because<00:06:52.470> this<00:06:52.920> is

to get cancer and this provides some

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.950 
to get cancer and this provides some
pretty<00:06:59.940> strong<00:07:00.240> evidence<00:07:00.270> that<00:07:00.840> they<00:07:00.930> might

pretty strong evidence that they might

pretty strong evidence that they might

cause cancer but if we cancer was only

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.800 
cause cancer but if we cancer was only
about<00:07:05.160> half<00:07:05.490> of<00:07:05.730> the<00:07:05.880> non<00:07:06.030> cardiovascular

about half of the non cardiovascular
