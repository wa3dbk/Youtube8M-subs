00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.460
 that are well be days evenings or evenings 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.970
 whatever they are 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.160
 and today I'm going to show you in this video 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:19.180
 how to download and install 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.210
 This game is called Richard Ambou de o 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.590
 something like that the truth is I'm not bilingual and 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.590
 now this we are going to 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.930
 this page and today I'm going to leave the link in 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.390
 the description of the video and they give you where 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.570
 says to download torrents once it's 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.310
 I have downloaded them 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.270
 what will they do? 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.710
 is to give right click and they give to open and 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.489
 they wait for it to be released now obviously 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.489
 with the author 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.820
 if you are missing one of the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.640
 programs that you see during the video this 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.790
 go through the channel or the page and there 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.079
 they go to watch the videos and says that I already 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.300
 I have here is 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.450
 this lasted me around 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.000
 an hour here says that 4 because I'm 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.460
 sharing to be downloaded more 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.229
 quick and I'll leave it for a while 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.420
 well now what they are going to do is that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.430
 when they already miss the parts and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.980
 to go is to go where the parties left 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.620
 in my case it's here we open it 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.520
 and we are going to have several files we give 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.930
 to the first file rar extract from here and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.410
 we are going to start extracting what 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.410
 it would be him 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.180
 the file did 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.280
 I get this because I have it 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.540
 here is I'm going to give you cancel 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.610
 you let it be extracted 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.900
 completely 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.470
 once we are going to mount it with our 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.470
 heap 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.180
 well once they have already been opened 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.330
 of the world give you right click 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.610
 virtual devices and add you 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.180
 a unit if they do not have one if 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.080
 they have a bad age they choose it and in 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.770
 mount image and look for where your 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.770
 image 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.840
 in my case, this iso image is the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.810
 desktop games folder 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.870
 and here is going to be the folder of the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.290
 raid and the file that we're going to do 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.060
 is to give it where it says open but first 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.030
 select and open 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.010
 and we wait for that world 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.220
 well once I make them get out of 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.410
 senama give you here to run you and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.410
 wait for the installer to open 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.700
 well once it is already that way they select 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.770
 their language and they accept and wait for 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.820
 that the installer opens them what they are going 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.860
 to do is here next next 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.370
 next and they give it install and it's going to 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.760
 be installing what would be the game 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:09.420
 short this I am going to return when 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.620
 Little is missing to tell them what else to do 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:17.180
 well once it is almost finished 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:22.030
 this that left us ours and know 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.030
 more we wait another little while more 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.070
 once here already if they have if they have already 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.770
 installed some game that is not direct 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.050
 x no longer give you here to install 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.020
 but if his first game then they give him there 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.800
 obviously and they give it to finish and 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.890
 They wait for them 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.890
 install upload x now go to team 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.140
 well and then they go where they are 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.900
 unity and here is going to be this crisis cairo 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.610
 key and here they are going to have all these 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.459
 files will do is click 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.990
 right copy and now they go where is 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:15.580
 the game in my case is on disk equipment 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.269
 local files of the program 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.259
 Y 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.200
 namco bandai games we open it there goes to 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.180
 be the game folder 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.400
 and here we are going to paste what would be the 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.130
 crack of the game to make it work and 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.139
 be a more updated version that 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.289
 would be the 1.2 something like that 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.439
 and it is already 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:44.399
 Look, I wanted to make a gameplay 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:47.580
 but when I wanted to record it, it closed 

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:50.460
 the program with which he recorded 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.300
 and I closed the game the computer was 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.310
 It made me dumb 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.260
 and then I will not be able to do them in the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:02.110
 gameplay so this was all for today
