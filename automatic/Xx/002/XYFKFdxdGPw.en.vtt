that boy he plugged in not saved he's
plugged<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:14.219> think<00:00:14.820> there<00:00:14.969> needs<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.269> be<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
plugged in I think there needs to be a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.720 
plugged in I think there needs to be a
balance<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.109> think<00:00:16.350> there<00:00:16.500> there<00:00:16.830> has<00:00:17.160> been<00:00:17.460> and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
balance I think there there has been and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.779 
balance I think there there has been and
there<00:00:17.789> can<00:00:18.090> be<00:00:18.359> but<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.810> think<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.500> whole

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
there can be but I think the whole

there can be but I think the whole
prosperity<00:00:20.789> thing<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:22.050> know<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.590> if

true does God want us to be good in our
career<00:02:19.410> well<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.820> answer<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> guess<00:02:21.390> would<00:02:21.510> be

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
career well the answer I guess would be

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.630 
career well the answer I guess would be
no<00:02:21.690> if<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.650> had<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.890> answer<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.160> yes<00:02:23.280> or<00:02:23.430> no<00:02:23.490> I'd

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
no if I had to answer it yes or no I'd

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.550 
no if I had to answer it yes or no I'd
say<00:02:23.820> no<00:02:24.000> what<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.840> know<00:02:24.930> what<00:02:25.020> God<00:02:25.170> wants<00:02:25.470> us

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
say no what you know what God wants us

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.520 
say no what you know what God wants us
to<00:02:25.590> do<00:02:25.770> be<00:02:26.670> salt<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.390> light<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.810> our<00:02:28.140> career

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
to do be salt and light in our career

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.130 
to do be salt and light in our career
that's<00:02:28.860> what<00:02:29.070> God<00:02:29.250> wants<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.780> think

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
that's what God wants that that I think

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.170 
that's what God wants that that I think
that's<00:02:31.290> more<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> emphasis<00:02:32.130> not<00:02:32.550> climbing

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
that's more of the emphasis not climbing

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.390 
that's more of the emphasis not climbing
the<00:02:33.330> ladder<00:02:33.600> that's<00:02:34.320> irrelevant<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:35.040> God<00:02:35.220> God

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the ladder that's irrelevant to God God

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.580 
the ladder that's irrelevant to God God
isn't<00:02:35.580> knocked<00:02:35.910> out<00:02:36.120> by<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.630> God<00:02:37.440> is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
isn't knocked out by that God is

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.020 
isn't knocked out by that God is
impressed<00:02:38.010> when<00:02:38.190> we<00:02:38.220> go<00:02:38.490> into<00:02:38.790> the

is don't get me wrong I might poopoo in
any<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:50.580> stuff<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:51.780> that's<00:02:51.930> that's<00:02:52.320> not

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
any of that stuff but that's that's not

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.520 
any of that stuff but that's that's not
the<00:02:52.710> primary<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:54.420> primary<00:02:54.990> is<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.320> we<00:02:55.410> are

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the primary the primary is that we are

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.030 
the primary the primary is that we are
godly<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.250> Christ<00:02:56.850> Jesus<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.140> he<00:02:58.350> can<00:02:58.890> be

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
godly in Christ Jesus so that he can be

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.460 
godly in Christ Jesus so that he can be
glorified<00:02:59.460> it's<00:03:00.360> simply<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> different

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
glorified it's simply a different

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.190 
glorified it's simply a different
emphasis<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:03.090> think<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.510> approach<00:03:03.870> here's

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
emphasis and I think the approach here's

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.750 
emphasis and I think the approach here's
the<00:03:04.350> here's<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.680> difference<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.280> think<00:03:05.310> an

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the here's the difference I think an

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.890 
the here's the difference I think an
approach<00:03:07.040> this<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.280> what<00:03:08.460> I<00:03:08.490> think<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.210> here's

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
approach this is what I think and here's

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.880 
approach this is what I think and here's
a<00:03:09.960> verse<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.380> support<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:11.720> versus<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:13.710> is

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
a verse to support it versus this is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.010 
a verse to support it versus this is
what<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.220> Bible<00:03:14.610> says<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.570> how<00:03:15.870> it

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
what the Bible says and this is how it

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.840 
what the Bible says and this is how it
