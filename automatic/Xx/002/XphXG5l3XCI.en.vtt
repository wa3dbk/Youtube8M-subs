00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
on an edge and see if it works it might

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.030 
on an edge and see if it works it might
not<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.350> might<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> don't<00:01:29.070> know<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.299> go
