00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.320
 some good tips for saving a 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.269
 rather than redeeming a new 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.099
 backpack for school why 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.960
 finally do not customize that of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.720
 last year to have a unique bag 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.920
 this is the idea of ophelia lens this is the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.420
 blogger montpelliÃ©raine who we 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.029
 joined the most of a turn in his box 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.189
 at morning seam to refresh the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.470
 binder it's going to be to apply to 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.260
 baths by sticking a shape that we're going 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.390
 precut in a magazine in the ain 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.610
 books and convinces applied on the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.680
 schoolbag for example we can take a 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.870
 samurai shadow for example for a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.180
 boy a fairy for a little girl 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.620
 after that can be something like 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.629
 a tree in whatever kind it takes 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.239
 double-sided fusible so little by little 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.910
 close to 50 cm it will also need fabric 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.590
 similar of the order of 50 cm one can 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.390
 take silver fabric for example 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.719
 for the boys have bloomed for the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.449
 girls 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.239
 and finally to finish we could 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.850
 buy a goal tube Haiti is a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.150
 kind of glue tube so we go 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.740
 use to actually write on the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.810
 schoolbag all we want when she 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.640
 is going to stay so that's glittering in 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 Relief is exactly that is 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.909
 in all leisure stores 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.400
 creative as scene place next where 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.650
 will first cut out the topic that one 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.250
 will have to postpone 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.040
 dough sheet 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.110
 then we will pin this shape on 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.810
 the fabric we will cut the fabric to the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.299
 chosen form we will fix the term 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.950
 settlers on the back of Sichuan and we're going 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.079
 so remove a little film on 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.250
 fusible we go collectys u on it 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.100
 and we will go back 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.200
 then the shape will be attached to the adhesive 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.850
 fusible we will remove the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.380
 film on the other side I 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.229
 fusible since they were included 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.270
 hunting and there we will put the form on the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.920
 schoolbag and we'll go back to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.350
 glass and in law by protecting 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.299
 I imagine with a cloth since we are 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.439
 on a bag not that kind of bag at 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.150
 general is still basins 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.800
 hearing 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.320
 small and everything and does not matter too much 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.510
 lodge protect with a cloth or paper 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.580
 greaseproof for example it works very 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.180
 okay so the form will be set at 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.970
 backpack 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.280
 you have to choose beforehand 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.450
 place where we will apply the end I was 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.210
 once it is attached to fix the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.940
 to finish we can write each 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.010
 side a world where everything is flat broke ODIMO 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.050
 the favorite music group that these 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.000
 games the choice is vast will find 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.010
 other cities and on the blog of one 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.630
 redone says laurence the sewing workshop 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.230
 vintage before getting used to it 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.230
 still
