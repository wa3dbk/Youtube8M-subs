like little gaps or anything so I'm

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.460 
like little gaps or anything so I'm
sitting<00:04:10.780> at<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.080> end<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.560> my<00:04:11.770> right<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:13.470> kind

sitting at the end of my right so kind

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:44.260 
sitting at the end of my right so kind
of<00:04:15.660> go<00:04:16.660> through<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:18.720> dad

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.460 

and<00:04:45.270> this<00:04:45.480> is<00:04:45.630> another<00:04:45.840> reason<00:04:45.960> for<00:04:46.230> doing

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
and this is another reason for doing

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.700 
and this is another reason for doing
this<00:04:46.620> is<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.040> it<00:04:47.280> doesn't<00:04:47.460> look<00:04:48.170> flat<00:04:49.170> in

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
this is so that it doesn't look flat in

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.420 
this is so that it doesn't look flat in
the<00:04:50.160> back<00:04:50.390> because<00:04:51.390> it's<00:04:51.570> not<00:04:51.630> like<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:52.430> you

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
the back because it's not like I you

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.940 
the back because it's not like I you
know<00:04:53.580> got<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.150> little<00:04:54.300> drier<00:04:54.720> or<00:04:55.110> anything<00:04:55.710> and
