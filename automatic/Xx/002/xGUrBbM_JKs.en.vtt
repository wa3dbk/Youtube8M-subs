00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.299 
create new models if you didn't know a
model<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.260> basically<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.710> file<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.250> you

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
model is basically a file that you

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
model is basically a file that you
create<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.850> your<00:00:41.879> transmitter<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.570> has<00:00:42.899> all

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200

of the settings for your aircraft so the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.670 
of the settings for your aircraft so the
first<00:00:45.570> thing<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
first thing that I'm going to do is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
first thing that I'm going to do is
scroll<00:00:47.100> down<00:00:47.370> until<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.760> find<00:00:48.030> an<00:00:48.120> empty<00:00:48.420> space

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
scroll down until I find an empty space

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.180 
scroll down until I find an empty space
and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.140> I'm<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> hit<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> write

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and then I'm going to hit the write

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.220 
and then I'm going to hit the write
d-pad<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.050> actually

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
d-pad and what that will do is actually

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.560 
d-pad and what that will do is actually
create<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> new<00:00:53.430> model<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.180> bring<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
create a new model and then bring it to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.810 
create a new model and then bring it to

of<00:01:20.040> stuff<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.610> learn<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> doesn't<00:01:21.390> really

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
of stuff to learn but it doesn't really

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
of stuff to learn but it doesn't really
matter<00:01:21.750> because<00:01:21.990> all<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.560> need<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> know

matter because all you need to know
about<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.060> mixer<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.350> mixer

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
about right now is the mixer the mixer

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800 
about right now is the mixer the mixer
in<00:01:25.830> its<00:01:25.979> most<00:01:26.159> basic<00:01:26.280> form<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.479> assigns

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
in its most basic form is what assigns

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
in its most basic form is what assigns
every<00:01:28.409> single<00:01:28.770> little<00:01:28.890> control<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
every single little control to a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.630 
every single little control to a
specific<00:01:30.720> channel<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.040> example<00:01:32.430> channel

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
specific channel so for example channel

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.310 
specific channel so for example channel
1<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.000> rudder<00:01:33.500> channel<00:01:34.500> 2<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.180> elevator

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
1 is rudder channel 2 is elevator

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.950 
1 is rudder channel 2 is elevator
channel<00:01:37.320> 3<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.920> LaRon<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.729> channel<00:01:39.390> 4<00:01:39.689> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
channel 3 is a LaRon and channel 4 is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
channel 3 is a LaRon and channel 4 is
throttle<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.280> wanted<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> could

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
throttle so if I wanted to I could

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.910 
throttle so if I wanted to I could
easily<00:01:42.030> change<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.049> throttle<00:01:43.439> could

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
easily change it so that throttle could

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.370 
easily change it so that throttle could
be<00:01:44.040> channel<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.729> or<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> LaRon<00:01:45.990> could<00:01:46.229> be

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
be channel one or a LaRon could be

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
be channel one or a LaRon could be
channel<00:01:46.860> two<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.340> could<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.820> whatever<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.180> want

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
channel two I could do whatever I want

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060 
channel two I could do whatever I want
here<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> mixer<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
here so that's what the mixer is

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.950 
here so that's what the mixer is
actually<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.570> look<00:01:51.750> closely

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
actually for so if you look closely

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.179 
actually for so if you look closely
there's<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> little<00:01:52.560> line<00:01:52.740> right<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
there's a little line right there and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.980 
there's a little line right there and
that<00:01:53.549> means<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.180> creating<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.570> new<00:01:54.689> mix

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that means that I'm creating a new mix

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
that means that I'm creating a new mix
if<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.920> highlighted<00:01:56.159> numbers<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
if you see highlighted numbers then that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.420 
if you see highlighted numbers then that
means<00:01:57.450> you're<00:01:57.630> editing<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> current<00:01:58.560> mix<00:01:58.799> so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
means you're editing the current mix so

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.740 
means you're editing the current mix so
what<00:01:59.549> I'm<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.790> do<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.119> scroll<00:02:00.390> down<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
what I'm going to do is scroll down to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.050 
what I'm going to do is scroll down to
channel<00:02:01.049> 5<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:02.159> press<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.670> select

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
channel 5 and then press the select

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.060 
channel 5 and then press the select
button<00:02:03.229> what<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.439> will<00:02:04.619> do<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.009> actually

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
button what that will do is actually

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.240 
button what that will do is actually
create<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.119> new<00:02:06.360> mix<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.950> set<00:02:08.220> up

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
create a new mix so that I can set up

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
create a new mix so that I can set up
one<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> positions<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.989> three

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
one of the positions on the three

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.380 
one of the positions on the three
position<00:02:10.709> switch<00:02:10.890> after<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.970> I'm<00:02:12.090> going<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
position switch after that I'm going to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
position switch after that I'm going to
scroll<00:02:12.810> down<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
scroll down to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.280 
scroll down to
it<00:02:13.470> says<00:02:13.740> switch<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.490> then<00:02:15.300> change<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.840> to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
it says switch and then change that to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.490 
it says switch and then change that to
ID<00:02:16.620> 0<00:02:17.250> ID<00:02:17.970> 0<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> name<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.260> first

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
ID 0 ID 0 is the name of the first

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.290 
ID 0 ID 0 is the name of the first
position<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.220> your<00:02:20.490> three<00:02:20.700> position<00:02:21.120> switch

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
position on your three position switch

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.690 
position on your three position switch
now<00:02:22.290> I'm<00:02:22.410> going<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.620> go<00:02:22.740> up<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.010> source<00:02:23.370> and

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
now I'm going to go up to source and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.310 
now I'm going to go up to source and
change<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.390> full

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
change that to full

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.620 
change that to full
now<00:02:26.010> what<00:02:26.190> fol<00:02:26.430> does<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.910> basically<00:02:27.120> instead

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
now what fol does is basically instead

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.510 
now what fol does is basically instead
of<00:02:27.690> taking<00:02:28.200> one<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.530> inputs<00:02:29.040> from<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
of taking one of the inputs from the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.330 
of taking one of the inputs from the
control<00:02:29.910> sticks<00:02:30.270> or<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.900> knobs<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.920> gets<00:02:32.130> its

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
control sticks or the knobs it gets its

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.340 
control sticks or the knobs it gets its
value<00:02:32.400> from<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.150> other<00:02:33.480> setting<00:02:34.050> called

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
value from this other setting called

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.960 
value from this other setting called
weight<00:02:34.710> I'll<00:02:35.100> go<00:02:35.310> over<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.610> little<00:02:35.760> bit

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
weight I'll go over that a little bit

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.580 
weight I'll go over that a little bit
more<00:02:36.150> later<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.780> now<00:02:36.870> we<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.050> need<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
more later but for now we just need to

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.440 
more later but for now we just need to
exit<00:02:38.070> out<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.310> here<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:38.850> we<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.240> set<00:02:39.420> up

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
exit out of here so that we can set up

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.060 
exit out of here so that we can set up
the<00:02:39.720> other<00:02:39.900> positions<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.860> three

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
the other positions on the three

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.680 
the other positions on the three
position<00:02:41.490> switch<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.360> now<00:02:42.450> we're<00:02:42.540> going<00:02:42.630> to

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
position switch so now we're going to

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.870 
position switch so now we're going to
add<00:02:42.870> another<00:02:42.990> mix<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:43.620> channel<00:02:43.950> 5<00:02:44.160> we're<00:02:44.850> going

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
add another mix on channel 5 we're going

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.920 
add another mix on channel 5 we're going
to<00:02:45.030> change<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.480> source<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:46.110> full<00:02:46.380> again<00:02:46.710> and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
to change the source to full again and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.780 
to change the source to full again and
then<00:02:48.930> we're<00:02:49.020> going<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.170> change<00:02:49.410> switch<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.490> ID

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
then we're going to change switch to ID

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.440 
then we're going to change switch to ID
1<00:02:51.560> then<00:02:52.560> we're<00:02:52.740> going<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.920> add<00:02:53.100> another<00:02:53.400> mix<00:02:54.120> on

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
1 then we're going to add another mix on

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.210 
1 then we're going to add another mix on
channel<00:02:54.960> 5<00:02:55.580> change<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.880> full<00:02:57.120> also<00:02:57.660> and

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
channel 5 change it to full also and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.420 
channel 5 change it to full also and
then<00:02:59.220> change<00:02:59.610> switch<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.720> ID<00:03:00.990> 2<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.250> now<00:03:02.370> we

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
then change switch to ID 2 so now we

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.220 
then change switch to ID 2 so now we
have<00:03:02.640> all<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:03.000> our<00:03:03.090> mixes<00:03:03.510> created<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.140> we<00:03:04.200> can

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
have all of our mixes created and we can

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.050 
have all of our mixes created and we can
move<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.830> giving<00:03:05.100> them<00:03:05.220> values<00:03:05.670> which<00:03:05.910> is

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
move on to giving them values which is

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.000 
move on to giving them values which is
what<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.360> weight<00:03:06.570> setting<00:03:06.960> is<00:03:07.050> for<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.830> for

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
what the weight setting is for so for

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.380 
what the weight setting is for so for
the<00:03:08.070> first<00:03:08.310> mix<00:03:08.640> I'm<00:03:08.880> going<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.090> set<00:03:09.270> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
the first mix I'm going to set the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.050 
the first mix I'm going to set the
weight<00:03:09.600> value<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.380> negative<00:03:10.640> 100<00:03:11.640> percent

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
weight value to a negative 100 percent

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.920 
weight value to a negative 100 percent
the<00:03:12.840> next<00:03:13.140> mix<00:03:13.350> should<00:03:13.590> be<00:03:13.710> set<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:13.980> 0<00:03:14.460> and<00:03:14.930> then

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
the next mix should be set to 0 and then

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.650 
the next mix should be set to 0 and then
the<00:03:16.140> final<00:03:16.560> mix<00:03:16.740> should<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.130> left<00:03:17.430> at<00:03:17.610> 100%<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
the final mix should be left at 100% and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.980 
the final mix should be left at 100% and
so<00:03:18.990> now<00:03:19.140> what<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.410> means<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:19.950> ID<00:03:20.400> 0<00:03:21.090> 1<00:03:21.690> &amp;

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
so now what this means is that ID 0 1 &amp;

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.790 
so now what this means is that ID 0 1 &amp;
2<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.070> values<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.970> negative<00:03:24.150> 100<00:03:24.870> 0<00:03:25.500> and

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
2 have the values of negative 100 0 and

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.130 
2 have the values of negative 100 0 and
100<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.330> make<00:03:27.510> sure<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:27.930> set<00:03:28.110> up

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
100 so to make sure that it's set up

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.540 
100 so to make sure that it's set up
correctly<00:03:28.590> I'm<00:03:28.770> going<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.950> exit<00:03:29.250> out<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.490> the

correctly I'm going to exit out of the

the home screen all you have to do is

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.620 
the home screen all you have to do is
move<00:03:46.920> up<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.250> down<00:03:47.430> using<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.910> d-pad<00:03:48.090> until

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
you find it the last thing that we're

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.040 
you find it the last thing that we're
going<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.640> do<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:50.970> go<00:03:51.150> back<00:03:51.360> into<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.750> mixer

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
going to do is go back into the mixer

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.530 
going to do is go back into the mixer
settings<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.709> add<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.920> new<00:03:53.130> mix<00:03:53.459> on<00:03:53.700> channel<00:03:54.209> 6

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
settings and add a new mix on channel 6

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.540 
settings and add a new mix on channel 6
and<00:03:55.290> then<00:03:55.830> we're<00:03:55.920> going<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.070> change<00:03:56.340> the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
and then we're going to change the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.550 
and then we're going to change the
source<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.209> P<00:03:57.450> 3<00:03:57.840> which<00:03:58.170> stands<00:03:58.470> for

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
source to P 3 which stands for

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.120 
source to P 3 which stands for
potentiometer<00:03:59.550> 3<00:04:00.260> for<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.410> mix<00:04:01.709> since<00:04:01.920> we're

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
potentiometer 3 for this mix since we're

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.890 
potentiometer 3 for this mix since we're
using<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.430> potentiometer<00:04:02.760> we<00:04:03.480> actually<00:04:03.810> don't

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
using a potentiometer we actually don't

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.570 
using a potentiometer we actually don't
have<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.170> touch<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.680> weight<00:04:04.890> or<00:04:05.130> switch

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
have to touch the weight or switch

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.880 
have to touch the weight or switch
setting<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:06.780> now<00:04:06.900> if<00:04:07.020> I<00:04:07.080> exit<00:04:07.440> back<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.800> the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
setting so now if I exit back to the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.710 
setting so now if I exit back to the
home<00:04:08.070> screen<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.640> then<00:04:08.760> move<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.209> knob<00:04:09.390> you

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.170 
home screen and then move the knob you
can<00:04:10.260> clearly<00:04:10.530> see<00:04:10.650> channel<00:04:11.250> 6<00:04:11.520> moving<00:04:12.000> just

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
can clearly see channel 6 moving just

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.240 
can clearly see channel 6 moving just
