hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.780
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.650
we're going to make another very popular cookies from India

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.939
that is Tutti fruity cookies so let's learn how to make these cookies.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.230
You know first we're going to take 100 grams of dry fruits

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.789
you know you mix and match, here I've got some cherry I've got some cashew nut and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.890
here is papaya candy fruit and kismis, kismis is the raisins you know

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.809
whatever variety you like just mix all of them together and they should be

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.390
around hundred grams, in this add 250
grams of flour, 50 grams of custard

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.640
powder and 15 grams of milk powder and in this add cardamom powder for

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.390
flavoring

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.980
you can add almost 10 grams of
cardamom powder and a pinch of baking

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.199
powder now mix all of this flour mixture
and keep it aside because we're going to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.699
add this and make our cookies

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.880
now take around 150 grams of butter,  in this add 150 grams of powdered sugar and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.790
also another important flavoring in
tutti frutti is pineapple essence you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.270
know

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.049
add a little bit of pineapple essence
this will give a very nice flavor to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.310
your cookies and then mix this to a
nice creamy texture. In this

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.000
add 1 tablespoon of water and then mix this,  this will act as a moisture if you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
want to add you can add the milk also now

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.850
the flour, dry fruits all the other flour mixture you add in this slowly

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.520
knead into a nice dough,  you know look at this

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.070
this dough is perfect. Take this dough and then we're going to sprinkle some flour

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.610
now just roll into even sheet because
we're going to cut these cookies in the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.329
square

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.979
first you know tap this dough in such a
way it becomes a nice rectangle then we

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.469
will be able to cut nice square cookies. Divide this into the sizes you want

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:11.459
just I think I can cut them into four
parts, just half and again one more like

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.900
this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.689
then and then once you mark it just cut them neatly same thing if you want you

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.200
can make bigger but i think this is
good enough for me

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.879
now this is perfect and now just cut
them into squares if you want to cut

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.730
smaller you can cut smaller good and
then run the palette knife underneath it so

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.590
that this gets separated now arrange them on a baking tray you know look at this

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.299
just arrange it usually what they do is
while rolling this sheet they put some

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.700
of the Tutti fruitty on top and roll it that way tutti fruitty will look more on the cookies

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.269
but this is pretty good when you bite
them when you see them they will be

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.340
lot of tutti fruitties, so let's bake them
at 180 degree centigrade for 15

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.900
minutes

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.060
Look at these cookies, the tutti frutti
cookies wow you know because there's a

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.709
lot of tutti frutti the dough itself
becomes nice fragile and literally put

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.389
in the mouth it melts huh

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.310
mm-hmm

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.480
and you know so many dry fruits - and
also wow this is literally melting and when

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.799
