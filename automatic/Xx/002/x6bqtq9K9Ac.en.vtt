00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
this list might be the better way to do

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
this list might be the better way to do
it<00:01:14.180> fifth<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.110> Del<00:01:16.290> Negro<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it fifth because of Del Negro with it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.460 
it fifth because of Del Negro with it
with<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> better<00:01:17.850> coach<00:01:18.240> I'd<00:01:18.570> put<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.200> next

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
with a better coach I'd put them next

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.460 
with a better coach I'd put them next
and<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> coach<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.390> hurts<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
and now a coach like this hurts and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.870 
and now a coach like this hurts and
that's<00:01:22.770> what's<00:01:23.009> interesting<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.610> lot<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that's what's interesting a lot of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.190 
that's what's interesting a lot of
people<00:01:24.119> think<00:01:24.330> there's<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.900> correlation

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
people think there's a correlation

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.969 
people think there's a correlation
between<00:01:25.850> let's<00:01:26.850> say<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.900> team<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.590> Team<00:01:28.799> B

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
between let's say if team a and Team B

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.280 
between let's say if team a and Team B
played<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> new<00:01:30.150> Troy<00:01:30.360> could<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.750> pick'em

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
played on a new Troy could be pick'em

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.249 
played on a new Troy could be pick'em
but<00:01:32.070> he<00:01:32.490> may<00:01:32.670> might<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.600> significantly

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
but he may might be a significantly

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.980 
but he may might be a significantly
better<00:01:34.320> chance<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.189> win<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.729> NBA<00:01:35.850> title<00:01:36.509> few

the<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.670> coach<00:02:22.000> limitation<00:02:22.930> affects<00:02:23.470> them

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
the the coach limitation affects them

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.960 
the the coach limitation affects them
more<00:02:23.800> in<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.950> playoffs<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.610> does<00:02:24.760> during

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
more in the playoffs and it does during

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.400 
more in the playoffs and it does during
the<00:02:25.060> regular<00:02:25.300> grave<00:02:25.540> one<00:02:25.780> hundred<00:02:26.050> percent<00:02:26.080> I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
the regular grave one hundred percent I

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.770 
the regular grave one hundred percent I
think<00:02:26.620> where<00:02:27.100> it's<00:02:27.250> real<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:28.120> more<00:02:28.420> intense

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
think where it's real it's more intense

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.540 
think where it's real it's more intense
and<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.110> think<00:02:29.320> coaching<00:02:29.830> comes<00:02:30.040> into<00:02:30.310> play

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
and I think coaching comes into play

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.400 
and I think coaching comes into play

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
the motivation they're playing at home

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.420 
the motivation they're playing at home
and<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> team<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:08.890> wins<00:03:09.130> eighty

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
and this is a team that wins eighty

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.100 
and this is a team that wins eighty
percent<00:03:09.670> of<00:03:09.910> our<00:03:10.030> home<00:03:10.210> games<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:10.930> they're<00:03:11.080> a

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
percent of our home games so they're a

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.650

good<00:03:11.410> home<00:03:11.620> team<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.130> begin<00:03:12.250> with<00:03:12.640> but<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.390> also

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
good home team to begin with but I also

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.330 
good home team to begin with but I also
think<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.710> plus<00:03:15.010> for<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
think it's a it's a plus for the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.070 
think it's a it's a plus for the
Clippers<00:03:15.700> because<00:03:16.060> being<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.510> prime-time<00:03:16.780> game
