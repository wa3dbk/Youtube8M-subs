00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800 

I<00:00:00.089> got<00:00:00.960> most<00:00:01.110> of<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.410> mice<00:00:01.589> out<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:02.010> it

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:07.810 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.190 

I<00:00:08.430> took<00:00:09.430> it<00:00:09.550> out<00:00:09.670> and<00:00:09.910> I<00:00:10.330> blew<00:00:10.570> a<00:00:10.600> lot<00:00:10.840> of<00:00:11.020> it<00:00:11.110> out

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
I took it out and I blew a lot of it out

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.049 
I took it out and I blew a lot of it out
with<00:00:11.380> the<00:00:11.530> compressor<00:00:12.010> the<00:00:12.730> only<00:00:12.910> thing

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
with the compressor the only thing

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.129 
with the compressor the only thing
that's<00:00:13.210> really<00:00:13.330> left<00:00:13.629> is<00:00:13.809> down<00:00:13.990> on<00:00:14.020> the

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
that's really left is down on the

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.080 
that's really left is down on the
cooling<00:00:14.469> fins<00:00:15.010> right<00:00:15.309> down<00:00:15.520> in<00:00:15.670> there<00:00:15.850> for<00:00:16.030> the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
cooling fins right down in there for the

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.180 
cooling fins right down in there for the
generator<00:00:16.539> you<00:00:17.320> can<00:00:17.500> see<00:00:17.650> there's<00:00:17.830> actually

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.190 
generator you can see there's actually

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.580 
generator you can see there's actually
one<00:00:18.670> Mouse<00:00:18.940> right<00:00:19.270> there<00:00:19.539> not<00:00:19.930> much<00:00:20.110> left<00:00:20.380> of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
one Mouse right there not much left of

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.580 
one Mouse right there not much left of
it<00:00:20.650> I<00:00:21.490> got<00:00:22.300> to<00:00:22.390> get<00:00:22.480> rid<00:00:22.630> of<00:00:22.690> all<00:00:22.869> that<00:00:22.900> stuff<00:00:23.289> in

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
it I got to get rid of all that stuff in

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.740 
it I got to get rid of all that stuff in
there<00:00:23.740> so<00:00:23.800> once<00:00:24.429> this<00:00:24.609> engine<00:00:25.029> spinning<00:00:25.359> over

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
there so once this engine spinning over

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.759 
there so once this engine spinning over
I'll<00:00:26.199> be<00:00:26.800> able<00:00:26.919> to<00:00:27.330> now<00:00:28.330> unfortunately<00:00:29.050> the

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
I'll be able to now unfortunately the

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.109 
I'll be able to now unfortunately the
other<00:00:29.919> day<00:00:30.130> when<00:00:30.310> I<00:00:30.339> was<00:00:30.460> going<00:00:30.669> through<00:00:30.910> this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
other day when I was going through this

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.880 
other day when I was going through this
I<00:00:31.179> pulled<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:31.960> spark<00:00:32.259> plugs<00:00:32.529> out<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:32.860> I

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
I pulled the spark plugs out and I

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.790 
I pulled the spark plugs out and I
looked<00:00:33.070> down<00:00:33.220> inside<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:34.500> both<00:00:35.500> of<00:00:35.530> these

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
looked down inside and both of these

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.460 
looked down inside and both of these
cylinders<00:00:36.130> were<00:00:36.490> full<00:00:36.790> of<00:00:36.940> water<00:00:36.970> and<00:00:37.510> I<00:00:38.380> know

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
cylinders were full of water and I know

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.140 
cylinders were full of water and I know
the<00:00:38.590> trailer<00:00:38.920> that<00:00:39.070> it<00:00:39.160> was<00:00:39.310> in<00:00:39.520> had<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:39.850> lot<00:00:40.030> of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
the trailer that it was in had a lot of

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.520 
the trailer that it was in had a lot of
moisture<00:00:40.300> in<00:00:40.600> it<00:00:40.780> all<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:40.990> time<00:00:41.200> on<00:00:41.410> the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
moisture in it all the time on the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.640 
moisture in it all the time on the
ceiling<00:00:41.950> so<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:43.210> think<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:43.960> was<00:00:44.050> in<00:00:44.170> there<00:00:44.350> for<00:00:44.620> a

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
ceiling so I think it was in there for a

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.950 
ceiling so I think it was in there for a
long<00:00:44.920> time<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:46.090> moisture<00:00:46.540> must<00:00:46.720> have<00:00:46.840> worked

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
long time and moisture must have worked

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.020 
long time and moisture must have worked
its<00:00:47.170> way<00:00:47.350> in<00:00:47.530> because<00:00:47.710> this<00:00:48.520> side<00:00:48.820> had<00:00:48.940> an

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
its way in because this side had an

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.140 
its way in because this side had an
exhaust<00:00:49.390> valve<00:00:49.660> open

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.290 

you<00:00:54.080> could<00:00:54.230> see<00:00:54.410> that<00:00:54.530> these<00:00:54.940> exhaust<00:00:55.940> out<00:00:56.180> the

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
you could see that these exhaust out the

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300 
you could see that these exhaust out the
sides<00:00:56.540> of<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.810> mufflers<00:00:57.200> unlike<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.130> ones

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
sides of the mufflers unlike the ones

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.310 
sides of the mufflers unlike the ones
that<00:00:58.430> are<00:00:58.490> usually<00:00:58.610> on<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:58.910> top<00:00:59.180> and<00:00:59.480> this

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
that are usually on the top and this

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.079 
that are usually on the top and this
side<00:01:00.530> had<00:01:00.680> an<00:01:00.800> intake<00:01:01.130> open

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.620 

so<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:04.989> must<00:01:05.140> go

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
so it must go

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.289 
so it must go
through<00:01:05.899> the<00:01:06.079> air<00:01:06.979> cleaner<00:01:07.310> somehow<00:01:07.820> because

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
through the air cleaner somehow because

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.420 
through the air cleaner somehow because
it's<00:01:08.450> an<00:01:08.570> oil<00:01:08.750> bath<00:01:08.990> but<00:01:09.320> moisture<00:01:09.860> does<00:01:10.189> get

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
it's an oil bath but moisture does get

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.359 
it's an oil bath but moisture does get
around<00:01:11.049> but<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.350> Pistons<00:01:12.979> were<00:01:13.100> only<00:01:13.189> about

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
around but the Pistons were only about

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.279 
around but the Pistons were only about
you<00:01:13.970> know<00:01:14.090> an<00:01:14.240> inch<00:01:14.420> about<00:01:14.689> that<00:01:14.899> far<00:01:15.140> down

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
you know an inch about that far down

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.380 
you know an inch about that far down
inside<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.829> cylinder<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:16.549> wasn't<00:01:16.789> too<00:01:16.970> bad

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
inside the cylinder so it wasn't too bad

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.179 
inside the cylinder so it wasn't too bad
cleaned<00:01:18.170> everything<00:01:18.409> out<00:01:18.679> it<00:01:18.860> cleaned<00:01:19.100> up

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
cleaned everything out it cleaned up

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.340 
cleaned everything out it cleaned up
fairly<00:01:19.520> nice<00:01:19.759> put<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.509> heads<00:01:20.659> back<00:01:20.899> on<00:01:21.140> and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
fairly nice put the heads back on and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.529 
fairly nice put the heads back on and
fill<00:01:21.530> them<00:01:21.679> with<00:01:21.710> ATF<00:01:22.579> and<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:23.149> little<00:01:23.360> bit<00:01:23.450> of

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
fill them with ATF and a little bit of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.010 
fill them with ATF and a little bit of
oil<00:01:24.729> now<00:01:25.729> I'm<00:01:25.880> back<00:01:26.060> here<00:01:26.329> with<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.659> Lincoln

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
oil now I'm back here with the Lincoln

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.800 
oil now I'm back here with the Lincoln
welded<00:01:27.350> generator<00:01:27.740> again<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.659> since<00:01:29.659> this

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
welded generator again and since this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.139 
welded generator again and since this
engine<00:01:30.200> had<00:01:30.350> water<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:30.979> heads<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:31.789> I

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
engine had water in the heads and I

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.969 
engine had water in the heads and I
wasn't<00:01:32.450> able<00:01:32.539> to<00:01:32.720> get<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.079> to<00:01:33.200> move<00:01:33.350> with<00:01:33.740> the

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
wasn't able to get it to move with the

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.340 
wasn't able to get it to move with the
pry<00:01:34.670> bar<00:01:34.909> setup<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:35.390> made<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.720> for<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.899> flywheel

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
pry bar setup I made it for the flywheel

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.929 
pry bar setup I made it for the flywheel
what<00:01:36.590> I'm<00:01:36.679> going<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.829> do<00:01:37.039> is<00:01:37.280> pull<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:37.640> engine

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
what I'm going to do is pull this engine

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.179 
what I'm going to do is pull this engine
off<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.599> generator<00:01:39.049> that<00:01:39.289> way<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.770> can<00:01:39.979> get<00:01:40.099> it

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
off the generator that way I can get it

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.620 
off the generator that way I can get it
up<00:01:40.280> on<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:40.490> bench<00:01:40.789> and<00:01:41.030> see<00:01:41.209> if<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.360> can<00:01:41.509> get

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
up on the bench and see if I can get

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.719 
up on the bench and see if I can get
everything<00:01:41.840> freed<00:01:42.319> up<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.399> what<00:01:43.520> I'm<00:01:43.580> going<00:01:43.670> to

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
everything freed up so what I'm going to

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.309 
everything freed up so what I'm going to
start<00:01:43.970> with<00:01:44.209> doing<00:01:44.569> is<00:01:44.689> we<00:01:44.810> have<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.020> pull<00:01:45.200> off

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
start with doing is we have to pull off

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.380 
start with doing is we have to pull off
this<00:01:45.500> panel<00:01:45.920> here<00:01:46.220> with<00:01:46.789> all<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.000> electrical

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
this panel here with all the electrical

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.240 
this panel here with all the electrical
stuff<00:01:47.659> on<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.140> get<00:01:48.259> these<00:01:48.409> wires<00:01:48.679> out<00:01:49.099> in

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
stuff on it and get these wires out in

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.219 
stuff on it and get these wires out in
the<00:01:49.340> fuel<00:01:49.580> line<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.000> then<00:01:50.720> we<00:01:50.810> have<00:01:50.929> a<00:01:50.959> bolt

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
the fuel line and then we have a bolt

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.649 
the fuel line and then we have a bolt
down<00:01:51.920> there<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.490> there's<00:01:53.060> one<00:01:53.209> in<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.390> middle

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
down there and there's one in the middle

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.990 
down there and there's one in the middle
so<00:01:54.229> there's<00:01:54.349> three<00:01:54.649> of<00:01:54.679> them<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:55.909> could

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
so there's three of them that it could

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.279 
so there's three of them that it could
pull<00:01:56.149> off<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.569> then<00:01:56.659> this<00:01:56.780> thing<00:01:56.990> will<00:01:57.110> be<00:01:57.140> out

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
pull off and then this thing will be out

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.699 
pull off and then this thing will be out
of<00:01:57.319> my<00:01:57.500> way<00:01:57.679> and<00:01:58.299> then<00:01:59.299> we<00:01:59.390> have<00:01:59.599> a<00:02:00.079> bolts<00:02:00.530> hole

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
of my way and then we have a bolts hole

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.279 
of my way and then we have a bolts hole
in<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.979> engine<00:02:01.220> on<00:02:01.479> which<00:02:02.479> I<00:02:02.750> believe<00:02:03.079> we're

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
in the engine on which I believe we're

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.479 
in the engine on which I believe we're
going<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.470> be<00:02:03.590> these<00:02:03.739> ones<00:02:03.799> here<00:02:04.310> there's

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:04.489 
going to be these ones here there's

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.219 
going to be these ones here there's
probably<00:02:04.610> four<00:02:05.119> of<00:02:05.149> them<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:05.569> this<00:02:05.689> housing

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
probably four of them so this housing

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.380 
probably four of them so this housing
here<00:02:07.009> with<00:02:07.220> all<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.459> fins<00:02:07.700> on<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:07.909> it's<00:02:08.239> going

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
here with all the fins on it it's going

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.779 
here with all the fins on it it's going
to<00:02:08.450> stay<00:02:08.720> on<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.259> engine<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.769> hopefully<00:02:10.700> if

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
to stay on the engine and hopefully if

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.270 
to stay on the engine and hopefully if
everything<00:02:11.180> works<00:02:11.390> out<00:02:11.630> nicely<00:02:12.130> it'll<00:02:13.130> all

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
everything works out nicely it'll all

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.610 
everything works out nicely it'll all
slip<00:02:13.579> apart<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.180> what<00:02:14.959> I'm<00:02:15.079> hoping<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.530> that

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
slip apart and what I'm hoping is that

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.400 
slip apart and what I'm hoping is that
the<00:02:15.890> shaft<00:02:16.160> comes<00:02:16.519> out<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.290> where<00:02:18.290> the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the shaft comes out of this where the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.099 
the shaft comes out of this where the
armature<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.040> I'd<00:02:20.030> rather<00:02:20.239> not<00:02:20.540> have<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.930> pull

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
armature is I'd rather not have to pull

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.620 
armature is I'd rather not have to pull
out<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.260> whole<00:02:21.560> generator<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.880> then<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.480> have

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
out the whole generator and then I have

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.059 
out the whole generator and then I have
to<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:24.019> know<00:02:24.139> redo<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.560> brushes<00:02:24.950> and

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
to you know redo the brushes and

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.160 
to you know redo the brushes and
everything<00:02:25.130> get<00:02:25.639> them<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.910> slide<00:02:26.299> back<00:02:26.569> in<00:02:26.870> but

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
everything get them to slide back in but

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.960 
everything get them to slide back in but
we'll<00:02:27.950> start<00:02:28.190> off<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.340> pulling<00:02:28.730> off<00:02:28.850> this

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
we'll start off with pulling off this

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.640 
we'll start off with pulling off this
panel<00:02:29.389> and<00:02:29.720> we<00:02:29.900> can<00:02:30.019> see<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.260> we<00:02:30.319> get<00:02:30.500> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
panel and we can see if we get the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:52.250 
panel and we can see if we get the
engine<00:02:30.920> loosened<00:02:31.310> up

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.440 

yeah<00:02:52.739> they're<00:02:52.980> still<00:02:53.099> off<00:02:53.400> they<00:02:53.940> just<00:02:54.180> flipped

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
yeah they're still off they just flipped

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.170 
yeah they're still off they just flipped
out<00:02:54.659> of<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.840> back<00:02:57.769> brushes<00:02:59.000> one<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.120> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
out of the back brushes one of the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.420 
out of the back brushes one of the
pressures<00:03:00.540> right

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
pressures right

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:14.820 
pressures right
these<00:03:02.430> are<00:03:02.580> radius<00:03:03.000> ready<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.390> go

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:59.180 

at<00:03:14.950> once

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.660 

that's<00:03:59.700> kind<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.000> go<00:04:00.260> yep<00:04:01.370> we<00:04:02.370> have<00:04:02.460> to<00:04:02.580> get

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
that's kind of go yep we have to get

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:36.109 
that's kind of go yep we have to get
something<00:04:03.030> underneath

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:36.119 

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:45.719

out on the bench - yeah clean that up
nice<00:04:48.809> check<00:04:49.809> the<00:04:49.960> bearing<00:04:50.169> pocket<00:04:50.919> that

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
nice check the bearing pocket that

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.879 
nice check the bearing pocket that
should<00:04:51.849> all<00:04:51.969> clean<00:04:52.240> up<00:04:52.360> Chris<00:04:52.629> all<00:04:53.289> out<00:04:53.619> real

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.870 

well<00:06:09.380> everything<00:06:09.920> came<00:06:10.100> apart<00:06:10.430> pretty<00:06:10.700> well

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
well everything came apart pretty well

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.840 
well everything came apart pretty well
today<00:06:11.090> the<00:06:12.050> engine<00:06:12.380> came<00:06:12.620> off<00:06:12.830> was<00:06:13.220> a<00:06:13.400> little

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
today the engine came off was a little

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.310 
today the engine came off was a little
tough<00:06:14.060> getting<00:06:14.330> the<00:06:14.480> armature<00:06:14.900> out<00:06:15.050> of<00:06:15.200> the

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
tough getting the armature out of the

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.530 
tough getting the armature out of the
inside<00:06:15.740> of<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:15.860> generator<00:06:16.310> but<00:06:16.610> slipped<00:06:17.360> out

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
inside of the generator but slipped out

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.290 
inside of the generator but slipped out
all<00:06:17.720> right<00:06:18.430> luckily<00:06:19.430> all<00:06:19.550> the<00:06:19.640> flywheel<00:06:20.120> and

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
all right luckily all the flywheel and

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.930 
all right luckily all the flywheel and
everything<00:06:20.630> came<00:06:20.840> off<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.230> engine<00:06:21.730> it's<00:06:22.730> just

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
everything came off the engine it's just

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.210 
everything came off the engine it's just
a<00:06:23.090> very<00:06:23.810> slight<00:06:24.200> taper<00:06:24.530> to<00:06:24.800> the<00:06:24.830> end<00:06:25.010> of<00:06:25.130> this

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
a very slight taper to the end of this

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.640 
a very slight taper to the end of this
shaft<00:06:25.520> so<00:06:25.940> at<00:06:26.540> least<00:06:26.720> everything<00:06:26.990> came<00:06:27.320> apart

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
shaft so at least everything came apart

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.040 
shaft so at least everything came apart
so<00:06:28.400> I'm<00:06:28.460> gonna<00:06:28.550> forget<00:06:28.730> all<00:06:28.910> this<00:06:29.090> Mouse<00:06:29.660> stuff

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
so I'm gonna forget all this Mouse stuff

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.200 
so I'm gonna forget all this Mouse stuff
cleaned<00:06:30.440> out<00:06:30.650> get<00:06:31.310> the<00:06:31.430> vacuum<00:06:31.820> out<00:06:31.970> and

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
cleaned out get the vacuum out and

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.480 
cleaned out get the vacuum out and
vacuum<00:06:32.570> all<00:06:32.690> that<00:06:32.900> out<00:06:33.110> get<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:33.890> fan<00:06:34.130> clean

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
vacuum all that out get the fan clean

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.090 
vacuum all that out get the fan clean
back<00:06:34.700> out<00:06:35.260> so<00:06:36.260> what<00:06:36.380> I'm<00:06:36.470> going<00:06:36.590> to<00:06:36.650> try<00:06:36.830> to<00:06:36.860> do

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
back out so what I'm going to try to do

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.010 
back out so what I'm going to try to do
is<00:06:37.250> get<00:06:37.430> this<00:06:37.580> engine<00:06:37.970> freed<00:06:38.360> up<00:06:38.510> I'm<00:06:38.840> probably

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
is get this engine freed up I'm probably

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.390 
is get this engine freed up I'm probably
going<00:06:39.200> to<00:06:39.260> drain<00:06:39.470> the<00:06:39.590> oil<00:06:39.620> out<00:06:39.950> of<00:06:39.980> it<00:06:40.130> today

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
going to drain the oil out of it today

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.150 
going to drain the oil out of it today
and<00:06:40.640> then<00:06:40.760> pull<00:06:41.600> the<00:06:41.720> bottom<00:06:42.020> oil<00:06:42.830> pan<00:06:43.130> off

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
and then pull the bottom oil pan off

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.910 
and then pull the bottom oil pan off
here<00:06:43.700> get<00:06:44.480> that<00:06:44.690> all<00:06:44.840> pulled<00:06:45.140> out<00:06:45.320> and<00:06:45.680> see

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:45.920 
here get that all pulled out and see

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.770 
here get that all pulled out and see
what<00:06:46.070> it<00:06:46.130> looks<00:06:46.160> like<00:06:46.490> inside<00:06:46.880> and<00:06:47.420> if<00:06:47.690> we

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
what it looks like inside and if we

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.360 
what it looks like inside and if we
could<00:06:47.930> free<00:06:48.140> it<00:06:48.230> up<00:06:48.350> and<00:06:48.530> I<00:06:48.920> get<00:06:49.070> the<00:06:49.220> engine

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
could free it up and I get the engine

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.060 
could free it up and I get the engine
running<00:06:50.080> what<00:06:51.080> we<00:06:51.200> were<00:06:51.290> thinking<00:06:51.680> is<00:06:51.860> just

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
running what we were thinking is just

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.620 
running what we were thinking is just
going<00:06:52.190> to<00:06:52.280> completely<00:06:52.460> redo<00:06:53.000> the<00:06:53.150> generator

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
going to completely redo the generator

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.440 
going to completely redo the generator
make<00:06:54.500> it<00:06:54.620> like<00:06:54.800> new<00:06:54.830> just<00:06:55.370> take<00:06:55.520> a<00:06:55.550> take<00:06:56.090> a<00:06:56.120> shot

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
make it like new just take a take a shot

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.920 
make it like new just take a take a shot
at<00:06:56.630> it

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
at it

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.380 
at it
because<00:06:57.380> like<00:06:58.220> I<00:06:58.340> say<00:06:58.550> the<00:06:58.730> generator<00:06:59.150> head

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
because like I say the generator head

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.580 
because like I say the generator head
really<00:06:59.660> doesn't<00:06:59.960> look<00:07:00.080> that<00:07:00.110> bad

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
really doesn't look that bad

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.620 
really doesn't look that bad
everything's<00:07:01.550> still<00:07:01.820> in<00:07:02.030> fairly<00:07:02.420> decent

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
everything's still in fairly decent

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.450 
everything's still in fairly decent
shape<00:07:02.840> the<00:07:03.260> brushes<00:07:03.650> are<00:07:03.800> still<00:07:04.040> really<00:07:04.280> good

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
shape the brushes are still really good

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
shape the brushes are still really good
so<00:07:05.530> the<00:07:06.530> armature<00:07:06.850> we're<00:07:07.850> going<00:07:07.970> to<00:07:08.030> clean

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
so the armature we're going to clean

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.420 
so the armature we're going to clean
this<00:07:08.660> up<00:07:08.720> some<00:07:09.140> we're<00:07:09.950> probably<00:07:10.160> going<00:07:10.370> to

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
this up some we're probably going to

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.040 
this up some we're probably going to
take<00:07:10.670> it<00:07:10.820> if<00:07:11.060> we<00:07:11.480> get<00:07:11.600> the<00:07:11.750> engine<00:07:11.990> running

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
take it if we get the engine running

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.080 
take it if we get the engine running
that<00:07:12.410> is<00:07:12.520> probably<00:07:13.520> going<00:07:13.640> to<00:07:13.700> take<00:07:13.790> this<00:07:13.910> to

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.090 
that is probably going to take this to

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.900 
that is probably going to take this to
someplace<00:07:14.330> that<00:07:14.870> does<00:07:15.730> specializes<00:07:16.730> in<00:07:16.820> the

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:16.910 
someplace that does specializes in the

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.230 
someplace that does specializes in the
generators<00:07:17.510> and<00:07:17.810> electric<00:07:18.470> motors<00:07:18.800> and<00:07:18.830> stuff

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 
generators and electric motors and stuff

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.250 
generators and electric motors and stuff
and<00:07:20.240> we're<00:07:20.420> going<00:07:20.540> to<00:07:20.570> have<00:07:20.750> them<00:07:20.870> look<00:07:20.960> at<00:07:21.230> it

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
and we're going to have them look at it

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.050 
and we're going to have them look at it
and<00:07:21.590> see<00:07:22.010> if<00:07:22.070> I<00:07:22.130> can<00:07:22.250> get<00:07:22.370> a<00:07:22.400> price<00:07:22.670> just<00:07:22.970> to

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
and see if I can get a price just to

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.400 
and see if I can get a price just to
clean<00:07:23.300> it<00:07:23.330> up<00:07:23.540> you<00:07:23.780> know<00:07:23.870> if<00:07:23.990> they<00:07:24.080> could<00:07:24.140> set

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410 
clean it up you know if they could set

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.080 
clean it up you know if they could set
it<00:07:24.500> up<00:07:24.590> on<00:07:24.710> a<00:07:24.770> lathe<00:07:25.010> and<00:07:25.190> just<00:07:25.430> touch<00:07:25.730> the<00:07:25.970> edge

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090 
it up on a lathe and just touch the edge

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.180 
it up on a lathe and just touch the edge
of<00:07:26.270> everything<00:07:26.540> shine<00:07:27.530> it<00:07:27.650> up<00:07:27.710> real<00:07:27.980> nice

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.190 
of everything shine it up real nice

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.580 
of everything shine it up real nice
because<00:07:28.790> I<00:07:28.940> mean<00:07:29.150> the<00:07:29.240> grooves<00:07:29.540> where<00:07:30.470> the

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:30.590 
because I mean the grooves where the

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.170 
because I mean the grooves where the
brushes<00:07:30.950> ride<00:07:31.160> they're<00:07:31.370> still<00:07:31.610> fairly<00:07:31.880> deep

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.180 
brushes ride they're still fairly deep

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.960 
brushes ride they're still fairly deep
so<00:07:32.540> you<00:07:32.780> know<00:07:33.020> it<00:07:33.170> wasn't<00:07:33.500> used<00:07:33.710> a<00:07:34.040> ton<00:07:34.520> and<00:07:34.790> it

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:34.970 
so you know it wasn't used a ton and it

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.060 
so you know it wasn't used a ton and it
was<00:07:35.060> used<00:07:35.300> but<00:07:35.600> not<00:07:35.810> a<00:07:36.230> whole<00:07:36.530> heck<00:07:36.710> of<00:07:36.740> a<00:07:36.890> lot

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.070 
was used but not a whole heck of a lot

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.540 
was used but not a whole heck of a lot
so<00:07:37.490> we'll<00:07:37.580> have<00:07:37.730> to<00:07:37.910> see<00:07:37.940> how<00:07:38.210> that<00:07:38.270> goes<00:07:39.550> but

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.550 
so we'll have to see how that goes but

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.860 
so we'll have to see how that goes but
I'll<00:07:40.700> start<00:07:40.940> by<00:07:41.060> getting<00:07:41.330> this<00:07:41.420> stuff<00:07:41.690> cleaned

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:41.870 
I'll start by getting this stuff cleaned

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.500 
I'll start by getting this stuff cleaned
up<00:07:42.200> and<00:07:42.530> then<00:07:43.220> we<00:07:43.580> can<00:07:43.610> get<00:07:43.850> to<00:07:43.910> pulling<00:07:44.360> the

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.510 
up and then we can get to pulling the

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.960 
up and then we can get to pulling the
engine<00:07:44.600> apart
