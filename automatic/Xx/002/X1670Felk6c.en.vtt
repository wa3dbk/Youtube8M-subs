00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
throwing me off balance it's so heavy

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.130 
throwing me off balance it's so heavy
look<00:01:25.430> at<00:01:25.550> that

will<00:02:15.390> evaporate<00:02:15.720> giving<00:02:16.350> us<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.530> mixture<00:02:16.860> of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
will evaporate giving us a mixture of

will evaporate giving us a mixture of
gases<00:02:17.520> inside<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.180> tube<00:02:18.540> finally<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.530> will

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
gases inside this tube finally I will

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.180 
gases inside this tube finally I will
light<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:21.000> top<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.660> tube<00:02:21.959> causing<00:02:22.860> the

light the top of the tube causing the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.970 
light the top of the tube causing the

the temperature and pressure in the tube

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.140 
the temperature and pressure in the tube
will<00:02:28.020> increase<00:02:28.530> causing<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.430> reaction<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.120> go

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
will increase causing the reaction to go

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.720 
will increase causing the reaction to go
faster<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.990> faster<00:02:31.230> it'll<00:02:31.860> accelerate<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
faster and faster it'll accelerate and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:42.259 
faster and faster it'll accelerate and
bark<00:02:36.739> Wow<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:40.200> look<00:02:40.550> at<00:02:41.550> all<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> sulphur<00:02:42.150> on

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
bark Wow and look at all the sulphur on

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.700 
bark Wow and look at all the sulphur on
the<00:02:42.390> sides<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.959> tube

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.860 

that<00:02:46.710> reaction<00:02:47.040> was<00:02:47.460> fun<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.090> cool<00:02:48.450> and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
that reaction was fun and cool and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.290 
that reaction was fun and cool and
powerful<00:02:49.050> but<00:02:49.890> we're<00:02:50.130> way<00:02:50.280> off<00:02:50.310> track<00:02:50.850> here

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
powerful but we're way off track here

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.059 
powerful but we're way off track here
even<00:02:51.569> though<00:02:51.660> sulphur<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.200> precious<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.890> dear

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069

to<00:02:53.100> my<00:02:53.340> heart<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:54.150> not<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.780> rare<00:02:55.110> at<00:02:55.440> all<00:02:55.680> so

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
to my heart it's not that rare at all so

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.559 
to my heart it's not that rare at all so
let's<00:02:56.490> get<00:02:56.670> crazy<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.510> talk<00:02:57.900> about<00:02:58.290> astatine

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
let's get crazy and talk about astatine

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.050 
let's get crazy and talk about astatine
astatine<00:03:00.569> is<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.380> rare<00:03:01.800> here<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.520> earth<00:03:02.790> that

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
astatine is so rare here on earth that

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.960 
astatine is so rare here on earth that
we<00:03:03.270> don't<00:03:03.450> even<00:03:03.600> know<00:03:03.840> what<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.680> looks<00:03:05.100> like<00:03:05.400> if

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
we don't even know what it looks like if

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.910 
we don't even know what it looks like if
you<00:03:06.150> were<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.330> try<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.570> get<00:03:06.840> enough<00:03:07.200> astatine

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
you were to try to get enough astatine

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
with your own eyes it would instantly

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.250 
with your own eyes it would instantly
vaporize<00:03:12.330> itself<00:03:12.750> because<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.140> its

radioactive<00:03:13.590> heat<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:15.360> fact<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.080> so

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
radioactive heat the fact that it's so

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.840 
radioactive heat the fact that it's so
radioactive<00:03:16.530> means<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.280> wouldn't<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.580> great

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
radioactive means it wouldn't be great

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.600 
radioactive means it wouldn't be great
as<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.150> ring<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:18.900> let's<00:03:19.140> move<00:03:19.380> on<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.980> to

it's<00:06:24.970> a<00:06:25.180> stable<00:06:25.600> isotope<00:06:25.750> with<00:06:26.350> a<00:06:26.380> half-life

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
it's a stable isotope with a half-life

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.560 
it's a stable isotope with a half-life
of<00:06:26.980> over<00:06:27.220> a<00:06:27.250> billion<00:06:27.730> years<00:06:27.910> it's<00:06:28.180> nonreactive

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
of over a billion years it's nonreactive

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.770 
of over a billion years it's nonreactive
it<00:06:29.050> fits<00:06:29.500> all<00:06:29.650> our<00:06:29.830> criteria<00:06:30.490> a<00:06:30.670> ring<00:06:31.120> made<00:06:31.630> of

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
it fits all our criteria a ring made of

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.160 
it fits all our criteria a ring made of
the<00:06:31.930> scarcest<00:06:32.910> naturally-occurring<00:06:34.170> stable

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
the scarcest naturally-occurring stable

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.070 
the scarcest naturally-occurring stable
nonreactive<00:06:35.650> thing<00:06:36.340> so<00:06:37.090> hey<00:06:37.270> it<00:06:37.660> would<00:06:37.870> be<00:06:37.990> an

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
nonreactive thing so hey it would be an

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.170 
nonreactive thing so hey it would be an
awesome<00:06:38.260> ring<00:06:39.160> now<00:06:39.850> you're<00:06:40.000> probably

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
awesome ring now you're probably

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.780 
awesome ring now you're probably
wondering<00:06:40.500> Michael<00:06:41.530> why<00:06:41.890> did<00:06:42.040> you<00:06:42.160> experiment

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
wondering Michael why did you experiment

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.870 
wondering Michael why did you experiment
with<00:06:42.820> vanadium<00:06:43.300> sulfur<00:06:44.140> Gold<00:06:44.590> and<00:06:44.860> Syria<00:06:45.280> well

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
with vanadium sulfur Gold and Syria well

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.980 
with vanadium sulfur Gold and Syria well
here's<00:06:46.060> what's<00:06:46.240> interesting<00:06:46.390> take<00:06:46.750> a<00:06:46.780> look<00:06:46.930> at

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
here's what's interesting take a look at

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.920 
here's what's interesting take a look at
the<00:06:47.050> periodic<00:06:47.260> table<00:06:47.530> and<00:06:47.860> their<00:06:48.250> symbols

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
the periodic table and their symbols

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.340 
the periodic table and their symbols
tada

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
tada

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:57.830 
tada
