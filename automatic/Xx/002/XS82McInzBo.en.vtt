and it's this kid has changed several

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.680 
and it's this kid has changed several

go from zero to 70 miles an hour one of

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.660 
go from zero to 70 miles an hour one of
the<00:02:48.990> biggest<00:02:49.320> issues<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:50.010> had<00:02:50.250> with<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
the biggest issues that we had with the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.610 
the biggest issues that we had with the
scooter<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.330> last<00:02:51.660> issue<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.410> had

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
scooter and the last issue that we had

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.210 
scooter and the last issue that we had
is<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:54.120> product<00:02:55.010> didn't<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.190> a

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
is that the product didn't have a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.190 
is that the product didn't have a
governor<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.730> slow<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.510> down<00:02:57.540> all<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.020> way

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
governor to slow it down all the way

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.280 
governor to slow it down all the way
during<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.190> acceleration<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.810> what<00:03:00.930> happens

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
during the acceleration so what happens

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.620 
during the acceleration so what happens
is<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:02.430> e<00:03:02.700> wheels<00:03:02.940> model<00:03:03.500> gt3<00:03:04.500> W<00:03:04.950> 36<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:06.270> does

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
is this e wheels model gt3 W 36 it does

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.160 
is this e wheels model gt3 W 36 it does
not<00:03:06.870> slow<00:03:07.470> down<00:03:07.500> when<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.190> takes<00:03:08.430> off<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.720> it

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
not slow down when it takes off so it

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.740 
not slow down when it takes off so it
does<00:03:10.470> not<00:03:10.650> govern<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.880> take-off<00:03:12.330> or<00:03:12.630> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
does not govern the take-off or the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.290 
does not govern the take-off or the
acceleration<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:14.160> these<00:03:14.280> things<00:03:14.580> unless<00:03:15.150> you

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
acceleration so these things unless you

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.960 
acceleration so these things unless you
get<00:03:15.420> used<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.780> twisting<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.530> very<00:03:17.340> slow<00:03:17.790> and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
get used to twisting it very slow and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.380 
get used to twisting it very slow and
easy

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
easy

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.260 
easy
it'll<00:03:19.020> take<00:03:19.230> off<00:03:19.440> very<00:03:19.740> fast<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:21.090> was

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
it'll take off very fast and that was

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.410 
it'll take off very fast and that was
the<00:03:21.420> last<00:03:21.600> issue<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.110> we<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.620> now<00:03:22.800> fixed<00:03:23.460> so

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the last issue that we have now fixed so

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.090 
the last issue that we have now fixed so
what<00:03:24.570> happens<00:03:24.870> moving<00:03:25.170> forward<00:03:25.530> when<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.710> test

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
what happens moving forward when we test

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.960 
what happens moving forward when we test
these<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:27.360> you're<00:03:27.870> gonna<00:03:27.990> turn<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
these is that you're gonna turn the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.150 
these is that you're gonna turn the
speed<00:03:29.970> knob<00:03:30.180> which<00:03:30.390> we<00:03:30.540> test<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.080> we<00:03:31.680> turn<00:03:31.950> all

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
speed knob which we test and we turn all

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.190 
speed knob which we test and we turn all
the<00:03:32.250> way<00:03:32.310> down<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:33.090> will<00:03:33.210> not<00:03:33.390> move<00:03:33.450> and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
the way down and it will not move and

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.680 
the way down and it will not move and
then<00:03:34.830> it'll<00:03:34.980> go<00:03:35.250> as<00:03:35.460> fast<00:03:35.790> as<00:03:36.030> 1<00:03:36.240> mile<00:03:36.480> an<00:03:36.600> hour

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
then it'll go as fast as 1 mile an hour

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.590 
then it'll go as fast as 1 mile an hour
all<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:36.960> way<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.230> 17<00:03:37.860> by<00:03:38.460> working<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.120> twist

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
all the way to 17 by working that twist

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.190 
all the way to 17 by working that twist
knob<00:03:40.340> ok<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:42.030> what<00:03:42.210> I'm<00:03:42.300> going<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.450> do<00:03:42.570> also<00:03:42.960> is

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
knob ok so what I'm going to do also is

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.320 
knob ok so what I'm going to do also is
I'm<00:03:43.380> going<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.590> show<00:03:43.740> you<00:03:43.800> that<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.820> is<00:03:44.850> nearly

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
I'm going to show you that it is nearly

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.820 
I'm going to show you that it is nearly
impossible<00:03:45.510> for<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.500> thing<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.800> come

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
impossible for this thing to come

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.180 
impossible for this thing to come
damaged<00:03:47.460> if<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.180> does<00:03:48.440> number<00:03:49.440> one<00:03:49.620> it's<00:03:49.800> bad

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
damaged if it does number one it's bad

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.060 
damaged if it does number one it's bad
luck<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:50.760> number<00:03:51.270> two<00:03:51.500> something<00:03:52.500> could<00:03:52.950> have

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
luck and number two something could have

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.910 
luck and number two something could have
gotten<00:03:53.310> jarred<00:03:53.760> through<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.270> vibration<00:03:55.020> we

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
gotten jarred through the vibration we

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.750 
gotten jarred through the vibration we
have<00:03:56.130> had<00:03:56.340> lights<00:03:56.930> that<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:59.220> light<00:03:59.460> came

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
have had lights that the the light came

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.780 
have had lights that the the light came
loose<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.230> was<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.380> basic<00:04:01.620> easy<00:04:02.010> fix<00:04:02.460> but

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
loose so that was a basic easy fix but

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.990 
loose so that was a basic easy fix but
you<00:04:03.600> can<00:04:03.750> see<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.080> wrap<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.710> we<00:04:04.890> tie<00:04:05.460> down<00:04:05.760> this

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
you can see we wrap and we tie down this

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.210 
you can see we wrap and we tie down this
about<00:04:06.420> as<00:04:06.540> secure<00:04:06.690> as<00:04:07.020> possible<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:08.040> what<00:04:08.160> I'm

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
about as secure as possible and what I'm

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.440 
about as secure as possible and what I'm
gonna<00:04:08.340> do<00:04:08.490> is<00:04:08.610> I'm<00:04:08.730> gonna<00:04:08.790> take<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.210> crate

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
gonna do is I'm gonna take the crate

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.780 
gonna do is I'm gonna take the crate
here<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.870> I'm<00:04:10.050> gonna<00:04:10.250> I'm<00:04:11.250> gonna<00:04:11.400> pretend

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
here and I'm gonna I'm gonna pretend

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.160 
here and I'm gonna I'm gonna pretend
what<00:04:12.750> happens

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
what happens

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.910 
what happens
when<00:04:14.860> this<00:04:15.100> is<00:04:15.280> in<00:04:15.790> route<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:17.620> if<00:04:17.769> you

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
when this is in route to you so if you

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.380 
when this is in route to you so if you
could<00:04:17.950> do<00:04:18.280> this<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.750> multiply<00:04:20.350> this<00:04:20.410> by<00:04:20.709> about

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
could do this and multiply this by about

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.170 
could do this and multiply this by about
500<00:04:22.390> maybe<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.690> thousand<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:24.580> happens<00:04:25.030> when

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
500 maybe a thousand that happens when

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.240 
500 maybe a thousand that happens when
it's<00:04:25.300> checked<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:25.930> obviously<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.740> depends<00:04:27.130> on

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
it's checked and obviously it depends on

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.910 
it's checked and obviously it depends on
how<00:04:27.430> far<00:04:27.730> going<00:04:28.720> from<00:04:28.960> Scottsdale<00:04:29.620> Phoenix

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
how far going from Scottsdale Phoenix

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.670 
how far going from Scottsdale Phoenix
Arizona<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.990> you<00:04:31.990> know<00:04:32.110> anywhere<00:04:32.530> in<00:04:32.620> the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
Arizona to you know anywhere in the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.500 
Arizona to you know anywhere in the
country<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:33.760> know<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:34.000> more<00:04:34.210> it's<00:04:34.360> gonna

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
country you know the more it's gonna

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.290 
country you know the more it's gonna
vibrate<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:35.380> mean<00:04:36.220> I'm<00:04:36.310> I'm<00:04:36.550> doing<00:04:37.030> this<00:04:37.150> as

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
vibrate I mean I'm I'm doing this as

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.960 
vibrate I mean I'm I'm doing this as
hard<00:04:37.510> as<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:37.810> possibly<00:04:37.840> can<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:39.550> can<00:04:39.730> see

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
hard as I possibly can and you can see

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.640 
hard as I possibly can and you can see
that<00:04:40.180> it's<00:04:40.690> not<00:04:40.930> even<00:04:41.140> touched<00:04:41.380> in<00:04:41.560> the

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
that it's not even touched in the

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.760 
that it's not even touched in the
Machine<00:04:42.010> okay<00:04:42.730> and<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.720> was<00:04:43.930> just<00:04:44.140> 20<00:04:44.530> times

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
Machine okay and that was just 20 times

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.590 
Machine okay and that was just 20 times
right<00:04:45.040> there<00:04:45.070> basically<00:04:45.880> as<00:04:46.120> hard<00:04:46.390> as<00:04:46.510> I

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
right there basically as hard as I

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.659 
right there basically as hard as I
possibly<00:04:46.990> could<00:04:47.230> and<00:04:47.440> now<00:04:48.010> I'm<00:04:48.310> gonna<00:04:48.430> take

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
possibly could and now I'm gonna take

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:49.950 
possibly could and now I'm gonna take
the<00:04:48.790> scooter<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.210> I'm<00:04:49.450> gonna<00:04:49.600> do<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.930> same

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
the scooter and I'm gonna do the same

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.930

thing to the scooter no way that this

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.550 
thing to the scooter no way that this
thing<00:04:58.000> can<00:04:58.360> come<00:04:58.510> damaged<00:04:58.990> which<00:04:59.320> was

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
thing can come damaged which was

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.730 
thing can come damaged which was
probably<00:05:00.160> half<00:05:00.610> of<00:05:00.730> our<00:05:00.880> battle<00:05:01.330> when<00:05:02.110> we<00:05:02.380> sell
