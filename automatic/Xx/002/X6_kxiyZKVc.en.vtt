00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.839
 7 great friends this is with you supsa channel 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.000
 9 May where actually today 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.670
 will be my first day when I do 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.590
 tutorial on 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:20.150
 in minecraft in general I thought so 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.010
 stop playing this stupid game you 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.400
 Now you will probably laugh digger 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.820
 online 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:30.080
 I played it I realized that it was full 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.730
 nonsense sorry then she likes to play and 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.670
 also started knocked out sorry I was being carried 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.239
 this is not satisfied but now I am no longer 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.260
 like so what I'm a normal person in 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.710
 overall i will shoot a tutorial 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.290
 and we will be with friends when I'm already on 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.309
 take the people we will shoot the tutorial in 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.879
 minecraft 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:01.610
 Well, let's for today 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:05.570
 let me some players who 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.430
 beginners probably many do not know how 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.750
 make portal to endermen 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:17.509
 but many know so understand me 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:20.479
 it means it is not difficult to do there. 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.600
 you can get lost there 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:28.009
 already so that they go pus in which direction 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.969
 so it will be difficult to put me a game 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:36.820
 a little bit podglyuchivaet 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:41.299
 so the abyss to survive means 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.350
 let's begin the first thing we need 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.350
 to do this 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.370
 let's in this place 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.370
 build a portal to measure Ender 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:00.440
 As you can see, I probably already have 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:04.960
 eat and let's get started mean for 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.960
 this we need to go underground 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:19.850
 that's something like this, and so after 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:30.470
 as we dug the earth on one side we 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:36.020
 we can continue to build a shorter portal 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.520
 just like this unit means here you 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.270
 should get right if you 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.670
 did the same as mine means 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:50.930
 eyes you must look right this 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.780
 it will be difficult to do so here is it really 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:59.720
 we got it right now 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:02.600
 we need to see those eyes right now in 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:12.430
 this side excuse me 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:12.430
 for an error then wait now 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:29.890
 amber is 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:33.320
 so yes damn yes damn 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:40.360
 my zenith for being so stupid 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:45.880
 just it's true to weigh up 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:54.340
 so how are we on the site 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:57.860
 the eyes are so close we are close 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.350
 without weight 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.350
 damn here again yes what is this such 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:14.200
 so set and that he also looked here 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:19.730
 so it looked here so do not have 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:22.220
 well we got it so these eyes 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.240
 were looked to the left 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:30.410
 Well, which side they are so one year 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:35.510
 here and the other and the last thing on us is 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:39.070
 to look ahead well 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.070
 queen are close 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:54.110
 I ask because I'm looking for such as him 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:05:06.980
 called quarter ax means yes damn 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:08.620
 the thing is this here and damn so well, nothing 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.970
 not happening 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.970
 hey maybe you did something wrong 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.390
 maybe another hole to dig 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:45.780
 now wait a minute 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:50.470
 After all, and there like drive and I just 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:54.510
 In this problems with him I do not know, actually 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:06:13.680
 eyes on look in the wrong direction bath 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:13.680
 driver and here we made a portal in 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:30.940
 ender world is shorter we are now but so here 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:36.220
 this same tender world but ender dragon 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:45.990
 there is no longer because I soaked it so 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:45.990
 Well, here you see winter the world is 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:57.940
 here you can wet them well and shorter so here 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:03.630
 Now it will be the end of a pancake how to release 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.630

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:19.370
 probably seen as a portal to the world 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:23.360

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:25.689
