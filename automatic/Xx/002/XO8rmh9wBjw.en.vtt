00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.650
 I'm here again to teach you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.139
 how to get in the car 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.160
 a lot of the same people are asking 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.990
 Why am I an instructor as well? 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.920
 but I think a lot of people have difficulty 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.289
 in that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.890
 I'm not going to explain to you how to go 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.140
 the first ever average 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.519
 When you go on the march, you have 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.980
 that tighten in goiÃ¡s 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.960
 still on the first lap will stay in 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.620
 in the dead end will be between 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.980
 the third and fourth gear 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.520
 first you press in open braille 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.930
 turn and was the first the same 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.079
 thing for the second fran for the third 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:01.670
 room will automatically fall into the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:05.510
 straight from the third stage the same thing to 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:10.110
 back washing the middle field 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.390
 pressed, it almost engages the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.540
 you walk back washing through 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.840
 to the passenger side and to the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.600
 fifth march 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.990
 always when you leave first 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.990
 march 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:33.380
 The first one is missing in Brazil is medium. 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.380
 until the car starts to walk 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:41.840
 if you only have one arm at a time the car 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:47.549
 will start very hard because 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:52.320
 free wheel then all the engine power 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:55.530
 at once the wheel of the cars of the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:01.340
 chevrolet has a button here underneath you 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:05.210
 Press he squeezes his wrong side 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:10.039
 Since the Fiat some are broad 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.980
 quartas squeezing back from the volks 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.450

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.489

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.620
