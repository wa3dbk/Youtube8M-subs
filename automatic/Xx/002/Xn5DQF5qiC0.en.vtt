00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:05.200
 good now that the driver has been fined 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.870
 here on my right side we are already with one or with the magnetometer side 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.649
 the daily use that leaves the motorcycle with my son wanted or not but that I 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.449
 I highly recommend the grounding that goes 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.779
 going from the end of the block of the motor field 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.739
 up to the side of the moped 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.130
 of traps that I will love 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.089
 the pholia clutch 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.300
 and now I have left the most important 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.650
 that the word of order 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.030
 in the position there are two in a well that they want that is not the original of it sida that 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.550
 it's already a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.710
 a little more elaborate mech 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.880
 here this black part is the tub 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.600
 where is wall 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.790
 the float goal it is the fuel enters here 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.470
 here I am all this screw has a face that acts as a filter 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.900
 here is missing a carburetor part 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.010
 which is really like a guillotine 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.070
 It's a plastic door that will close here in the front. 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.420
 I do not know if it's going to look right 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.880
 but here there is a tube as if it were the one to speak what I give 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.660
 o the products now ache the senator trouble the senator 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.130
 so she has two little holes in there 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.500
 is the working of this simple but costly face that can beat victor 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.780
 Here is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.050
 kate screwed not 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.260
 at the end of the wing 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.210
 so according to Basque 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.850
 is created here in the room 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.820
 but there is no dismissal 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.420
 humm the fuel rises by aspiration through the decex holes it was 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.120
 indicted is slightly higher 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.700
 this is what works like that a progression the carburetor much more 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.080
 simple if you see 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 my son sleep with him 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.700
 it is the carburetor much simpler than here 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.540
 but that serves well in itself 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.090
 this engines me 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.430
 the main difference is that they and finally in relation to two tries pro 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.360
 four tries 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.570
 and that you simply can not handle the healer here 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.180
 and for a simple reason 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.720
 remembering the driver's explanation 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.970
 What I said when they are suffering 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.469
 they understand 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.959
 the mixture that I just resigned here 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.789
 enter and it creates a 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:15.480
 a small pressure 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.529
 above the atmosphere of capra craque 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.599
 so that the flow of 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.760
 of arica zuliani can climb through the transfer window 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.469
 remember that I said that then you need to have a resource so that the 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.829
 single passive fuel 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.539
 and he can not and he does not come back in any way nor the arineu fuel 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.389
 so there is 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.599
 this seemingly simple piece but there 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.669
 well regulated and well adjusted 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.559
 for the engine to work well 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.509
 this here is a vane valve 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.739
 This is a valve of Felipe 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.790
 that if you have a twitter dilma and the mafia in the 80's 90's the staff 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.069
 called it from here victories 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.599
 I still had the reason of my bike because the reason of my bike 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.810
 in fact it was 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.959
 this valve because why 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.299
 if it worked legal 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.709
 she will give you a tone here from a low vote and even a 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.969
 power 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.389
 in high rotation 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.529
 how it works 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:14.739
 bush that tried to show it here 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.520
 imagine that this from kitano 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.520
 inside the engine there is enclosed what is a blade 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.649
 fiber 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.649
 I went there to see if it was a mouthpiece of a southern instrument 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.369
 so they appealed support that perfectly if you 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.139
 create negative pressure in relation to being here 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.309
 this palette on Tuesday fast operates to allow the air that is here in the 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.999
 truth will be under pressure if you had less pressure than outside 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.160
 it will be as if the art 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.249
 that there was compression here it will win 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:46.659
 the little pick will be a little 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.599
 just a little bit to get into that mine amount of air 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.649
 and she will close again 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:54.539
 when you understand when you create greater pressure 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.369
 in this sense here 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:04:00.939
 you will more and more touch those straws not on her nesting 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.650
 and it will not allow to erase the passage of 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.279
 daily fuel out 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:10.869
 so use that which the lovers of the reboleira 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:12.269
 unfortunately 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.040
 when it comes to furniture and it is difficult for you to find pieces of quality 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.509
 so this 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.729
 this talk for the purchase of the smart of the fin pectoral aspect is what 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.400
 intends to make a complaint of the water that was with the hand to round the corners 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.669
 her 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.120
 for her to sit in the best way possible 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.580
 in this block of aluminum 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.340
 if you get a motorcycle 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.620
 a jet-ski or something in that sense 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.620
 The UFC lock is rubber-coated demel premium 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:39.789
 so there's 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.789
 she appeared she can live in a much more efficient way 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.289
 What's up? 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.289
 will arrive here 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.199
 So what did I do when I'm a monster? 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.949
 if two screws holding this limiter 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.129
 the curve of whether it is limited to its function precisely from the pressure here at the tip of the 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.180
 from volvo 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.469
 so there is not much secret here 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:03.339
 for the sector a regulation base has more than a third of the length here it has 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:04.990
 What are you supporting and well? 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.509
 hugo 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.620
 ap 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.820
 on the apple stand from there you 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.499
 It should only open a little bit 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.679
 but without anything and know nothing to be assumed that the reed actually 

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:17.289
 she hardly hucks 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.580
 arrive constantly from here like tottenham by bruise 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.930
 at least it looks like a motor 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.930
 if you have a chance, we'll have a pick of a 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.940
 motodev motorcycle racing homestead that actually here you 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.940
 only one side as the other if you take 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.669
 david yates that dilma would gain from a network of 150 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.300
 there are six Palestinians three teams here 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.069
 then function in a much more efficient way 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.999
 is a paradox - the montage 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.080
 next to the new 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.159
 the palestinian 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.969
 doctors 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.279
 another one up here 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:56.819
 It's finally right. 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.349
 the small intake manifold 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:00.919
 here is simply a 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.919
 a little thing at least 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.889
 go away 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.460
 three screws of the line that a door here because here we have time but this one 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.300
 link 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.620
 here has no physical space for you to put a screw year because of the 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.710
 platform 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.710
 I was two draws 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.240
 then only missing exhaust mount exhaust 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.330
 I think that with this fall 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.660
 mounted it does not 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.839
 on the motor show 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:34.650
 what you have to take care of with maximum exhaust captain 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.490
 this is what is the point I consider the weakest of all of the ps project 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.169
 there is not I am nobody to criticize 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.349
 nor the author who has been made more 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.210
 I think what if there is a weak point nishimoto from here 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.560
 it is precisely this search here because they are metabolized if 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.229
 exhaust with rice with fall 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:56.490
 but I came here it's a nut 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.050
 a door that has already had a shoreline leak here along with my record 

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:02.219
 click here 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:03.270
 unfortunate 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.020
 We will not get the title. 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.639
 but at last there's a ring here 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.800
 and here comes the exhaust here is going to be proven 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.080
 and if you do not start that from here right if you miss the thread 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.960
 voice with rivals for this from here 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.379
 we have space that will reflect if it bothers the grind 

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:23.199
 It's what I did here on my bike. 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:26.080
 That's where you can get a good consultation out of it. 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.080
 I did I went very high. 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.990
 so after I had tight support year 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.949
 not the expense of the treasury 

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:38.909
 in the right place I'll just fancy to rifle. 

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:40.099
 dropping 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:43.099
 with the vibration the actor who said he hopes to be much better than me 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:50.879
 Any doubt can only write is thanks for watching. 

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.110
 my videos and as soon as 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.279
 this engines given entity 

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:58.669
 the first sign of life in my furniture that I'm going to make a video 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:00.800
 and you will follow
