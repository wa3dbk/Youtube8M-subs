00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
when I work straight but which is normal

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.140 
when I work straight but which is normal
with<00:04:04.769> this<00:04:05.040> type<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.280> hair<00:04:05.609> of<00:04:05.730> course<00:04:05.940> is

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
with this type of hair of course is

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.879 
with this type of hair of course is
gonna<00:04:06.299> tangle<00:04:06.569> when<00:04:06.810> it's<00:04:07.049> constantly<00:04:07.530> moving

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
gonna tangle when it's constantly moving

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.099 
gonna tangle when it's constantly moving
and<00:04:08.160> it's<00:04:08.669> curly<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.419> interlocking

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
and it's curly and it's interlocking

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.990 
and it's curly and it's interlocking
with<00:04:10.290> each<00:04:10.380> other<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.829> that's<00:04:11.010> normal<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.370> it

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
with each other so that's normal so it

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.630 
with each other so that's normal so it
doesn't<00:04:12.480> it's<00:04:12.630> not

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
doesn't it's not

nothing that bothers me but um now with

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.400 
nothing that bothers me but um now with
the<00:04:18.440> way<00:04:18.799> parent<00:04:19.609> I<00:04:19.760> did<00:04:20.359> notice<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:20.959> the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
the way parent I did notice that the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.150 
the way parent I did notice that the
waves<00:04:22.060> loosened<00:04:23.060> up<00:04:23.180> when<00:04:23.780> I<00:04:23.810> added<00:04:24.440> my<00:04:24.620> other

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
waves loosened up when I added my other

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.430 
waves loosened up when I added my other
bottle<00:04:25.639> to<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.880> top<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.480> noticed<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.410> difference

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
bottle to the top I noticed a difference

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.250 
bottle to the top I noticed a difference
in<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.700> weight<00:04:28.910> patterns<00:04:29.510> you<00:04:29.690> really<00:04:29.960> can't

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
in the weight patterns you really can't

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.620 
in the weight patterns you really can't
I<00:04:30.620> don't<00:04:31.340> know<00:04:31.430> if<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.669> can<00:04:31.820> see<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.419> see

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
I don't know if you can see it you see

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.390 
I don't know if you can see it you see
the<00:04:33.490> curls<00:04:34.490> up<00:04:34.760> here<00:04:35.419> ways<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:37.160> waves

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
the curls up here ways and the waves

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.260 
the curls up here ways and the waves
down<00:04:37.760> here<00:04:38.620> these<00:04:39.620> are<00:04:39.830> like<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.310> newer<00:04:40.580> mine

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
down here these are like the newer mine

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.050 
down here these are like the newer mine
or<00:04:41.510> bundle<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:43.010> this<00:04:43.910> up<00:04:44.450> underneath<00:04:45.760> it's<00:04:46.760> my

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
or bundle and this up underneath it's my

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.520 
or bundle and this up underneath it's my
older<00:04:47.479> bundle<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:47.900> you<00:04:47.960> can<00:04:48.139> tell<00:04:48.320> the

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
older bundle so you can tell the

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.840 
older bundle so you can tell the
difference<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.150> curl<00:04:50.540> pattern<00:04:51.820> but<00:04:52.820> uh

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
difference in the curl pattern but uh

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.820 
difference in the curl pattern but uh
it's<00:04:53.240> not<00:04:53.389> it's<00:04:53.750> not<00:04:53.990> something<00:04:54.260> about<00:04:54.500> to<00:04:54.740> me

is<00:05:17.570> fine<00:05:18.070> it<00:05:19.070> has<00:05:19.660> this<00:05:20.660> a<00:05:20.720> deep<00:05:21.080> wave<00:05:21.320> but<00:05:22.130> it's

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
is fine it has this a deep wave but it's

then I bleached some streaks and I kind
of<00:06:14.810> died<00:06:15.110> it<00:06:15.520> colored<00:06:16.520> it<00:06:16.669> I<00:06:16.849> believe<00:06:17.330> the

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
of died it colored it I believe the

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.719 
of died it colored it I believe the
first<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:18.020> then<00:06:18.410> I<00:06:18.500> colored<00:06:18.950> the<00:06:19.099> strips<00:06:19.490> like

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
first and then I colored the strips like

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.909 
first and then I colored the strips like
carbon<00:06:20.419> red<00:06:21.020> color<00:06:21.440> so<00:06:21.830> it<00:06:22.370> has<00:06:22.550> like<00:06:22.789> a<00:06:22.820> red

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
carbon red color so it has like a red

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.890 
carbon red color so it has like a red
ten<00:06:24.370> highlight<00:06:24.879> going<00:06:25.180> around<00:06:25.419> in<00:06:25.569> the<00:06:25.689> hair

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900
