00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.119
 Hello my loves or now I bring you this 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:16.180
 makeup and I hope you like it just 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:18.460
 let's start first let's start 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.349
 I'm going to use these new palettes that I 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.000
 He sent make up forever so that if 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.820
 I wanted to use the ones you can do in a video 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.660
 and these are palette some new palettes 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:33.820
 or I'm using this shadow mistress that is 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.430
 like a gray color but it has a little 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.350
 of brightness the shadows are beautiful 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.320
 I really like yes I am 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.060
 applying this on the entire eyelid 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.400
 and from there I will apply one more shadow 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.710
 clear and will not apply that in the basin 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.600
 of the eye as you can see I already had a 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.400
 color in the eye socket and it was a 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.090
 shadow and now I'm going to show you that 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.610
 shadow 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.320
 I have that blush I 'm seeing there 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.829
 this is the place I was using the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.450
 principle and I'm going to reapply 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.050
 over only to see a 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.050
 a little more 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.640
 what is the word that is looking for a 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.860
 little bit more worm so you do not look so 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.690
 I do not know how to explain it but well I hope 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.760
 that they understand me to teach more I am going to 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.920
 blur it with this shadow clearer and 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.960
 I'm going to re -apply the colors and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.810
 blur it only until I'm 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.760
 happy this look was so simple I should 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.950
 apply a brush that is like a pencil and 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.470
 moved it a little bit and I used this shadow that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.680
 It's like a green quote when you apply 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.380
 this shadow down the intel tabs 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.370
 exteriors that in my eyes be 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.020
 to assault as it is said good as not 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.050
 I have time to give us videos in Spanish 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.970
 whatever 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.420
 they cleared up a little bit more they could not 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.700
 highlight a little more of this and I liked 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.720
 the truth and I'm going to apply an eyeliner 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.880
 which is like a clear skin color 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.640
 just so that my eyes look more 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.560
 awake and look bigger there 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.360
 I applied the shadow again 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.570
 because I felt that I was losing the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.610
 the intensity of the colors but 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.330
 I just did that and then applied my 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.000
 eyelashes because it's the look without the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.420
 tracks the eyelashes would not look the same 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.160
 I'm just applying like this as close 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.170
 I can from my real eyelashes 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.060
 just so you do not have to apply 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.080
 eyeliner because as you can see in 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.130
 this look does not apply anything eyeliner 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.710
 only because I wanted you to look at 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.990
 cooler light and that's the only thing 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.590
 I did read I 'm just cleaning 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.670
 any shade dust that has fallen 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.130
 in our http and there I will apply my 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.790
 mask that is from mica foresee are two 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.760
 different to one is against water and the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.680
 another one I do not like to use the 200 as 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.620
 that make my eyelashes look more 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.230
 black and highlight a little more that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.300
 only what I did and reapplied 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.819
 a little bit of the green color because I felt 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.370
 that one side darker than the other 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.469
 and of lips study being this one that is 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.930
 ofra kaczmarek if that is called in 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.879
 lagoon beach are the lic or ellipses that 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.999
 they become matt the truth I 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.450

 cosmetics and I love this illuminates so 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.659
 pretty and just blur everything and this 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.329

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.980

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.439

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.510
