00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
so i'm working in photoshop cs3 and what

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.170 
so i'm working in photoshop cs3 and what
i<00:00:08.809> did<00:00:09.020> is<00:00:09.110> i<00:00:09.260> started<00:00:09.590> a<00:00:09.620> new<00:00:09.650> document<00:00:10.070> in<00:00:10.370> 300

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
i did is i started a new document in 300

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.070 
i did is i started a new document in 300
DPI<00:00:11.209> and<00:00:11.980> for<00:00:12.980> the<00:00:13.129> lines<00:00:13.369> I<00:00:13.910> just<00:00:14.600> held<00:00:14.900> down

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
DPI and for the lines I just held down

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.740 
DPI and for the lines I just held down
the<00:00:15.109> shift<00:00:15.619> button<00:00:16.190> while<00:00:16.789> I<00:00:16.820> had<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.119> brush

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
the shift button while I had the brush

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.390 
the shift button while I had the brush
tool<00:00:17.930> selected<00:00:18.320> in<00:00:18.560> order<00:00:18.770> to<00:00:18.890> draw<00:00:19.130> straight

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
tool selected in order to draw straight

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.849 
tool selected in order to draw straight
lines<00:00:19.460> and<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:20.929> I'm<00:00:20.990> just<00:00:21.199> setting<00:00:21.349> up<00:00:21.619> some

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
lines and so I'm just setting up some

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.429 
lines and so I'm just setting up some
different<00:00:22.160> thumbnails<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:23.029> that<00:00:23.150> i<00:00:23.179> can<00:00:23.439> try

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
different thumbnails so that i can try

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.689 
different thumbnails so that i can try
and<00:00:24.529> get<00:00:24.619> an<00:00:24.710> idea<00:00:24.980> of<00:00:25.070> what<00:00:25.249> i'm<00:00:25.339> gonna<00:00:25.490> work

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
and get an idea of what i'm gonna work

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:26.919 
and get an idea of what i'm gonna work
on<00:00:25.880> because<00:00:26.029> i'm<00:00:26.119> not<00:00:26.240> really<00:00:26.359> sure<00:00:26.480> what<00:00:26.749> type

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
on because i'm not really sure what type

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.769 
on because i'm not really sure what type
of<00:00:26.960> environment<00:00:27.589> i<00:00:27.650> want<00:00:27.829> to<00:00:27.890> do<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:29.480> actually

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
of environment i want to do and actually

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.589 
of environment i want to do and actually
set<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:30.460> lines<00:00:31.460> to<00:00:31.789> multiply<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.480> I'm

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
set the lines to multiply and I'm

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.600 
set the lines to multiply and I'm
painting<00:00:33.050> beneath<00:00:33.590> them<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.100> that<00:00:34.130> I<00:00:34.280> can<00:00:34.430> keep

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
painting beneath them so that I can keep

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.869 
painting beneath them so that I can keep
the<00:00:34.820> lines<00:00:35.030> intact<00:00:35.530> and<00:00:36.530> I<00:00:37.340> kind<00:00:37.550> of<00:00:37.579> wanted<00:00:37.789> to

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
the lines intact and I kind of wanted to

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.240 
the lines intact and I kind of wanted to
go<00:00:37.940> for<00:00:38.239> a<00:00:38.539> cinematic<00:00:39.309> aspect<00:00:40.309> ratio<00:00:42.250> sorry

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
go for a cinematic aspect ratio sorry

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.150 
go for a cinematic aspect ratio sorry
now<00:00:43.370> I'm<00:00:43.460> thinking<00:00:43.609> I<00:00:44.620> kind<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:45.739> want<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.949> do

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
now I'm thinking I kind of want to do

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.830 
now I'm thinking I kind of want to do
some<00:00:46.550> kind<00:00:46.760> of<00:00:46.820> environment<00:00:47.390> dealing<00:00:47.719> with

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
some kind of environment dealing with

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.910 
some kind of environment dealing with
architecture<00:00:48.969> so<00:00:49.969> I'm<00:00:50.030> just<00:00:50.210> trying<00:00:50.449> to<00:00:50.920> put

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
architecture so I'm just trying to put

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.540 
architecture so I'm just trying to put
down<00:00:52.039> some<00:00:52.280> ideas<00:00:53.710> still<00:00:54.710> exploring<00:00:55.250> right

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
down some ideas still exploring right

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.259 
down some ideas still exploring right
now<00:00:56.800> right<00:00:57.800> now<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:57.980> brush<00:00:58.489> I'm<00:00:58.640> using<00:00:58.670> has<00:00:59.210> a

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
now right now the brush I'm using has a

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.930 
now right now the brush I'm using has a
hardness<00:00:59.629> of<00:00:59.839> a<00:00:59.929> hundred<00:01:00.199> percent<00:01:00.699> so<00:01:01.699> i'm

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
hardness of a hundred percent so i'm

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.639 
hardness of a hundred percent so i'm
actually<00:01:02.120> not<00:01:02.359> getting<00:01:02.749> any<00:01:02.899> opacity<00:01:03.530> with

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
actually not getting any opacity with

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.680 
actually not getting any opacity with
pressure<00:01:03.949> it's<00:01:04.220> just<00:01:04.460> all<00:01:05.000> one<00:01:05.570> hundred

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
pressure it's just all one hundred

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.980 
pressure it's just all one hundred
percent<00:01:07.120> now<00:01:08.120> what<00:01:08.300> I<00:01:08.330> did<00:01:08.510> there<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:08.869> I

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
percent now what I did there is I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.539 
percent now what I did there is I
flipped<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.439> canvas<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.130> just<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.400> that

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
flipped the canvas I just have that

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.640 
flipped the canvas I just have that
bound<00:01:10.759> to<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.000> key<00:01:11.329> its<00:01:13.180> command<00:01:14.180> F<00:01:14.420> online<00:01:15.409> you

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
bound to a key its command F online you

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.230 
bound to a key its command F online you
can<00:01:15.740> just<00:01:15.950> set<00:01:16.100> those<00:01:16.130> up<00:01:16.310> yourself<00:01:17.000> with

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
can just set those up yourself with

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.899 
can just set those up yourself with
keyboard<00:01:17.750> shortcuts<00:01:18.670> right<00:01:19.670> now<00:01:19.759> i'm<00:01:19.850> using

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
keyboard shortcuts right now i'm using

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.139 
keyboard shortcuts right now i'm using
the<00:01:20.270> chalk<00:01:21.110> brush<00:01:21.439> I'm<00:01:22.399> just<00:01:22.549> trying<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:22.820> land

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
the chalk brush I'm just trying to land

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.630 
the chalk brush I'm just trying to land
some<00:01:23.540> big<00:01:23.780> shapes<00:01:24.220> still<00:01:25.220> searching<00:01:25.549> around

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
some big shapes still searching around

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.350 
some big shapes still searching around
for<00:01:25.880> what<00:01:26.060> I<00:01:26.119> want<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.329> do<00:01:30.880> i'm<00:01:31.880> thinking<00:01:32.060> maybe

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
for what I want to do i'm thinking maybe

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.410 
for what I want to do i'm thinking maybe
I'll<00:01:32.600> have<00:01:32.810> some<00:01:33.729> kind<00:01:34.729> of<00:01:34.790> a<00:01:34.909> bridge<00:01:35.240> or

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
I'll have some kind of a bridge or

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.620 
I'll have some kind of a bridge or
something<00:01:35.479> I<00:01:36.850> also<00:01:37.850> wanted<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.240> mention<00:01:38.329> that

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
something I also wanted to mention that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.389 
something I also wanted to mention that
i<00:01:38.899> usually<00:01:39.229> don't<00:01:39.469> start<00:01:39.829> out<00:01:39.950> by<00:01:40.130> doing

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
i usually don't start out by doing

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.030 
i usually don't start out by doing
thumbnails<00:01:40.790> whenever<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.360> start<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.350> project<00:01:42.560> I

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
thumbnails whenever I start a project I

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.160 
thumbnails whenever I start a project I
usually<00:01:43.399> just<00:01:43.460> start<00:01:44.180> right<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.479> on<00:01:44.899> the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
usually just start right in on the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.609 
usually just start right in on the
painting<00:01:45.850> um<00:01:46.850> I'm<00:01:47.750> not<00:01:47.840> really<00:01:47.899> sure<00:01:48.140> why<00:01:48.439> I<00:01:48.500> do

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
painting um I'm not really sure why I do

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.770 
painting um I'm not really sure why I do
that<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:49.100> I've<00:01:49.729> just<00:01:49.789> always<00:01:50.149> done<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.600> even

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
that I I've just always done that even

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.800 
that I I've just always done that even
when<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:51.079> was<00:01:51.200> in<00:01:51.289> school<00:01:51.469> I<00:01:51.860> guess<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.750> kind<00:01:53.750> of

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
when I was in school I guess I kind of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.990 
when I was in school I guess I kind of
felt<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:54.110> my<00:01:54.680> first<00:01:54.920> idea<00:01:55.130> was<00:01:55.369> usually<00:01:55.969> the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
felt like my first idea was usually the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.929 
felt like my first idea was usually the
one<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.479> went<00:01:56.659> with<00:01:56.869> anyway<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.920> found<00:01:58.759> myself

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
one I went with anyway so I found myself

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.779 
one I went with anyway so I found myself
just<00:01:59.619> you<00:02:00.619> know<00:02:00.710> doing<00:02:00.950> extra<00:02:01.399> thumbnails

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
just you know doing extra thumbnails

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.170 
just you know doing extra thumbnails
just<00:02:02.119> because<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.750> was<00:02:02.869> forced<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.469> like<00:02:04.180> you

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
just because I was forced to like you

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.810 
just because I was forced to like you
know<00:02:05.210> someone<00:02:05.659> teacher<00:02:05.899> would<00:02:06.109> say<00:02:06.289> yes<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.890> 15

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
know someone teacher would say yes to 15

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.630 
know someone teacher would say yes to 15
thumbnails<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.950> first<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.369> know<00:02:10.490> one

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
thumbnails so in the first you know one

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.150 
thumbnails so in the first you know one
or<00:02:10.729> two<00:02:10.850> thumbnails<00:02:11.240> like<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.630> pretty<00:02:12.080> much<00:02:12.170> had

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
or two thumbnails like I pretty much had

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.220 
or two thumbnails like I pretty much had
what<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.430> wanted<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.760> do<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.239> then<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:15.110> know

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
what I wanted to do and then you know

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.830 
what I wanted to do and then you know
for<00:02:15.379> the<00:02:15.470> next<00:02:15.849> 13<00:02:16.849> or<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.209> would<00:02:17.510> have<00:02:17.540> to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
for the next 13 or so I would have to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.460 
for the next 13 or so I would have to
sit<00:02:18.050> there<00:02:18.260> and

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
sit there and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.070 
sit there and
come<00:02:18.830> up<00:02:18.980> with<00:02:19.190> ideas<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.540> knew<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.720> wasn't

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
come up with ideas that I knew I wasn't

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.930 
come up with ideas that I knew I wasn't
going<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.350> do<00:02:21.470> anyways<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.400> seemed<00:02:22.730> like<00:02:22.760> a

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
going to do anyways I just seemed like a

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.410 
going to do anyways I just seemed like a
waste<00:02:23.180> of<00:02:23.330> time<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:24.730> mean<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.820> other<00:02:25.940> problem<00:02:26.330> I

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
waste of time I mean the other problem I

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.060 
waste of time I mean the other problem I
have<00:02:26.600> with<00:02:26.630> doing<00:02:27.080> thumbnails<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.710> a<00:02:27.740> lot<00:02:27.920> of

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
have with doing thumbnails is a lot of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.870 
have with doing thumbnails is a lot of
times<00:02:28.250> I'll<00:02:29.150> do<00:02:29.450> thumbnails<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.140> then<00:02:30.880> almost

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
times I'll do thumbnails and then almost

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.850 
times I'll do thumbnails and then almost
without<00:02:32.420> fail<00:02:32.630> if<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.170> show<00:02:33.380> an<00:02:33.500> art<00:02:33.680> director

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
without fail if you show an art director

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.620 
without fail if you show an art director
a<00:02:34.370> bunch<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.790> thumbnails<00:02:34.970> they're<00:02:35.420> going<00:02:35.540> to

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
a bunch of thumbnails they're going to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.260 
a bunch of thumbnails they're going to
pick<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.440> one<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.830> like<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.670> least<00:02:37.880> I

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
pick the one that you like the least I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.780 
pick the one that you like the least I
mean<00:02:39.080> it<00:02:39.230> pretty<00:02:39.800> much<00:02:39.950> happens<00:02:40.310> every<00:02:40.610> time

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
mean it pretty much happens every time

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.320 
mean it pretty much happens every time
so<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:42.530> order<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.920> kind<00:02:43.460> of<00:02:43.580> avoid<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.270> I

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
so in order to kind of avoid that and I

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.180 
so in order to kind of avoid that and I
just<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:45.140> know<00:02:45.170> into<00:02:45.470> one<00:02:45.680> idea<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.920> speaking

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
just you know into one idea so speaking

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.710 
just you know into one idea so speaking
of<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.490> distort<00:02:49.850> tool<00:02:49.910> that's<00:02:50.270> actually<00:02:50.600> what

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
of the distort tool that's actually what

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.390 
of the distort tool that's actually what
I'm<00:02:50.810> doing<00:02:51.050> right<00:02:51.170> now<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.560> what<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:51.950> did<00:02:52.160> first

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
I'm doing right now and what I did first

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.340 
I'm doing right now and what I did first
is<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.760> selected<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.420> entire<00:02:53.690> image<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.260> then

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
is I selected the entire image and then

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.770 
is I selected the entire image and then
I<00:02:54.440> did<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.650> copy<00:02:55.010> merged<00:02:55.459> which<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.330> command

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
I did a copy merged which is command

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.590 
I did a copy merged which is command
shift<00:02:56.990> C<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.890> mac<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.459> ctrl<00:02:59.030> shift<00:02:59.060> C<00:02:59.420> for

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
shift C for the mac and ctrl shift C for

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.660 
shift C for the mac and ctrl shift C for
pc<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.160> then<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.340> went<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:02.050> edit

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
pc and then I just went to edit

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.980 
pc and then I just went to edit
transform<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.030> then<00:03:05.180> distort<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.690> you'll

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
transform and then distort and you'll

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.620 
transform and then distort and you'll
get<00:03:06.140> these<00:03:06.350> handlebars<00:03:07.070> and<00:03:07.550> then<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:08.420> just

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
get these handlebars and then you just

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.360 
get these handlebars and then you just
click<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:08.959> drag<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.290> handlebars<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.980> distort

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
click and drag the handlebars to distort

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.840 
click and drag the handlebars to distort
your<00:03:10.459> image<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.840> was<00:03:11.990> just<00:03:12.140> pulling<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.680> out

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
your image and I was just pulling it out

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.900 
your image and I was just pulling it out
so<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.660> perspective<00:03:15.490> was<00:03:16.490> a<00:03:16.520> little

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
so that the perspective was a little

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.370 
so that the perspective was a little
more<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.209> an<00:03:17.300> upshot<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.900> was<00:03:17.990> a<00:03:18.050> little<00:03:18.260> more

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
more of an upshot it was a little more

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.440 
more of an upshot it was a little more
severe<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:22.550> distort<00:03:22.910> tool<00:03:22.940> is<00:03:23.180> just<00:03:23.360> a

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
severe and the distort tool is just a

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.870 
severe and the distort tool is just a
really<00:03:23.720> great<00:03:23.870> tool<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.280> kind<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.430> push<00:03:25.670> the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
really great tool to kind of push the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.150 
really great tool to kind of push the
perspective<00:03:26.420> in<00:03:26.540> your<00:03:26.690> piece<00:03:26.930> or<00:03:27.290> just<00:03:27.890> to

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
perspective in your piece or just to

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.890 
perspective in your piece or just to
change<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.700> angles<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.209> things<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.570> little<00:03:29.690> bit

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
change the angles of things a little bit

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.380 
change the angles of things a little bit
same<00:03:30.709> with<00:03:30.890> like<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.220> warp<00:03:31.459> tool<00:03:31.730> like<00:03:32.120> if<00:03:32.269> you

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
same with like the warp tool like if you

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.500 
same with like the warp tool like if you
want<00:03:32.570> something<00:03:33.370> maybe<00:03:34.370> like<00:03:34.880> your<00:03:35.209> lips

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
want something maybe like your lips

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.290 
want something maybe like your lips
isn't<00:03:36.370> wrapping<00:03:37.370> around<00:03:37.489> as<00:03:37.880> much<00:03:38.030> as<00:03:38.180> you

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
isn't wrapping around as much as you

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.970 
isn't wrapping around as much as you
would<00:03:38.390> like<00:03:38.600> you<00:03:38.780> can<00:03:38.810> use<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.290> warp<00:03:39.500> tool<00:03:39.739> to

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
would like you can use the warp tool to

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.640 
would like you can use the warp tool to
kind<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.310> use<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.239> as<00:03:41.570> like<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.750> quick<00:03:42.050> fix<00:03:42.380> but

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
kind of use that as like a quick fix but

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.920 
kind of use that as like a quick fix but
I<00:03:43.370> mean<00:03:43.550> all<00:03:43.730> these<00:03:43.940> tools<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.390> need<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.570> use

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
I mean all these tools you need to use

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.960 
I mean all these tools you need to use
in<00:03:45.080> moderation<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.860> you<00:03:46.280> need<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:46.640> be<00:03:46.790> very

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
in moderation and you need to be very

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.420 
in moderation and you need to be very
subtle<00:03:47.239> with<00:03:47.510> them<00:03:47.690> because<00:03:47.900> otherwise<00:03:48.430> you

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
subtle with them because otherwise you

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.979 
subtle with them because otherwise you
know<00:03:49.519> this<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.150> image<00:03:50.450> starts<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.870> look

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
know this the image starts to look

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.660 
know this the image starts to look
really<00:03:51.260> weird<00:03:51.440> it<00:03:51.709> starts<00:03:52.100> breaking<00:03:52.459> down

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.620 

now<00:03:55.670> it's<00:03:55.820> time<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:56.090> add<00:03:56.210> a<00:03:56.240> little<00:03:56.450> more

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
now it's time to add a little more

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.590 
now it's time to add a little more
atmosphere<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.740> i'm<00:03:58.070> using<00:03:58.670> my<00:03:58.700> dust<00:03:59.270> brush

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
atmosphere so i'm using my dust brush
