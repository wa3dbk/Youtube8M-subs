Hi, I'm leonardo

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.440
Today we talk about the birth of the dinosaurs

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.580
Billion years ago , our planet was very different

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.420
It was covered with volcanoes

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.940
look

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.540
after many years , it creates the atmosphere

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.900
with the rains have created the oceans

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.340
the first dinosaurs are amphibians

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.700
were water

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.600
They had fins

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.280
look

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:09.800
Aquatic dinosaurs moved on the ground and their fins transform into legs

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.320
created the first four-legged dinosaurs

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.440
Did you know that crocodiles are the ancestors of the dinosaurs ?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:38.380
They existed three geological eras , Jurassic , Cretaceous , Triassic

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.120
They were born carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.920
This is a tyrannosaurus, carnivorous

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.880
also gigantosauro carnivorous

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.180
The triceratops is herbivorous

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.000
The pterosaur was a flying reptile

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.220
