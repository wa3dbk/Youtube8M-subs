00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
see how slim it is it's it's is it six

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.639 
see how slim it is it's it's is it six
nine<00:02:08.970> six<00:02:09.239> point<00:02:09.479> nine<00:02:09.539> millimeters<00:02:10.289> thin

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
nine six point nine millimeters thin

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
wanted to dote on the design because we

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.860 
wanted to dote on the design because we
had<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.460> thing<00:02:23.520> at<00:02:23.820> CES<00:02:24.180> at<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.720> big

attic etc so tell me about the specifics

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.840 
attic etc so tell me about the specifics
of<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.940> camera<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.480> why<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:00.990> kind<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.290> a

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
of this camera and why this is kind of a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.650 
of this camera and why this is kind of a
differentiating<00:03:02.850> play<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.120> let's<00:03:03.330> start<00:03:03.570> with

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
differentiating play so let's start with

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.880 
differentiating play so let's start with
the<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.990> back<00:03:04.140> camera<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.560> one<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.800> you

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
the the back camera the one that you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.260 
the the back camera the one that you
would<00:03:05.010> use<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.190> take<00:03:05.460> pictures<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.790> other

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
would use to take pictures of other

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.450 
would use to take pictures of other
people<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.690> other<00:03:06.780> things<00:03:07.050> it's<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.860> 13

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
people and other things it's a 13

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.900 
people and other things it's a 13
megapixel<00:03:08.730> camera<00:03:09.260> right<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.470> does<00:03:10.620> a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
megapixel camera right so does a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.750 
megapixel camera right so does a
ultra-high<00:03:11.910> resolution<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:13.490> aperture<00:03:14.490> is

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
ultra-high resolution the aperture is

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.690 
ultra-high resolution the aperture is
astounding<00:03:15.600> for<00:03:16.080> those<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.440> who<00:03:16.590> are<00:03:16.770> you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
astounding for those of you who are you

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.280 
astounding for those of you who are you
know<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.910> means<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.300> don't<00:03:18.480> hear<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.750> right

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
know that means so don't hear it right

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.890 
know that means so don't hear it right
but<00:03:19.470> it's<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.739> it's<00:03:19.950> an<00:03:20.040> F<00:03:20.190> 1.8<00:03:20.940> aperture<00:03:21.390> which

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
but it's a it's an F 1.8 aperture which

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.840 
but it's a it's an F 1.8 aperture which
means<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.530> capable<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:23.130> letting<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.670> a

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
means that it is capable of letting in a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.370 
means that it is capable of letting in a
tremendous<00:03:24.540> amount<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.020> light<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.290> you're

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
tremendous amount of light so you're

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.170 
tremendous amount of light so you're
