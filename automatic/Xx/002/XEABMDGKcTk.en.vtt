00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
gives you basically a little bit of

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
gives you basically a little bit of
leeway<00:01:26.939> when<00:01:27.390> you're<00:01:27.540> making<00:01:27.720> tackles<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.679 
leeway when you're making tackles in the
open<00:01:29.220> field<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:30.119> always<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.450> good

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
open field and that's always a good

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.630 
open field and that's always a good
thing<00:01:30.930> because<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.740> really<00:01:32.189> tough<00:01:32.400> as

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
thing because it's it's really tough as

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.450 
thing because it's it's really tough as
it<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.270> making<00:01:33.689> tackles<00:01:34.020> an<00:01:34.229> open<00:01:34.530> field<00:01:34.770> but

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
it is making tackles an open field but

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 
it is making tackles an open field but
with<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.150> at<00:01:36.390> least<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
with this on at least you have a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
with this on at least you have a
fighting<00:01:37.259> chance<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.280> would<00:01:38.700> recommend

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
fighting chance so I would recommend

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.990 
fighting chance so I would recommend
having<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.140> sure<00:01:40.670> now<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> ball

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
having that on for sure now the ball

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.030 
having that on for sure now the ball
hawk<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> an<00:01:42.479> interesting<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.079> because<00:01:43.350> this

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
hawk is an interesting one because this

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.889 
hawk is an interesting one because this
one's<00:01:44.250> gonna<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:45.030> based<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.420> personal

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
one's gonna be really based on personal

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.800 
one's gonna be really based on personal
preference<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:47.280> off<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.689> be

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
preference on or off I really to be

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.330 
preference on or off I really to be
honest<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.560> noticed<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:50.009> single

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
honest have not noticed a single

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.179 
honest have not noticed a single
difference<00:01:50.520> between<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> two<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:52.979> just

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
difference between the two so I'm just

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.039 
difference between the two so I'm just
leaving<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.210> case<00:01:54.450> there's<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.810> few

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
leaving it on just in case there's a few

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.990 
leaving it on just in case there's a few
more<00:01:55.200> animations<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.219> they<00:01:56.729> have

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
more animations that there they have

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.639 
more animations that there they have
programmed<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> game<00:01:57.899> while<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.320> on

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
programmed into the game while it's on

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.889 
programmed into the game while it's on
I'm<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.009> even<00:01:59.310> sure<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.420> just

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I'm not even sure on that but I just

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
I'm not even sure on that but I just
have<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.170> off<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.530> heck<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
have it off for the heck of it because I

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.069 
have it off for the heck of it because I
really<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.329> noticed<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> difference

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
really have not noticed the difference

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.929 
really have not noticed the difference
between<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> being<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.979> off<00:02:05.100> but

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
between it being on and off but

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.059 
between it being on and off but
hopefully<00:02:06.329> players<00:02:06.719> will<00:02:06.960> react<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.680> respond

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
