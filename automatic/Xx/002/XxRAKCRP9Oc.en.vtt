 view I believe on Italy 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.129
 the 30 eye shadow collection seems to me 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.940
 that so 250 250 dollars 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.129
 I don't think I take it, I don't think so 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.000
 to take it this is the small spoon 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.100
 inside of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.510

 immediately after we see what he did 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.199
 start by applying the ivory color 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.199
 on the inside corner 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.810
 in the middle of the extending mobile eyelid 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.810
 the gold color 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.360
 I don't know why I forgot to do 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:38.530
 see the blue anyway on the sides of the color 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:42.399
 gold I go to apply them in fig 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.600
 so as to blend the two points well where i 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.539
 two colors meet on the corner 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.619
 the shade with a small brush 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.619
 I apply the aubergine color 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.570
 in the crease of the eye towards the corner 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.570
 I apply the bronze inside 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:30.350
 for the eyebrow arch I go to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:34.480
 resume work on the eyelid 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.480
 lower I extend the purple 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:54.250
 from the outer corner towards the center 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:57.900
 of the eyelid eyes with the lunch there 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:02.980

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.549
 days 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.230
 the mascara and miss manga de l'oreal 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.730
 to fill the eyebrows with the use of 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.570
 blau of anastasia beverly hills and the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.570
 color the chocolate 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.770
 false eyelashes are the hai common ict 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.770
 in house of lies 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.260
 I apply the blush that orgasm of us 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:14.459
 and finally I apply the lip gloss 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.459
 of lipstick queen this is the big bang 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.640
 and this is the final residue then I have 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.370
 took this palette on the sephora site 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.550
 puntocom so I didn't see it 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.980
 I do n't know the store to see it 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.110
 that has me ahmed in italy 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.750
 I've seen it now the thing that has me 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.210
 immediately hit is the size it is 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.510
 little girl now I put it next to the 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.340
 nor that so that you can see that it is 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.410
 decidedly smaller than the 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.800
 naked so there is inside 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.940
 mirror and two brushes that are 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.080
 awful 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.960
 the colors are really beautiful the 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.540
 quality is really very good that is 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.770
 the only one that I didn't like 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.620
 very much is this purple this purple 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.820
 here I do not know I expected a little more 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.250
 pigmented instead there is so much glitter a 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.640
 poor pigment but otherwise i 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.300
 colors are really beautiful even i 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.289
 finish are very special 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.240
 metallic sheen 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.689
 certainly has a good combination 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:32.349
 both of neutral colors that is of colors and 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:37.749
 a little more intense like this very blue 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:40.749
 very nice and also gold and also 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:44.529
 very very cute they have some 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:46.809
 But nothing excessive fallout have 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:50.199
 a bit of fallout that needs cleaning up 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:52.719
 with a brush even over the duration not 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.520
 I can only speak well of them 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:59.469
 really good quality eye shadows there 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:03.610
 I would define it as pressed pigments 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:05.589
 they are so intense and beautiful they are 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.099
 very little is enough and the application 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:11.349
 wet can make it even better 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.959
 these colors that are already beautiful there 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:17.619
 consistency of eye shadows and almost 

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:21.459
 creamy , however, they blend very well 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:23.610
 consistency is definitely richer 

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:27.759
 compared to a powder eye shadow 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.669
 traditional and packaging is comfortable is in 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:34.870
 plastic closes well so you can 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:38.469
 definitely put in your bag in your suitcase 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.919
 without being afraid that it can be opened 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:45.610
 as maybe happens with the naked that 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:47.889
 having this the magnetic closure every 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:52.149
 so it happened to me at least that happened 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:54.759
 you find it open and it's a mess with i 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:56.319
 colors of the naked and it's all like at 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.330
 I usually hope this review is 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.930
 It was useful to send you a big kiss 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.930
