00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.740
 very nice match Thursday to I think we 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.360
 wanted to win today because we 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.860
 created a lot of opportunities plays good 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.959
 unfortunately we made a machine and that 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.380
 happens because we had made 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:22.890
 errors in the first leg we lost 2-0 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.009
 in the Senate today we are eliminated I 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 well of suspension and I was also 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.060
 I am also down to a few 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.950
 moments for a while at the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.080
 stages also it's more the tail 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.420
 I play a little woman tell me not what 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.270
 I did not even want to play for the day 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.320
 good I told the coach I can play 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.630
 to help the team 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.580
 the truce was long you did not have anymore 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.320
 played official match since december 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.500
 also explains the lack of pace at 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.870
 first leg against valence hu and 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.850
 difficult 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.980
 there is such a problem there because 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.969
 it's been two years since I played 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.649
 until today 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.040
 it's a bit difficult to point 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.410
 rhythm I hope we have to be sent 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.449
 for a long time died for the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.860
 championship political problem that took 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.560
 in ukraine as we felt it is to 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.659
 inside the group oi for us a 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.149
 tanner stage with walks in me 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.950
 I know nothing good politics I hope 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.860
 attend to continue like this for me 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.080
 good I'm going to ask the present of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.060
 left because I'm not going to stay 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.729
 like that by playing for three 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.110
 month it's a bit difficult for us to 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.960
 play if you stay for three months 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.160
 without playing it's a bit difficult for 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.840
 following there would be a championship that 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.270
 would make you dream 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.500
 yeah now I had headed by to 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.450
 cable dynamos now 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.520
 i'm going to england now because 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.079
 that madam 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.060
 my goal is to help party in 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.469
 England we saw you a few times 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.240
 in stadiums in belgium what is 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.399
 that you think especially of sporting 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.159
 anderlecht this year yeah for me 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.179
 I mean for the mall 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.869
 esplanade 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.450
 it does not work well I hope it will go 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.670
 for the next time i believe that my naiad 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.280
 youth teams i hope it takes 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.289
 also let relaxation and for internet 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.099
 I did not judge the coach for me 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.260
 coach I work with him on 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.140
 was champions want more for me good 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.849
 and 1p problem to daddy or joy too 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.120
 it's not the coach who will play 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.069
 as well 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.290
 if the field I stuck the test 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.019
 also joys and the coach too 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.400
 it's not all coach and you 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.930
 follow the Belgian Championship for you 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.230
 team what will be champion this year 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.349
 yeah well I have not said ben all the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.900
 ways the points we're going to divide her share 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.579
 vouchers we'll see very well for the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.329
 moment I see pretty standard and 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:42.060
 bruges but hey I hope also relates 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.950
 in the play-offs 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.810
 why not also Ukrainian championship 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.170
 compared to the Belgian championship that the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.410
 good levels I 'm going 10 relative to 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.209
 belgrade 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.470
 it's a bit difficult sometimes 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.450
 belgium now when they see the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.250
 Belgian champion it's a bit nil by 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.630
 report he drags because coaching them 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.940
 to clubs lions a fear based 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.319
 each ton and a metal shoulder 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.049
 success of good clubs 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.799
 I hope for you now you see 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.079
 think we worked hard for 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.530
 next year I have a pendant in a 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.530
 big club
