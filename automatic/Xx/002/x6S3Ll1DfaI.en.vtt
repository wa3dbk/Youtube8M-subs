hey guys Brian from precision taping

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.599 
hey guys Brian from precision taping
here<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.439> wanted<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> do<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> video<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.189> you

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
to show you how we run our flat box so

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.950 
to show you how we run our flat box so
the<00:00:23.160> box<00:00:23.340> I'm<00:00:23.490> using<00:00:23.670> here<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.060> 12<00:00:24.420> inch<00:00:24.570> flat

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the box I'm using here is a 12 inch flat

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.519 
the box I'm using here is a 12 inch flat
box<00:00:25.260> by<00:00:25.619> Columbia<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.420> here<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.510> go<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.109> I'm

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
box by Columbia and here we go so I'm

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.250 
box by Columbia and here we go so I'm
running<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.099> a5<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.929> tightest

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
running it on a5 so that's the tightest

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.659 
running it on a5 so that's the tightest
setting<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> back<00:00:32.520> of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
setting that we can get on the back of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.000 
setting that we can get on the back of
the<00:00:32.730> box<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> tension<00:00:34.380> adjuster<00:00:34.800> there

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the box on the tension adjuster there

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.090 
the box on the tension adjuster there
goes<00:00:35.309> from<00:00:35.700> 1<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.210> 5<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.170> I'm<00:00:37.350> running<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.770> 5

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
goes from 1 to 5 so I'm running it on 5

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.150 
goes from 1 to 5 so I'm running it on 5
just<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.210> tight<00:00:39.450> skin<00:00:40.010> you<00:00:41.010> don't

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
just for a really tight skin you don't

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.490 
just for a really tight skin you don't
necessarily<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.570> 5<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.740 
blade is you know every box is different
you'll<00:00:50.670> see<00:00:50.850> right<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.300> dropped

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
you'll see right there I just dropped

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020 
you'll see right there I just dropped
the<00:00:51.899> tension<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.379> little<00:00:52.530> bit<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.699> my<00:00:53.820> butt

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the tension a little bit so on my butt

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.670 
the tension a little bit so on my butt
joint<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.360> opened<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> box<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.410> more

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
joint I opened up the box a little more

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.930 
joint I opened up the box a little more
just<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.920> leave<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.340> more<00:00:56.550> mud<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
just to leave a little more mud on the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.299 
just to leave a little more mud on the
middle<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> tape<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:58.170> my<00:00:58.620> first<00:00:58.890> pass<00:00:59.129> on

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
middle of the tape for my first pass on

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.930 
middle of the tape for my first pass on
a<00:00:59.340> budget

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
a budget

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.330 
a budget
I<00:01:00.059> ran<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> box<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:01.050> either<00:01:01.320> side<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> tape

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
I ran the box on either side of the tape

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.729 
I ran the box on either side of the tape
so<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.910> means<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.149> ran<00:01:03.359> my<00:01:03.480> wheel<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.530> down

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
so that means I ran my wheel right down

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.320 
so that means I ran my wheel right down
the<00:01:04.890> middle<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> tape<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> coated

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the middle of the tape so I coated

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
the middle of the tape so I coated
either<00:01:06.720> side<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.320> butt<00:01:07.500> joint<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.979> then

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
either side of the butt joint and then

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.090 
either side of the butt joint and then
for<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.580> second<00:01:08.909> pass<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.720> ran<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> box<00:01:10.830> right

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
for the second pass I ran the box right

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.700 
for the second pass I ran the box right
down<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> middle<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.150> doing<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
down the middle as I'm doing now so the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.310 
down the middle as I'm doing now so the
flats<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.820> two<00:01:15.060> coats<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.080> do

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
flats here they get two coats so we do

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
flats here they get two coats so we do
our<00:01:16.350> tape<00:01:16.710> first<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.820> run<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> flat<00:01:18.299> box

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
our tape first then we run a flat box

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.170 
our tape first then we run a flat box
and<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.830> we'll<00:01:20.040> run<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> first<00:01:20.670> pass<00:01:20.970> on

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
and you know we'll run the first pass on

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120 
and you know we'll run the first pass on
the<00:01:21.330> flats<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:22.140> more<00:01:22.290> open<00:01:22.650> maybe<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the flats a little more open maybe on a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.330 
the flats a little more open maybe on a
three<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:25.020> second<00:01:25.380> skin<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.040> doing

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
three and the second skin like I'm doing

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.819 
three and the second skin like I'm doing
now<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.880> gets<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.780> tight<00:01:28.259> coat<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
now it gets a really tight coat like a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.010 
now it gets a really tight coat like a
four<00:01:29.250> or<00:01:29.460> five<00:01:29.700> again<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.450> depends<00:01:30.750> how<00:01:30.810> thick

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
four or five again it depends how thick

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050 
four or five again it depends how thick
or<00:01:31.170> thin<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.439> mud<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:32.790> did

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
or thin your mud is and like I just did

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
or thin your mud is and like I just did
again<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.299> drop<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.960> tension<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
again I drop the tension on the back of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.319 
again I drop the tension on the back of
the<00:01:35.130> box<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> middle<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.090> butt

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the box for the middle of this butt

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.179 
the box for the middle of this butt
joint<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.200> put<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.590> more<00:01:37.829> mud<00:01:38.040> on

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
joint just to put a little more mud on

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
joint just to put a little more mud on
there<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:39.509> maybe<00:01:39.630> there<00:01:39.810> was<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> little

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
there and see maybe there was a little

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.630 
there and see maybe there was a little
too<00:01:40.170> much<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> tighten<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.189> attention

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
too much so I tighten the attention

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.880 
too much so I tighten the attention
adjuster<00:01:42.090> again<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.439> run<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.740> down<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
adjuster again and I run it down the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.130 
adjuster again and I run it down the
middle<00:01:44.220> one<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.520> time<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.240> each<00:01:45.479> butt<00:01:45.810> joint

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
middle one more time so each butt joint

down the middle and you can see the tape

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.090 
down the middle and you can see the tape
is<00:01:56.939> still<00:01:57.149> slightly<00:01:57.420> visible<00:01:57.799> open<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:59.009> a

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
there

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.560 
there
and<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:02.189> solves<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.729> problem<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
and that solves that problem and

and that solves that problem and
likewise<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.409> run<00:02:04.530> your<00:02:04.680> box<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.189> you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
likewise you can run your box and you

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.410 
likewise you can run your box and you
can<00:02:05.399> see<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.090> little<00:02:06.180> bit<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
can see this kind of a little bit a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
can see this kind of a little bit a
little<00:02:06.840> bit<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.110> bubble<00:02:07.380> or<00:02:07.619> some<00:02:07.740> drag<00:02:07.979> marks

little bit of bubble or some drag marks

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.190 
little bit of bubble or some drag marks
because<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.640> mud<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.239> too<00:02:09.390> thick<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.170> know

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
because the mud is too thick you know

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.020 
because the mud is too thick you know
tighten<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.830> little<00:02:10.860> bit<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.550> another<00:02:11.760> pass

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
tighten it a little bit do another pass

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.180 
tighten it a little bit do another pass
and<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.020> will<00:02:13.260> put<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.410> tighter<00:02:13.800> coat<00:02:14.040> on

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
started on the walls I already finished

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.699 
started on the walls I already finished
that<00:02:18.269> ceiling<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.019> know<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.200> less<00:02:19.349> than<00:02:19.560> a

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
that ceiling you know in less than a

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.140 
that ceiling you know in less than a
minute<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.280> half<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.730> shows<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.030> how

fast that is as you can see here I just
kind<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.390> went<00:02:24.540> right<00:02:25.530> up<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.890> plug<00:02:26.190> as

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
kind of went right up to the plug as

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.640 
kind of went right up to the plug as
tight<00:02:26.550> as<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.760> could<00:02:26.930> if<00:02:27.930> there's<00:02:28.170> any<00:02:28.319> plugs

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
tight as I could if there's any plugs

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.470 
tight as I could if there's any plugs
light<00:02:29.010> fixtures<00:02:29.519> or<00:02:29.760> kind<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:29.970> obstacles<00:02:30.450> in

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.350 
to it and then I always have a putty
knife<00:02:37.920> afterwards<00:02:38.549> when<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.880> whole<00:02:39.030> room<00:02:39.239> is

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
knife afterwards when the whole room is

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.210 
knife afterwards when the whole room is
done<00:02:39.540> I'll<00:02:39.750> go<00:02:39.959> around<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.530> I'll<00:02:40.620> get<00:02:41.100> all

done I'll go around and I'll get all
that<00:02:41.340> stuff<00:02:41.489> by<00:02:41.760> hand<00:02:42.170> you'll<00:02:43.170> see<00:02:43.380> also<00:02:43.680> that

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
that stuff by hand you'll see also that

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.199 
that stuff by hand you'll see also that
I'll<00:02:44.310> I'll<00:02:44.970> do<00:02:45.299> two<00:02:45.510> passes<00:02:46.049> on<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.680> seams

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
I'll I'll do two passes on the seams

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.960 
I'll I'll do two passes on the seams
often<00:02:48.209> times<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.349> called<00:02:49.620> tracing<00:02:50.250> or<00:02:50.459> as

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
often times this is called tracing or as

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.660 
often times this is called tracing or as
some<00:02:51.150> people<00:02:51.180> call<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.510> chasing<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:53.370> reason

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
some people call it chasing the reason

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.120 
some people call it chasing the reason
for<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.390> kind<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.660> helps<00:02:54.930> eliminate

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
for this is it kind of helps eliminate

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.220 
for this is it kind of helps eliminate
bubbles<00:02:56.130> or<00:02:56.370> little<00:02:56.580> pits<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> mud<00:02:57.239> when

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
bubbles or little pits in the mud when

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.680 
bubbles or little pits in the mud when
you<00:02:58.349> do<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.650> when<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:58.890> go<00:02:59.010> over<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.370> twice<00:02:59.690> it's

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
you do it when you go over it twice it's

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.380 
you do it when you go over it twice it's
not<00:03:00.840> necessary<00:03:01.380> but<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:01.920> find<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.370> does<00:03:02.519> help<00:03:02.819> so

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
not necessary but I find it does help so

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.759 
not necessary but I find it does help so
you<00:03:03.450> know<00:03:03.599> I'll<00:03:03.660> do<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> seam<00:03:04.080> once<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.650> then

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
you know I'll do the seam once and then

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.020 
you know I'll do the seam once and then
if<00:03:04.890> there's<00:03:05.040> little<00:03:05.160> bubbles<00:03:05.579> or<00:03:05.820> anything

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
if there's little bubbles or anything

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.090 
if there's little bubbles or anything
little<00:03:06.390> imperfections<00:03:07.079> in<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.290> I'll<00:03:07.620> run<00:03:07.980> it

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
little imperfections in it I'll run it

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.979 
little imperfections in it I'll run it
over<00:03:08.250> again<00:03:08.609> a<00:03:08.640> second<00:03:09.030> time<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.870> can

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
over again a second time so here you can

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.729 
over again a second time so here you can
see<00:03:10.140> I'm<00:03:10.230> going<00:03:10.440> one<00:03:10.650> way<00:03:10.829> I<00:03:11.160> flip<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> box<00:03:12.239> and

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
see I'm going one way I flip the box and

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.670 
see I'm going one way I flip the box and
I<00:03:13.739> finish<00:03:14.609> off<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.820> half<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.450> then<00:03:15.690> do<00:03:16.019> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
I finish off that half and then do the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.030 
I finish off that half and then do the
whole<00:03:16.859> seam<00:03:17.160> once<00:03:17.640> again<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:19.650> that's<00:03:19.859> called

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
whole seam once again so that's called

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.680 
whole seam once again so that's called
tracing<00:03:20.430> or<00:03:20.760> chasing<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.329> just<00:03:21.480> helps

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
tracing or chasing it just helps

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.020 
tracing or chasing it just helps
eliminate<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:22.170> rid<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.319> bubbles<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.609> here<00:03:23.819> on

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
eliminate get rid of bubbles so here on

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.789 
eliminate get rid of bubbles so here on
the<00:03:24.090> butt<00:03:24.239> joint<00:03:24.269> again<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.750> drop<00:03:25.140> my<00:03:25.170> tension<00:03:25.650> a

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
the butt joint again I drop my tension a

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.309 
the butt joint again I drop my tension a
little<00:03:25.920> bit<00:03:26.540> put<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.569> little<00:03:27.780> more<00:03:27.900> mud<00:03:28.079> on<00:03:28.170> in

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
little bit put a little more mud on in

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.009 
little bit put a little more mud on in
the<00:03:28.410> middle<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.829> tape<00:03:29.359> it<00:03:30.359> was<00:03:30.690> still<00:03:30.989> a

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
the middle of the tape it was still a

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.390 
the middle of the tape it was still a
little<00:03:31.170> thick<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.739> did<00:03:31.889> that<00:03:31.950> one<00:03:32.100> three

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
little thick so I did that one three

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.280 
little thick so I did that one three
times<00:03:32.579> just<00:03:33.000> because<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.900> know<00:03:33.989> that's<00:03:34.109> the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
times just because you know that's the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.069 
times just because you know that's the
beauty<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.590> having<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.370> box<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.959> can

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
beauty of having a box you know you can

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.170 
beauty of having a box you know you can
easily<00:03:37.290> adjust<00:03:37.530> your<00:03:37.980> your<00:03:38.489> attention<00:03:38.970> on<00:03:39.090> the

easily adjust your your attention on the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.300 
easily adjust your your attention on the
back<00:03:39.359> if<00:03:39.959> it's<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.470> little<00:03:40.709> bit<00:03:40.889> much<00:03:41.010> little

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
back if it's a little bit much little

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.550 
back if it's a little bit much little
too<00:03:41.430> thick<00:03:41.730> or<00:03:41.880> thin<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:43.019> adjust<00:03:43.230> that

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
too thick or thin you just adjust that

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.740 
too thick or thin you just adjust that
tension<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.220> do<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.880> again<00:03:45.090> put<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> little

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
tension and do it again put a little

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.680 
tension and do it again put a little
warm<00:03:45.930> butter<00:03:46.109> on<00:03:46.290> or<00:03:46.410> take<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> little<00:03:46.829> mud<00:03:47.190> off

warm butter on or take a little mud off

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.059 
warm butter on or take a little mud off
and<00:03:48.690> again<00:03:48.900> I'm<00:03:49.049> just<00:03:49.079> hitting<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.709> middle<00:03:49.950> of

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
and again I'm just hitting the middle of

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.400 
and again I'm just hitting the middle of
all<00:03:50.190> these<00:03:50.310> butt<00:03:50.519> joints<00:03:50.970> because<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.139> first

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
all these butt joints because the first

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.009 
all these butt joints because the first
pass<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:53.040> hit<00:03:53.459> either<00:03:53.670> side<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.660> can<00:03:54.810> do<00:03:54.900> it

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
pass I hit either side and you can do it

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.059 
pass I hit either side and you can do it
the<00:03:55.079> other<00:03:55.109> way<00:03:55.290> as<00:03:55.470> well<00:03:55.590> for<00:03:55.829> your<00:03:55.889> first

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
the other way as well for your first

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.890 
the other way as well for your first
pass<00:03:56.370> if<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.639> want<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.030> do<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.569> could<00:03:57.720> hit<00:03:57.870> the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
pass if you want to do you could hit the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.990 
pass if you want to do you could hit the
middle<00:03:58.200> build<00:03:59.100> out<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.340> middle<00:03:59.579> of<00:03:59.670> your<00:03:59.790> tape

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
middle build out the middle of your tape

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.390 
middle build out the middle of your tape
and<00:04:00.180> then<00:04:00.750> on<00:04:01.019> your<00:04:01.200> second<00:04:01.650> pass<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:02.069> can<00:04:02.250> hit

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
and then on your second pass you can hit

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.910 
and then on your second pass you can hit
either<00:04:02.609> side<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.319> that's<00:04:04.319> another<00:04:04.560> way<00:04:04.769> of

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
either side so that's another way of

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.580 
either side so that's another way of
doing<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.690> there<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.750> go<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:07.049> whole<00:04:07.260> room

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
doing it so there you go this whole room

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.890 
doing it so there you go this whole room
which<00:04:08.069> was<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.489> little<00:04:08.730> over<00:04:08.939> 14<00:04:09.330> feet<00:04:09.569> I<00:04:09.629> think

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
which was a little over 14 feet I think

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.860 
which was a little over 14 feet I think
14<00:04:10.290> by<00:04:10.409> 14<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:11.400> whole<00:04:11.640> room<00:04:11.909> took<00:04:12.209> three

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
14 by 14 this whole room took three

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.000 
14 by 14 this whole room took three
minutes<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.230> 38

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
minutes and 38

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.539 
minutes and 38
from<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.849> time<00:04:15.090> my<00:04:15.840> box<00:04:16.440> hit<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.889> first<00:04:17.190> flat

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
from the time my box hit the first flat

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.449 
from the time my box hit the first flat
until<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.660> pulled<00:04:18.989> off<00:04:19.199> from<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.769> last<00:04:20.070> flat

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
until I pulled off from that last flat

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.610 
until I pulled off from that last flat
three<00:04:20.850> minutes<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.180> 38<00:04:21.449> seconds<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.380> do<00:04:22.500> this

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
three minutes and 38 seconds to do this

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.530 
three minutes and 38 seconds to do this
whole<00:04:22.800> room<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.760> look<00:04:23.970> at<00:04:24.030> how<00:04:24.090> beautiful

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
whole room so look at how beautiful

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.450 
whole room so look at how beautiful
those<00:04:24.720> joints<00:04:25.199> are<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:25.530> know<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.650> flat<00:04:26.010> box<00:04:26.250> is

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
those joints are you know a flat box is

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.330 
those joints are you know a flat box is
really<00:04:26.699> hard<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.120> beat<00:04:27.479> at<00:04:27.750> time<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:28.530> quality

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
really hard to beat at time and quality

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.969 
really hard to beat at time and quality
wise<00:04:30.169> obviously<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.260> know<00:04:31.350> where<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.710> butt

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
wise obviously you know where the butt

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.250 
wise obviously you know where the butt
joint<00:04:32.010> intersects<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:33.060> flat<00:04:33.360> after<00:04:33.990> this<00:04:34.110> is

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
joint intersects the flat after this is

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.780 
joint intersects the flat after this is
all<00:04:34.350> dry<00:04:34.620> I'll<00:04:34.800> usually<00:04:34.949> just<00:04:35.190> do<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.460> quick
