so I thought I would do a secondary nuke
one<00:00:46.149> week<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.570> then<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.750> next<00:00:46.780> week<00:00:47.110> I<00:00:47.200> do<00:00:47.260> you

know<00:00:47.770> black<00:00:48.040> ops<00:00:48.280> gameplay<00:00:48.520> or<00:00:48.700> whatever<00:00:49.380> so

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
know black ops gameplay or whatever so

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.430 
know black ops gameplay or whatever so
that's<00:00:50.739> why<00:00:50.950> I<00:00:50.980> just<00:00:51.570> decided<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.899> do<00:00:53.320> the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440

can't do that with that's a stinger for

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.689 
can't do that with that's a stinger for
obvious<00:04:09.879> reasons<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.180> mean<00:04:10.329> if<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:11.549> were<00:04:12.549> like

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
obvious reasons I mean if you were like

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:13.949 
obvious reasons I mean if you were like
God<00:04:12.909> or<00:04:13.090> something<00:04:13.389> and<00:04:13.509> you<00:04:13.599> knew<00:04:13.780> how<00:04:13.900> to

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
God or something and you knew how to

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.349 
God or something and you knew how to
shoot<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.769> stinger<00:04:15.129> out<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.669> Harrier<00:04:16.180> that

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
shoot a stinger out a Harrier that

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.659 
shoot a stinger out a Harrier that
somehow<00:04:16.690> got<00:04:17.320> in<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.530> way<00:04:17.709> of<00:04:17.889> a<00:04:17.949> person<00:04:18.459> and

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
somehow got in the way of a person and

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.290 
somehow got in the way of a person and
you<00:04:19.479> got<00:04:19.659> like<00:04:20.139> a<00:04:20.169> six<00:04:20.590> kills<00:04:21.400> in<00:04:21.549> one<00:04:21.579> missile

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300
