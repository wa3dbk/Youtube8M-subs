00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
right all right so I have a cargo plane

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.410 
right all right so I have a cargo plane
with<00:02:34.030> me

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
with me

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.410 
with me
the<00:02:34.780> plan<00:02:35.019> is<00:02:35.230> cargo<00:02:35.739> plane<00:02:36.099> versus<00:02:36.849> angry

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
the plan is cargo plane versus angry

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.699 
the plan is cargo plane versus angry
planes<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:37.989> let's<00:02:38.140> see<00:02:38.319> how<00:02:38.440> long<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.620> last

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
planes so let's see how long you last

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.680 
planes so let's see how long you last
which<00:02:39.129> gonna<00:02:39.340> we're<00:02:40.000> gonna<00:02:40.120> take<00:02:40.329> off<00:02:40.480> first

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
which gonna we're gonna take off first

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.630 
which gonna we're gonna take off first
and<00:02:40.989> then<00:02:41.290> once<00:02:41.530> we're<00:02:41.680> was<00:02:42.010> once<00:02:42.280> we're<00:02:42.459> up

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
and we're flying I'm gonna set angry

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.800 
and we're flying I'm gonna set angry
planes<00:02:45.069> on<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.610> we're<00:02:45.700> gonna<00:02:45.819> see<00:02:46.030> how<00:02:46.209> see

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
planes on and we're gonna see how see

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.490 
planes on and we're gonna see how see
how<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:47.170> goes<00:02:47.410> for<00:02:47.440> us<00:02:47.769> three<00:02:48.310> two<00:02:49.060> one<00:02:49.900> boom

plane<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:58.209> looks<00:02:58.510> like<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> wasp<00:02:59.200> but<00:02:59.530> compared

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
plane it looks like a wasp but compared

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.960 
plane it looks like a wasp but compared
to<00:02:59.980> us<00:03:00.630> ready<00:03:01.630> so<00:03:02.590> far<00:03:02.889> I<00:03:03.280> wish<00:03:03.670> they<00:03:03.819> could

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
make cargo plane as part of the angry

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.450 
make cargo plane as part of the angry
planes<00:03:06.280> because<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.609> would<00:03:06.700> be<00:03:06.790> fucking

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
planes because that would be fucking

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.570

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
oh my goodness gracious what is going on

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.400 
oh my goodness gracious what is going on
right<00:03:36.770> now<00:03:37.120> ten<00:03:38.120> frames<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.720> second<00:03:39.170> would<00:03:39.290> you

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
right now ten frames a second would you

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.850 
right now ten frames a second would you
know<00:03:39.530> about<00:03:39.680> ten<00:03:40.010> frames<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.370> second<00:03:40.760> yo<00:03:44.860> this

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
know about ten frames a second yo this

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.680 
know about ten frames a second yo this
is<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.130> reason<00:03:46.400> why<00:03:46.550> I<00:03:46.820> wanted<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.210> go<00:03:47.390> higher

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
is the reason why I wanted to go higher

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.380 
is the reason why I wanted to go higher
because<00:03:47.960> I<00:03:48.200> know<00:03:48.260> big<00:03:49.250> planes<00:03:49.610> can<00:03:49.910> only<00:03:50.030> spawn

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
because I know big planes can only spawn

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.690 
because I know big planes can only spawn
at<00:03:50.660> higher<00:03:51.050> what<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.830> this<00:03:52.070> plane<00:03:52.310> doing<00:03:52.490> here

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
at higher what is this plane doing here

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.370 
at higher what is this plane doing here
it's<00:03:52.820> like<00:03:52.910> a<00:03:53.090> nosedive<00:03:53.360> is<00:03:53.780> there<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.930> near<00:03:54.230> me

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
it's like a nosedive is there a near me

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's like a nosedive is there a near me
right<00:03:54.590> I<00:03:55.490> think<00:03:55.610> we've<00:03:55.850> gone<00:03:56.000> out<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.240> range

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
right I think we've gone out the range

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.970 
right I think we've gone out the range
of<00:03:56.690> smaller<00:03:57.500> plane

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
planes we can take down before our tank

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.790 
planes we can take down before our tank
gets<00:05:04.680> taken<00:05:04.860> down<00:05:05.570> right<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:07.260> we<00:05:07.380> have<00:05:07.590> the

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
Santos let's see how long this tank can

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.590 
Santos let's see how long this tank can
last<00:05:13.530> with<00:05:14.130> angry<00:05:14.430> planes<00:05:14.670> on<00:05:14.850> all<00:05:15.030> right<00:05:15.150> guys

one<00:05:24.330> boom<00:05:24.780> right<00:05:25.380> let's<00:05:26.100> see<00:05:26.190> how<00:05:26.250> long<00:05:26.400> we<00:05:26.490> can

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
one boom right let's see how long we can

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.880 
one boom right let's see how long we can
like<00:05:27.240> our<00:05:27.390> goal<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:28.020> see<00:05:28.170> how<00:05:28.470> many<00:05:28.710> we<00:05:28.860> can

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
like our goal is to see how many we can

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.880 
like our goal is to see how many we can
take<00:05:29.190> out<00:05:29.400> just<00:05:29.880> with<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.150> tank<00:05:30.890> apparently

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
take out just with the tank apparently

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.140 
take out just with the tank apparently
we're<00:05:32.010> ripping<00:05:32.190> up<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.490> pavement<00:05:32.700> I<00:05:32.970> didn't

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
we're ripping up the pavement I didn't

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.370

even<00:05:33.240> know<00:05:33.360> that<00:05:33.390> was<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:33.660> thing<00:05:33.750> for<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.170> tank

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
even know that was a thing for the tank

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.040 
even know that was a thing for the tank
I<00:05:34.470> thought<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.710> tank<00:05:34.920> just<00:05:35.630> that<00:05:36.630> isn't<00:05:36.870> quite

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
I thought the tank just that isn't quite

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.270 
I thought the tank just that isn't quite
a<00:05:37.080> weird<00:05:37.320> sight<00:05:37.560> in<00:05:37.680> there<00:05:37.860> best

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
a weird sight in there best

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.620
