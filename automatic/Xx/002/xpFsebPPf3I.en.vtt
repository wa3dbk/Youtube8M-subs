dollars each maybe five so I got four of

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.329 
dollars each maybe five so I got four of
them<00:00:14.750> and<00:00:15.200> I'm<00:00:15.650> going<00:00:15.800> to<00:00:15.830> start<00:00:16.099> you<00:00:16.219> know

them and I'm going to start you know
practicing<00:00:16.999> drawing<00:00:17.240> in<00:00:17.539> them<00:00:17.689> and<00:00:18.409> every<00:00:18.619> now

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
practicing drawing in them and every now

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.249 
practicing drawing in them and every now
and<00:00:18.859> then<00:00:18.919> I'll<00:00:19.039> upload<00:00:19.909> a<00:00:20.390> little<00:00:20.989> update<00:00:21.230> for

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259

you and some of the stuff I've been

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.979 
you and some of the stuff I've been
doing<00:00:24.880> so<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:25.939> can<00:00:26.089> watch<00:00:26.210> me<00:00:26.239> learn<00:00:26.630> to<00:00:26.779> draw

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
doing so you can watch me learn to draw

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.609 
doing so you can watch me learn to draw
and<00:00:27.980> maybe<00:00:28.009> it'll<00:00:28.460> inspire<00:00:28.550> you<00:00:29.029> to<00:00:29.499> think<00:00:30.499> all

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
and maybe it'll inspire you to think all

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.240 
and maybe it'll inspire you to think all
it<00:00:30.710> takes<00:00:30.890> is<00:00:31.009> practice<00:00:31.570> so<00:00:32.980> here's<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.100> first

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
it takes is practice so here's the first

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.979 
it takes is practice so here's the first
update<00:00:36.280> alright<00:00:37.280> first<00:00:37.579> a<00:00:37.910> couple<00:00:38.390> things<00:00:38.629> I

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
update alright first a couple things I

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.349 
update alright first a couple things I
would<00:00:39.920> like<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:40.129> clarify<00:00:40.340> that<00:00:40.640> they're<00:00:41.059> not

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
would like to clarify that they're not

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.979 
would like to clarify that they're not
100<00:00:42.079> hands<00:00:42.260> in<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:42.530> video<00:00:42.859> but<00:00:43.670> 102<00:00:44.420> hands

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
100 hands in this video but 102 hands

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.750 
100 hands in this video but 102 hands
don't<00:00:45.410> want<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.649> sell<00:00:45.829> myself<00:00:45.980> short<00:00:46.280> they're

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
don't want to sell myself short they're

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.139 
don't want to sell myself short they're
also<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:48.670> initially<00:00:49.670> went<00:00:50.030> out<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.390> draw<00:00:52.149> 500

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
also I initially went out to draw 500

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.900 
also I initially went out to draw 500
hands<00:00:53.390> but<00:00:54.079> after<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.440> first<00:00:54.710> 100<00:00:55.339> I<00:00:55.429> realized

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
hands but after the first 100 I realized

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.829 
hands but after the first 100 I realized
that<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:58.550> might<00:00:58.609> not<00:00:58.909> be<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.149> best<00:00:59.269> use<00:00:59.570> of<00:00:59.690> my

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
that it might not be the best use of my

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.579 
that it might not be the best use of my
time<00:01:00.109> I<00:01:01.030> learned<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.210> draw<00:01:02.420> time<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.899> is<00:01:03.079> and

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
time I learned to draw time that is and

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.920 
time I learned to draw time that is and
I<00:01:03.679> could<00:01:04.190> concentrate<00:01:04.550> on<00:01:04.820> drawing<00:01:05.570> fewer

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
I could concentrate on drawing fewer

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.390 
I could concentrate on drawing fewer
hands<00:01:06.200> better<00:01:06.530> maybe<00:01:07.010> or<00:01:07.720> also<00:01:08.720> other<00:01:09.400> other

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
hands better maybe or also other other

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.090 
hands better maybe or also other other
things<00:01:10.720> you<00:01:11.720> know<00:01:11.780> just<00:01:12.050> other<00:01:12.200> things<00:01:12.260> this

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
things you know just other things this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.140 
things you know just other things this
was<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> lot<00:01:13.550> more<00:01:15.190> what<00:01:16.190> was<00:01:16.820> more<00:01:16.970> difficult

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
was a lot more what was more difficult

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.780 
was a lot more what was more difficult
than<00:01:17.510> I<00:01:17.600> had<00:01:17.630> anticipated<00:01:18.280> I'd<00:01:19.280> never<00:01:19.460> really

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
than I had anticipated I'd never really

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.750 
than I had anticipated I'd never really
seriously<00:01:20.210> sat<00:01:20.480> down<00:01:20.660> to<00:01:20.900> draw<00:01:21.050> hands<00:01:21.320> before

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
seriously sat down to draw hands before

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.070 
seriously sat down to draw hands before
except<00:01:22.760> for<00:01:22.910> once<00:01:23.210> or<00:01:23.360> twice<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:23.930> was

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
except for once or twice and it was

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.980 
except for once or twice and it was
always<00:01:24.380> kind<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.770> discouraging<00:01:25.430> because

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
always kind of discouraging because

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.120 
always kind of discouraging because
everyone<00:01:26.990> knows<00:01:27.140> what<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> hand<00:01:27.650> looks<00:01:27.890> like

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
everyone knows what a hand looks like

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.880 
everyone knows what a hand looks like
and<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:28.970> get<00:01:29.120> one<00:01:29.270> little<00:01:29.420> part<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:30.710> the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
and you get one little part of the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.800 
and you get one little part of the
proportions<00:01:31.460> off<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.420> whole<00:01:32.570> thing

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
proportions off and the whole thing

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.650 
proportions off and the whole thing
looks<00:01:32.840> weird<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.970> it's<00:01:34.970> not<00:01:35.180> like<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.480> can

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
looks weird and it's not like you can

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.530 
looks weird and it's not like you can
get<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:35.870> half<00:01:36.110> right<00:01:36.610> it's<00:01:37.610> just<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.360> looks

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
get it half right it's just it looks

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.770 
get it half right it's just it looks
like<00:01:38.690> an<00:01:38.840> alien<00:01:38.960> hand<00:01:39.470> or<00:01:39.710> maybe<00:01:39.980> someone<00:01:40.820> has

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
like an alien hand or maybe someone has

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.980 
like an alien hand or maybe someone has
elephantitis<00:01:42.320> or<00:01:42.710> something<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.760> know<00:01:43.990> it's

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
elephantitis or something you know it's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.910 
elephantitis or something you know it's
just<00:01:45.080> no<00:01:45.290> no<00:01:45.710> bueno<00:01:45.970> but<00:01:46.970> uh<00:01:47.050> as<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.320> went<00:01:48.530> on<00:01:48.650> I

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
just no no bueno but uh as I went on I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.920 
just no no bueno but uh as I went on I
just<00:01:49.250> forced<00:01:49.670> myself<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:50.120> keep<00:01:50.360> drawing<00:01:50.810> I

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
just forced myself to keep drawing I

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.800 
just forced myself to keep drawing I
used<00:01:51.260> a<00:01:51.380> pen<00:01:51.620> so<00:01:52.430> I<00:01:52.460> wouldn't<00:01:52.790> be<00:01:52.850> tempted<00:01:53.630> to

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
used a pen so I wouldn't be tempted to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.970 
used a pen so I wouldn't be tempted to
erase<00:01:54.230> a<00:01:54.590> pencil<00:01:55.580> is<00:01:55.640> probably<00:01:55.850> better<00:01:56.150> for

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
erase a pencil is probably better for

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.030 
erase a pencil is probably better for
another<00:01:57.980> reason<00:01:58.190> than<00:01:58.430> that<00:01:58.490> but<00:01:59.110> um

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
another reason than that but um

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.570 
another reason than that but um
as<00:02:01.910> I<00:02:02.060> progressed<00:02:02.480> and<00:02:02.690> drew<00:02:02.810> more<00:02:02.960> hands<00:02:03.580> I've

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
as I progressed and drew more hands I've

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.510 
as I progressed and drew more hands I've
slowly<00:02:05.060> felt<00:02:05.420> better<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.810> better<00:02:05.960> about<00:02:06.260> them

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
slowly felt better and better about them

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.100 
slowly felt better and better about them
still<00:02:07.520> drew<00:02:07.730> lots<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.060> hands<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.450> wasn't<00:02:08.780> happy

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
still drew lots of hands I wasn't happy

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.050 
still drew lots of hands I wasn't happy
with<00:02:09.259> but<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:09.890> drew<00:02:10.250> more<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.550> more<00:02:10.670> hands<00:02:10.850> that

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
with but I drew more and more hands that

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.470 
with but I drew more and more hands that
I<00:02:11.090> was<00:02:11.360> happy<00:02:11.630> with<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.520> know<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.610> mean<00:02:13.820> if<00:02:14.330> you

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
I was happy with you know I mean if you

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.540 
I was happy with you know I mean if you
do<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.050> recommend<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.920> maybe<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.370> don't

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
do this I recommend that maybe you don't

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.400 
do this I recommend that maybe you don't
draw<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.850> hundred<00:02:17.300> but<00:02:17.690> just<00:02:17.870> concentrate<00:02:18.350> on

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
draw a hundred but just concentrate on

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.980 
draw a hundred but just concentrate on
drawing<00:02:18.740> fewer<00:02:19.460> hands<00:02:19.700> better<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.300> also<00:02:20.840> you

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
drawing fewer hands better and also you

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.380 
drawing fewer hands better and also you
can<00:02:21.710> see<00:02:21.920> here<00:02:22.100> I'm<00:02:22.190> doing<00:02:22.340> more<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.850> line

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
can see here I'm doing more of a line

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.930 
can see here I'm doing more of a line
drawing<00:02:23.810> technique<00:02:24.410> which<00:02:25.340> might<00:02:25.580> not<00:02:25.670> be<00:02:25.730> the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
drawing technique which might not be the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.630 
drawing technique which might not be the
best<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.620> art<00:02:27.620> school<00:02:27.860> apparently<00:02:28.280> they<00:02:28.400> teach

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
best in art school apparently they teach

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.020 
best in art school apparently they teach
you<00:02:29.140> gesture<00:02:30.140> drawing<00:02:30.470> which<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.910> know

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
you gesture drawing which is you know

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.080 
you gesture drawing which is you know
just<00:02:32.240> light<00:02:32.560> sketchy<00:02:33.560> strokes<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:37.430> outline

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
just light sketchy strokes that outline

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.210 
just light sketchy strokes that outline
the<00:02:38.120> basic<00:02:38.630> shapes<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.530> structure<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.100> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
the basic shapes and structure of the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.980 
the basic shapes and structure of the
hand<00:02:40.400> first<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.880> then<00:02:41.060> if<00:02:41.240> once<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.780> get<00:02:41.870> that

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
hand first and then if once you get that

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.150 
hand first and then if once you get that
down<00:02:42.140> pat<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.590> can<00:02:42.709> go<00:02:42.800> back<00:02:42.920> into<00:02:43.100> the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
down pat you can go back into the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.490 
down pat you can go back into the
details<00:02:43.670> I'm<00:02:44.150> kind<00:02:44.630> of<00:02:44.720> almost<00:02:45.050> adding<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
details I'm kind of almost adding the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.020 
details I'm kind of almost adding the
details<00:02:45.920> at<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.190> same<00:02:46.400> time<00:02:46.640> I'm<00:02:46.760> adding

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
details at the same time I'm adding

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.890 
details at the same time I'm adding
basic<00:02:47.900> structure<00:02:48.260> here<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.560> these<00:02:49.900> that's

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
basic structure here in these that's

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.300 
basic structure here in these that's
like<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.950> see<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.280> first<00:02:52.670> few<00:02:52.940> hands<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.270> drew

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
like you see the first few hands I drew

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.380 
like you see the first few hands I drew
we're<00:02:55.310> very<00:02:55.700> flat<00:02:56.120> looking<00:02:57.430> as<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.489> as<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.060> video

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
we're very flat looking as a as a video

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.790 
we're very flat looking as a as a video
progresses<00:02:59.630> you'll<00:03:00.020> see<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.290> try<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.620> add

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
progresses you'll see that I try to add

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.360 
progresses you'll see that I try to add
more<00:03:01.130> value<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.150> shading<00:03:02.890> which<00:03:03.890> isn't<00:03:04.220> the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
more value and shading which isn't the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.070 
more value and shading which isn't the
easiest<00:03:04.670> thing<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.940> do<00:03:05.030> with<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.150> pen<00:03:05.450> for<00:03:05.870> a

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
easiest thing to do with a pen for a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.680 
easiest thing to do with a pen for a
beginner<00:03:06.440> anyways<00:03:07.150> as<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.300> can<00:03:08.420> pretty<00:03:08.540> much

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
beginner anyways as you can pretty much

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.560 
beginner anyways as you can pretty much
only<00:03:08.840> make<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.230> lines<00:03:10.000> darker<00:03:11.000> or<00:03:11.209> add

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
only make the lines darker or add

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.680 
only make the lines darker or add
hatching<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:13.489> pencil<00:03:14.120> would<00:03:14.360> probably<00:03:14.630> be

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
hatching and a pencil would probably be

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.410 
hatching and a pencil would probably be
better<00:03:14.840> for<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:15.170> but<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:16.150> carried<00:03:17.150> on<00:03:17.269> with

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
better for that but I carried on with

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.500 
better for that but I carried on with
the<00:03:17.450> pen

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.170 

100<00:03:23.170> hands<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> lot<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.910> was<00:03:25.030> thinking

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
100 hands is a lot and I was thinking

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.380 
100 hands is a lot and I was thinking
about<00:03:25.510> how<00:03:25.840> many<00:03:26.020> that<00:03:26.170> was<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:27.150> know<00:03:28.150> I've

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
about how many that was I know I've

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.260 
about how many that was I know I've
shaken<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.930> hundred<00:03:29.260> hands<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.950> other<00:03:30.130> people

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
shaken a hundred hands of other people

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.870 
shaken a hundred hands of other people
but<00:03:31.270> I<00:03:31.739> can't<00:03:32.739> really<00:03:32.860> think<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.430> hundred

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
but I can't really think of a hundred

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.640 
but I can't really think of a hundred
times<00:03:34.239> I've<00:03:34.450> shaken<00:03:34.630> someone's<00:03:35.110> hand

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
times I've shaken someone's hand

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.990 
times I've shaken someone's hand
because<00:03:36.069> you<00:03:36.160> don't<00:03:36.310> really<00:03:36.459> remember<00:03:36.640> those

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
because you don't really remember those

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.370 
because you don't really remember those
sorts<00:03:37.300> of<00:03:37.390> things<00:03:37.599> they're<00:03:38.020> just<00:03:38.230> like

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
sorts of things they're just like

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.470 
sorts of things they're just like
fleeting<00:03:38.770> moments<00:03:39.160> shake<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.300> guy's<00:03:40.450> hand

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
fleeting moments shake the guy's hand

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.120 
fleeting moments shake the guy's hand
and<00:03:40.930> it's<00:03:41.080> gone<00:03:41.260> why<00:03:41.680> would<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:41.890> need<00:03:42.040> to

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
and it's gone why would you need to

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.520 
and it's gone why would you need to
remember<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.900> sometimes<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.200> remember<00:03:44.319> a

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
remember that sometimes I remember a

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.050 
remember that sometimes I remember a
person<00:03:44.739> because<00:03:45.130> they<00:03:45.250> gave<00:03:45.400> me<00:03:45.580> a<00:03:45.610> weekend

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
person because they gave me a weekend

for a good manly handshake and you just
kind<00:03:52.510> of<00:03:52.540> feel<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:52.930> squishy<00:03:53.680> thing<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.250> they

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
kind of feel this squishy thing and they

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.590 
kind of feel this squishy thing and they
give<00:03:54.580> you<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:55.019> slight<00:03:56.019> wiggle<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:58.390> walk

give you a slight wiggle and you walk

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.910 
give you a slight wiggle and you walk
away<00:03:58.780> thoroughly<00:03:59.319> unsatisfied<00:04:01.530> but<00:04:02.530> that's

away thoroughly unsatisfied but that's

not what this video is about this
probably<00:04:07.810> took<00:04:08.049> about<00:04:08.350> uh<00:04:08.410> is<00:04:08.980> probably<00:04:09.130> about

probably took about uh is probably about

probably took about uh is probably about
