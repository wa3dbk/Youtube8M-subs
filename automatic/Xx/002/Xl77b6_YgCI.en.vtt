00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
didn't do it in this video but uh I did

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.350 
didn't do it in this video but uh I did
it<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.310> co-op<00:01:24.670> partner<00:01:24.850> when<00:01:25.149> I<00:01:25.240> was

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
it with the co-op partner when I was

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.690 
it with the co-op partner when I was
playing<00:01:25.539> this<00:01:25.719> game<00:01:26.049> before<00:01:29.189> I'm<00:01:30.189> not<00:01:30.430> exactly

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
playing this game before I'm not exactly

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.859 
playing this game before I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:30.820> how<00:01:30.939> to<00:01:30.969> do<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.210> but<00:01:31.390> apparently<00:01:31.689> just

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
sure how to do it but apparently just

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.569 
sure how to do it but apparently just
run<00:01:32.020> over<00:01:32.049> there<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.380> press<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.039> button<00:01:33.130> or

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
run over there and press the a button or

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:39.740 
run over there and press the a button or
something

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.300 

and<00:01:40.750> then<00:01:41.320> just<00:01:41.440> have<00:01:41.530> one<00:01:41.680> person<00:01:41.860> sit<00:01:42.130> on<00:01:42.220> the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
and then just have one person sit on the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.770 
and then just have one person sit on the
turret<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.729> mow<00:01:42.880> down<00:01:43.060> everybody<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:43.600> comes

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
turret and mow down everybody that comes

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.360 
turret and mow down everybody that comes
your<00:01:43.930> way<00:01:44.110> just<00:01:44.770> hold<00:01:44.950> down<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.159> trigger

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
your way just hold down the trigger

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.660 
your way just hold down the trigger
because<00:01:45.610> that<00:01:45.970> uh<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:48.250> makes<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.520> really

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
because that uh that makes it really

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.040 
because that uh that makes it really
easy<00:01:48.760> for<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.180> other<00:01:49.270> person<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:49.780> run<00:01:49.900> around

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
easy for the other person to run around

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.460 
easy for the other person to run around
like<00:01:50.800> almost<00:01:51.040> completely<00:01:51.400> invisible<00:01:55.470> other

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
like almost completely invisible other

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.420 
like almost completely invisible other
than<00:01:56.650> that<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:56.950> area<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.310> pretty

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
than that this area is pretty

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.370 
than that this area is pretty
straightforward<00:01:57.820> there's<00:01:58.750> also<00:01:58.869> an<00:01:59.050> Intel

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
straightforward there's also an Intel

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.290 
straightforward there's also an Intel
hidden<00:01:59.650> behind<00:01:59.950> one<00:02:00.160> of<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.400> tents<00:02:00.940> in<00:02:01.240> the
