00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.280 

actually<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:09.390> they're<00:03:09.510> sexy<00:03:09.989> look<00:03:10.140> at

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290

actually I think they're sexy look at
the<00:03:10.380> two<00:03:10.560> actually<00:03:11.100> but<00:03:12.200> my<00:03:13.200> color<00:03:13.560> has

the two actually but my color has
changed<00:03:14.070> again<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.239> I'm<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.709> don't<00:03:17.430> think

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
changed again so I'm like I don't think
