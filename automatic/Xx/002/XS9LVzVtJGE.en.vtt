00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.389
 hello everyone welcome on the 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.580
 nonsense schnell today I you 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.520
 offers to make a pasta gratin 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.800
 with black olives peppers with lots of 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.230
 coulon cheese and unctuous go see 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.759
 it's super easy it's gone for 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.710
 start this recipe we are already going to 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.910
 finely chop the onions and then 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.410
 we will do the same thing with the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.329
 pepper so you cut it in half you 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.440
 remove the seeds so go hull and 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.989
 then you go size and 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.100
 straps and after you go re-cut 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.470
 in the other direction and you're going to get 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.300
 little cubes that's the principle is 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.769
 to have small pieces give 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.809
 small pieces of peppers here more 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.309
 or less of the same size we are going 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.960
 then prepare the mushrooms so 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.489
 you cut off the end of the foot and 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.079
 then you just go 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.420
 stuffed animals and once they are ready 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.809
 wanted to cut such finely into small 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.239
 parts 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.890
 we will now go to cooking 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.629
 so you take a big skillet and on 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.609
 a medium-bright fire you will add 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.749
 olive oil with butter you 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.330
 mix for all are well distributed 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:07.490
 and then we'll come and add them 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.530
 onions you mix we will continue 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.180
 then by adding the little ones from 2 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.610
 peppers and we finish with 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.500
 mushrooms you mix well you 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.590
 put salt pepper and leave you 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.299
 cook roughly like that 5 6 minutes 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.100
 so here after five minutes everything 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.990
 start and a little golden there we go 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.350
 come add to their care to chisel it 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.390
 finely 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.759
 or then you pulp it down so 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.680
 you add your ipad we give you 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.350
 change again and then on a fire 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.119
 sweet ways we will add the flour on 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.740
 incorporate it well and when it is 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.130
 incorporated we will be able to add some 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.770
 cream 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.829
 we mix well and then we go 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.750
 add the tomato paste 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.460
 mix again and if you find that 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.159
 your preparation is a little bit too much 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.420
 sticky a little pasty you add a 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.530
 little bit of milk in front of me I have 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.539
 added what I think is a little 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.719
 too compact so a little bit of milk 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.490
 we mix gently we continue in there 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.159
 adding small pieces of olives 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.119
 black with fresh basil 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.950
 the northern shores you can replace them 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.570
 a parent of green olives or anything 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.000
 what other color does not matter 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.800
 mix your preparation again 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.450
 go recipe almost completed 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.460
 now we will add our 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.500
 leg preparation so already cooked 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.860
 obviously we think about cooking them 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.900
 before 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.730
 so here you have added them you go 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.650
 mix well then we will add 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.660
 some of the cheese so pretty much the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.670
 half or a little bit less you 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.650
 add this cheese give you langer to 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.750
 again how hot everything is 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.140
 melt and then you will transfer 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.060
 all that in a big dish gratin 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.700
 you add at that moment their s2 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.170
 grated cheese and then place you under 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.640
 the oven rack so like pasta 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.110
 are hot and the sauce is fine 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.500
 go fast huh it's just place at 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.750
 oven 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.400
 in fact to make gratin the top 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.540
 so your cheese so here you are 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.700
 leave a few minutes 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.120
 and when the cheese cool and that's that 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.290
 it is well au gratin and golden it's ready 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.940
 So here you have nothing left but 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.770
 enjoy doing something nice with a 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.270
 green salad it is great that marries 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.800
 that it's still pretty rich so 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.180
 here with the salad is perfect in 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.709
