recruited<00:03:07.930> players<00:03:08.200> who<00:03:08.980> will<00:03:09.400> add<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.820> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
recruited players who will add to the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.979 
recruited players who will add to the
squad<00:03:10.290> there's<00:03:11.290> no<00:03:11.440> point<00:03:11.709> in<00:03:11.890> bringing<00:03:12.040> in

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
squad there's no point in bringing in

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.630 
squad there's no point in bringing in
players<00:03:13.989> who<00:03:14.320> will<00:03:14.620> just<00:03:14.950> fill<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.340> squad

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
players who will just fill the squad

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.539 
players who will just fill the squad
they've<00:03:16.239> got<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.660> add<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:18.010> think<00:03:18.310> that

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
they've got to add to it so I think that

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.940

that<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.840> quality<00:03:20.260> will<00:03:20.620> be<00:03:20.650> an

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
that that the quality will be an

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.269 
that that the quality will be an
