 vest which has 7 cargo compartments 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.500
 this piece of equipment is wonderful 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.179
 suitable for ukrainian submarines 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.620
 hunters 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.710
 forced most of the year to hunt 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.270
 in the cold waters of our reservoirs hunting in 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 cold water implies 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.710
 the use of thick wetsuits that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.449
 in turn forces the hunter 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.760
 hang onto your weight belt

 large amount of lead cargo 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.510
 also when using the entire load 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.309
 lumbar weight only 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.620
 the spine is experiencing 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.500
 significant loads that ultimately can 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 lead to disc displacement as well as sharply

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.230
 correctly distribute the load on the body 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.949
 if you remove the overload with

 dive and float vest does not have 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.530
 protruding elements which 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.000
 could cause the hook in 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.030
 hunting time in the grottoes 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.340
 or under woody debris provides 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.580
 the center of gravity on the back is not 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.460
 limiting the mobility of hunters 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.450
 sizes from s to 2xl 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.720
 It is recommended to place up to forty 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.380
 percent of the cargo vest and 60 on the belt 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:37.290

 greater density this type of neoprene 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.119
 has significantly less positive 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.399
 buoyancy which means less load 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.310
 will go to compensate for buoyancy itself 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.070
 vest vest very well unloads
