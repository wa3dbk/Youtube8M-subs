00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.230
 how about champions again with you 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.710
 to let them see a failure of a 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.420
 motherboard 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.350
 of a desktop PC that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.050
 the image was constantly 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.189
 the monitor 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.410
 and then this checking this fashion we saw 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.470
 that there was an integrated warming 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.960
 in excess that this one is sometimes achieved 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.300
 distinguish that is there where the 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.190
 red light 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.769
 this integrated 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.300
 it got too hot and it did not bring 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:46.399
 sink then what we did was 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.440
 put a heat sink but as 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.469
 paste it like they come from glued factories 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.860
 most already come with a heatsink and 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.850
 they bring 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.790
 and bring your insurance to like this that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.190
 show down here to get stuck 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.840
 but in this not then what we did 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.360
 was to glue it with a glue that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.470
 epoxy flame here on this side is the cb 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:18.210
 the black of how it was stuck and already the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.910
 apc is no longer used again then 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.729
 I leave this guy so that if someone 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.250
 have some problem similar to mine what 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.170
 can solve and right now I'm going to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.130
 to show 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.159
 merely epoxic 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.770
 he always took care to paste this 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.020
 this heat sink logically from 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.619
 Charo its light the silicone paste 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.810
 so he disciplined connecting them and there 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.179
 I leave you then this you know 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.670
 subscribe to my channel and hand up 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.520
 to continue creating electronic tips 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.149
 thank you and see you in the next video 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.149
 see you later
