00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
from rolling and I've pressed down my

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.499 
from rolling and I've pressed down my
casing<00:00:20.810> again<00:00:21.130> so<00:00:22.130> that<00:00:22.250> I<00:00:22.279> have<00:00:22.429> a<00:00:22.460> nice<00:00:22.730> wide

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
casing again so that I have a nice wide

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.650 
casing again so that I have a nice wide
space<00:00:23.869> for<00:00:24.109> that<00:00:24.199> to<00:00:24.380> go<00:00:24.500> through<00:00:24.669> and<00:00:25.669> I'm

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
space for that to go through and I'm

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.659 
space for that to go through and I'm
just<00:00:26.929> going<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:27.169> start<00:00:27.560> it<00:00:27.769> out<00:00:28.419> by<00:00:29.419> running<00:00:29.960> a

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
just going to start it out by running a

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.200 
just going to start it out by running a
straight<00:00:31.669> stitch<00:00:31.909> down<00:00:32.150> the<00:00:32.930> back<00:00:33.140> side<00:00:34.210> or

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
straight stitch down the back side or

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.490 
straight stitch down the back side or
the<00:00:35.329> bottom<00:00:35.629> side<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:35.989> I<00:00:36.020> can<00:00:36.079> run<00:00:36.379> that

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
the bottom side so I can run that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.340 
the bottom side so I can run that
through

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
made so that it doesn't bend there's a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.540 
made so that it doesn't bend there's a
lot<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.610> elastics<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.540> will<00:00:49.809> Bend<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:51.340> is<00:00:51.520> a

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
lot of elastics that will Bend this is a

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.340 
lot of elastics that will Bend this is a
great<00:00:51.820> one<00:00:51.940> for<00:00:52.000> that<00:00:57.960> once<00:00:58.960> I<00:00:59.080> get<00:00:59.230> that

through to my desired elasticity and I'm
not<00:01:21.310> go<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.580> much<00:01:24.509> again<00:01:25.509> I'm<00:01:25.630> just<00:01:25.780> going<00:01:25.930> to

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
and then I can run it even two more

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.030 
and then I can run it even two more
times<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.200> just<00:02:41.440> gives<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.800> really
