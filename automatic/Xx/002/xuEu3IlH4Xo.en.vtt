00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
all this is this is my droid factory

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.919 
all this is this is my droid factory
small<00:00:09.690> but<00:00:09.990> that's<00:00:10.650> kind<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.010> looks<00:00:11.160> cool<00:00:11.340> oh

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
production area this little area right

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.480 
production area this little area right
here<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.320> I'm<00:00:19.410> zooming<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.220> where

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
here that I'm zooming in on is where

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.720 
here that I'm zooming in on is where
they<00:00:20.640> make<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.890> like<00:00:22.890> parts<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.490> droids

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
they make the like parts for the droids

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.900 
they make the like parts for the droids
its<00:00:24.449> communications<00:00:25.170> array<00:00:25.439> that's<00:00:25.920> right

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
its communications array that's right

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.479 
its communications array that's right
there<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.320> fair<00:00:29.039> amount<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:31.489> you<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.610> I

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
there is a fair amount is a you know I

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.680 
there is a fair amount is a you know I
just<00:00:35.489> put<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.640> look<00:00:35.969> cool<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> think

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
imprints on to the droid and they cut

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.060 
imprints on to the droid and they cut
and<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.110> put<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.680> wiring<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.250> such<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.149> then

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
and they put in wiring and such and then

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.369 
and they put in wiring and such and then
come<00:00:59.070> over<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.510> thing<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.199> I'm

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
it's like one of those things that um

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.840 
it's like one of those things that um
sorry<00:01:10.049> my<00:01:10.170> hands<00:01:10.380> no<00:01:10.530> way<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.729> those

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
sorry my hands no way it's one of those

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.730 
sorry my hands no way it's one of those
things<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:13.369> can<00:01:14.570> like<00:01:15.570> integrate<00:01:16.530> more

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
things that can like integrate more

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.160 
things that can like integrate more
wiring<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.460> fuse<00:01:17.790> wiring<00:01:18.299> whatever<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.020> want

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
wiring or fuse wiring whatever you want

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.249 
wiring or fuse wiring whatever you want
so<00:01:19.530> goes<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.689> integrating<00:01:21.689> wiring<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
so goes it's like integrating wiring I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.950 
so goes it's like integrating wiring I
guess<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> am<00:01:22.850> then<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> fire<00:01:24.180> right<00:01:24.479> there<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
guess I am then the fire right there is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.289 
guess I am then the fire right there is
to<00:01:25.680> heat<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.070> again<00:01:27.619> okay<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.970> right<00:01:29.970> there

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to heat it up again okay and right there

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.120 
to heat it up again okay and right there
that<00:01:31.110> thing<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:32.670> scanner<00:01:33.740> let<00:01:34.740> me<00:01:34.799> bring<00:01:35.009> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that thing is a scanner let me bring it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.850 
that thing is a scanner let me bring it
around<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.490> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.180> better<00:01:36.860> but

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
around you can kind of see it better but

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.280 
around you can kind of see it better but
it's<00:01:38.159> um<00:01:40.189> oops<00:01:41.189> let<00:01:41.640> me<00:01:41.670> zoom<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:42.420> alright

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
it's um oops let me zoom way out alright

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
it's um oops let me zoom way out alright
so<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.280> part<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> scanner<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.210> blue

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
so that part of the scanner that blue

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.899 
so that part of the scanner that blue
piece<00:01:45.689> AC<00:01:45.899> right<00:01:46.320> under<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> miss<00:01:47.159> buck<00:01:47.490> this

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
piece AC right under it miss buck this

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.970 
piece AC right under it miss buck this
part<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> scanner

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.030 

and<00:01:51.880> then<00:01:52.630> once<00:01:53.200> all<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.440> pieces<00:01:53.560> are<00:01:53.830> done

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
and then once all the pieces are done

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.980 
and then once all the pieces are done
this<00:01:54.220> thing<00:01:54.460> will<00:01:54.850> swivel<00:01:55.120> and<00:01:56.160> I<00:01:57.160> like<00:01:57.670> it

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
this thing will swivel and I like it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.060 
this thing will swivel and I like it
it's<00:01:58.990> pretty<00:01:59.140> cool<00:01:59.350> in<00:01:59.470> my<00:01:59.500> opinion<00:02:01.830> this<00:02:02.830> will

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
it's pretty cool in my opinion this will

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.690 
it's pretty cool in my opinion this will
go<00:02:03.190> down<00:02:03.220> like<00:02:04.030> that<00:02:04.330> pick<00:02:04.930> up<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.230> item<00:02:05.700> move

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
go down like that pick up the item move

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.580 
go down like that pick up the item move
back<00:02:07.030> up<00:02:07.260> sorry<00:02:08.940> those<00:02:09.940> back<00:02:10.150> up<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.570> twist<00:02:11.410> it

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
back up sorry those back up and twist it

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.850 
back up sorry those back up and twist it
and<00:02:11.830> then<00:02:12.630> normally<00:02:13.630> it's<00:02:13.750> over<00:02:13.930> here<00:02:14.140> and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
and then normally it's over here and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.560 
and then normally it's over here and
then<00:02:15.010> I'll<00:02:15.130> drop<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.400> off<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:16.120> bin<00:02:16.330> over

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
then I'll drop it off in that bin over

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.620 
then I'll drop it off in that bin over
there<00:02:16.780> has<00:02:17.380> been<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.820> just<00:02:19.090> drop<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.450> piece

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
there has been so just drop the piece

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.810 
there has been so just drop the piece
off<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.830> then<00:02:21.070> you<00:02:21.160> might<00:02:21.310> be<00:02:21.400> wondering<00:02:21.580> what

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
off and then you might be wondering what

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.380 
off and then you might be wondering what
this<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:23.190> basically<00:02:24.190> what<00:02:24.460> it<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:25.060> just

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
this is basically what it is is just

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.100 
this is basically what it is is just
like<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:26.610> cools<00:02:27.610> everything<00:02:28.120> off<00:02:28.330> comp<00:02:28.960> its

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
like it cools everything off comp its
