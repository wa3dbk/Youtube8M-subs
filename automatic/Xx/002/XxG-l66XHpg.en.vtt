00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the second thing is how to enable it in

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
the second thing is how to enable it in
cm<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.789> for<00:00:59.969> some<00:01:00.090> reason<00:01:00.120> maybe<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.780> just

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
cm so for some reason maybe it's just

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.360 
cm so for some reason maybe it's just
cuz<00:01:00.989> I'm<00:01:01.140> way<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> loop<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.280> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
cuz I'm way out of the loop when it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.979 
cuz I'm way out of the loop when it
comes<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.640> roms<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.030> took<00:01:03.149> me<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.359> 20<00:01:03.539> minutes

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
comes to roms it took me like 20 minutes

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.289 
comes to roms it took me like 20 minutes
to<00:01:04.439> hear<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.830> how<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> enable<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.729> thing<00:01:05.939> so
