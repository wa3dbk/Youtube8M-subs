00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.710
 here are some products of the line a 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.120
 maicon 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.099
 all these products are organic 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.170
 saw biodegradable and are highly 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.960
 concentrated 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.460
 we say a higher price than the products 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.180
 that we normally find in the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.859
 supermarket 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.960
 however these products have to be diluted 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.939
 therefore in practice 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.260
 we therefore make even less plastic 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.550
 so let's help the environment 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.510
 we leave on the left we have the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.840
 shower product next door 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.629
 the one for the green kitchen that one 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.540
 rather blue for glasses then 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.340
 we have that of the bathroom finally that 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.920
 for dishes all these products in 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.899
 practice I have product that I am 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.140
 of recharges in practice us with that 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.780
 product we recharge one more times 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.120
 sprayer such as in this 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.430
 case the sprayer this for the dishes 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.660
 half-liter 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.629
 this is a one-liter refill 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.119
 we recharge practically eight times the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.799
 our sprayer and we will have a product 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.950
 exceptional at the most good levels 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.799
 found on premium in the supermarket 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.090
 traditional so the same rildo that one 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.759
 they are all organic products of the video 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.840
 grada black called in practice you see 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.369
 which I practically already have almost 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.970
 finished because I 've already reloaded it 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.820
 the shark three times I have to recharge it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.600
 practically when I finish this part 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 I will recharge with this last product 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.040
 then I will put the water on the cleat 3 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.909
 to 1 then for friends who have i 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.380
 products 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.479
 have not yet figured out how it works 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.729
 all these products so you see 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.869
 here they are to be diluted in the same way 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.899
 water up to where it says 3 1 then 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.539
 a portion a part up to the middle 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.209
 liter than from this cleat of 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.189
 produced in practice three parts of water 1 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.740

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.330
 sometimes a sprayer then if ad 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.629
 example we had to say a price 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.989
 roughly in this for the glasses that 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.760
 costs about 4 euros and 24 hours 20 for 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.150
 420 attention but it is highly 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.560
 concentrated practically we fill 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.140
 four times the nuisance then a 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.269
 competitive price with no 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.560
 doubt for now we conclude a moment a 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.190
 this roundup and let's see 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.790
