00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 to convince oneself of the site 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.639
 in application 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.849
 take a sheet a4 but in its horizontal format 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.849
 I started with the client 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.130
 then 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.519
 see blatter 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.390
 that side here as well as their costs 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.390
 the same way 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.819
 you will take over the edge that the keys they brought on example 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.900
 then 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.380
 you take lapointe 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.470
 you take the title the man here and you touch the tip 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.710
 like these 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.710
 and then you will press with your finger on the center line 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.890
 to mark a well 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.250
 but not especially 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.440
 leaning all the way 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.810
 on the center line 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.490
 sculptor actually operates badly then makes a rule you have not 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.990
 suffer from the mark oechslÃ© and the end of the wings implied 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.730
 m 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.900
 so far our hero 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.220
 p you take the wings to the side 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.640
 listen and make a fold in such a way 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.790
 that that edge are parallel central aline 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.520
 then 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.910
 for another plane 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.320
 and everything is folded according to central celine 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.910
 she's a rule 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.330
 you go 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.230
 take 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.720
 about a centimeter a centimeter and a half 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.380
 along 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.380
 from the bottom of our alliance 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 eto'o has crushed the tables 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.520
 4 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:09.910
 but beware 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.750
 because the tracks are legault to avoid Alsace 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.239
 grasshopper you created 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.949
 you go 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.909
 so do you have coughed 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.129
 this little bit there 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.129
 inside the plane 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.750
 in order to create a kind of accordion 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.479
 after doing particular central we still have more 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.479
 beisel folded barrel 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:56.659
 you take roughly 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.659
 the end of there too and makes you a little triangle 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.809
 m 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.049
 There you go 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.379
 our inquiry 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.609
 and finished 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.609
 and now with a casting 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:18.789
 bethesda cancer 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:26.639
 thank you batixis tougher penalties whose act m its percentage
