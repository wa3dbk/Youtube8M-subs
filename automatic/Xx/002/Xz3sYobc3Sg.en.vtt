00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.309
 in this video we show how 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.780
 nicest foundation 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.830
 before applying foundation can 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.960
 you choose to use a primer 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.820
 use it is ensures that coarse 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.949
 pores and fine lines are filled 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.300
 which makes your foundation beautiful and longer 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.830
 sit down 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.020
 important is that you get it to one 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.970
 day cream and the ride out well in 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 to dry 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.170
 Then we will use the concealer for this 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.869
 ensures that you have spots and others 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.430
 can camouflage irregularities 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.430
 So that can be under the eye 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.250
 along the nostrils and where necessary 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.360
 choose the color of the concealer in the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.980
 skin color 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.420
 britt use under your eyes you can 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.219
 also choose to light a decade 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.270
 taking which makes it a natural he 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.550
 would teach the testing of foundation 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.050
 do it on the jaw line and as the color 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.660
 disappears in the skin then you have the right one 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 color suit and if you like the color too 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.699
 got a lot on the skin 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.510
 then you have the wrong color 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.880
 for applying the foundation 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.250
 you can choose foundation brush 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 This makes it irish a beautiful 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.720
 and evenly and without stripes 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.610
 you start at the in the middle of it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.890
 then face away and time at the jaw line 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.890
 the hairline and corners of the mouth 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.299
 if you use it deppend then the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.350
 foundation become more covert and like me 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.420
 it becomes more like that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.680
 more transparent 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.420
 another option for applying 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.890
 foundation are of course your fingers 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.299
 it can also use a sponge to 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.130
 you can use the ferry wet 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.409
 which makes the coverage more transparent 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.600
 and if you dab the sponge 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.770
 used the foundation will be more covert 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.350
 the skin 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.450
 you obtain it from those of the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.399
 become more transparent with it 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.409
 you start applying the foundation 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.270
 the center of the face and that work 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.069
 you look forward to the hairline so that you 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.549
 have the least product there you have to 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.009
 over there 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.049
 You have box hairs for it too 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.520
 choose to use the dot lashes 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.140
 this consists of synthetic and 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.500
 natural free please in it 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.119
 the end result will be very natural 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.709
 also start with the stippling brush in it 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.450
 middle of the face and that you work 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.180
 out there he can tattoo it 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.860
 circular movements until finally you 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.700
 choose to finish your foundation 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.739
 powder 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.120
