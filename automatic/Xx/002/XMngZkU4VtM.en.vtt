a jerk team but I didn't get that but

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.880 
a jerk team but I didn't get that but
the<00:02:47.570> team<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.870> did<00:02:48.110> end<00:02:48.290> up<00:02:48.410> facing<00:02:48.620> was

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
the team that did end up facing was

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.229 
the team that did end up facing was
probably<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.280> best<00:02:49.459> team<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:50.000> faced

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
probably the best team that I have faced

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.940 
probably the best team that I have faced
so<00:02:50.450> far<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.840> series<00:02:51.050> probably<00:02:51.800> had<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
so far in the series probably had the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.729 
so far in the series probably had the
most<00:02:52.040> chemistry<00:02:52.550> probably<00:02:52.880> had<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.030> most<00:02:53.090> uh

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
most chemistry probably had the most uh

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.830 
most chemistry probably had the most uh
weapons<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.950> use<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.220> mean<00:02:55.520> he<00:02:55.610> had<00:02:55.760> David<00:02:56.540> vm

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
weapons to use I mean he had David vm

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.800 
weapons to use I mean he had David vm
Mikhail<00:02:57.290> Arteta<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.280> believe<00:02:58.670> mark<00:02:59.480> mark

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
Mikhail Arteta and I believe mark mark

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.010 
Mikhail Arteta and I believe mark mark
