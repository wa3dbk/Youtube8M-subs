only one lava bucket you will have an
infant<00:00:52.699> obsidian<00:00:53.699> generator<00:00:54.559> so<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.860> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
infant obsidian generator so it is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.130 
infant obsidian generator so it is
pretty<00:00:56.190> awesome<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.000> my<00:00:57.149> pic<00:00:57.449> eggs<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.809> also

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
pretty awesome and my pic eggs is also

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.779 
pretty awesome and my pic eggs is also
pretty<00:00:58.289> awesome<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.800> winds<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.250> obviously

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
pretty awesome it winds up obviously

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
pretty awesome it winds up obviously
really<00:01:00.210> fast<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> let's<00:01:03.239> go<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.290> one

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
really fast so let's go like the one

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.300 
really fast so let's go like the one
that's<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.400> left<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:06.080> don't<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.170> why<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that's is left I don't know why is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.500 
that's is left I don't know why is
because<00:01:08.490> again<00:01:09.000> mm-hmm<00:01:09.810> nevermind<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:12.030> let's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
because again mm-hmm nevermind and let's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.120 
because again mm-hmm nevermind and let's
go<00:01:12.780> ahead<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.200> show<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.500> how<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.740> make<00:01:13.979> this

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
go ahead and show you how to make this

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.359 
go ahead and show you how to make this
one<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> first<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.380> make<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> hole<00:01:17.040> just

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
one so first of all make a hole just

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.130 
one so first of all make a hole just
like<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.150> got<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> first<00:01:18.630> area<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
like this so they got the first area and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.280 
like this so they got the first area and
then<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.710> one<00:01:20.600> now<00:01:21.600> you're<00:01:21.900> going<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
then this one now you're going to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.999 
then this one now you're going to
creative<00:01:22.680> mode<00:01:24.290> just<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.740> easier

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
creative mode just because it's easier

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.870 
creative mode just because it's easier
from<00:01:26.189> me<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.180> let's<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:30.860> now

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
from me so let's go like this and now

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.330 
from me so let's go like this and now
just<00:01:32.880> pretty<00:01:33.119> much<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:34.560> base<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.189> you're

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
just pretty much the base that you're

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.980 
just pretty much the base that you're
going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.640> building<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:36.600> they<00:01:36.810> got

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
going to be building on so now they got

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.200 
going to be building on so now they got
on<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.759> where<00:01:38.970> your

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
on this one and this is where your

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.249 
on this one and this is where your
position<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:42.079> let's<00:01:43.079> dig

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
position is going to be on so let's dig

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.100 
position is going to be on so let's dig
out<00:01:43.700> this<00:01:44.700> one<00:01:46.220> okay<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.460> looks<00:01:47.930> not<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
out this one okay this looks not that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.740 
out this one okay this looks not that
good<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.909> actually<00:01:50.909> cares<00:01:51.180> how<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.479> looks

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
good but actually cares how it looks

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.000 
good but actually cares how it looks
well<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:54.079> so

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
well I do so

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.460 
well I do so
it<00:01:56.910> looks<00:01:57.150> good<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.600> me<00:01:57.770> but<00:01:58.770> anyway<00:02:00.200> now<00:02:01.200> what

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
it looks good to me but anyway now what

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.450 
it looks good to me but anyway now what
you<00:02:01.590> want<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.800> do<00:02:01.980> is<00:02:04.040> make<00:02:05.040> something<00:02:05.400> like

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you want to do is make something like

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.630 
you want to do is make something like
this<00:02:06.170> go<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.650> way<00:02:07.680> around<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:10.100> it's<00:02:11.100> not

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
this go all the way around it's it's not

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.850 
this go all the way around it's it's not
an<00:02:11.820> important<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.900> materially<00:02:13.380> what's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
an important what materially what's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.000 
an important what materially what's
material<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.700> were<00:02:14.850> using<00:02:15.510> cell<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.800> can

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
material you were using cell you can

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.610 
material you were using cell you can
even<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.310> what<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:18.000> won't<00:02:18.270> burn<00:02:18.540> down<00:02:18.900> pretty

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
even is what it won't burn down pretty

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.410 
even is what it won't burn down pretty
much<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:22.170> let's<00:02:22.650> go<00:02:22.830> like<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.330> think

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
much so let's go like this and I think

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.670 
much so let's go like this and I think
this<00:02:24.720> should<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:25.050> good<00:02:25.530> sure<00:02:26.040> know<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.810> it's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
this should be good sure know so it's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.850 
this should be good sure know so it's
brunch<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:31.640> now<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:33.180> an<00:02:33.300> infinite<00:02:33.860> ocean

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
brunch it now we have an infinite ocean

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.790 
brunch it now we have an infinite ocean
generate<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.430> now<00:02:35.580> he<00:02:35.640> puts<00:02:35.910> rest<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.390> like

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
generate so now he puts rest on like
