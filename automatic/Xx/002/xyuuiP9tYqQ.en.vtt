root<00:01:10.930> you<00:01:11.140> can't<00:01:11.409> pull<00:01:11.619> it<00:01:11.650> out<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.310> it<00:01:12.820> takes

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
root you can't pull it out and it takes

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
root you can't pull it out and it takes
over<00:01:13.440> anything<00:01:14.440> oh<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:16.360> we<00:01:16.480> found<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:16.870> great

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
over anything oh but we found a great

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
weapon against pasture grass or so we

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.110 
weapon against pasture grass or so we

how<00:01:22.360> old<00:01:23.050> carpet<00:01:23.710> could<00:01:24.340> be<00:01:24.490> used<00:01:24.760> turned

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
how old carpet could be used turned

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.500

upside<00:01:25.630> down<00:01:25.659> in<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.409> path<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.790> then<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:28.330> put

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
upside down in a path and then you put

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.540 
upside down in a path and then you put
straw<00:01:28.960> or<00:01:29.260> something<00:01:29.620> over<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.890> top<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.370> to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
straw or something over the top of it to

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.980 
straw or something over the top of it to
cover<00:01:30.790> it<00:01:30.970> but<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.300> would<00:01:31.479> hold<00:01:31.690> down<00:01:31.840> the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
cover it but it would hold down the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.200 
cover it but it would hold down the
weeds<00:01:32.170> we<00:01:32.770> had<00:01:32.979> we<00:01:33.340> had<00:01:33.520> carpet<00:01:34.000> we<00:01:34.090> were

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and so we laid it all down and put our

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.109 
and so we laid it all down and put our
straw<00:01:49.600> on<00:01:49.810> top<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:50.950> grew<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.400> lovely

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
straw on top and it just grew a lovely

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.930 
straw on top and it just grew a lovely
carpet<00:01:52.540> especially<00:01:53.110> around<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.440> edge<00:01:53.590> of

weeds<00:01:54.940> in<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.659> carpet<00:01:56.049> so<00:01:56.770> we<00:01:57.220> ended<00:01:57.580> up

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
weeds in the carpet so we ended up

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.700 
weeds in the carpet so we ended up
having<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:59.100> tear<00:02:00.100> up<00:02:00.250> all<00:02:00.400> that<00:02:00.790> carpet<00:02:01.270> and
