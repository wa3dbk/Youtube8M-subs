00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:17.400
 in 2010 the tube still let gasoline gives 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:24.630
 to see clearly elekta completely 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:27.810
 rusty and so our whole 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.359
 the wet track when everything is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.730
 rusty anyway tightening well 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.410
 thanks to dengue 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.020
 The rust causes the water to 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.489
 scraping through the tube 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.989
 then this tube then needs to be 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.989
 changed if it will not continue leaking 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:06.140
 tito back enjoy quite bold 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.920
 lixadinhos program but this will only be 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:16.340
 a palliative is best when there is some 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.850
 rust 5 calcaneus people how to play it 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:26.360
 It's not so simple but I'll never have to 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.180
 disassemble which is the collector of a 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.390
 exhaust 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:39.350
 so for now it's a little girl's 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:44.720
 in it and I will put instead of a two 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:49.610
 one of their bags is to have these two 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.770
 these two pieces plus tube advantage and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.780
 a logo back here 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.070
 I hope this insurance is until I 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:03.440
 can take it in the mechanical and exchange this 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:06.170
 tube or take time to assemble the manifold in 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.679
 to do is the same so let's ride from 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.750
 new the theme sanded here with sandpaper already 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.000
 is well levezinho not expect 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:20.930
 putting your two with this one from the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.430
 vote here, you can handle it up to 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.430
 that I can take the mechanic 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:44.100
 cassino tribes bras tight wineries 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.340
 to weave leak pay but 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.580
 any form this all rusty to 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.330
 best thing to do is to mechanical 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.220
 do the tube replacement that does not run 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.010
 risk 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:03.240
 but as a palliative I hope this 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.560
 solution that works everything else 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.560
