00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
doing here you can adjust it by plus or

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.880 
doing here you can adjust it by plus or
minus<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.670> 2<00:00:51.239> or<00:00:51.270> 3<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.960> it'll<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.710> different

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
minus like 2 or 3 and it'll be different

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.450 
minus like 2 or 3 and it'll be different
for<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.370> photo<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> different<00:00:55.460> settings

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
for your photo so different settings

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.279 
for your photo so different settings
will<00:00:56.579> look<00:00:56.699> different<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.180> each<00:00:57.210> photo<00:00:57.600> but

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
will look different for each photo but

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.740 
will look different for each photo but
I'm<00:00:58.379> gonna<00:00:58.500> use<00:00:58.680> about<00:00:59.340> plus<00:00:59.730> 30<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.329> ended<00:01:00.690> up

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
I'm gonna use about plus 30 it ended up

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.880 
I'm gonna use about plus 30 it ended up
being<00:01:00.989> 33<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.879> then<00:01:02.879> mid-tones<00:01:03.840> were<00:01:04.229> will<00:01:04.680> go

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
being 33 and then mid-tones were will go

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.840 
being 33 and then mid-tones were will go
to<00:01:05.659> cyan<00:01:06.659> turn<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.680> down<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.040> about<00:01:08.130> negative

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
to cyan turn it down to about negative

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.609 
to cyan turn it down to about negative
20<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:11.240> turn<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.450> blue<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.350> about

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
20 and turn the blue up to about

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.149 
20 and turn the blue up to about
positive<00:01:14.159> 30<00:01:16.549> next<00:01:17.549> go<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.880> highlights<00:01:19.159> turn

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
positive 30 next go to highlights turn

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.300 
positive 30 next go to highlights turn
the<00:01:20.340> red<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.060> about<00:01:21.299> positive<00:01:21.780> 20<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the red up to about positive 20 and the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.760 
the red up to about positive 20 and the
yellow<00:01:23.759> down<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:25.229> about<00:01:25.380> negative<00:01:25.590> 39<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
yellow down to about negative 39 and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.560 
yellow down to about negative 39 and
then<00:01:28.770> make<00:01:29.009> sure<00:01:29.040> preserve<00:01:29.610> luminosity<00:01:29.850> is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
then make sure preserve luminosity is

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.390 
then make sure preserve luminosity is
checked<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:32.900> alright<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.560> next<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.189> go<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
checked on alright so next we can go to

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.530 
checked on alright so next we can go to
layer<00:01:36.329> new<00:01:36.720> fill<00:01:37.409> layer<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.850> select<00:01:39.240> solid

layer new fill layer and select solid

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.249 
layer new fill layer and select solid
color<00:01:40.790> here<00:01:41.790> your<00:01:42.360> color<00:01:42.570> picker<00:01:42.840> will<00:01:43.110> come

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
color here your color picker will come

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.030

set the blending mode of it to soft

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.179 
set the blending mode of it to soft
light<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:25.200> now<00:02:25.349> it's<00:02:25.590> already<00:02:25.829> getting<00:02:26.069> that

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
light so now it's already getting that

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.270 
light so now it's already getting that
darker<00:02:26.730> more<00:02:27.000> cold<00:02:27.329> look<00:02:27.709> as<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.769> final<00:02:29.250> step

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
darker more cold look as a final step

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.160 
darker more cold look as a final step
we'll<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:29.879> make<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.030> look<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.359> bit<00:02:30.390> more<00:02:30.569> icy

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
we'll just make it look a bit more icy

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.940 
we'll just make it look a bit more icy
so<00:02:31.950> go<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.129> layer<00:02:32.549> new<00:02:32.909> adjustment<00:02:33.329> layer

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
so go to layer new adjustment layer

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.690 
so go to layer new adjustment layer
photo<00:02:34.950> filter<00:02:36.379> alright<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.590> then<00:02:38.099> select

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
under filter there should be a cooling

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.839 
under filter there should be a cooling
filter<00:02:42.450> for<00:02:43.409> in<00:02:43.530> parentheses<00:02:44.069> you'll<00:02:44.220> say<00:02:44.370> 82

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
filter for in parentheses you'll say 82

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.839 
filter for in parentheses you'll say 82
should<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> preset<00:02:46.440> go<00:02:47.370> ahead<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.670> select

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
should be a preset go ahead and select

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.539 
should be a preset go ahead and select
that<00:02:48.060> one<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.690> turn<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.349> density<00:02:50.190> up<00:02:50.370> to

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
that one and turn the density up to

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.509 
that one and turn the density up to
about<00:02:50.760> 50%<00:02:51.799> make<00:02:52.799> sure<00:02:52.980> preserve<00:02:53.340> luminosity

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
about 50% make sure preserve luminosity

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.110 
about 50% make sure preserve luminosity
is<00:02:54.090> checked<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.019> then<00:02:56.010> select<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.879> layer

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
is checked on and then select that layer

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.069 
is checked on and then select that layer
turn<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.959> opacity<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.879> down<00:02:59.879> to<00:03:00.239> about<00:03:00.450> 50%

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
turn the opacity of it down to about 50%

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.199 
turn the opacity of it down to about 50%
so<00:03:04.079> as<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.319> can<00:03:04.409> see<00:03:05.629> in<00:03:06.629> final<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:08.489> is<00:03:08.730> after

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
so as you can see in final this is after

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.539 
so as you can see in final this is after
and<00:03:10.019> this<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.319> before<00:03:10.709> so<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.250> gives<00:03:11.430> your

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
and this is before so it gives your

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.830 
and this is before so it gives your
photo<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.909> much<00:03:12.359> more<00:03:13.370> icy<00:03:14.370> look<00:03:14.629> and<00:03:15.629> of<00:03:15.810> course

photo a much more icy look and of course
you<00:03:16.349> can<00:03:16.500> always<00:03:16.680> add<00:03:17.090> some<00:03:18.090> brightness<00:03:18.629> and

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
you can always add some brightness and

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.960 
you can always add some brightness and
contrast<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.829> your<00:03:19.949> liking<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.720> tweak<00:03:22.500> every
