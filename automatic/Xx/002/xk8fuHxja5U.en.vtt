00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.930 
opponent is going absolutely crazy now
the<00:03:12.209> body<00:03:12.570> faint<00:03:12.870> acceleration<00:03:13.770> after<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.820> do

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
the body faint acceleration after you do

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.910 
the body faint acceleration after you do
the<00:03:15.060> wiggle<00:03:15.240> your<00:03:15.540> usually<00:03:16.020> quite<00:03:16.320> slow<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.830> I

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
the wiggle your usually quite slow so I

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.910 
the wiggle your usually quite slow so I
do<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.250> fake<00:03:17.459> shutdown<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.120> I'm<00:03:19.110> quite<00:03:19.650> slow

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
do the fake shutdown and I'm quite slow

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.770 
do the fake shutdown and I'm quite slow
so<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.130> need<00:03:20.340> an<00:03:20.459> acceleration<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.480> use<00:03:21.660> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
so I need an acceleration and I use the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.979 
so I need an acceleration and I use the
body<00:03:22.050> frame<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.470> accelerate<00:03:23.600> let's<00:03:24.600> do<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:24.930> go

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
body frame to accelerate let's do we go

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.440 
body frame to accelerate let's do we go
right<00:03:25.860> left<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.459> we<00:03:26.700> accelerate<00:03:27.209> with<00:03:27.330> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
right left and we accelerate with the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.240 
right left and we accelerate with the
body<00:03:27.660> frame<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.110> gap<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.680> we<00:03:28.800> do<00:03:28.980> get<00:03:29.220> a

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
body frame to the gap and we do get a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.020 
body frame to the gap and we do get a
penalty<00:03:29.580> they're<00:03:30.680> fake<00:03:31.680> shut<00:03:31.860> up<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.730> party

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
penalty they're fake shut up the party

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.580 
penalty they're fake shut up the party
Finn<00:03:33.209> turn<00:03:33.360> down<00:03:33.600> we<00:03:33.750> did<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.019> wiggle<00:03:34.320> but<00:03:34.470> we

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
Finn turn down we did the wiggle but we

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.070 
Finn turn down we did the wiggle but we
need<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.800> acceleration<00:03:35.700> in<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.080> situation

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
need the acceleration in this situation

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.070 
need the acceleration in this situation
so<00:03:37.920> we<00:03:38.070> use<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.489> party<00:03:38.790> faint<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.450> accelerate

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
so we use the party faint to accelerate

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.410 
so we use the party faint to accelerate
do<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.010> wiggle<00:03:41.130> but<00:03:41.459> now<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.610> acceleration

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
do the wiggle but now the acceleration

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.600 
do the wiggle but now the acceleration
this<00:03:42.600> time<00:03:42.810> we<00:03:42.930> used<00:03:43.080> face<00:03:43.380> up<00:03:43.590> dribbling<00:03:44.010> if

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
this time we used face up dribbling if

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.890 
this time we used face up dribbling if
you<00:03:44.730> do<00:03:44.820> not<00:03:44.940> know<00:03:45.120> how<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.360> do<00:03:45.570> face<00:03:45.750> of

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
you do not know how to do face of

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.270 
you do not know how to do face of
dribbling<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.410> will<00:03:46.560> also<00:03:46.980> do<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.100> tutorial

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
dribbling I will also do a tutorial

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.210 
dribbling I will also do a tutorial
about<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.940> soon<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:49.440> look<00:03:49.709> at<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:49.860> a

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
about that soon and look at that a

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.710 
about that soon and look at that a
triple<00:03:50.580> wiggle<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.209> we<00:03:51.510> need<00:03:51.630> the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
triple wiggle and we need the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.630 
triple wiggle and we need the
acceleration<00:03:52.410> there<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.799> there<00:03:53.010> was<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.400> body

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
acceleration there so there was the body

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.300 
acceleration there so there was the body
faint<00:03:53.940> now<00:03:54.750> finally<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.290> combination<00:03:56.160> we're

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
faint now finally the combination we're

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.370 
faint now finally the combination we're
going<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.489> use<00:03:56.959> multiple<00:03:57.959> methods<00:03:58.080> we

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
going to use multiple methods we

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.770 
going to use multiple methods we
discussed<00:03:58.709> before<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.220> fake<00:03:59.489> shot<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.360> drag

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
discussed before the fake shot the drag

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.150 
discussed before the fake shot the drag
back<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.320> party<00:04:01.590> faint<00:04:01.769> turn<00:04:01.950> we're

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
back and the party faint turn we're

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.100 
back and the party faint turn we're
passing<00:04:02.549> around<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:02.910> box<00:04:03.209> but<00:04:03.420> we<00:04:03.570> cannot

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
passing around this box but we cannot

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.410 
passing around this box but we cannot
get<00:04:04.350> through<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:04.769> let's<00:04:04.980> try<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.489> do<00:04:05.670> teste

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
get through so let's try and do teste

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.850 
get through so let's try and do teste

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
faint turn down and look at that now you

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.289 
faint turn down and look at that now you
to<00:04:19.830> drag<00:04:20.100> back<00:04:20.310> we're<00:04:20.459> just<00:04:20.609> combining<00:04:20.790> all

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
to drag back we're just combining all

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.270 
to drag back we're just combining all
the<00:04:21.690> tools<00:04:21.930> we<00:04:22.200> know<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:22.650> that's<00:04:23.160> the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
the tools we know and that's the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.730 
the tools we know and that's the

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
greatest Bahamas for the three guess but

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.170
