00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello I'm final was going to be a tutorial 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.719
 about the 2 x 2 cll that they gave us 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.360
 today enough people more than anything 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.540
 I ask Cristian flowers so they had 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.150
 that explain the 40s reads I'm going to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.970
 show algorithms work one by one and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.710
 I'm going to show you how to recognize them and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.830
 how he executed it in a more comfortable way 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 well this is an introduction they are 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.810
 as the exercise is 40 he reads them 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.340
 they are divided into I think it's 56 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.530
 little things of name 56 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.540
 The case could be said that is very 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.040
 Well, I think you do not have different 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.650
 cases that are une 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.650
 before the machete 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.900
 those of the h 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.870
 those of the t2 of the uv and those of the ly 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.370
 those of the pib are six that is not good 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.620
 you each have algorithms 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 some have five that have four and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.340
 there are their homes subdividing but 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.590
 well the cr consists mainly as 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.390
 a first step forgiveness if they listen 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.320
 extending the dog that can not be 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.750
 get on the bed and is very upset 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:24.060
 this consists of the cube 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.400
 rich already the husband the easy people and for 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.350
 those who use ortega and not suffer if 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.270
 our two can know a little more 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.160
 have to do this first step but 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.380
 with practice you can do 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.600
 quietly good as I said 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.650
 first step is to make a crown that is 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.410
 a crown would have to be this one face 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.780
 from any white officer one 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.580
 face well made 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.580
 and that all this is well done as 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:56.280
 you can see all this not blue red 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.870
 orange and the face well made clear that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.760
 it could also look like this but this does not 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.730
 it serves us up to the well-made face but 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.430
 here there are no rules all this has to 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.900
 be well armed and that's a step 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.399
 simple in two by two that I think that 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.710
 Anyone who does not think there's 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.110
 initiated one with ortega so we 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.360
 we see they should know more how to do it 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.490
 there are some tricks that I will go 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.740
 showing them is that I'm the first step 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.770
 of the cl that would be to form in any 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.890
 color a face well made in this case 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.350
 I swam all my weapon and second step of crb 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.820
 It is to guide the entire Depor end of 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.980
 one for example here about a case like 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.250
 is identified in the scientific cdn 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.340
 through the clear stickers here we talk 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.770
 of equal or adjacent opposites by 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.050
 example well I this was a case cl 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.420
 I would say that since these two are equal 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.420
 and these two proposed in this case 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.730
 they are fairly fast enough 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.640
 fast execute can be quietly 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.390
 one and then you understand more or less 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.310
 what is cl like now is interested 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.349
 by paul and they entered every curiosity 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.019
 crucial the boatwoman can put in 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.900
 they knew or more or less so that they already have 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.650
 a better idea of ​​how to celebrate then 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.920
 make a well-armed crown and proceed 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.410
 to make all the laws of a 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.680
 also after the videos I'm going 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.780
 to do a mini tutorial on the part of 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.910
 as I do the crown the tricks that 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.510
 use to make the crown sub one more or 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.850
 less almost so that it serves them also 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.830
 to complement the whole sun because 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.709
 and of course they know all the laws but the 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.140
 crown separates his ass does not serve him 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.430
 they're going to be bad times like that so 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.340
 then I will win more or less 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.910
 tips to make the crown in two by two 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.620
 in things that died to mention 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.480
 I'm going to be several days for two which is 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.400
 a short introduction then they go to 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.890
 watch a video with the unites with the sentís 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.350
 one is another video with the other pee with the 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.420
 with those of h with those of l with those of 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.210
 the t well all videos with separate with 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.790
 the little group of algorithms in each one like this 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.610
 it's easier to know for example I stayed 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.740
 I stopped all the joins 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.660
 and in return the video of the anti your minute 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.030
 that advance the video see more or less 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.090
 where they were fart is going to be everything 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.670
 separate seeds I will explain the 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.800
 how to identify them and here below I will 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.020
 put the algorithm afterwards with background 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.880
 edit another way you can see 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.200
 I hope it does not happen much is that 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.000
 You can jump a 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.720
 whatever the name a water concept 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.020
 a publisher watermark that I use 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.090
 because I am a bird is a publisher and as 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.040
 I have the version for the premium version 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.010
 that is, I have the downloaded one like this 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.230
 internet every five minutes appears here 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.230
 or at the beginning of the video and the brand of 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.360
 bird water editor in the middle one very 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.450
 great but it also appears so 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.030
 I hope not fuck a lot that does not cover the 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.910
 cube or the algorithms but nothing else 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.350
 well that would be more or less pdl more or 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.210
 fewer problems that can happen here 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.580
 future points because of how to show 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.280
 something with transportation is that I can 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.630
 understand better here and nothing else I 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.450
 I think it serves as an introduction it seems 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.450
 we raise one with security 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.450
 expression
