00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.810 

guesswork<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.290> side<00:00:07.620> roll<00:00:07.980> when<00:00:08.730> you're

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
guesswork on the side roll when you're

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.339 
guesswork on the side roll when you're
doing<00:00:09.030> your<00:00:09.059> side<00:00:09.360> rug<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.840> same<00:00:10.080> motion

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
doing your side rug in the same motion

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.560 
doing your side rug in the same motion
as<00:00:10.620> your<00:00:10.769> normal<00:00:10.950> forward<00:00:11.550> roll<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.360> only

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
as your normal forward roll the only

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
as your normal forward roll the only
difference<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.230> can<00:00:13.259> keep<00:00:13.440> your

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
difference is that you can keep your

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.250 
difference is that you can keep your
eyes<00:00:13.849> directly<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.059> front<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.990> or

to get the ideas the same motion as your
forward<00:00:43.440> roll<00:00:44.030> if<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.210> start<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.570> sideways<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
forward roll if I start out sideways and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.740 
forward roll if I start out sideways and
I'm<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.370> shoot<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:47.940> arms<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.600> I'm

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
doing a regular roll but my eyes stay

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.830 
doing a regular roll but my eyes stay
right<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.570> target<00:00:52.280> right<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.300> it's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
right on target right here and then it's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.400 
right on target right here and then it's
up<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:56.160> roll<00:00:58.370> an<00:00:59.370> old<00:01:00.000> classical<00:01:00.870> style<00:01:01.109> side

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
up and roll an old classical style side

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.830 
up and roll an old classical style side
roll<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.760> rolling<00:01:03.570> straight

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
roll is actually just rolling straight

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.690 
roll is actually just rolling straight
over<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.500> back<00:01:04.710> from<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.189> position<00:01:05.580> right

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
over the back from this position right

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
over the back from this position right
here<00:01:08.180> we<00:01:09.180> cut<00:01:09.390> those<00:01:09.570> out<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.110> most<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> our

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
here we cut those out on most of our

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.050 
here we cut those out on most of our
training<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> doesn't<00:01:11.640> allow<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
training because it doesn't allow you to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.760 
training because it doesn't allow you to
be<00:01:12.150> very<00:01:12.450> fast<00:01:12.780> when<00:01:13.409> you're<00:01:13.500> doing<00:01:13.740> your

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
be very fast when you're doing your

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.160 
be very fast when you're doing your
rolls<00:01:16.549> we<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.729> use<00:01:17.939> those<00:01:18.150> side<00:01:18.420> rolls<00:01:18.689> for

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
rolls we do use those side rolls for

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
rolls we do use those side rolls for
other<00:01:19.380> exercises<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.250> example<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.640> had<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
other exercises for example if we had a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.380 
other exercises for example if we had a
partner<00:01:21.229> we<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.380> step<00:01:22.560> back<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> view<00:01:24.270> as

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
partner we would step back and view as

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.350 
partner we would step back and view as
video<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.780> outside<00:01:25.170> before<00:01:25.380> ten<00:01:25.820> we<00:01:26.820> bent

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
video they outside before ten we bent

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.330 
video they outside before ten we bent
over<00:01:27.479> there<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.770> roll<00:01:30.409> this<00:01:31.409> way<00:01:31.650> if

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
over there and then we roll this way if

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.760 
over there and then we roll this way if
we're<00:01:32.490> rolling<00:01:32.729> over<00:01:32.880> an<00:01:32.939> object<00:01:33.450> say<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> table

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
we're rolling over an object say a table

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.280 
we're rolling over an object say a table
we<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.850> use<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.329> type<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> exercise<00:01:36.810> with

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
we can use this type of exercise with

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.830 
we can use this type of exercise with
this<00:01:37.409> side<00:01:37.590> wall

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
this side wall

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.149 
this side wall
another<00:01:39.840> example<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.409> he<00:01:40.530> comes<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.950> throws<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
another example is he comes in throws a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:41.600 
another example is he comes in throws a
punch

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
punch

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.180 
punch
we<00:01:42.360> drop<00:01:42.660> now<00:01:42.960> strike<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.560> groin<00:01:43.800> and<00:01:44.040> I'm

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
we drop now strike the groin and I'm

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:52.930 
we drop now strike the groin and I'm
gonna<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> rule<00:01:44.790> between<00:01:45.150> his<00:01:45.270> legs

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.070 

okay<00:01:53.940> another<00:01:54.150> exercise<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:54.960> when

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
okay another exercise we can do when

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.630 
okay another exercise we can do when
we're<00:01:55.170> doing<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.410> side<00:01:55.620> roll<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.400> we're

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
we're doing a side roll is we're

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.860 
we're doing a side roll is we're
actually<00:01:56.790> going<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.210> rolling<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.660> reason

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
actually going to be rolling the reason

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.900 
actually going to be rolling the reason
we<00:01:57.930> need<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.080> keep<00:01:58.230> our<00:01:58.320> eyes<00:01:58.470> on<00:01:58.830> our<00:01:58.910> let's

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
we need to keep our eyes on our let's

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.330 
we need to keep our eyes on our let's
say<00:02:00.060> our<00:02:00.330> subject<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.250> if

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
say our subject is so that we can see if

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.800 
say our subject is so that we can see if
they<00:02:02.490> move<00:02:02.730> or<00:02:02.970> if<00:02:03.030> they<00:02:03.120> hear<00:02:03.330> us<00:02:03.450> when<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.690> do

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
they move or if they hear us when we do

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.960 
they move or if they hear us when we do
our<00:02:03.840> roll<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.830> mr.<00:02:05.220> Butler's<00:02:05.580> back<00:02:05.760> a<00:02:05.790> little

poking<00:02:41.040> on<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> other<00:02:41.430> side<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.300> want<00:02:42.450> to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
poking on the other side so you want to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.360 
poking on the other side so you want to
make<00:02:42.630> sure<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.050> roll<00:02:43.260> behind<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
make sure that you roll behind the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.220 
make sure that you roll behind the
obstacle<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:44.850> he<00:02:44.940> goes<00:02:45.030> back<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:46.019> this<00:02:46.170> time

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
obstacle so he goes back and this time

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.970 
obstacle so he goes back and this time
I'm<00:02:47.220> kind<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.820> here<00:02:48.650> actually<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.800> would

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
I'm kind of just here actually I would

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.940 
I'm kind of just here actually I would
normally<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.400> front<00:02:50.730> out<00:02:51.480> here<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.140> I'm

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
normally be in front out here and I'm

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.070 
normally be in front out here and I'm
just<00:02:53.130> kind<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.730> know<00:02:53.820> guarding<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:54.720> area

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
just kind of you know guarding this area

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.630 
just kind of you know guarding this area
and<00:02:55.350> then<00:02:55.800> he<00:02:55.830> does<00:02:56.070> his<00:02:56.190> roll

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
and then he does his roll

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.500 
and then he does his roll
I<00:02:56.780> hear<00:02:57.780> something<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.470> turn<00:02:59.310> around<00:02:59.610> so<00:02:59.940> he

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
I hear something I turn around so he

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.930 
I hear something I turn around so he
shouldn't<00:03:00.750> be<00:03:00.840> seen<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.489> then<00:03:02.489> he<00:03:02.670> peeks

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
shouldn't be seen and then he peeks

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.040 
shouldn't be seen and then he peeks
around<00:03:03.140> one<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.230> these<00:03:04.320> walls<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:05.510> sees<00:03:06.510> you

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
around one of these walls and sees you

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.150 
around one of these walls and sees you
know<00:03:07.170> if<00:03:07.290> I'm<00:03:07.500> still<00:03:07.739> here

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
know if I'm still here

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.770 
know if I'm still here
probably<00:03:08.700> good<00:03:08.820> idea<00:03:09.060> from<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.360> peak<00:03:09.540> down

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
probably good idea from the peak down

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.900 
probably good idea from the peak down
low<00:03:10.140> from<00:03:10.350> one<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.680> sides<00:03:10.860> not<00:03:11.160> above<00:03:11.519> but

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
low from one of the sides not above but

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.160 
low from one of the sides not above but
you<00:03:12.120> know<00:03:12.380> invisibility<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.620> another<00:03:13.920> lesson
