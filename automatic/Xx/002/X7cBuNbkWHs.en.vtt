00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
it's kind of weird how well they match

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
it's kind of weird how well they match
because<00:02:53.820> they're<00:02:53.970> not<00:02:54.090> from<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.330> same<00:02:54.450> place

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
because they're not from the same place

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.100 
because they're not from the same place
or<00:02:54.840> anything<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.320> was<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:55.440> crazy<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.220> me<00:02:56.280> and

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
or anything it was just crazy to me and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.440 
or anything it was just crazy to me and
