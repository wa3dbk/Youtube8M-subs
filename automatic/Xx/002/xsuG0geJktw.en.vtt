00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 or talk here I have another one is 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.560
 commenting on a trox guide if he does not 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.420
 is worse as you can see that I already 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.350
 I have in my hands and they show their 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.600
 good skills 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.220
 to begin with we started with the cv what 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.900
 is that it jumps on the unit 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.990
 enemy and lifts them is swimming 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.200
 for a second the w as you can see 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 right now what it does is that 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.390
 you recover a few percent life and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.650
 increases 200 percent when it 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.830
 finds below half of the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.730
 lifetime 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.440
 and then if we activate the w what happens is 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.200
 that inflingidas a percentage more 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.490
 of damage but losses are also a 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.910
 little bit of life 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:48.380
 flamengo a dream you see then it was a 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.410
 little bit more but if you see I'm losing 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.810
 nothing a little life that this 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.420
 I would recommend more having it activities and 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.700
 yes yes if you are a little more tanks and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.610
 the most of tanks 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.369
 and then what we have here that what 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.090
 does it inflict the magic year 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.570
 making enemies 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.530
 is here the leather w again 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.290
 and finally we have the last one what 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.350
 does it inflicts damage in the area 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.350
 and also recover more life 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.500
 and we also have the theater passive 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.850
 c's that also what it does is that 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.240
 when 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.210
 when the child kills you what he does is 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.940
 that the one hundred percent approach to 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.970
 year that inflicts itself and gets 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.850
 1% attack speed and a little bit of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.920
 lifetime 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.909
 so it's pretty good 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.619
 and I'm going marÃ­a then I would do 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.439
 basically I took the recommended or 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.869
 be a sheet of reggae ruined the 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.080
 tab boots and some sports phases already 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.400
 I've tried and this pretty well 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.310
 I would take from the gift sheet and swim 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.750
 because the attack speed and 15% of 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.060
 Life stealing 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.790
 some detail notes because of the mature 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.770
 and such 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.910
 and later 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.460
 ties of last as it gives more damage 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.670
 of attack for every 25 life lost or 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.610
 it would be good because the passive 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.670
 lose tight damage lose life then 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:45.510
 we would be more in the attack 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.420
 then then I would make a bloodthirsty 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.310
 for the theft of life basically and the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.030
 hurt 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:59.500
 and then like mariah a warm armor 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:03.460
 or because our life is clear and also 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.340
 because having the work had activated 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.070
 this will make us have it because it is not 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.040
 we pretend so much life when we have 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.860
 the double activated 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.200
 ride new more basically and then 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.099
 finally it is more your thing 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.920
 but I 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.709
 mari a dancer because at speed 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.969
 attack and critical then also with the 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.700
 speed is that we will make that we win 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.760
 more life robbery 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.099
 since we had the bloodthirsty and the leaf 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.099
 the king has ruined good and that's it 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.750
 basically for today and it's already 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.670
 and good if you liked this video 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.319
 subscribe and if not also 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.319
