00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.790 

then<00:02:08.630> with<00:02:08.810> your<00:02:08.929> other<00:02:09.110> hand

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
then with your other hand

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
then with your other hand

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
get a thicker crust so the cheese

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.610 
get a thicker crust so the cheese
doesn't<00:02:29.060> come<00:02:29.540> out<00:02:31.150> everywhere<00:02:32.320> repeat<00:02:33.320> into

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
doesn't come out everywhere repeat into

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.900

the egg wash a nice coat and back into

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.979 
the egg wash a nice coat and back into
the<00:02:38.030> bread<00:02:38.299> crumbs<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:41.360> go<00:02:41.660> ahead<00:02:41.720> and

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
the bread crumbs and just go ahead and

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.479 
the bread crumbs and just go ahead and
put<00:02:42.140> pressure<00:02:42.440> on<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:42.890> at<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.250> bread

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
put pressure on it so at the bread

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.570 
put pressure on it so at the bread
crumbs<00:02:43.760> stick

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.450 

all<00:02:48.580> right<00:02:49.230> shake<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.260> off<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.530> little<00:02:50.770> bit<00:02:51.070> and
