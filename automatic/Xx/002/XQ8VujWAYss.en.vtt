00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
basically when we started working on it

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.700 
basically when we started working on it
we<00:00:34.280> didn't<00:00:34.520> want<00:00:34.700> to<00:00:34.850> make<00:00:35.060> another<00:00:35.180> sequel<00:00:35.840> so

we sort of script everything out started

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.709 
we sort of script everything out started
from<00:00:38.899> scratch<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:39.879> just<00:00:40.879> built<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:41.390> new<00:00:41.420> game

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
from scratch and just built a new game

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.420 
from scratch and just built a new game
the<00:00:41.989> game<00:00:42.109> we<00:00:42.230> wanted<00:00:42.469> to<00:00:42.530> play<00:00:42.680> wanted<00:00:43.370> to

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
keep the heart soul the game so it's

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.049 
keep the heart soul the game so it's
familiar<00:00:45.430> but<00:00:46.430> we<00:00:46.550> wanted<00:00:46.789> to<00:00:46.850> make

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
familiar but we wanted to make

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
everything bigger better more options

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.319 
everything bigger better more options
more<00:00:50.269> accessible<00:00:51.199> making<00:00:51.679> payments<00:00:52.239> lots<00:00:53.239> of

more accessible making payments lots of

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.840 
more accessible making payments lots of
customization<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.109> I'll<00:00:54.710> go<00:00:54.859> over<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:55.250> few<00:00:55.789> of

blow<00:01:48.159> out<00:01:48.219> the<00:01:48.340> sky<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:50.049> in<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.200> fifth<00:01:50.380> kill

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
blow out the sky and in the fifth kill

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.459 
blow out the sky and in the fifth kill
streak<00:01:50.799> is<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.759> predator<00:01:52.090> missile<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.630> that

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
streak is the predator missile and that

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.889 
streak is the predator missile and that
is<00:01:53.619> basically<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:54.659> remote-control<00:01:55.659> missile

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899
