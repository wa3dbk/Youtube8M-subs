00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
like you can kind of see those little

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.940 
like you can kind of see those little
v's<00:01:41.670> there<00:01:42.259> those<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.440> knit<00:01:43.679> stitches

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and and that's pretty much it and then

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.270 
and and that's pretty much it and then
you're<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:48.360> playing<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.959> these<00:01:49.280> with

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
you're really playing with these with

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.080 
you're really playing with these with
shapes<00:01:50.610> we've<00:01:51.300> got<00:01:51.539> these<00:01:51.720> two<00:01:51.989> triangular

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
shapes we've got these two triangular

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.419 
shapes we've got these two triangular
sides<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.259> connected<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.069> pick<00:01:56.280> up

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
sides that are connected so you pick up

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.760 
sides that are connected so you pick up
stitches<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.810> side<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.170> then<00:01:58.440> you<00:01:58.560> pick

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
stitches on one side and then you pick

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.520 
stitches on one side and then you pick
up<00:01:59.060> stitches<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.110> opposite

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
up stitches on the out on the opposite

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.169 
up stitches on the out on the opposite
side<00:02:01.800> so<00:02:02.069> you<00:02:02.099> make<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.580> then<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.789> just<00:02:02.970> work

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
side so you make and then you just work

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.229 
side so you make and then you just work
these<00:02:03.420> these<00:02:03.920> triangles<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.160> then<00:02:06.000> as<00:02:06.119> you

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
these these triangles and then as you

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.770 
these these triangles and then as you
can<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:06.630> there's<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> third<00:02:07.200> color<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:08.780> it's

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
can see there's a third color here it's

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.960 
can see there's a third color here it's
kind<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.959> our<00:02:10.080> deceived<00:02:10.440> video<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.819> can

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
kind of our deceived video but you can

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.390 
kind of our deceived video but you can
get<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> idea<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:13.709> like<00:02:13.770> playing<00:02:14.160> with

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
get the idea so it's like playing with

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.610 
get the idea so it's like playing with
shapes<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.120> that's<00:02:15.930> what<00:02:16.170> gets<00:02:16.290> me<00:02:16.439> really

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
shapes and that's what gets me really

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.520 
shapes and that's what gets me really
excited<00:02:16.769> about

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
excited about

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.110 
excited about
this<00:02:17.740> particular<00:02:19.380> design<00:02:20.730> because<00:02:21.730> also

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
this particular design because also

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.670 
this particular design because also
you're<00:02:22.300> learning<00:02:22.780> how<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.930> pick<00:02:23.110> up<00:02:23.290> stitches

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
you're learning how to pick up stitches

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.830 
you're learning how to pick up stitches
so<00:02:24.130> you're<00:02:24.400> picking<00:02:24.550> up<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:25.030> knitting<00:02:25.480> and

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
that's a technique that I'm going to

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.190 
that's a technique that I'm going to
show<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:30.480> there's<00:02:31.480> no<00:02:31.600> sewing<00:02:31.840> involved

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
show you and there's no sewing involved

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.460 
show you and there's no sewing involved
other<00:02:32.770> than<00:02:33.120> weaving<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.300> your<00:02:34.780> ends<00:02:35.020> when

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
other than weaving in your ends when

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.260 
other than weaving in your ends when
you're<00:02:35.620> finished<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.459> that's<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.850> so<00:02:37.090> let's

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
you're finished so that's it so let's

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.540
