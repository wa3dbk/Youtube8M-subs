in<00:00:01.350> this<00:00:01.560> video<00:00:01.890> I'm<00:00:02.280> going<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.429> be<00:00:02.550> teaching

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
in this video I'm going to be teaching

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.910 
in this video I'm going to be teaching
you<00:00:02.939> guys<00:00:02.970> how<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.419> bench<00:00:03.689> with<00:00:03.990> proper<00:00:04.589> form

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
you guys how to bench with proper form

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.400 
you guys how to bench with proper form
and<00:00:05.160> optimize<00:00:06.089> as<00:00:06.270> many<00:00:06.509> things<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:06.990> can<00:00:07.200> on

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
and optimize as many things you can on

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.049 
and optimize as many things you can on
the<00:00:07.500> bench<00:00:07.680> press<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.309> get<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.639> most<00:00:08.820> out<00:00:09.000> of

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
the bench press to get the most out of

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.310 
the bench press to get the most out of
the<00:00:09.240> lift<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:11.210> common<00:00:12.210> mistake<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.750> see<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:13.019> lot<00:00:13.200> of

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the lift a common mistake I see a lot of

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.799 
the lift a common mistake I see a lot of
people<00:00:13.590> make<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.309> they're<00:00:14.820> lame<00:00:15.089> too<00:00:15.540> far

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
people make is that they're lame too far

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.290 
people make is that they're lame too far
up<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.350> bench<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.880> reason<00:00:18.210> that's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
up on the bench and the reason that's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.120 
up on the bench and the reason that's
fat<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:19.050> when<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:19.560> rack<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.949> bar

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
fat is because when you one rack the bar

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.189 
fat is because when you one rack the bar
you're<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.240> going<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.539> able<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.810> bench<00:00:21.990> it

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
you're not going to be able to bench it

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.349 
you're not going to be able to bench it
because<00:00:22.529> there's<00:00:23.160> you're<00:00:23.939> gonna<00:00:24.060> be<00:00:24.150> hitting

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
because there's you're gonna be hitting

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.400 
because there's you're gonna be hitting
a<00:00:24.420> bunch<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.689> things<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> be

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
a bunch of things it's going to be

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.560 
a bunch of things it's going to be
sloppy<00:00:25.680> you're<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.609> don't<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> you

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
sloppy you're just you don't have a you

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.939 
sloppy you're just you don't have a you
don't<00:00:27.720> have<00:00:27.840> an<00:00:27.930> empty<00:00:28.170> plane<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.769> bench

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
don't have an empty plane to bench

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.849 
don't have an empty plane to bench
through<00:00:29.599> another<00:00:30.599> mistake<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.410> people

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
through another mistake is that people

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.400 
through another mistake is that people
are<00:00:32.009> laying<00:00:32.219> too<00:00:32.640> far<00:00:32.969> down<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> bench<00:00:34.079> so

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
are laying too far down on the bench so

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.440 
are laying too far down on the bench so
when<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.160> own<00:00:35.280> racket<00:00:35.760> they<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.300> move

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
when they own racket they have to move

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.690 
when they own racket they have to move
it<00:00:36.600> such<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> great<00:00:37.440> distance<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.250> when<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
it such a great distance that when it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.160 
it such a great distance that when it
comes<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> heavier<00:00:39.239> weight<00:00:39.480> they're<00:00:39.989> not

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
comes to heavier weight they're not

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.799 
comes to heavier weight they're not
going<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.440> able<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:42.660> also

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
going to be able to do that and it also

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.959 
going to be able to do that and it also
means<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.260> vertical<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.190> fail<00:00:44.460> or<00:00:44.610> up<00:00:44.760> for

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
means you vertical if you fail or up for

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.610 
means you vertical if you fail or up for
the<00:00:45.059> spotter<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.570> help<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.079> because<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> lot

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the spotter to help you up because a lot

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.200 
the spotter to help you up because a lot
of<00:00:46.739> times<00:00:46.950> he's<00:00:47.280> physically<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.120> be

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
of times he's physically not going to be

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
of times he's physically not going to be
able<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.960> you're<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.590> do

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
able to and you're going to have to do

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.110 
able to and you're going to have to do
the<00:00:50.340> role<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.550> Shamer

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the role of Shamer

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.400 
the role of Shamer
make<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> plates<00:00:51.960> fall<00:00:52.199> off<00:00:52.379> each<00:00:52.559> side<00:00:54.410> so

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
make the plates fall off each side so

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.220 
make the plates fall off each side so
essentially<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.430> find<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.690> right

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
essentially you have to find the right

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.049 
essentially you have to find the right
spot<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> bench<00:00:59.010> that's<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.550> too<00:00:59.730> hot<00:00:59.940> or

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
spot on the bench that's not too hot or

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.389 
spot on the bench that's not too hot or
not<00:01:00.180> too<00:01:00.420> low<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.350> could<00:01:01.559> unrack<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
not too low so you could unrack it and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.920 
not too low so you could unrack it and
move<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> less<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.390> minimum<00:01:03.780> distance

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
move it the less the minimum distance

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.679 
move it the less the minimum distance
possible<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.610> able<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.939> comfortably

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
possible and be able to comfortably

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.740 
possible and be able to comfortably
bench<00:01:07.049> without<00:01:07.380> hitting<00:01:07.740> anything<00:01:08.750> another

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
bench without hitting anything another

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.330 
bench without hitting anything another
mistake<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> lot<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.439> people<00:01:10.560> make<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
mistake a lot of people make is that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.190 
mistake a lot of people make is that
they'll<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:11.939> pick<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.600> bar<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.900> unrack

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
they'll just pick up the bar and unrack

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.929 
they'll just pick up the bar and unrack
it<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.590> away<00:01:13.710> without<00:01:14.010> paying<00:01:14.460> attention

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
it right away without paying attention

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.640 
it right away without paying attention
to<00:01:15.119> where<00:01:15.270> they're<00:01:15.390> holding<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
to where they're holding it and that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.929 
to where they're holding it and that
caused<00:01:16.890> events<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> pick<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> bar

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
caused events to pick up the bar

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.219 
caused events to pick up the bar
unevenly<00:01:20.119> so<00:01:21.119> before<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.630> want<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.840> rack<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
unevenly so before you want to rack the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.570 
unevenly so before you want to rack the
bar<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.560> make<00:01:22.710> sure<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.340> holding

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
bar and make sure that you're holding

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.149 
bar and make sure that you're holding
the<00:01:23.850> bar<00:01:24.030> evenly<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.710> hands<00:01:26.040> are

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
the bar evenly and that your hands are

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.670 
the bar evenly and that your hands are
in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.340> exact<00:01:26.729> same<00:01:26.909> spot<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.479> each<00:01:27.540> side<00:01:27.840> what

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
in the exact same spot on each side what

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.410 
in the exact same spot on each side what
I<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> do<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> put<00:01:29.700> my<00:01:29.970> pinkies

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
I like to do is I like to put my pinkies

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.480 
I like to do is I like to put my pinkies
right<00:01:30.750> inside<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> knurling<00:01:31.650> every<00:01:32.220> single

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
right inside the knurling every single

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.390 
right inside the knurling every single
time

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.730 

another<00:01:36.150> very<00:01:36.450> crucial<00:01:36.930> mistake<00:01:37.290> people<00:01:37.500> do

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
another very crucial mistake people do

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770 
another very crucial mistake people do
is<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.100> Lotus<00:01:38.520> casually<00:01:39.120> lay<00:01:39.300> down<00:01:39.510> on<00:01:39.660> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
is that Lotus casually lay down on the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.190 
is that Lotus casually lay down on the
bench<00:01:40.340> completely<00:01:41.340> relax<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.780> unwrap

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
bench completely relax and just unwrap

bench completely relax and just unwrap
the<00:01:43.380> bar<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:46.020> want<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.260> have<00:01:46.410> your<00:01:46.560> shoulder

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the bar you want to have your shoulder

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.070 
the bar you want to have your shoulder
blades<00:01:47.190> pinched<00:01:47.730> down<00:01:48.120> and<00:01:48.330> back<00:01:48.480> and<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> way

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
blades pinched down and back and the way

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.840 
blades pinched down and back and the way
you<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:52.100> retract<00:01:53.100> your<00:01:53.280> scapula

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you do that is you retract your scapula

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.150 
you do that is you retract your scapula
and<00:01:54.240> also<00:01:54.570> try<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.750> bring<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.200> down<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.980> bring

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
and also try to bring it down to bring

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.790 
and also try to bring it down to bring
it<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.370> your<00:01:56.520> lower<00:01:56.700> back<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.330> arch<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.620> much

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
it to your lower back and arch as much

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.560 
it to your lower back and arch as much
as<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.220> see<00:02:02.490> here<00:02:02.730> I'm<00:02:03.420> going

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
as you can so as you see here I'm going

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.990 
as you can so as you see here I'm going
to<00:02:03.630> grab<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:04.050> bar<00:02:04.260> in<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:05.400> same<00:02:05.640> spot<00:02:05.970> that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
to grab the bar in the same spot that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.700 
to grab the bar in the same spot that
always<00:02:06.330> hold<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.720> pinkies<00:02:07.170> inside<00:02:07.560> the

always hold it pinkies inside the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.800 
always hold it pinkies inside the
knurlings<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.390> right<00:02:09.390> now<00:02:09.510> I'm<00:02:09.630> completely

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
knurlings and right now I'm completely

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.260 
knurlings and right now I'm completely
relaxed<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.670> see<00:02:11.820> I'm<00:02:11.940> trying<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
relaxed and as you can see I'm trying to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.930 
relaxed and as you can see I'm trying to
find<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.510> sweet<00:02:12.720> spot<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.460> boom<00:02:14.460> there<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.790> go

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
find a sweet spot and boom there you go

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.380 
find a sweet spot and boom there you go
I<00:02:15.590> slide<00:02:16.590> up<00:02:16.620> against<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.160> bench<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.760> retract

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
I slide up against the bench I retract

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.990 
I slide up against the bench I retract
my<00:02:18.480> scapula<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:20.070> pinch<00:02:20.310> my<00:02:20.490> sore<00:02:20.700> blades

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
my scapula and I pinch my sore blades

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970 
my scapula and I pinch my sore blades
down<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.330> back<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.470> I'm<00:02:22.590> perfectly

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
down and back and then I'm perfectly

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.400 
down and back and then I'm perfectly
tight<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> improper<00:02:26.730> set<00:02:27.120> up

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
tight so this is the improper set up

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.570 
tight so this is the improper set up
shoulder<00:02:28.410> bleeds<00:02:28.620> not<00:02:28.860> pinched<00:02:29.160> down<00:02:29.370> and

shoulder bleeds not pinched down and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.500 
shoulder bleeds not pinched down and
back<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.030> here's<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> proper<00:02:31.170> setup<00:02:32.510> here's

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
back and here's the proper setup here's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.750 
back and here's the proper setup here's
a<00:02:33.570> side<00:02:33.870> by<00:02:34.080> side<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.740> correct<00:02:35.250> setup<00:02:35.640> in

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
a side by side of the correct setup in

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.210 
a side by side of the correct setup in
the<00:02:35.880> incorrect<00:02:36.180> setup<00:02:36.720> now<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.650> correct

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the incorrect setup now the correct

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.520 
the incorrect setup now the correct
setup<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.970> right<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.380> could

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
setup is on the right and as you could

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.800 
setup is on the right and as you could
tell<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.790> range<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.209> motion<00:02:42.630> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
tell the range of motion is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.860 
tell the range of motion is
significantly<00:02:43.680> less<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:45.030> there's<00:02:45.330> less<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
significantly less so there's less of a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.510 
significantly less so there's less of a
distance<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.680> actually<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.280> push

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
distance that you actually have to push

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.949 
distance that you actually have to push
the<00:02:47.730> bar<00:02:47.940> through<00:02:48.239> making<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.110> lift<00:02:49.320> easier

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
the bar through making the lift easier

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.180 
the bar through making the lift easier
another<00:02:51.959> common<00:02:52.410> mistake<00:02:52.500> people<00:02:52.739> make<00:02:53.040> is

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
another common mistake people make is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.640 
another common mistake people make is
that<00:02:53.370> they<00:02:53.580> bench<00:02:54.260> perpendicularly<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
that they bench perpendicularly to the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.870 
that they bench perpendicularly to the
floor<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.730> they<00:02:57.000> let<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.360> bar<00:02:57.540> directly<00:02:57.810> down

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
floor so they let the bar directly down

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.150 
floor so they let the bar directly down
without<00:02:59.880> any<00:03:00.180> arc<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.930> as<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.739> can<00:03:01.830> see<00:03:01.890> here

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
without any arc so as you can see here

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.680 
without any arc so as you can see here
I'm<00:03:02.250> doing<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.610> wrong<00:03:02.790> I'm<00:03:03.090> letting<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.510> bar

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
I'm doing it wrong I'm letting the bar

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.080 
I'm doing it wrong I'm letting the bar
directly<00:03:04.260> down<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.830> that's<00:03:05.459> flaring<00:03:06.000> my

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
directly down and that's flaring my

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.630 
directly down and that's flaring my
elbows<00:03:06.510> giving<00:03:07.200> me<00:03:07.290> unwanted<00:03:07.800> pressure<00:03:08.280> on<00:03:08.489> my

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
elbows giving me unwanted pressure on my

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.820 
elbows giving me unwanted pressure on my
shoulders<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.330> I'm<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.440> getting<00:03:10.590> less

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
shoulders and I'm just getting less

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.860 
shoulders and I'm just getting less
power<00:03:11.100> now<00:03:11.700> here<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.270> can<00:03:12.360> see<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.720> I'm

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
power now here you can see that I'm

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.229 
power now here you can see that I'm
tucking<00:03:13.230> my<00:03:13.470> elbows<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.670> this<00:03:14.820> gives<00:03:15.060> me

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
tucking my elbows in now this gives me

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.520 
tucking my elbows in now this gives me
more<00:03:15.420> tricep<00:03:15.930> activation<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:18.060> reduces<00:03:18.630> stress

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
more tricep activation it reduces stress

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.470 
more tricep activation it reduces stress
on<00:03:19.800> my<00:03:19.920> shoulders<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.580> I'm<00:03:20.700> able<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.120> push

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
on my shoulders and I'm able to push

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.870 
on my shoulders and I'm able to push
with<00:03:21.690> more<00:03:21.930> power<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.500> I'm<00:03:23.070> also<00:03:23.280> pushing<00:03:23.790> the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
with more power and I'm also pushing the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.300 
with more power and I'm also pushing the
bar<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.750> direction<00:03:25.190> instead<00:03:26.190> of

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
bar in that direction instead of

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.490 
bar in that direction instead of
perpendicular<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.300> floor<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.840> ties

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
perpendicular to the floor and that ties

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.560 
perpendicular to the floor and that ties
in<00:03:28.709> with<00:03:28.739> leg<00:03:29.070> drive<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.880> I'm<00:03:30.030> about<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.300> show

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
in with leg drive that I'm about to show

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:38.790 
in with leg drive that I'm about to show
later<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:31.019> in<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.200> video

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.940 

and<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:40.300> is<00:03:40.450> how<00:03:40.630> not<00:03:40.960> to<00:03:41.020> use<00:03:41.230> leg<00:03:41.650> drive

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
and this is how not to use leg drive

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.760 
and this is how not to use leg drive
this<00:03:42.490> is<00:03:42.850> completely<00:03:43.810> wrong<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.080> lot<00:03:44.380> of<00:03:44.440> people

floor on the way but just because you're

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.860 
floor on the way but just because you're
pushing<00:04:27.190> down<00:04:27.220> so<00:04:27.610> hard<00:04:27.880> that's<00:04:28.570> going<00:04:28.810> to

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
pushing down so hard that's going to

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.650 
pushing down so hard that's going to
create<00:04:29.200> power<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:30.060> help<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.180> incorporate

create power and help you incorporate

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.030 
create power and help you incorporate
your<00:04:31.720> whole<00:04:31.990> body<00:04:32.230> into<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.220> benchpress<00:04:35.040> it's

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
your whole body into the benchpress it's

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.830 
your whole body into the benchpress it's
also<00:04:36.220> very<00:04:36.490> important<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.150> get<00:04:37.270> your<00:04:37.360> timing

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
also very important to get your timing

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.660 
also very important to get your timing
down<00:04:37.870> right<00:04:38.320> if<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:38.740> use<00:04:38.980> leg<00:04:39.220> drive<00:04:39.460> before

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
down right if you use leg drive before

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.000 
down right if you use leg drive before
you<00:04:39.910> actually<00:04:40.300> push<00:04:40.540> that's<00:04:41.530> going<00:04:41.770> to<00:04:41.830> mess

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
you actually push that's going to mess

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.370 
you actually push that's going to mess
it<00:04:42.160> up<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.460> want<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.700> have<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.360> as<00:04:43.840> soon<00:04:44.200> as<00:04:44.320> you

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
it up you want to have it as soon as you

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.170 
it up you want to have it as soon as you
push<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.710> bar<00:04:45.040> that's<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.430> second<00:04:45.790> use<00:04:45.970> leg

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
push the bar that's a second use leg

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.600 
push the bar that's a second use leg
drive<00:04:46.450> so<00:04:46.780> here's<00:04:47.620> how<00:04:47.830> it<00:04:47.950> looks<00:04:48.100> like<00:04:48.310> in

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
drive so here's how it looks like in

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.590 
drive so here's how it looks like in
action

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.850 

so<00:04:52.600> here's<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.050> all<00:04:53.140> put<00:04:53.350> together<00:04:53.470> with<00:04:53.830> some

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
so here's it all put together with some

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
so here's it all put together with some
weight<00:04:54.160> on<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.400> bar

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
weight on the bar

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.970 
weight on the bar
finding<00:04:55.810> where<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:55.990> put<00:04:56.200> my<00:04:56.230> hands<00:04:56.560> on<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.770> bar

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
finding where I put my hands on the bar

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.670 
finding where I put my hands on the bar
making<00:04:57.370> sure<00:04:57.520> it's<00:04:57.670> even<00:04:58.060> now<00:04:59.020> I'm<00:04:59.410> pinching

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
making sure it's even now I'm pinching

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.710 
making sure it's even now I'm pinching
my<00:04:59.920> shoulder<00:05:00.250> blades<00:05:00.460> down<00:05:00.670> and<00:05:00.730> back<00:05:00.940> getting

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
my shoulder blades down and back getting

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.020 
my shoulder blades down and back getting
a<00:05:01.870> good<00:05:02.020> setup<00:05:02.410> on<00:05:02.620> racking<00:05:03.130> I'm<00:05:03.430> really<00:05:03.820> tight

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
a good setup on racking I'm really tight

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.250 
a good setup on racking I'm really tight
and<00:05:04.300> I'm<00:05:05.110> lowering<00:05:05.470> it<00:05:05.650> down<00:05:05.680> in<00:05:06.190> arc<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:06.940> I'm

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
and I'm lowering it down in arc and I'm

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.870 
and I'm lowering it down in arc and I'm
exploding<00:05:08.260> it<00:05:08.380> off<00:05:08.470> my<00:05:08.680> chest<00:05:09.040> while<00:05:09.640> using

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
exploding it off my chest while using

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.470 
exploding it off my chest while using
lead<00:05:10.180> drive<00:05:12.330> now<00:05:13.390> here's<00:05:14.110> it<00:05:14.290> with<00:05:14.380> 225<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.550> my

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
lead drive now here's it with 225 and my

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.580 
lead drive now here's it with 225 and my
leg<00:05:16.690> drive<00:05:16.870> is<00:05:16.990> going<00:05:17.140> to<00:05:17.200> become<00:05:17.410> more

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
leg drive is going to become more

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.900 
leg drive is going to become more
apparent<00:05:17.800> here<00:05:18.100> you'll<00:05:18.220> actually<00:05:18.430> be<00:05:18.640> able<00:05:18.760> to

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
apparent here you'll actually be able to

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.330 
apparent here you'll actually be able to
see<00:05:19.120> my<00:05:19.270> legs<00:05:19.540> tense<00:05:20.320> up<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.770> second<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.310> I

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
see my legs tense up the second that I

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.640 
see my legs tense up the second that I
actually<00:05:21.640> push<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.240> bar<00:05:22.419> because<00:05:23.260> the

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
actually push the bar because the

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.140 
actually push the bar because the
heavier<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:24.070> weight<00:05:24.250> gets<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.940> more

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
heavier the weight gets the more

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.760 
heavier the weight gets the more
noticeable<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.660> leg<00:05:25.780> drive<00:05:25.990> will<00:05:26.260> be<00:05:26.560> for

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
noticeable the leg drive will be for

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.050 
noticeable the leg drive will be for
most<00:05:26.950> people<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:28.380> I'm<00:05:29.380> setting<00:05:29.650> up<00:05:30.000> getting<00:05:31.000> a

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
most people so I'm setting up getting a
