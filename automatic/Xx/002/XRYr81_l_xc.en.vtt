00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.110
 hi how are sawyer and here and today we are going 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:17.100
 to prepare a rich coffee flan and these 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.100
 they are the ingredients 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.890
 for this saying what we are going to 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.890
 need 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.560
 coffee 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.670
 a condensed milk the milkmaid one 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.390
 evaporated milk 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:38.739
 six eggs three quarters of a cup 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:42.460
 aluminum paper sugar we will occupy 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.559
 also a flanera that is this that is 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.470
 which can be translated into others 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.660
 frets so we can make the flan and 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.960
 also what we will occupy is going to be a 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.750
 pot express and this is the first thing that 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.300
 let's do the first thing we will do is 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.720
 that in the way we are going to put what 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.280
 It's three quarters of a cup of sugar 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.050
 I like that the truth with a lot 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.330
 candy for these are three quarters of 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.240
 cup you can put the amount of 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.820
 sugar that you like and we 're going to 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.100
 put on low heat so that we are not 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.930
 go burn the sugar nothing more than 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.390
 we begin to see that it is beginning to be 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.860
 liquid and turn a brown tone like 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.470
 honey type and that's when we're going to pay 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.750
 here is the candy no matter what 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.700
 have these tails and these are going to 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.120
 remove then at this time already you 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120
 he turned off 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.109
 and with this I'm going to start this cap 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.119
 mold then here what follows is to put 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.880
 all the ingredients not all 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.980
 other ingredients in the blender is 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.840
 in evaporated milk 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.840
 this is condensed milk 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.030
 all this 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.579
 also the 6 eggs 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.690
 good 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:23.190
 and we are going to put two tablespoons of coffee 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.380
 spoonful coffee maker here we're not going to put 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.190
 and we're going to liquefy it very well for 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.230
 then incorporate it into the flanera where 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.650
 already candy is not easy for 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.739
 banks and it's already cold as we liquefy 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.200
 everything perfectly so that it incorporates 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.209
 all now what we are going to do is 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.209
 add zeal to the ways 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.940
 all because it is exactly the measure of 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.370
 the ways and what we are going to do here 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.060
 it's with aluminum foil we're going to 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.980
 cover all this so that it is the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.250
 better and here I put the role of 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:08.140
 aluminum I already put the cover here the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.750
 cover brings you a little hand to 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.990
 this grab it perfect I here I have 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.570
 little water water I will see where 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.800
 come if I do not keep putting more to my 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:24.490
 mold and then as I saw it is perfect 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.430
 this water here we will leave it for 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.560
 30 minutes after we cover it and 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.530
 start to sound the valve then I'll 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.510
 to cover the pressure cooker for here already 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.580
 cover now what I'm going to expect is that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.630
 when it starts making noise whatever it is 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.180
 this valve starts to sound 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.330
 when it starts to sound I'm going to count 30 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.320
 minutes and I'll wait for it to cool 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.360
 when this valve cools down here 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.540
 when it 's hot it goes up and when 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.370
 it's cold is like right now when 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.890
 it's like this again I'm going to uncover it for 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.050
 unmold it but I'm going to wait 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.840
 let it cool a little 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.970
 from here the time has passed since it was consumed 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.490
 the water is already consumed here 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.890
 what I'm going to do is take it out of there and 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.280
 I'm going to put it here on top of the stove 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.580
 so that it goes cold as it 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.860
 be cold then we wait about two hours 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.750
 maybe we can unmold it 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.840
 make up or uncover to see if 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.529
 It was cooked then we put a 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.679
 knife 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.889
 and if it comes out clean is that it is already if they see 

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:41.349
 here it came out clean 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.940
 so now what I'm going to expect is 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:48.130
 that is cool to be able to unmold 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.910
 and here we have it finished and you des 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:55.240
 mold and so we're going to decorate it with 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.850
 cherries I hope you like try and go to 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.680
 see that he is very rich we see each other until the 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.030
 next do not forget to subscribe and 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.030
 comment see you
