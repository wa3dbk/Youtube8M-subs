more I'll try it locked
all<00:03:24.620> right<00:03:24.890> or<00:03:25.160> move<00:03:25.459> is<00:03:25.610> just<00:03:25.640> coming<00:03:26.090> off<00:03:26.209> or

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
all right or move is just coming off or

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.710 
all right or move is just coming off or
now<00:03:26.540> it's<00:03:27.290> also<00:03:27.500> just<00:03:27.800> of<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.450> unscrewed<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.570> on

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720

turn around one and stuff and so

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.140 
turn around one and stuff and so
probably<00:03:33.380> harder<00:03:33.680> putting<00:03:34.519> off<00:03:34.640> place<00:03:34.910> again

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
probably harder putting off place again
