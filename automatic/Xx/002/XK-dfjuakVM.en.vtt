00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.169
 Russia approved the method of determining 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.829
 fire risks for residential and office 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.149
 buildings and structures 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.109
 calculations and measures to be taken 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.109
 if the building does not satisfy 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.989
 fire safety requirements 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.129
 clarifies the order of the Ministry 

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:24.460
 emergency document 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.559
 published in a Russian newspaper 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.539
 according to the approved 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.939
 a technique definitely 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.990
 determination of payments to the police 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.650
 percentage is in the calculation and 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.430
 individual fire risk for 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.829
 staff tenants as well as for all people 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.820
 which are in the building so for what 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.629
 it is necessary but in opera to 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.210
 compiled and all possible instructions 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.640
 evacuation plans 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.780
 in the end, tel 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.640
 do not take into account many factors 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.260
 initially on each buildings and structures 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.070
 exporting organization 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.979
 fire declaration 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.969
 which indicates which are not executed 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.869
 fire safety standards and what 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:00.659
 then fire protection 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.339
 declaration is submitted to local authorities 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.749
 state fire supervision 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.649
 city ​​of districts heading 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.490
 notice of order 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.740
 Lenin spectrum of state supervision in 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.800
 determines a lot just correctly 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.939
 filled gasoline think this declaration 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.610
 already 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.330
 in determining activities for 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.640
 oz control of course he looks 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.300
 declaration and when checking because 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.910
 he already has to take into account 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.570
 parallel with the pressure irregularity on 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.040
 completeness organized in 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.660
 declaration calculation of fire risks when 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.760
 making a declaration 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.920
 produced by the method 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.650
 approved by the ministry 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.380
 emergency situations 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.560
 it is necessary for buildings built before 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.680
 entering into force 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.439
 fire safety requirements as well 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.899
 for buildings built by 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.560
 projects that do not take into account these 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.650
 tennis federation requirements 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.770
 but also studied 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.700
 the situation looks like there is a creation here 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.929
 for example, here in this building it looks 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.120
 what kind 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.510
 in materials he is on Wednesday in is located 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.450
 Galician village or not flammable easily perceived 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.960
 ignited neither easily 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.090
 flammable if estimated gasoline 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.920
 kerosene and its other other substances 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.299
 considering the experience all all all these factors 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.499
 but the commission used to joke parishko 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.629
 room conclusions she calculates about 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.109
 according to published 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.449
 methodology but also to assign creation 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:24.089
 degrees 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:26.589
 there is a problem of fire danger 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.040
 especially in the old building 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.310
 Well, nothing but smart wiring is 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.400
 problems premier building built 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.570
 think not everyone was celebrated there as years 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.630
 building high-rise they have neither 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.330
 foreseen by defense projects 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.950
 engineering systems represented protection 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.150
 that is, there is no fire 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.139
 alarm component 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.849
 rocket carrier he's there smoke exhaust so 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.909
 further to assign buildings a new degree 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.079
 fire hazard 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.779
 for example, if the system was not installed 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.109
 fire fighting and fire fighting 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.310
 alarms 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.170
 all fire risk calculations are also 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.880
 need to produce again 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.039
 all violations create a threat 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.829
 we had no fire with him or 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.399
 safety of people in buildings that are not 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:08.559
 meet the requirements of fire 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:09.879
 security 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.399
 we are where the risk of fire 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:15.339
 her people safety 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:17.619
 we send materials to court on 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.459
 suspension of activity 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.229
 statistics about 15 percent 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.229
 Russian buildings have no effect 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.680
 fire protection systems 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.520
 with seventy percent of the time 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.160
 cause of 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.240
 fires is careless 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.510
 handling of fire another 20 percent 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.110
 fires occur due to 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.950
 wiring faults
