ROM

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
ROM

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.729 
ROM
for<00:02:13.730> now<00:02:13.879> I<00:02:13.909> think<00:02:14.090> only<00:02:14.689> compatible<00:02:15.049> with<00:02:15.290> a

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
for now I think only compatible with a

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.479 
for now I think only compatible with a
32b<00:02:16.489> model<00:02:16.849> then<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.900> CH<00:02:18.230> boot<00:02:18.469> which<00:02:19.249> means

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
32b model then you CH boot which means

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.429 
32b model then you CH boot which means
the<00:02:19.939> SPL<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:22.209> if<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.359> haven't<00:02:23.569> flashed<00:02:24.049> a

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
the SPL and if you haven't flashed a

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.699 
the SPL and if you haven't flashed a
custom<00:02:25.099> SPL<00:02:25.579> yet<00:02:25.879> it's<00:02:26.319> still<00:02:27.319> gonna<00:02:27.439> be<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
custom SPL yet it's still gonna be the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.259 
custom SPL yet it's still gonna be the
stock<00:02:28.099> one<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:28.519> guess<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.790> stock<00:02:29.000> one<00:02:29.150> is

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
stock one and I guess the stock one is

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.899 
stock one and I guess the stock one is
133<00:02:30.260> zero<00:02:30.950> zero<00:02:31.459> zero<00:02:31.959> seven<00:02:33.519> but<00:02:34.519> we're<00:02:34.700> gonna

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
133 zero zero zero seven but we're gonna

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.640 
133 zero zero zero seven but we're gonna
flash<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:36.909> custom<00:02:37.909> SPL<00:02:38.389> and<00:02:38.569> then<00:02:39.109> the<00:02:39.260> radio

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
flash a custom SPL and then the radio

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.550 
flash a custom SPL and then the radio
it's<00:02:40.219> a<00:02:40.370> different<00:02:40.669> radio<00:02:41.000> but<00:02:41.329> you<00:02:41.689> have<00:02:42.290> to

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
it's a different radio but you have to

running clockworkmod and of course your

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.390 
running clockworkmod and of course your

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
reboot into recovery mode and then you

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.510 
reboot into recovery mode and then you
can<00:05:48.310> check<00:05:48.720> what<00:05:49.720> by<00:05:49.930> our<00:05:50.080> Facebook<00:05:50.620> fastboot

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
can check what by our Facebook fastboot

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.490 
can check what by our Facebook fastboot
mode<00:05:53.220> if<00:05:54.220> everything<00:05:55.110> has<00:05:56.110> been<00:05:56.320> done

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
mode if everything has been done

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.350 
mode if everything has been done
correctly<00:05:56.979> and<00:05:57.310> then<00:05:57.729> there's<00:05:58.030> going<00:05:58.240> to<00:05:58.300> be

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
correctly and then there's going to be

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.080 
correctly and then there's going to be
the<00:05:58.599> new<00:05:58.810> H<00:05:59.169> boot<00:05:59.440> and<00:05:59.770> radio<00:06:00.250> listed<00:06:00.849> in

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
the new H boot and radio listed in

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.980 
the new H boot and radio listed in
fastboot<00:06:01.599> mode<00:06:01.949> ok<00:06:02.949> so<00:06:03.520> this<00:06:04.449> is<00:06:04.599> the<00:06:04.720> first

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
fastboot mode ok so this is the first

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.379 
fastboot mode ok so this is the first
step<00:06:05.260> to<00:06:05.710> flash<00:06:06.010> the<00:06:06.250> new<00:06:06.370> radio<00:06:06.610> and<00:06:07.000> to<00:06:07.300> the

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
step to flash the new radio and to the

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.409 
step to flash the new radio and to the
new<00:06:07.539> SPL<00:06:08.020> but<00:06:09.010> when<00:06:09.400> you're<00:06:09.610> done<00:06:09.880> flashing

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
new SPL but when you're done flashing

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.140 
new SPL but when you're done flashing
you're<00:06:10.930> good<00:06:11.229> to<00:06:11.349> go<00:06:11.380> to<00:06:11.580> go<00:06:12.580> on<00:06:12.729> to<00:06:12.849> the<00:06:12.940> next

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
you're good to go to go on to the next

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.800 
you're good to go to go on to the next
step<00:06:13.449> which<00:06:13.720> is<00:06:13.889> ginger<00:06:14.889> Yoshi<00:06:15.130> 1.5<00:06:17.490> maybe

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
step which is ginger Yoshi 1.5 maybe

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.830 
step which is ginger Yoshi 1.5 maybe
before<00:06:19.810> you<00:06:19.870> flash<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:20.470> ROM<00:06:20.880> do<00:06:21.880> a<00:06:21.909> full<00:06:22.599> wipe

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
before you flash the ROM do a full wipe

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.620 
before you flash the ROM do a full wipe
