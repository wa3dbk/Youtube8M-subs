00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800

such a big issue because left mids don't
get<00:02:31.980> put<00:02:32.940> into<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.209> game<00:02:33.360> as<00:02:33.540> much<00:02:33.569> as<00:02:33.750> when<00:02:34.080> he

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
get put into the game as much as when he

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.930 
get put into the game as much as when he
was<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.470> striker<00:02:34.739> position<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.340> come<00:02:35.910> on

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
was in a striker position but come on

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.280

room<00:03:00.080> one<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.200> them<00:03:01.319> isn't<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.650> best<00:03:01.830> but

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.650 
NEMA or Lucas inform hell yeah go for
Neymar<00:03:19.920> especially<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.940> because<00:03:21.209> Lucas<00:03:21.510> is

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
Neymar especially that because Lucas is

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.940 
Neymar especially that because Lucas is
a<00:03:21.690> right<00:03:21.959> foot<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.260> he's<00:03:22.380> on<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.500> right<00:03:22.739> mid

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
a right foot and he's on the right mid

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.199 
a right foot and he's on the right mid
so<00:03:23.100> it's<00:03:23.190> harder<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:23.459> him<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.700> move<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:24.060> to

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
so it's harder for him to move in to

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.960 
so it's harder for him to move in to
finesse<00:03:25.079> it<00:03:25.110> but<00:03:25.500> where's<00:03:26.340> Neymar's<00:03:26.790> better

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
finesse it but where's Neymar's better

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.610 
finesse it but where's Neymar's better
off<00:03:27.060> on<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.299> left<00:03:27.630> mid<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:27.989> can<00:03:28.110> cut<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.380> in

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
off on the left mid we can cut it in

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.680 
off on the left mid we can cut it in
just<00:03:29.280> use<00:03:29.549> his<00:03:29.730> right<00:03:29.880> foot<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.150> finish<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.570> off

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
just use his right foot to finish it off

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.300 
just use his right foot to finish it off
so<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:30.870> think<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.200> should<00:03:31.350> go<00:03:31.410> for<00:03:31.440> Neymar<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.040> a

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
so I think you should go for Neymar is a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.420 
so I think you should go for Neymar is a
grade<00:03:32.640> by<00:03:32.850> great<00:03:33.470> player<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.799> lot<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.190> might

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
grade by great player a lot of you might

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.190 
grade by great player a lot of you might
think<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.760> cheaper<00:03:36.120> alternatives<00:03:36.630> true<00:03:36.870> there

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
think is cheaper alternatives true there

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.350 
think is cheaper alternatives true there
are<00:03:37.350> but<00:03:37.920> as<00:03:38.190> if<00:03:38.370> people<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.820> coins<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.299> our

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
are but as if people have coins and our

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.060 
are but as if people have coins and our
big<00:03:39.540> fan<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.019> stuff<00:03:40.260> name<00:03:40.500> on<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.890> way<00:03:41.010> to

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
big fan and stuff name on is the way to

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.800 
big fan and stuff name on is the way to
go<00:03:41.250> that's<00:03:41.459> for<00:03:41.640> sure<00:03:41.790> got<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.239> decent<00:03:42.450> left
