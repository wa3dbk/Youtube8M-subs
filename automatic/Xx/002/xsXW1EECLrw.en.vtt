00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello how are you and welcome to this 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.049
 guitar tutorial indeed this video 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.179
 has dedicated to kléber chávez that already 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.000
 I had asked for a tutorial of strumming in 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.580
 the song away from you so this 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.010
 tutorial goes for you nclr I hope it serves you 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.760
 and I hope that also serve all 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.340
 that they use to have this video we are 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.530
 to put ourselves a bit in context I'm going to 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.290
 play a part of the chorus of the song and 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:31.029
 then I'll pass radio signals ok 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.029
 then it was more or less like that 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.129
 like you 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.480
 away from you 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.210
 there is like him 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.210
 yes 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.650
 then let's move on to explain the geo 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.200
 we'll try 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.480
 and move the camera closer to the 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.400
 box so that you can appreciate 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.440
 better there we are ok ok this strum of 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.330
 fact is not complicated but it is a 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.540
 little more elaborate than those that explained 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.030
 before there is a tutorial on the 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.800
 strum of Andean rhythms this would be a 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.600
 third style because before there are taught 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.850
 a traditional region and the trait of 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.670
 alternative this here is a third 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.420
 style we are then 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.420
 It's like watching this 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.770
 ok then in this third style I'm going to 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.590
 try to be the most 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.960
 the most methodological to try to 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.549
 explain it in a simple way so 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.640
 that can be assimilated and you can 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.810
 practice it later ok then 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.890
 this strumming consists of starting a 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.409
 strum down 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.890
 a strum down and up 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.979
 a click is to say a thud 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.460
 a drop of the thumb that is here low 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.940
 the thumb and his life 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.940
 Y 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.530
 is this now let's do it in a way 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.730
 slower and more explicitly 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:27.340
 again a strumming down 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.850
 a drop and rise click below and 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.820
 up there is no doubt 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:40.340
 again flush 2 down and up 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:43.129
 click and down and up very vulgar 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.610
 ok the way we're going it so 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.610
 progressive 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.430
 Y 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.160
 and as we practice and do it 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:11.720
 let's go earning a little more speed 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:13.550
 it will sound more or less like this with the help of 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.300
 the chords will make it sound more or 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.300
 less so 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.450
 and we will sing 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.270
 ok and well that's all I will not happen to 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.560
 explain the chords but I 'm going to 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.870
 leave a link in the part of the 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.810
 description so they can visit them and 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.520
 can play this song we're fine 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.370
 that's all I hope has served you 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.960
 kléber and for all I also hope that 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.230
 have been helpful thanks 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.230
 by your attention
