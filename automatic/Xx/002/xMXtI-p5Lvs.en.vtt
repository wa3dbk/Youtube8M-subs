so<00:02:34.170> secure<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.950> said<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.549> double

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
so secure like I said this is a double

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.900 
so secure like I said this is a double

this tray right here this is $35.99 and
that's<00:02:55.140> with<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.440> 10%<00:02:55.650> off<00:02:56.450> these<00:02:57.450> are

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
that's with the 10% off these are

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.099 
that's with the 10% off these are
fantastic<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.739> said<00:02:59.040> they<00:02:59.220> do<00:02:59.280> snap

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
fantastic like I said they do snap

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.039 
fantastic like I said they do snap
they're<00:03:01.109> stackable<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:03.269> they<00:03:03.660> interlock

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
they're stackable and they interlock

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.229 
they're stackable and they interlock
just<00:03:04.620> like<00:03:04.829> so<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.549> stack<00:03:05.850> them<00:03:06.060> up

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
just like so and you can stack them up

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.190 
just like so and you can stack them up
as<00:03:06.390> high<00:03:06.420> as<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:08.480> now<00:03:09.480> this<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.900> another

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
as high as you like now this is another

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.680 
as high as you like now this is another
double<00:03:10.410> trend<00:03:10.859> has<00:03:11.130> delicas<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.060> do<00:03:12.600> you

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
double trend has delicas in it do you

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.259 
double trend has delicas in it do you
see<00:03:12.900> how<00:03:13.049> beautiful<00:03:13.290> those<00:03:13.769> are<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.370> they<00:03:15.150> are

of 15 and this is a single trade this is
$25.99<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.360> just<00:03:48.630> one<00:03:48.900> layer<00:03:49.170> tray<00:03:49.760> it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
$25.99 it is just one layer tray it

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.259 
$25.99 it is just one layer tray it
holds<00:03:51.120> 50<00:03:51.540> jars<00:03:52.310> but<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.819> best<00:03:54.060> thing

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
I've seen so far for the beading you can

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.220 
I've seen so far for the beading you can
take<00:03:57.090> them<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:57.420> put<00:03:57.569> them<00:03:57.690> in<00:03:57.780> your<00:03:57.930> craft
