 The faithful have changed a few words to express the meaning of the song and its messengers. The authors hope that the words do not cause any sensitivity. In this case, or if there are any mistakes in the translation, they pledge and request a message at the following email address: 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Land of Hope 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.000
 You know it is not easy to write and register 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 But tell me how to give hope to music 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Tightness in the heart of my heart narrowed 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Seven spells in one heart 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 I speak without moving my lips speak from my belly 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.000
 In the chest of anger and the memory of my mother 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 At four in the morning he discovered palaces of sand 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 They will fall down 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Imagine the future of 3013 people scavenging 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Such as fantasy stories 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Colonize the universe and spread hatred 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Now like cancer spread 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 In the Niger Delta he wins and governs death 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 In a river of fire due to oil and pollution 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.500
 Imam of Mabdosa (Isle of Sol and the boat of immigrants in Italy) in search of life 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.000
 You are drowning and hoping for a new life to die 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 The coast in front of you extend your hand as you get it 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Escape from you and your narrowing 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Cursed beards of the cow who do not help 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 But say to me 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Look down and your head is hidden in Ramla 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 So do not hear the footsteps of those who 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 They pray on the land of hope 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 They throw stones at a man without hope 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Desperate anonymous personality 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 and what are you doing? What has changed? 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Now do not tell me you can not sleep 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Because you know that there is a whole world 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 He lives underground in a war 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Look at the war for you also 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Her hair is in the middle of the sea like an immigrant 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Where is the coast? How much did you sail? 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 From Africa to Sicily How I miss my daughter 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Each wave shattering consumes the beam 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Thirst in the water without drinking 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 The irony of life is always cruel 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Without the wind in the sails you shall not sail 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Do not know the direction and called your Lord 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 The hypocrisy of a nation does not help 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Death brings public attention 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Hidden silly people and prejudiced opinions 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 But they speak and are miles away 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Look down and your head is hidden in Ramla 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 So do not hear the footsteps of those who 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 They pray on the land of hope 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 They throw stones at a man without hope 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Desperate anonymous personality 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 and what are you doing? What has changed? 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Because you know that there is a whole world 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 He lives underground in a war 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Look at the war for you also 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 There are those who fire from the Lord called 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 And who is not afraid to take another step to help the two brothers 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Another step 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 and what are you doing? What has changed? 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 He lives underground in a war 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
