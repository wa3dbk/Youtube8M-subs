through shields so people who are
standing<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.600> say<00:00:54.960> Spears<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:56.149> crash<00:00:57.149> site

areas<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.199> they<00:00:58.289> hold<00:00:58.620> those<00:00:58.859> shields<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
areas and they hold those shields up you

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.250 
areas and they hold those shields up you
can<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.210> much<00:01:00.300> shoot<00:01:00.690> through<00:01:01.050> them

me and I just shot them right through
the<00:01:04.559> shield<00:01:04.799> microwaved<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.880> no<00:01:06.180> problem

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the shield microwaved them no problem

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.780 
the shield microwaved them no problem
now<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.740> thing<00:01:08.010> seems<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.580> pretty

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
now as this thing seems to be pretty

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.820 
now as this thing seems to be pretty
much<00:01:08.909> perfectly<00:01:09.630> accurate<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> hip

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
much perfectly accurate from the hip

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.410 
much perfectly accurate from the hip
you'll<00:01:11.070> notice<00:01:11.369> I'm<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.700> even<00:01:11.939> aiming<00:01:12.150> down

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you'll notice I'm not even aiming down

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.420 
you'll notice I'm not even aiming down
sights<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.200> weapon<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.979> does<00:01:14.220> come

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
sights with this weapon it does come

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
sights with this weapon it does come
with<00:01:14.460> about<00:01:14.820> four<00:01:15.119> different<00:01:15.450> kinds<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.840> sites

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
with about four different kinds of sites

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.679 
with about four different kinds of sites
you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.259> equip<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.640> say<00:01:17.939> what's<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.479> point

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you can equip but I say what's the point

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.719 
you can equip but I say what's the point
why<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.500> keep<00:01:19.650> firing<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.189> thing<00:01:20.250> from

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
why not just keep firing this thing from

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.609 
why not just keep firing this thing from
the<00:01:20.909> hip<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.360> has<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> hundred<00:01:21.900> rounds<00:01:22.530> or

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the hip it has a hundred rounds or

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.190 
the hip it has a hundred rounds or
rather<00:01:22.920> energy<00:01:23.520> per<00:01:23.850> magazine<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
rather energy per magazine and you get a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
rather energy per magazine and you get a
total<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.740> four<00:01:26.009> magazines<00:01:26.310> including<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
total of four magazines including the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.450 
total of four magazines including the
one<00:01:27.450> that's<00:01:27.990> equipped<00:01:28.439> when<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.009> start<00:01:29.310> out

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
one that's equipped when you start out

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
one that's equipped when you start out
this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.850> actually<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> decent<00:01:30.570> amount<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.140> ammo

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
this is actually a decent amount of ammo

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.050 
this is actually a decent amount of ammo
and<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:31.920> does<00:01:32.189> allow<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.880> on

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and it really does allow you to go on

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.539 
and it really does allow you to go on
some<00:01:33.270> killing<00:01:33.750> frenzies<00:01:34.409> because<00:01:35.250> you're<00:01:35.430> not

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
some killing frenzies because you're not

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.429 
some killing frenzies because you're not
actually<00:01:35.850> shooting<00:01:36.540> any<00:01:36.689> bullets<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.290> this

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
actually shooting any bullets with this

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.200 
actually shooting any bullets with this
gun<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:37.979> doesn't<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.430> seem<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.939> much

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
gun there doesn't really seem to be much

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.330 
gun there doesn't really seem to be much
of<00:01:39.240> any<00:01:39.659> recoil<00:01:40.140> at<00:01:40.380> all<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> gun<00:01:40.890> seems<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
of any recoil at all the gun seems to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.429 
of any recoil at all the gun seems to
shake<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:42.180> bit<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.930> other<00:01:43.140> than<00:01:43.350> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
shake a little bit but other than that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.460 
shake a little bit but other than that
it's<00:01:43.799> very<00:01:44.220> easy<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.820> keep<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.270> target<00:01:45.600> also

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
it's very easy to keep on target also

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.899 
it's very easy to keep on target also
because<00:01:46.799> you're<00:01:46.890> not<00:01:47.040> firing<00:01:47.340> bullets<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
because you're not firing bullets the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.179 
because you're not firing bullets the
thing<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.329> very<00:01:48.600> quiet<00:01:48.960> when<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.619> firing<00:01:49.860> so

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
thing is very quiet when it's firing so

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.460 
thing is very quiet when it's firing so
often<00:01:50.880> enemies<00:01:51.299> won't<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.990> realize

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
often enemies won't really realize

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.139 
often enemies won't really realize
what's<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.490> they<00:01:53.610> won't<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.820> able<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
what's going on or they won't be able to

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.120 
what's going on or they won't be able to
pinpoint<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.899> quickly<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.979> because

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
pinpoint you as quickly just because

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.550 
pinpoint you as quickly just because
they<00:01:56.430> don't<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:57.149> bullet<00:01:58.110> sound<00:01:58.380> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
they don't have that bullet sound that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.709 
they don't have that bullet sound that
they're<00:01:58.740> also<00:01:58.890> used<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.520> hearing<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.509> mic

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
they're also used to hearing so the mic

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.959 
they're also used to hearing so the mic
is<00:02:00.899> actually<00:02:01.409> quite<00:02:01.829> nice<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.729> getting

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
is actually quite nice for getting

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.480 
is actually quite nice for getting
around<00:02:03.140> unnoticed<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.320> getting<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.189> close

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
around unnoticed and getting in close

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.789 
around unnoticed and getting in close
quarters<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.119> those<00:02:06.270> easy<00:02:06.600> kills<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.469> my

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
quarters for those easy kills in my

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.469 
quarters for those easy kills in my
experience<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.489> actually<00:02:08.879> seems<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.330> do

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
experience that actually seems to do

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.330 
experience that actually seems to do
alright<00:02:09.959> at<00:02:10.170> range<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.739> well<00:02:10.950> you're<00:02:11.310> just

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
alright at range as well you're just

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.010 
alright at range as well you're just
gonna<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.819> stay<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.150> target<00:02:12.480> for<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> while

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
gonna have to stay on target for a while

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.520 
gonna have to stay on target for a while
so<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.319> some

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so if some

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.710 
so if some
he's<00:02:13.650> moving<00:02:14.069> around<00:02:14.240> bouncing<00:02:15.240> around<00:02:15.360> at

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
he's moving around bouncing around at

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.030 
he's moving around bouncing around at
range<00:02:15.959> you're<00:02:16.200> gonna<00:02:16.319> really<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.950> get

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
range you're gonna really have to get

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.220 
range you're gonna really have to get
your<00:02:17.220> aim<00:02:17.400> down<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.450> other<00:02:18.630> than<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.930> it

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
your aim down but other than that it

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.140 
your aim down but other than that it
doesn't<00:02:19.560> seem<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.040> too<00:02:20.069> much<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.790> a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
doesn't seem to have too much of a

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.630 
doesn't seem to have too much of a
damage<00:02:21.540> drop-off<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.290> had<00:02:22.590> no<00:02:22.950> problem<00:02:23.400> taking

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
damage drop-off I had no problem taking

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.160 
damage drop-off I had no problem taking
guys<00:02:23.970> out<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.660> what<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> would<00:02:24.959> consider

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
guys out and what I would consider

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.170 
guys out and what I would consider
medium-range<00:02:26.130> as<00:02:26.430> long<00:02:26.610> as<00:02:26.730> they<00:02:26.850> don't<00:02:27.030> move

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
medium-range as long as they don't move

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.449 
medium-range as long as they don't move
around<00:02:27.360> too<00:02:27.780> much<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.650> would<00:02:28.950> recommend

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
around too much but I would recommend

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.070 
around too much but I would recommend
trying<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.760> get<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.060> close<00:02:30.480> for<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> kill<00:02:30.900> just

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
trying to get in close for the kill just

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.170 
trying to get in close for the kill just
so<00:02:31.500> they<00:02:31.620> can't<00:02:31.860> get<00:02:32.069> away<00:02:32.190> from<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.760> there's

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
so they can't get away from you there's

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.309 
so they can't get away from you there's
a<00:02:33.270> whole<00:02:33.420> bunch<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.690> different<00:02:33.810> kinds<00:02:34.140> of

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
a whole bunch of different kinds of

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.290 
a whole bunch of different kinds of
builds<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.890> could<00:02:35.069> use<00:02:35.280> for<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.850> Mike<00:02:36.060> do<00:02:36.239> you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
builds you could use for the Mike do you

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.210 
builds you could use for the Mike do you
want<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.630> really<00:02:36.959> fast<00:02:37.260> or<00:02:37.709> would<00:02:38.130> you

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
want to be really fast or would you

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.370 
want to be really fast or would you
rather<00:02:38.340> be<00:02:38.580> really<00:02:38.970> tough<00:02:39.270> or<00:02:39.569> how<00:02:39.930> about<00:02:40.110> both

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
rather be really tough or how about both

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.290 
rather be really tough or how about both
that's<00:02:41.069> what<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.280> seem<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.580> be<00:02:41.730> running<00:02:42.150> with

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
that's what I seem to be running with

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.059 
that's what I seem to be running with
most<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> time<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.260> was<00:02:43.440> using<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.890> gun

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
most of the time I was using this gun

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.300 
most of the time I was using this gun
and<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.430> worked<00:02:44.610> out<00:02:44.810> incredibly<00:02:45.810> well

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
and it worked out incredibly well

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.350 
and it worked out incredibly well
maneuverability<00:02:47.310> as<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:47.910> see<00:02:48.030> here<00:02:48.269> I'm

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
maneuverability as you can see here I'm

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.630 
maneuverability as you can see here I'm
moving<00:02:48.660> around<00:02:48.780> very<00:02:49.200> quickly<00:02:49.500> making<00:02:50.040> me<00:02:50.370> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
moving around very quickly making me a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.420 
moving around very quickly making me a
hard<00:02:51.090> target<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.540> hit<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.930> also<00:02:52.310> allowing<00:02:53.310> me

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
hard target to hit and also allowing me

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.550 
hard target to hit and also allowing me
to<00:02:53.580> get<00:02:53.730> up<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.090> close<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.840> my<00:02:54.959> enemies<00:02:55.350> very

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
to get up and close to my enemies very

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.680 
to get up and close to my enemies very
quickly<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.030> course<00:02:57.269> I'm<00:02:57.420> using

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
quickly and then of course I'm using

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.990 
quickly and then of course I'm using
auto<00:02:58.140> armor<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.550> can<00:02:59.819> keep

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
auto armor so that I can keep

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.360 
auto armor so that I can keep
maneuverability<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.050> keep<00:03:01.380> my<00:03:01.530> speed<00:03:01.860> up<00:03:01.890> and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
maneuverability on keep my speed up and

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.100 
maneuverability on keep my speed up and
fast<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.180> have<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.540> really<00:03:03.780> worry<00:03:04.019> about

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
fast and not have to really worry about

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.380 
fast and not have to really worry about
armor<00:03:04.709> too<00:03:04.920> much<00:03:05.130> let<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.940> take<00:03:06.120> care<00:03:06.150> of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
armor too much let it take care of

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.270 
armor too much let it take care of
itself<00:03:06.600> with<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.500> whole<00:03:07.620> automatic

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
itself with the whole automatic

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.520 
itself with the whole automatic
activation<00:03:08.519> aspect<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:09.989> then<00:03:10.350> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
activation aspect to it and then the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.470 
activation aspect to it and then the
third<00:03:10.560> suit<00:03:11.190> module<00:03:11.610> laughs<00:03:11.790> trying<00:03:12.090> out<00:03:12.300> was

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
third suit module laughs trying out was

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.600 
third suit module laughs trying out was
armor<00:03:12.870> transfer<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.800> basically<00:03:14.250> armor

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
armor transfer so basically armor

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.420 
armor transfer so basically armor
transfer<00:03:15.060> lets<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.959> absorb<00:03:16.769> some<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
transfer lets you absorb some of the
