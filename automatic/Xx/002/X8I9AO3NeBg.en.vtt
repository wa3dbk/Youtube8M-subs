00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 what it means to be taken in the spirit 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.099
 the term being taken in the spirit is 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.349
 used in charismatic circles of 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.420
 churches to designate an assumption 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.150
 movement of the holy spirit on a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.520
 person the affirmation is that the spirit 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.820
 saint moves with such power over a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.189
 person that the person is reduced this 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.170
 does not mean that the person is dominated 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.390
 but he or she is covered by the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.369
 presence of the spirit in such a way that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.160
 that person falls to the floor or enters a 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.500
 kind of trance many evangelists 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 have televised meetings where they meet 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.120
 Christians and in some of these 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.120
 meetings have a special time of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.250
 healing or receiving the spirit here is 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 where the evangelist which is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.899
 supposed to be anointed to do this 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.760
 goes around people placing 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.190
 hands on the forehead of them doing 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.620
 that fall or be taken by the spirit 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.230
 insofar as they are covered with the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.899
 presence of the holy spirit this 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.430
 show is ostentatious and 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.799
 unfortunate because he can not 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.390
 be verified and it could be nothing more 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.940
 that feeling overwhelmed 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.490
 the emotions of the person from another side 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.040
 it is possible that the holy spirit can 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.830
 move so powerfully in a person 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.409
 that it can be invaded after 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.170
 every god is incredibly powerful 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.570
 but the problem is not in relation to 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.300
 that possibility but with the fact of whether 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.909
 this is biblical or not we should 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.979
 always look to stay as close as 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.110
 possible to the word of God and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.930
 let us guide by this in our 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.200
 words and practices so let's 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.670
 look at the word maybe the closest 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.130
 circumstance that we can find in 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.840
 the bible in relation to being taken by 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.450
 the spirit is where the apostle Paul 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.820
 falls to the floor when Jesus appeared 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.490
 to him facts 9 34 more going down the road 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.170
 it happened that when you get near damask 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.619
 Suddenly he was surrounded by a glow of 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.950
 light from heaven 4 and falling on earth he heard 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.440
 a voice that said saulo saulo because 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.100
 you persecute me shows this experience 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.260
 that Paul was taken by the spirit 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.600
 but it's an example where people 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.720
 fall to the ground when the presence of 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.790
 sir , my experience is strong 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.190
 subjective includes a time where the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.290
 The power of the Lord was so strong that I saw 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.960
 forced to bend my knees and be 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.150
 on the floor but the result was 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.790
 worship and veneration not a loss 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.190
 of the control of my body however 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.260
 let's look at some verses of the 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.390
 writing to sustain being taken 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.960
 by the spirit matteo 28 24 and there was a 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.040
 great earthquake because an angel of the Lord 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.580
 descending from heaven and arriving 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.370
 he removed the stone and sat on it 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.640
 Perez looked like a lightning bolt and 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.650
 her dress white as snow 4 and of 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.210
 afraid of him the guards trembled and he 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.450
 they were as dead Juan 18 36 judas 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.280
 for taking a company of soldiers and 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.550
 deputies of the chief priests 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.950
 and the Pharisees went there with lanterns 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.400
 and torches and with weapons 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.620
 4 but Jesus knowing all things 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.250
 that they had to come forward 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.819
 and he told who you are looking for 5 him 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.180
 they responded to jesus nazareno jesÃºs them 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.120
 said I am and was also with them 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.659
 judas who gave him 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.720
 when he told them I am they backed down and 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:44.640
 they fell to earth emphasis added facts 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.860
 26 13 14 when at noon or king going 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.170
 along the way I saw a light from heaven that 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.909
 the sun shone past the 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.299
 which surrounded me to those who were going 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.610
 with me 14 and having fallen all 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.400
 we on land heard a voice that 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.000
 He spoke and said in the Hebrew language Saul 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.790
 saul because you persecute me hard thing you 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.620
 is kicking against the sting we can 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.260
 see that in the presence of God the 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.660
 people fall to the ground is natural and 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.310
 own given the majestic sanctity of 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.459
 god compared to our nature 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.699
 Sinner fall to the ground in the presence 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.770
 of the Lord is to be expected but it means 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.560
 this that being taken in the spirit 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.020
 is biblical when someone is taken in 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.880
 the spirit the person is usually 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.610
 touched on the forehead by a shepherd or 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.470
 master evangelist and so on this alone 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.449
 touch seems to be the means by which 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.169
 a person receives this move from 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.990
 Holy Spirit 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.319
 person is then incapacitated by a 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.319
 time period one more time is this 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:49.150
 biblical apparently not because it does not 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.490
 there is only one example in the new 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.379
 testament where someone is touched in the 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.139
 front and falls to the ground due to 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:58.629
 presence of the spirit even more the 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.460
 danger with this phenomenon is that you can 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.139
 be established by the teacher that 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.389
 it seems to be someone special 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.610
 an anointed individual with the power to 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.999
 make the spirit move on the 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.370
 people then they congregate 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:14.439
 around this guy and they see him 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.349
 he or she as a person especially 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:19.719
 anointed this is dangerous because of 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.699
 numerous theological errors taught 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.279
 by many of the evangelists in the 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.529
 television now well I 'm not 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:28.539
 saying that the spirit of god does not 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:31.300
 can touch someone or that the spirit 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.400
 of God do not move today I think very 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.129
 deeply that the spirit is 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.289
 still very active in the church but 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.749
 given the sensationalism in the church 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.240
 television numerous practices do not 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.160
 biblical and the teachings that in these 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.650
 occur and excessive enthusiasm 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.870
 of people to be taken by the 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.780
 spirit would conclude that this phenomenon 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.670
 would be frowned upon because Pablo asked 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:00.730
 order to the Corinthians in 1st Corinthians 14 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:03.160
 39 40 tells us the gentleman that we should not 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.810
 prevent speaking in tongues but says 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.810
 also that we must do everything 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.670
 decently and with order as explained 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.400
 then the noise and disorder that 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.980
 produces in some churches like 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.050
 antecedent we will say that in the church of 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.300
 Corinth was producing a 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.790
 true chaos in relation to the use of 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.980
 the spiritual gifts mainly 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.230
 with the signal gifts which are the 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.570
 gift of tongues the gift of interpretation 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.090
 of tongues the gift of healing and the gift of 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.520
 miracles in their lacerating carnality 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.650
 denounced by the apostle Paul the 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.410
 Corinthian church offered a poor 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.270
 show every time he met the 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.860
 who practiced the authentic gift of 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.660
 languages and also those that 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.930
 they falsified they spoke in any 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.630
 moment without any control nobody 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.490
 understood those who had the gift of 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.650
 interpretation of languages not 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.870
 could use his gift because it was not 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.849
 possible to concentrate on the one that was 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.699
 speaking in tongues because of the crying 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.740
 from others this explains a bit of 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:05.080
 the disorders and displays of power 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.569
 that many today use to attract 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.460
 addicted by miracles not preaching 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:12.280
 the gospel of salvation according to 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.169
 bible each one look according to the spirit 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.539
 Holy the truth and ask for the gift of 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:19.389
 discernment to know when something is not 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:21.699
 is of god or if it is not to be 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:24.659
 deceived by these false prophets of 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:28.440
 today love the art of serving
