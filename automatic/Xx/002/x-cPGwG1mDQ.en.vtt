 tasks will give you an interesting token 

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:47.630

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.299
 like the following assignment called 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.130

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.190
 camouflage which is also called phantom 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.500
 and these camouflage are likely to be for 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.990
 techniques for a fighter and for weapons 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.030
