wear astronaut suits and we'll bounce

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.890

around<00:02:51.190> just<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.640> fight<00:02:51.910> where<00:02:52.120> graphic<00:02:52.720> I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
around just a fight where graphic I

around just a fight where graphic I
don't<00:02:53.290> actually<00:02:53.440> know<00:02:53.650> what<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:54.010> move<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.310> feel

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
don't actually know what the move I feel

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.949 
don't actually know what the move I feel
like<00:02:54.640> Mars's<00:02:55.000> gravity<00:02:55.060> is<00:02:55.510> actually<00:02:55.690> really

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
like Mars's gravity is actually really

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.170 
like Mars's gravity is actually really
similar<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.379> Earth's<00:02:56.590> another<00:02:57.340> moon<00:02:57.610> has<00:02:57.940> less

gravity<00:02:58.209> I'm<00:02:58.810> pretending<00:02:59.110> like<00:02:59.290> I'm<00:02:59.470> walking

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
gravity I'm pretending like I'm walking

on<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.860> moon<00:02:59.890> right<00:03:00.190> now<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.459> probably

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
on the moon right now I probably

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.430 
on the moon right now I probably
shouldn't<00:03:01.090> because<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.870> bedroom<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.290> right

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
shouldn't because the bedroom is right

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.530 
shouldn't because the bedroom is right
under<00:03:02.709> my<00:03:02.829> studio<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.459> nick<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:03.940> sleeping<00:03:04.329> so

under my studio and nick is sleeping so

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.089 
under my studio and nick is sleeping so
i<00:03:04.599> probably<00:03:04.810> shouldn't<00:03:05.140> stamp<00:03:05.470> around<00:03:05.799> like<00:03:06.069> a

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
i probably shouldn't stamp around like a

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.940 
i probably shouldn't stamp around like a
pink<00:03:06.370> headed<00:03:06.610> elephant<00:03:07.019> that's<00:03:08.019> rude<00:03:08.349> um<00:03:09.239> I

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
pink headed elephant that's rude um I
