00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.950
 a University I had a strong desire to be a lawyer since I entered university, 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:13.300
 Various university days 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:19.480
 I heard that the teacher of the lawyer met you 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.870
 And we were able to hear because enthusiasm is whether rewarding for the work lawyer in it 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.980
 Tablet 2 hope to be 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.980
 Well made it stronger 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.220
 It has already been an image like how to paint 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:37.200
 But I got to study every day that every day 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:44.320
 As the station is warm at the head of the exam companion 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:49.870
 I went to a meal and did something like that, but basically from morning to evening 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:54.730
 Questions from the receiving ends with it a lesson 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.510
 It was every day that I was learning myself in my own seat 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 Some of them 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:07.600
 As there is place where we worked together and formed voluntary seminars, such a place 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.600
 I was disappointed with the three years of the three major graduate schools 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:20.170
 After all I think that it is the first to mention that the learning environment is in place 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.860
 First of all, that's the environment in which each one has a self-study space 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.290
 Also 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:31.920
 Such a Toka go that question for the teacher to harm after the lesson is over after 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.920
 The place is equipped with is I think that it is about 5 to read from Chuo University way 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.290
 I had participated in some law firm briefing sessions before taking the exam 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.920
 But 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:48.010
 It was just after the exam that I started job hunting in earnest 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.280
 Very soon ended another round test 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.220
 Large-scale office 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.030
 international 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.650
 For offices that are off international speaking 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.010
 a 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:05.310
 I started job hunting immediately and started the interview with him, so I'm from there right after the exam 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.930
 Say it started 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.650
 It feels like 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:17.050
 We are doing business revitalization of your company 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.620
 Never choose a company that seems to pass by 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.920
 As a company 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.920
 I'm mainly doing the kind of job of having you do my best 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.390
 Naturally business revival itself is that bankruptcy law 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.480
 Matter of fact, for example, the Civil Rehabilitation Law Toka Corporate Rehabilitation Law comes at stake is 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:37.340
 m &amp; is a whether faience relationship 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.879
 It is said that it is a melting pot of law, as it can all be involved in the relationship with Robo . 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.610
 Ne 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:44.310
 Such 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:47.130
 Also I will be happy to do it to a professional in this Kano office that 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.660
 It was great that I received it as a quick reward 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:57.000
 It is one field of business revival, but various such subjects 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:02.610
 After that, I do not think that it is most rewarding to be involved in the field 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.400
 After that I would like to focus on playing g, though 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.210
 as a a lawyer I would like to involved in various sites in the form of a list of Jenny 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.650
 Not 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:18.200
 Yeah That's right I from this 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:21.319
 Kedomo also I think I become to many things hard to Tteyuu lawyer industry 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.870
 There are so many choices of michi o 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:32.250
 In their own anti-So I'm think the wind fields that Ikeru paving the way to your 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:37.390
 I want to actively promote what I want to do 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:41.710
 I think it's a needle with a chance to make use of that I think even four times 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:47.190
 Please come and see me actively in the nest 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.190
 I thought that if it is possible to do because you want to do it is hope Toka
