00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
charge this old classic style can be

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.330 
charge this old classic style can be
used<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.750> today's<00:00:15.870> game<00:00:16.289> believe<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.130> or<00:00:17.220> not

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
used in today's game believe it or not

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.700 
used in today's game believe it or not
there<00:00:18.300> are<00:00:18.330> two<00:00:18.510> primary<00:00:18.750> grips<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.410> doing<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
there are two primary grips for doing a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.130 
there are two primary grips for doing a
chip<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.100> charge<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:21.180> ideal<00:00:21.600> grip<00:00:21.840> would<00:00:21.960> be

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
chip in charge the ideal grip would be

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.230 
chip in charge the ideal grip would be
using<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.560> continental<00:00:23.340> grip<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:23.910> now<00:00:24.029> let's

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
using a continental grip but now let's

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.420 
using a continental grip but now let's
look<00:00:24.390> into<00:00:24.570> an<00:00:24.750> Eastern<00:00:25.289> grip<00:00:25.320> those<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.340> you

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
look into an Eastern grip those of you

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.820 
look into an Eastern grip those of you
who<00:00:26.580> are<00:00:26.670> using<00:00:26.970> an<00:00:27.090> Eastern<00:00:27.539> grip<00:00:27.830> basically

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
who are using an Eastern grip basically

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.370 
who are using an Eastern grip basically
the<00:00:29.429> motion<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.029> still<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> same<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:31.080> still

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the motion is still the same it's still

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.959 
the motion is still the same it's still
a<00:00:31.560> block<00:00:31.920> motion<00:00:32.420> just<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:34.020> slice<00:00:34.910> or<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
a block motion just like a slice or a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.450 
a block motion just like a slice or a
forehand<00:00:36.570> ground<00:00:36.870> stroke<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> finger<00:00:38.250> with

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
forehand ground stroke but a finger with

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
forehand ground stroke but a finger with
a<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.940> chip<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.540> eastern<00:00:39.960> grip<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.260> that

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
a the chip with the eastern grip is that

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.709 
a the chip with the eastern grip is that
you<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.070> little<00:00:41.520> quick<00:00:41.910> swipe<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
you want to do a little quick swipe a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.440 
you want to do a little quick swipe a
little<00:00:43.140> brush<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.129> little<00:00:44.610> quick<00:00:44.850> hit<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
little brush a little quick hit to the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.389 
little brush a little quick hit to the
ball<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.379> thing<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.800> unlike<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
ball the thing is that unlike the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.819 
ball the thing is that unlike the
continent<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.270> forehand<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.200> eastern<00:00:49.680> grip

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
continent to forehand the eastern grip

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.549 
continent to forehand the eastern grip
you<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> actually<00:00:50.660> brush<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you have to actually brush up on the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.729 
you have to actually brush up on the
ball<00:00:52.879> it'll<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:53.969> hard<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> chip<00:00:54.590> downward<00:00:55.590> like

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
ball it'll be hard to chip downward like

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.529 
ball it'll be hard to chip downward like
this<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> motion<00:00:56.670> would<00:00:56.940> look<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.239> this

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
this so the motion would look like this

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.420 
this so the motion would look like this
a<00:00:57.870> little<00:00:58.770> quick<00:00:58.920> hit

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
a little quick hit

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
a little quick hit
notice<00:01:00.000> how<00:01:00.090> I'm<00:01:00.180> blocking<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> ball<00:01:00.960> I'm<00:01:01.199> not

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
notice how I'm blocking the ball I'm not

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
notice how I'm blocking the ball I'm not
doing<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> stroke<00:01:02.160> neither<00:01:02.879> am<00:01:03.210> i<00:01:03.300> doing<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
doing a stroke neither am i doing a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.649 
doing a stroke neither am i doing a
slice<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.070> block<00:01:05.339> motion<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.630> that

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
slice it's a block motion so that

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.200 
slice it's a block motion so that
Eastern<00:01:07.229> grip<00:01:07.409> block<00:01:08.189> motion<00:01:09.740> block<00:01:10.740> motion

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
Eastern grip block motion block motion

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.920 
Eastern grip block motion block motion
after<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.479> chip<00:01:13.010> I'm<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> transition<00:01:14.930> get

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
after I chip I'm going to transition get

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.770 
after I chip I'm going to transition get
ready<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.500> either<00:01:16.770> an<00:01:16.979> approach<00:01:17.340> shot<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
ready to do either an approach shot or a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.999 
ready to do either an approach shot or a
volley<00:01:20.600> pay<00:01:21.600> close<00:01:21.900> attention<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.470> valladon

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
volley pay close attention to valladon

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.950 
volley pay close attention to valladon
his<00:01:23.130> grip<00:01:23.369> he's<00:01:23.640> using<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> continental<00:01:24.930> grip

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
his grip he's using a continental grip

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.289 
his grip he's using a continental grip
so<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> remember<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.340> continental<00:01:27.060> grip

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
so you remember that continental grip

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.420 
so you remember that continental grip
Valon<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.200> actually<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.770> opening<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.280> a

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
Valon will actually be opening up a

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580 
Valon will actually be opening up a
little<00:01:29.640> bit<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.850> his<00:01:29.970> palm<00:01:30.439> blocking<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
little bit of his palm blocking the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.100 
little bit of his palm blocking the
motion<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.909> remember<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.990> you're

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
motion then so remember when you're

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.249 
motion then so remember when you're
doing<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> chip<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> slice<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
doing the chip it's not a slice or a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.140 
doing the chip it's not a slice or a
forehand<00:01:37.710> ground<00:01:37.950> show<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.640> stroke<00:01:38.880> in

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
forehand ground show it's a stroke in

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.480 
forehand ground show it's a stroke in
between<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.720> simple<00:01:40.290> block<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
between a simple block that's what the
