speaking of sharpness out of box this
one<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:03.530> pretty<00:02:04.530> sharp<00:02:04.860> pretty<00:02:05.729> pretty<00:02:05.909> sharp

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
one is pretty sharp pretty pretty sharp

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.850 
one is pretty sharp pretty pretty sharp
have<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> piece<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.860> 550<00:02:08.340> cord<00:02:08.369> here

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.100 

they<00:02:11.860> don't<00:02:12.010> give<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.160> an<00:02:12.220> idea<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.840> pushed

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
they don't give you an idea it is pushed

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.920 
they don't give you an idea it is pushed
cutting<00:02:14.380> sharp<00:02:14.590> very<00:02:15.370> nice<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.720> edge<00:02:16.840> of

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
cutting sharp very nice so the edge of

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.870 
cutting sharp very nice so the edge of
the<00:02:17.020> box<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.380> definitely<00:02:17.770> excellent<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.459> wish

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
the box is definitely excellent I wish

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.309 
the box is definitely excellent I wish
you<00:02:19.000> could<00:02:19.120> say<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.390> same<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.900> Kershaw

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
you could say the same for the Kershaw

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.059 
you could say the same for the Kershaw
oh<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:20.680> sweet<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:22.330> nice<00:02:22.690> short<00:02:22.990> bench<00:02:23.140> blade

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
oh so sweet but nice short bench blade

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.900 
oh so sweet but nice short bench blade
shape<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:25.209> very<00:02:26.020> stubby<00:02:26.560> drop<00:02:26.800> point<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.370> it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
shape is a very stubby drop point and it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.790 
shape is a very stubby drop point and it
would<00:02:28.330> be<00:02:28.360> excellent<00:02:28.720> for<00:02:28.900> ebc<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.440> my<00:02:29.530> opinion

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
would be excellent for ebc in my opinion

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.490 
would be excellent for ebc in my opinion
you<00:02:29.950> know<00:02:30.010> opening<00:02:30.340> boxes<00:02:30.780> maybe<00:02:31.780> some<00:02:32.140> small

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
you know opening boxes maybe some small

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.580 
you know opening boxes maybe some small
food<00:02:32.740> preparation<00:02:33.370> tasks<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:34.380> find<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.410> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
food preparation tasks I find that the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.410 
food preparation tasks I find that the
longer<00:02:35.800> blades<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.880> do<00:02:36.970> better<00:02:37.120> at<00:02:37.270> food

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
longer blades just do better at food

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.850 
longer blades just do better at food
prep<00:02:37.660> maybe<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.709> la<00:02:39.010> rat<00:02:39.640> one<00:02:40.140> but<00:02:41.140> not<00:02:41.590> see<00:02:41.709> bud

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
prep maybe a la rat one but not see bud

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.310 
prep maybe a la rat one but not see bud
probably<00:02:42.489> do<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.660> slicing<00:02:43.660> an<00:02:43.959> apple<00:02:44.050> or

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
probably do a slicing an apple or

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
probably do a slicing an apple or
something<00:02:44.470> like<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.770> I<00:02:44.890> wouldn't<00:02:45.130> take<00:02:45.280> it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
something like that I wouldn't take it

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
something like that I wouldn't take it
to<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.870> full-sized<00:02:46.870> texas<00:02:47.320> steak<00:02:47.560> for<00:02:47.770> anything

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
to a full-sized texas steak for anything

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.530 
to a full-sized texas steak for anything
but<00:02:49.360> adequate<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.470> blade<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.830> Hubble<00:02:51.070> ground

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
but adequate the blade is Hubble ground

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.360 
but adequate the blade is Hubble ground
which<00:02:52.540> makes<00:02:53.019> very<00:02:53.320> very<00:02:53.590> very<00:02:53.769> sharp<00:02:54.130> edge

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
which makes very very very sharp edge

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.110 
which makes very very very sharp edge
and<00:02:54.700> an<00:02:55.570> excellent<00:02:55.840> slicing<00:02:56.260> blade<00:02:57.000> see<00:02:58.000> if<00:02:58.060> i

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
and an excellent slicing blade see if i

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.210 
and an excellent slicing blade see if i
can<00:02:58.239> get<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.360> close-up<00:02:58.540> on<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.780> nice<00:02:59.220> very

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
can get a close-up on that nice very

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.300 
can get a close-up on that nice very
fine<00:03:00.640> cutting<00:03:01.060> edge<00:03:01.300> there<00:03:01.800> very<00:03:02.800> nice<00:03:03.010> knife

it is made in china however if quality
controls<00:03:06.790> are<00:03:06.940> good<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.420> doesn't<00:03:07.690> really

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
controls are good it doesn't really

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.170 
controls are good it doesn't really
matter<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:09.130> doesn't<00:03:09.400> really<00:03:09.489> matter<00:03:09.700> I've<00:03:10.030> had

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
matter it doesn't really matter I've had

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.880 
matter it doesn't really matter I've had
some<00:03:10.390> knives<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:11.019> were<00:03:11.110> made<00:03:11.320> in<00:03:11.440> Japan<00:03:11.739> they

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
some knives that were made in Japan they

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.890 
some knives that were made in Japan they
weren't<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.160> great<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:13.330> now<00:03:13.360> they<00:03:13.540> were<00:03:13.720> made

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
weren't that great so now they were made

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.509 
weren't that great so now they were made
in<00:03:14.019> Germany<00:03:14.500> they<00:03:14.620> weren't<00:03:14.829> that<00:03:14.980> great<00:03:15.130> and

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
in Germany they weren't that great and

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.130 
in Germany they weren't that great and
yeah<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.209> thought<00:03:16.510> knives<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:16.840> were<00:03:16.930> made

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
yeah I thought knives that were made

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.360 
yeah I thought knives that were made
here<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.380> America<00:03:17.739> they<00:03:17.829> were<00:03:17.920> just<00:03:18.040> total

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
here in America they were just total

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.970 
here in America they were just total
crap<00:03:18.579> so<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.540> doesn't<00:03:19.660> really<00:03:19.810> matter<00:03:20.079> where

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
crap so it doesn't really matter where

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.410 
crap so it doesn't really matter where
knives<00:03:21.250> are<00:03:21.400> made<00:03:21.430> guys<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.209> quality

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
knives are made guys is the quality

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.479 
knives are made guys is the quality
control<00:03:22.810> isn't<00:03:22.959> good<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.769> then<00:03:23.950> it's<00:03:24.340> gonna

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
control isn't good and then it's gonna

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.720 
control isn't good and then it's gonna
suck<00:03:24.790> it's<00:03:25.269> just<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.570> way<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:26.730> deployment

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
suck it's just the way it is deployment

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.360 
suck it's just the way it is deployment

thumb stud and that is a bit of a hit

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
thumb stud and that is a bit of a hit
I'll<00:03:32.709> give<00:03:32.860> it<00:03:32.890> its<00:03:33.160> not<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.430> most

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
I'll give it its not the most

pyramid<00:03:58.299> design<00:03:58.390> it's<00:03:58.810> not<00:03:58.930> bad<00:03:59.140> it's<00:03:59.320> just
