higher volume here in this code let's go

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.490 
higher volume here in this code let's go
see<00:03:10.579> more<00:03:11.579> volume<00:03:11.909> in<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.120> let's<00:03:13.109> find<00:03:13.290> this

so<00:03:16.379> that's<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.919> dilemma<00:03:17.159> let<00:03:17.459> me<00:03:17.519> know<00:03:17.639> if<00:03:17.729> you

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
so that's the dilemma let me know if you

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.719 
so that's the dilemma let me know if you
have<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.359> solution<00:03:19.169> other<00:03:19.349> than<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.859> I<00:03:20.129> do

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
have a solution other than that I do

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.439 
have a solution other than that I do
love<00:03:21.120> my<00:03:21.299> machine<00:03:21.829> thank<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:24.090> we<00:03:24.299> have<00:03:24.419> a

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
love my machine thank you and we have a

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.270 
love my machine thank you and we have a
little<00:03:24.690> postscript<00:03:25.290> here<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.650> wanted<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:26.159> to

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
little postscript here I wanted you to

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.000 
little postscript here I wanted you to
see<00:03:26.489> how<00:03:27.329> much<00:03:27.510> coffee<00:03:27.840> I'm<00:03:28.260> going<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.739> put

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
see how much coffee I'm going to put

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.399 
see how much coffee I'm going to put
into<00:03:29.669> the<00:03:29.909> filter<00:03:30.359> holder<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:31.199> the

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
into the filter holder and the

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.129 
into the filter holder and the
approximate<00:03:32.040> coarseness<00:03:32.699> of<00:03:33.389> a<00:03:33.540> coffee

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
approximate coarseness of a coffee

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.929 
approximate coarseness of a coffee
produces<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.739> great<00:03:34.949> espresso<00:03:35.310> shot<00:03:35.669> with<00:03:35.849> this

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
produces a great espresso shot with this

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.849 
produces a great espresso shot with this
coarseness<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.689> that's<00:03:36.870> what<00:03:37.019> I'm<00:03:37.109> using<00:03:37.199> sort

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
coarseness so that's what I'm using sort

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.439 
coarseness so that's what I'm using sort
of<00:03:37.949> in-between<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:39.180> middle-of-the-road

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449

it's set for two cups rather than one

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.559 
it's set for two cups rather than one
cup<00:03:58.439> on<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.680> side<00:03:58.939> we're<00:03:59.939> ready<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.269> brew<00:04:00.419> some

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
cup on the side we're ready to brew some

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.929 
cup on the side we're ready to brew some
coffee<00:04:00.629> so<00:04:01.500> I'm<00:04:01.709> going<00:04:01.979> to<00:04:02.069> press<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.579> little

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
coffee so I'm going to press the little

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:08.830 
coffee so I'm going to press the little
button<00:04:03.090> for<00:04:03.900> two<00:04:04.139> cups<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.560> we'll<00:04:08.220> see

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
button for two cups and we'll see

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.869 
button for two cups and we'll see
probably<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.930> same<00:04:10.139> thing

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.349 

we've<00:04:13.879> got<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.239> good<00:04:14.840> red<00:04:15.409> pill<00:04:15.680> on<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:15.950> left<00:04:16.359> on

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
we've got a good red pill on the left on

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.949 
we've got a good red pill on the left on
the<00:04:17.419> right<00:04:18.549> you<00:04:19.549> got<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:19.759> little<00:04:20.060> weaker<00:04:20.449> rat<00:04:20.690> to

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
the right you got a little weaker rat to

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.850 
the right you got a little weaker rat to
help<00:04:23.889> but<00:04:24.889> if<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.250> results<00:04:25.789> this<00:04:25.970> time<00:04:26.860> this

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
help but if that results this time this

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.689 
help but if that results this time this
is<00:04:28.099> it's<00:04:28.430> never<00:04:28.729> looked<00:04:28.970> quite<00:04:29.389> this<00:04:29.660> good<00:04:30.699> but

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
is it's never looked quite this good but

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.450 
is it's never looked quite this good but
here<00:04:32.060> were<00:04:32.300> petering<00:04:32.810> out<00:04:32.930> on<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.320> right<00:04:33.530> and

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
here were petering out on the right and

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.600 
here were petering out on the right and
on<00:04:35.449> the<00:04:35.479> left<00:04:35.810> we're<00:04:36.050> still<00:04:36.349> going<00:04:36.680> strong<00:04:37.160> so

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
on the left we're still going strong so

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.450 
on the left we're still going strong so
there<00:04:38.120> again<00:04:38.449> it's<00:04:38.690> been<00:04:38.900> replicated<00:04:39.650> the

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
there again it's been replicated the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.890 
there again it's been replicated the
same<00:04:40.729> results<00:04:43.180> unfortunately<00:04:44.180> I'd<00:04:44.419> hoped<00:04:44.660> for

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
same results unfortunately I'd hoped for

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.100 
same results unfortunately I'd hoped for
better<00:04:45.020> results<00:04:45.820> almost<00:04:46.820> done<00:04:47.330> brewing

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
better results almost done brewing

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.850 
better results almost done brewing
espresso<00:04:48.820> in<00:04:49.820> just<00:04:50.180> a<00:04:50.360> second<00:04:50.990> then<00:04:51.349> we'll<00:04:51.650> see

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
espresso in just a second then we'll see

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.879 
espresso in just a second then we'll see
what<00:04:52.039> the<00:04:52.160> disparity<00:04:52.639> of<00:04:52.669> volume<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:54.500> it's

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
what the disparity of volume is and it's

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.970 
what the disparity of volume is and it's
almost<00:04:55.370> done

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.740 

and<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.550> machine<00:05:00.850> will<00:05:01.030> let<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.300> know<00:05:01.330> what

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
and the machine will let you know what

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.820 
and the machine will let you know what
it's<00:05:01.930> doing<00:05:02.170> okay<00:05:03.720> I'm<00:05:04.720> gonna<00:05:04.840> turn<00:05:05.140> this<00:05:05.380> off

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.470 

normally<00:05:08.830> I'd<00:05:08.950> let<00:05:09.070> it<00:05:09.250> drip<00:05:10.000> just<00:05:10.210> a<00:05:10.270> little

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
normally I'd let it drip just a little

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.510 
normally I'd let it drip just a little
longer<00:05:10.690> but<00:05:11.440> for<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.800> purposes<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.280> this

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
longer but for the purposes of this

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.560 
longer but for the purposes of this
experiment<00:05:13.230> and<00:05:14.230> will<00:05:14.380> now<00:05:14.500> show<00:05:14.800> you<00:05:15.570> the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
experiment and will now show you the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
experiment and will now show you the
differences<00:05:17.140> in<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.770> volume<00:05:19.020> see<00:05:20.020> if<00:05:20.140> I<00:05:20.320> can

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
differences in the volume see if I can

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.380 
differences in the volume see if I can
put<00:05:20.860> this<00:05:20.980> at<00:05:21.220> an<00:05:21.310> angle<00:05:21.670> and<00:05:21.940> you<00:05:22.000> can<00:05:22.210> see

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
put this at an angle and you can see

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.950 
put this at an angle and you can see
there<00:05:22.600> again<00:05:22.770> more<00:05:23.770> volume<00:05:24.160> on<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.370> left<00:05:24.960> less

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
there again more volume on the left less

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.080 
there again more volume on the left less
volume<00:05:26.380> on<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.620> right<00:05:26.830> feel<00:05:27.580> sorry<00:05:27.850> for<00:05:27.910> the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
volume on the right feel sorry for the

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.680 
volume on the right feel sorry for the
person<00:05:28.420> getting<00:05:28.570> the<00:05:28.690> one<00:05:28.840> on<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:29.020> right<00:05:30.690> left

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690
