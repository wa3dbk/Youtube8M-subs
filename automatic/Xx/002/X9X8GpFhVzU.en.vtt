00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:44.139
 it’s as if life has come off the stage with 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.479
 big with a theater with musicals here and in 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:51.100
 what musicals were still involved 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.180
 big period when after this musical 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.590
 did not participate 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.669
 then I worked as a cliff for musical pau 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.050
 performers 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:05.250
 choreography also traveled with 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.530
 they participated in various projects 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.080

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.650
 youth slang tell me to 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.080
 frame were 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.919
 intrigue rivalry or were you united 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:28.539
 the team in the first place we were united 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:33.130
 a team of a family so he said at first 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:37.300
 generally straight but I do not know native people, yes 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:41.080
 and now just in the project itself 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.880
 when we began to understand that in reality 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.700
 we were together and wanted to stay 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.710
 together and it seemed to us that but will not 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.520
 so much so that someone will leave that is even 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.680
 can't imagine 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.889
 he thinks that this project will be 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.680
 live live live and then when in real life 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.919
 how did you get the toy removed 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.800
 you cry and here and there and at the same 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:05.860
 but there were children together and here is one 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.729
 this kind of time and you understand that as 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.570
 he was our whole and he also went to 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.699
 victory he also having made that move came on 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.310
 the project lived 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:21.250
 this thought that he will reach the final and 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.259
 will be the winner and we all understand that 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.789
 he is now here and you everywhere 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:31.000
 such a shock failure and no one could from this 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:33.250
 just disengage and all worried 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.130
 for him as well as himself 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:41.590
 and for all it hurt me there we are 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.349
 set the first time seen only 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.620
 tears and girls and boys cried because 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:49.840
 that was hard because for us on 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.199
 that time it was this real life 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.880
 here is a cruel not cruel but such here 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:58.810
 the life we ​​were aiming for 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.909
 dream and then this dream is interrupted 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.729
 any end of life you see it 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:05.740
 watch you understand that everything 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.710
 you just start to understand that if 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.020
 a week later exactly the same person in 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.659
 where do you live or is there communicating 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.190
 You see, you just leave the project 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:19.630
 will even follow with you a little bit like 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:24.030
 people changed thinking just 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:27.270
 became more like this a little bit already 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:31.570
 lucidly began to realize that 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:35.740
 do not function because you need 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:38.500
 their power to give the question should 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.389
 need to dial in the right direction because 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.400
 and so little time to prepare on 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:44.650
 panamera on which, in principle, depends 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.860
 stay how do you handle this 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.860
 task 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.000
 that is, people already just start the water 

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:56.080
 already to visible borders and to 20 slept 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.539
 time before they go go these these well 

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.819
 number of people will stay there 

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:04.270
 definite but everyone wanted to reach 

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:04.270
 finals
