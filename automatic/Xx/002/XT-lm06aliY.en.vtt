00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670 

one<00:00:00.690> of<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:00.870> things<00:00:01.020> that<00:00:01.260> I<00:00:01.290> think<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.650> a

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
one of the things that I think is a

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.220 
one of the things that I think is a
hallmark<00:00:02.010> of<00:00:02.520> this<00:00:02.820> hundred<00:00:03.240> days<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.689> as

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
hallmark of this hundred days is as

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.120 
hallmark of this hundred days is as
clear<00:00:04.710> that<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.250> administration<00:00:06.150> has

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.130 
clear that the administration has

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.759 
clear that the administration has
favored<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.250> model<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:09.440> comprehensive<00:00:10.440> change

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
favored a model of comprehensive change

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.310 
favored a model of comprehensive change
versus<00:00:11.550> incremental<00:00:12.210> change<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:13.139> they're

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
versus incremental change so they're

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.810 
versus incremental change so they're
trying<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.559> tackle<00:00:13.860> most<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.670> big

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
trying to tackle most of the big

trying to tackle most of the big
problems<00:00:15.059> at<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> same<00:00:15.599> time<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
problems at the same time the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
problems at the same time the

they're<00:00:26.310> taking<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> big<00:00:27.420> issues<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:28.320> the

day the argument is you're better off

day the argument is you're better off
taking<00:00:30.869> them<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.320> all<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.650> once<00:00:31.830> because

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
taking them on all at once because

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.950 
taking them on all at once because
they're<00:00:32.790> interconnected<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.690> hand

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
they're interconnected on the one hand

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.720 
they're interconnected on the one hand
and<00:00:34.170> because<00:00:35.120> politically<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:38.309> won't<00:00:38.550> sort

and because politically you won't sort
of<00:00:38.820> continued<00:00:39.450> piece<00:00:40.110> by<00:00:40.140> piece<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:41.430> alienate

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
of continued piece by piece to alienate

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.380 
of continued piece by piece to alienate
particular<00:00:43.760> constituencies<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:45.210> be

particular constituencies all be

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.139 
particular constituencies all be
alienated<00:00:45.989> at<00:00:46.110> once<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.309> very<00:00:47.399> difficult<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
alienated at once and very difficult to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.209 
alienated at once and very difficult to
get<00:00:48.300> traction<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.379> environment<00:00:49.800> so

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
get traction in that environment so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.250 
get traction in that environment so
again<00:00:50.579> whether<00:00:51.210> incremental<00:00:51.930> versus

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
again whether incremental versus

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.840 
again whether incremental versus
comprehensive<00:00:53.129> works<00:00:54.059> will<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:55.070> we<00:00:56.070> will<00:00:56.670> see

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
comprehensive works will be we will see

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.549 
comprehensive works will be we will see
in<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.000> wash<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.770> think<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.949> he's<00:00:59.190> been<00:00:59.430> good

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
in the wash I think that he's been good

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
in the wash I think that he's been good
you<00:01:01.559> might<00:01:01.770> even<00:01:01.829> give<00:01:02.280> him<00:01:02.370> an<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.699> minus<00:01:03.030> but

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
you might even give him an a minus but

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.929 
you might even give him an a minus but
there's<00:01:03.930> been<00:01:04.110> some<00:01:04.379> missteps<00:01:04.890> there's<00:01:05.729> been

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
there's been some missteps there's been

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.539 
there's been some missteps there's been
a<00:01:06.000> bit<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.299> backtracking<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:07.799> things<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
a bit of backtracking on some things I

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.750 
a bit of backtracking on some things I
for<00:01:09.330> example<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> torture<00:01:10.770> issue<00:01:10.950> there's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
for example on the torture issue there's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.550 
for example on the torture issue there's
been<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> kind<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.510> lot<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.869> ambivalence

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
been a kind of a lot of ambivalence

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.399 
been a kind of a lot of ambivalence
there<00:01:13.970> he<00:01:14.970> wasn't<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> release<00:01:15.869> he<00:01:16.229> was

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
there he wasn't going to release he was

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.380 
there he wasn't going to release he was
going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> release<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.400> wasn't<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.939> he

going to release he wasn't going to he

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.030 
going to release he wasn't going to he
said<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> case<00:01:19.140> we've<00:01:19.380> been<00:01:19.530> pushed<00:01:19.830> by

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
said this is a case we've been pushed by

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.160 
said this is a case we've been pushed by
the<00:01:20.670> Democrats<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.330> Congress<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.110> after

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
the Democrats in Congress to go after

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.300 
the Democrats in Congress to go after
former<00:01:25.170> Republican<00:01:25.710> officials<00:01:25.830> were

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
former Republican officials were

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.539 
former Republican officials were
involved<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.630> Guantanamo<00:01:27.840> Bay<00:01:28.549> he's

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
involved with with Guantanamo Bay he's

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.160 
involved with with Guantanamo Bay he's
been<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.570> waffle<00:01:31.200> e<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:33.079> some<00:01:34.079> of

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
been a little waffle e on that some of

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.560 
been a little waffle e on that some of
the<00:01:34.229> early<00:01:34.500> appointments<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.310> attempts<00:01:36.090> at

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the early appointments or attempts at

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.810 
the early appointments or attempts at
appointing<00:01:37.079> folks<00:01:37.290> were<00:01:37.829> missteps<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.549> think

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
appointing folks were missteps you think

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.140 
appointing folks were missteps you think
he<00:01:38.939> probably<00:01:39.180> should<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.930> handled<00:01:40.770> better

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
he probably should have handled better

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.740 
he probably should have handled better
most<00:01:42.150> recently<00:01:42.689> receiving<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:44.790> gift<00:01:45.450> from

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
most recently receiving the gift from

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.359 
most recently receiving the gift from
Chavez<00:01:46.820> was<00:01:47.820> probably<00:01:48.450> not<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> wisest<00:01:49.740> move

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
Chavez was probably not the wisest move

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.420 
Chavez was probably not the wisest move
I<00:01:50.759> mean<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.000> was<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.149> tough<00:01:51.420> spot<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:52.110> still<00:01:53.100> was

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
I mean it was a tough spot but still was

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.639 
I mean it was a tough spot but still was
I<00:01:53.670> think<00:01:53.909> would<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.119> considered<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.720> misstep<00:01:55.290> of

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
I think would be considered a misstep of

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.630 
I think would be considered a misstep of
sorts<00:01:56.450> so<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.659> not<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.350> not<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.189> slam<00:01:59.579> dunk

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
sorts so it's not a it's not a slam dunk

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.300 
sorts so it's not a it's not a slam dunk
but<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:01.110> pretty<00:02:01.409> good<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.500> B<00:02:04.500> plus<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.070> minus

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
but it's pretty good so B plus a minus

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.069 
but it's pretty good so B plus a minus
if<00:02:05.640> he<00:02:05.729> had<00:02:05.880> good<00:02:06.060> attendance<00:02:06.600> I'd<00:02:06.750> give<00:02:06.960> him

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
if he had good attendance I'd give him

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.499 
if he had good attendance I'd give him
an<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.290> minus<00:02:07.580> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> had<00:02:08.789> only<00:02:08.910> come<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.270> class

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
an a minus if you had only come to class

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.940 
an a minus if you had only come to class
a<00:02:09.539> little<00:02:09.929> bit<00:02:10.080> he<00:02:10.170> gets<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.470> b-plus

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950
