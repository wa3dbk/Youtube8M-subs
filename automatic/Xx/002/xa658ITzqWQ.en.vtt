00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.330 
done laser tag and stuff like that and
it's<00:01:18.569> pretty<00:01:18.810> expensive<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.800> think<00:01:20.220> this

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it's pretty expensive and I think this

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.950 
it's pretty expensive and I think this
is<00:01:20.460> compo<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:21.240> probably<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.569> little

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
is compo it's actually probably a little

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.779 
is compo it's actually probably a little
more<00:01:22.229> affordable<00:01:22.440> he<00:01:23.220> didn't<00:01:23.429> want<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> get

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
more affordable he didn't want to get

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:25.969 
more affordable he didn't want to get
out<00:01:23.909> he<00:01:24.450> wanted<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> stay<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.619> think<00:01:25.860> he

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
out he wanted to stay and I think he

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.139 
out he wanted to stay and I think he
even<00:01:26.159> asked<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.460> people<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.850> threw<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
even asked the people that threw the

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.999 
even asked the people that threw the
party<00:01:27.299> if<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.659> can't<00:01:27.899> have<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> couple<00:01:28.860> more
