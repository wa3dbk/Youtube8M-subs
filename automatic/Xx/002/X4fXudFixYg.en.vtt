00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 so hello everyone today for the second issue 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.340
 about motorcycles and paid attention 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.830
 a little Chinese candle release will also be 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.210
 about chinese motorcycles 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:20.850
 this is chinese enduro dr 200 200 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:27.230
 cubic centimeters their volume price 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:30.779
 Well, someone as varies from 50 for example 7 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.480
 dollars can be taken for 67 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.780
 well in short here and so somewhere up to 50 mm to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.879
 67 thousand depending on the terrain 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.300
 motorcycle 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:47.850
 order for a real en fool 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.649
 that is, who does not know enduro is like 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.920
 motocross bike 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.170
 go on the road 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.840
 it's an engine on it which 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.850
 set has 14 horsepower and 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.439
 volume as i said 200 buy to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.380
 centimeters this old honda engines 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:12.049
 very old engines now put them 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.610
 on chinese also japanese carburetor 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:21.299
 Well, this is a weak weak engine 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.369
 but a hundred no longer rides along the road but he 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.119
 and not for this did he take two to 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.150
 ride through the woods go around obstacles 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.090
 bounce around and get from this 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.829
 pleasure for this is theirs 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.460
 motorcycle crosses spike wheels us 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:47.000
 big tread that gives them 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.229
 stability and traction and terrain 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.229
 of course I would like more horses 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.110
 little but basically for such a rider 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.420
 who drives it once a week is not right 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.149
 less often we seem to be quite enough 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.979
 go for a ride 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.630
 how do you see the look up enough 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.700
 acceptable i would say very even 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.979
 beautiful completely all these plastic 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.599
 for braids 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.860
 we are reminded of expensive sports 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.330
 motorcycles 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.550
 by the way this athlete 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.780
 motorcycle it also counts as 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.150
 sport equipment 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.960
 and despite the fact that he has a big 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.610
 batur is enough up for a motorcycle on 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.340
 he does not need rights that is yes is not needed 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.380
 insurance you just fucking must have 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.440
 you and yourself have a sales contract 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.530
 or here are the passports you bought 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.440
 for example, and nothing more for this 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.160
 no need but for the road as it were for 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.960
 communities 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.250
 on public roads you are not 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.860
 you have the right to leave 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.550
 that is, if you get caught trash it 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.840
 shustrov 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.080
 that is, you can only drive on 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.670
 country roads and woods in the sands and 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:02.420
 so on he has only one shock absorber 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.190
 and in principle as if it were enough but 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.430
 the suspension gets too soft yes on 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.070
 ride it comfortably just ride Noi 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.340
 so no longer bounces well, not correct 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.990
 shorter to straight fucked up 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.340
 dangerous it just might throw you up and 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.100
 pull away from the bike but that's basically 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.150
 and not a motocross bike on which 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:31.610
 jump also front fork too 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.730
 soft again it interferes 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.440
 bounce high enough height and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.550
 I would like a little harder that is 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.810
 the suspension would be a little harder 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:52.850
 all that should be noted is that on these 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:55.250
 motorcycles all the brakes and then the disc up 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.150
 heaps and hydraulic that pepper that 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.340
 tomorrow is again a good plus because 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.560
 that brakes are not always needed are always important 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.450
 and but it's nice when fully brakes 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.350
 all drive you are just like the old ones 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.780
 motocross bikes and modern 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.299
 cross on expensive mean up 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.310
 present they have an adjustment chain goes 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:25.250
 here is such that there is such a snail chain 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.370
 You say you need it to pull you 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.260
 unscrew the stock turn this 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.410
 snail and you have wheels starting to move 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.680
 convenient enough adjustment but 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.800
 often have to change these snails but 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.770
 there is still something like a chain 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.169
 you stretched you can not buy 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.540
 it is on this bike site you can 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.340
 buy a chain in Minsk which will come to you 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.130
 two times cheaper at least two 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.900
 times and put and here it fits 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.150
 what are the cons of this bike there 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.690
 this is something that is made all of r cooked 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.550
 metal like fucking on old tvs 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:14.360
 then fagot when broke old 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:16.250
 TVs have a body inside it 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.700
 Metal is what we so 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.080
 chemical spraying on this metal goes 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.830
 this metal color says it's Sarah 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.860
 chaff full well here is some 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.750
 iridescent green fucking 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.270
 red-blue dick understand what it is 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.000
 This is stupid Mitino cheese fucking and long this 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.900
 you won't hold back either 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.540
 the asterisk is also made of fragrant and and 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:46.639
 so you have to change and enough 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.659
 often 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:54.639
 all controls are located so 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:58.189
 as necessary interesting dashboard 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.590
 well, such a pretty tachometer 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:05.090
 there is a speedometer in miles and in 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:08.120
 kilometers what else is needed for happiness and 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.719
 all quite aesthetic well 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.180
 it looks beautiful you can buy 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:17.389
 or motorcycle will not fail in principle 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.810
 will carry ass but one more such 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:22.370
 the moment is that there is only one color 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.719
 mode, that is, did not give a proximal here 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.669
 the average mode that is it cannot 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:28.639
 switch but it can be fixed 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.409
 yourself and the factory do not turn 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.740
 can buy buy turn signals and 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:36.009
 put them yourself well that's all 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.539
 what can you tell why the chinese 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:43.159
 so if you decide you can buy 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:46.310
 good bike cheap for your 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:49.089
 money get a lot so on this 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.089
 bye
