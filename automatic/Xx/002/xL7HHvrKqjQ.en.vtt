00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
 and with that we have our server configured 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.150
 http 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.999
 Now we are going to configure our server 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.579
 stp 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:11.490
 this 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.839
 a customer minutes 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.369
 of server types 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.070
 called fedor 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.070
 we will explore and all our server 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 windows but in itself a nonsense 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.849
 and this eleven configure our stp site 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.849
 for this we put applications 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.700
 also tc terminal system 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.370
 in this terminal we had it 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.340
 administrator just where using the command sun 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.410
 we are not the password 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.400
 now we are a returned administrator 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.870
 corrupt 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.360
 we use is who they eat bric feel chivo 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.240
 after we have installed our ftp server in fedora 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.220
 we modify extension 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880
 that file contains several girls 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.860
 commented 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.400
 with a yes no it was not him to the left end of the line 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.470
 pinel in fact when we open it for the first time we will find it 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.500
 with several lines 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 as follows 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.890
 these instructions we have to remove them x5 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.320
 good is not art 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.210
 how could we account for the file when we opened 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.910
 previously 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.340
 until all the kids that in 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 as follows 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.270
 we can confront it 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.900
 with this video 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.320
 to make sure that our file that in the same way 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.130
 so that the settings that are being applied work 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:22.930
 Conquer role 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.159
 all crazy comments for all the lines 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.159
 we can configure 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.589
 validly our server 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.599
 stp 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.729
 rock that can be accessed from this to an ftp client 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.859
 from any 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.809
 user 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:48.569
 or any client connected to the same network then let's make the changes 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.669
 we close the editor 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.819
 we can miss the console 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.679
 and we go to a client 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.249
 in this client 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.220
 we open a client 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.529
 stp to make the connection between our computer 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.319
 in this case an indec machine 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.679
 all with xp 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.679
 gino your server fedor 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.720
 what we have 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.589
 ap share this is the personal folder 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:24.289
 of our servants fedor which pantin in all these aspects besides 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.289
 of that goat inside perpetrated commented 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:31.089
 we locate some use in our clients 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.329
 we introduce in remove 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.079
 from our server 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.099
 being hour 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.479
 our user in ferrol 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.549
 your password 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.539
 and exported 22 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.900
 private for connections 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.859
 with the port 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.139
 the ttp 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.139
 we check a quick connection 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:58.339
 we see that it has been validated correctly 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.699
 we select a location where we want to save 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.259
 - the goats 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.579
 what we take 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.509
 from the server 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.459
 for example the folders documents 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.919
 in this virtual machine etc with xp 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.919
 the jump folder 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.109
 a cart tocumen your 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.990
 contains the files 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.990
 that we were field match of this our ftp site 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.689
 we give you right click 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:31.289
 and download 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.220
 so we can see how in this part 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.620
 the news progress bar that is being overly guarded towards our 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.800
 calculation 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.939
 the our folder 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:44.309
 tocumen tos 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:48.729
 we go south and pressure nor indeed the file has been copied 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.449
 three of our 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.550
 server that ftp 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.550
 we turn to our customers minutes 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.090
 in which 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.090
 similarly we see an ftp client 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.259
 in this case the buffalo oak theme 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.550
 with this server ducÃ³ fumes to perform the same action we wanted to make a 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.659
 moment 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.659
 never and well crime I tried xp 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.319
 using exactly the same program 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.099
 only you a support 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.180
 the food 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.610
 and prov 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.610
 we think or fast connection 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.229
 we select 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.879
 directory 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:37.249
 crawford 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.360
 the files that we are going to download three of our ftp servers 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.529
 in as much frank 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.529
 in touched them 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.069
 we download name on p3 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:56.120
 we look that is connecting 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.219
 transferring at this time 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:00.729
 is over 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.629
 we go to places 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:03.939
 documents 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:07.039
 and we find that this file west 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.479
 on the rise ubuntu foot move 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.099
 documents 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.909
 and here we have 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:15.409
 those eight euros 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.659
 that have been downloaded 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.659
 from our server 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.919
 through deceased 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.289
 downloaded correctly 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.919
 let's go to this 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.289
 and we eliminate back 7 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.289
 let's go to our sense fountains-stack 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.900
 download again 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.879
 we prove that the file has been 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.259
 from our server stp 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:03.119
 obstructive asean asean induce this way 

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:04.730
 born 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.950
 checked the configuration of a server http iun stp
