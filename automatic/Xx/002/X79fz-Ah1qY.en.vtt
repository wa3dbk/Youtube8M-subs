00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.380
 There are few bathed in chocolate muffins 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.720
 with chocolate nuggets also the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.140
 today's video promises but I do not 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.390
 wait longer and cook has been said 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.120
 for this recipe we will need a 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.790
 little salt sugar flour 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.129
 black chocolate pastry for desserts 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.860
 chocolate nuggets an envelope of 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.060
 Yeast 4 eggs and olive oil 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.130
 soft 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.660
 we now proceed to make our base 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.430
 for the machines we first mix 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.140
 four small eggs at temperature 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.970
 environment with 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.320
 for at least six minutes 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.330
 I do not have but an electric blender 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.510
 help us in this step a lot 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.390
 so I do the same with a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.909
 how 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.830
 we now add 200 grams of oil 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.520
 olive smooth and we keep mixing a couple 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.520
 of minutes 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.590
 then we incorporate 220 grams 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.910
 of flour sieved little by little and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.530
 we mix again 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.300
 we put a little salt the envelope of 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.300
 yeast and we finish mixing 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.860
 this is how the base would have to be 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.050
 we add chocolate nuggets to taste 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.870
 I knotted him like that 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.320
 because I love them and we integrate them well 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.440
 in the mass 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.750
 and 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.060
 this time I'm going to use my ring to 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.160
 make cake pops the red light indicates that 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.350
 the machine is taking temperature and the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.800
 green light that is already the ideal for 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.810
 Cook 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.810
 fill the gaps with the dough 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.220
 or not 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.220
 and let it do for 15 minutes 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.800
 After this time we open the stove and 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.269
 we found that the cake pops are 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.849
 made inside with the method 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.319
 traditional we put a toothpick and if it comes out 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.319
 clean is that they are at their point 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.170
 we take them out with the same toothpick so as not to 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.940
 scratch the non-stick surface and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.550
 we let it cool 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.410
 meanwhile we split the chocolate and 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.690
 we melt it in the microwave until 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.850
 Acquire a liquid consistency with a 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.800
 minute and a half will be enough we catch 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.570
 the own sticks of which there are pops 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.340
 'we wet them a little in chocolate 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.920
 we puncture the base of the balls 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.510
 sponge cake and let cool this what 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.950
 we do so that the cake pops do not 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.920
 fall from the stick when bathing 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.690
 later in the hot chocolate 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.520
 by the way it is preferable that you use 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.190
 pretty choco because if you stay 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.080
 short as it happened to me I will not be able to bathe it 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.790
 well I had to help myself from a 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.860
 spoon 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.720
 Anyway you must remove excess 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.700
 chocolate turning the cake pop until 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.890
 cool a bit but not too much 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.630
 because sprinkle some caramelitos 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.840
 colors above and should stay 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.400
 stuck 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.590
 to 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.120
 and then we're going to nail them into a cork 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.079
 and we would have our cake pops 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.079
 preparations 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.370
 ah 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.709
 this mass serves us equally for 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.629
 prepare muffins I turn to my other 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.549
 stove and they come out perfect 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.530
 quick and simple but let's say the 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.590
 you can make in the traditional oven without 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.489
 a problem of the pint of this I do not have 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.060
 that explain anything true and it's up to me 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.450
 I want to take a little piece and you 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.450
 I take it to 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.170
 Well, with this we already have the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.420
 snack list a rich option and about 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.490
 everything very colorful to make it at a party 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.900
 or children's birthday or for 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.670
 older also than us too 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.900
 we love these things especially to 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.400
 the girls who do 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.010
 finally I say goodbye until the next 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.750
 video I hope you liked this one if 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.670
 it is like this to give the little finger up and 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.680
 share it on your social networks 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.660
 but of course I can not leave 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.580
 without mentioning the version of the potatoes 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.560
 baked with paprika that has made a 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.390
 Medical speech in our homely chef 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.799
