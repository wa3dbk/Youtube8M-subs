00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 at the end of june up to nothing network 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:20.400
 well what everyone knows is raiden 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.320
 I hope you'll listen to me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.610
 it's great today people get 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.560
 find for a new video on 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.720
 black ops 2 we are in domination 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.350
 hardcore if this one on the map is 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.259
 Jaked 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.790
 so it's a small nuclear or svs 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.380
 the sniper which is in semi automatic 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.410
 you will find out that this is the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.050
 kind of gameplay that has already been realized 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.570
 in the way of gameplay and especially by 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.670
 an edge to the map also to be like that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.559
 there was a lot of end gameplay not bad 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.449
 nuclear sbe on id jaked 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.000
 it's a good maps we'll say for the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.190
 sniper why because a place that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.300
 is still not bad and we will say 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.309
 that there are many nuclear that have been 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.269
 done here 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.679
 I remember for example the 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.780
 nuclear that fangs that had done in 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.800
 live 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.060
 good I did the same thing what I 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.760
 did not do live and we were in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.010
 group contracts are times in a group 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.270
 it adds some difficulties by 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.610
 report to people who enter the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.690
 spawn etc and especially with respect to 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.729
 ages is leaving because it's still 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.740
 not badly engaged to make series 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.110
 stitched of the reich that you have well it is 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.340
 we're not going to debate it 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.689
 simply wanted to thank the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.280
 people who are not on my videos 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.750
 who volunteered and presented for 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.759
 become a commentator or support players 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.560
 of the dhr it is necessary to know that there is no 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.540
 bad of commentators who at the moment 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.820
 are in standby at the level of 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.860
 recruitment because here they are 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.090
 presented their videos I asked 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.890
 opinions regarding the members of the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.600
 dream and they gave their opinion which 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.750
 for some it is there for 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.939
 others it's not too much his way 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.329
 people will have the answers soon 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.539
 and here I want to do a little 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.740
 precision one in my last video I 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:04.439
 maybe we were going to say badly finally I 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.550
 not been precise some you thought 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.900
 that for precisely 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.670
 the support players it's for everything from 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.110
 suite no unfortunately this is not 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.070
 for now and fos had something 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.860
 it's not that it will not be 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.210
 necessarily for me me I thought 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.590
 that just knowing that I want to 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.900
 involve support players in 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.460
 make good little gameplay 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.720
 if they have anything to capture that it's up to 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.360
 or to be captured the gameplay 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.130
 face of friends etc 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.150
 I told myself when you're in 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.890
 the second there are quite a few who 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.560
 would like to make big gameplay for 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.260
 their chains he would like to stand out 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.270
 like that in any case me for my part 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.170
 it's a bit the same in passing 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.820
 find just to say I did 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.220
 just two that he loved did you 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.630
 do not worry I had a lot of luck 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.430
 there really that the guy who saw me 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.390
 short end balls 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.880
 so yes I said there are a lot of 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.990
 to appear in the dream that I think 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.830
 would like to have some sport for some 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.630
 gameplay certainly a record that is can 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.690
 to be still achievable good no matter 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.830
 which that's for sure so I kept 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.860
 just to tell you that it's not for 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.880
 right now and we'll say that 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.980
 frankly knowing that you've been 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.440
 a lot more to offer you 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.240
 as a support player it will be enough 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.980
 special at the level of recruitment we are going 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.840
 not tomorrow we will not ask you for 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.680
 stuff of whew but just a 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.630
 brief presentation of you I will not judge 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.489
 not on the stats and that's all it will be 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.260
 no need to comment on 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.310
 this video 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.709
 because as I say it's not for 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.760
 right away so we basically put it there 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.610
 will not have any criteria 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.500
 if possible just play on skype 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.880
 with a good microphone and not necessarily on 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.340
 the tel because the phone is not 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.720
 bad background noise and it's a good 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.160
 knowledge of spawn a good 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.989
 experience on the game and stuff like 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
 that because you have to know that for 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.500
 we're asking for that it's mostly 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.290
 that if it is for you that will 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.640
 knowing that you too will realize 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.200
 some gameplay there are some who will play this 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.920
 support for you for example maybe 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.350
 me me me it could be done 1 mm 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.110
 other new luck everything depends on 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.550
 how's it going so that's why 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.080
 there will be certain criteria for the 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.970
 nuclear blow development 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.670
 which was done at the top it looks like 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.230
 osb not so serious france i hope 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.220
 that it did not bother you in everything 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.910
 case for the iem plan is already at the end 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.989
 had in any case me I hope that 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.630
 I enjoyed the video so 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.940
 as I say for the support I 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.230
 please I will warn you I was doing 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.630
 me 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.890
 the little beak of when it will be good when 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.840
 it will be necessary to present to you that it is 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.610
 and then we will advise on all the members 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.890
 of the dream that will come to you so 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.900
 that they will come to help me and that they will 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.990
 will say this is there is interesting 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.740
 and so that's it for the video so me 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.510
 I wish you a good 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.410
 day a good evening do not forget 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.330
 the little one with it's always a pleasure 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:47.630
 I may be telling you people at the 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:47.630
 next fugitives 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.750
 zaouia
