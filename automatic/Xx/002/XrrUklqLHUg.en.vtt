00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
track but them two together this one is

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.160 
track but them two together this one is

like literally taking it across my
natural<00:01:36.479> shape<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:42.030> when<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> comes

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
natural shape and then when it comes

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.840 
natural shape and then when it comes
towards<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> end<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.920> where<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.250> did<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> tip

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
towards the end so where we did the tip

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.450 
towards the end so where we did the tip
I<00:01:45.320> like<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.649> drag<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.640> there<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:49.460> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
I like to just drag it up there so it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
I like to just drag it up there so it
kind<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.939> fills<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.930> then<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:54.890> just

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
kind of fills it in and then I just

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.340 
kind of fills it in and then I just
might<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.340> bit<00:01:56.579> more<00:01:56.759> sharper<00:01:57.350> so

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
might like to a bit more sharper so

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.810 
might like to a bit more sharper so
let's<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.799> again<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> other<00:01:59.460> eye

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
let's do it again on the other eye

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.760 
let's do it again on the other eye
so<00:02:00.180> making<00:02:00.600> sure<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.469> tips<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:02.189> even

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
so making sure that the tips are even

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.350 
so making sure that the tips are even
now<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.130> don't<00:02:05.340> know<00:02:05.490> where<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
now if you don't know where to do the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.729 
now if you don't know where to do the
tip<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:08.670> better<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.660> match<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.590> end

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
tip it's better to match it to the end

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.250 
tip it's better to match it to the end
of<00:02:10.890> your<00:02:11.009> brow

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
of your brow

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.869 
of your brow
match<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:13.040> basically<00:02:13.400> going<00:02:13.519> like

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
match it so it's basically going like

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.520 
match it so it's basically going like
this<00:02:14.090> towards<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.569> end<00:02:14.689> of<00:02:14.810> your<00:02:14.930> brow<00:02:15.140> and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
this towards the end of your brow and
