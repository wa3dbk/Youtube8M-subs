cuz you know Two Steps always better
than<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.040> yeah<00:01:36.030> i<00:01:36.270> don't<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.509> i<00:01:36.540> just

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
than one and yeah i don't know i just

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.330 
than one and yeah i don't know i just
really<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> way<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.860> turning

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
really like the way that this is turning

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.940 
really like the way that this is turning
out<00:01:38.640> thus<00:01:39.360> far<00:01:39.780> um<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:41.340> adding<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.360> some

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
out thus far um and just adding in some

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.810 
out thus far um and just adding in some
decorations<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:44.130> actually<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.579> paint

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
decorations are actually just paint

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.660 
decorations are actually just paint
really<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.630> i<00:01:45.990> think<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.460> much

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
really and i think that is pretty much

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.440 
really and i think that is pretty much
it<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:49.280> stoop<00:01:50.280> with<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> porch<00:01:50.850> then<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
it for the stoop with the porch then I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.700 
it for the stoop with the porch then I
decided<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:52.020> what<00:01:52.110> go<00:01:52.290> ahead<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.619> add

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
decided you know what go ahead and add

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.789 
decided you know what go ahead and add
in<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.310> window<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.240> realize<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.590> window

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
in a window I realize like that window

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.469 
in a window I realize like that window
is<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.340> low<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.119> put<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> up

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
is really really low so I can put it up

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.499 
is really really low so I can put it up
a<00:01:57.570> little<00:01:57.659> bit<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:57.960> um<00:01:59.090> he<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.360> had<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
a little bit more um he and I had to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.899 
a little bit more um he and I had to
move<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> painting<00:02:01.110> because<00:02:01.380> obviously<00:02:01.909> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
move the painting because obviously the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.850 
move the painting because obviously the
window<00:02:03.119> was<00:02:03.240> kind<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.600> way<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:04.020> think<00:02:04.350> at

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
window was kind of in the way I think at

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.590 
window was kind of in the way I think at
some<00:02:05.040> point<00:02:05.100> Jennifer<00:02:05.549> realizes<00:02:05.820> she<00:02:06.360> doesn't

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
some point Jennifer realizes she doesn't

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.930 
some point Jennifer realizes she doesn't
have<00:02:06.689> style<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.710> think<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.550> case<00:02:08.580> I

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
have style I do think this is the case I

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729 
have style I do think this is the case I
think<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.239> do<00:02:09.300> realize<00:02:09.629> at<00:02:09.989> some<00:02:10.020> point<00:02:10.470> that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
think I do realize at some point that

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.890 
think I do realize at some point that
there's<00:02:10.950> nothing<00:02:11.129> that

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
there's nothing that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.960 
there's nothing that
I<00:02:11.959> don't<00:02:12.560> know<00:02:12.650> actually<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.370> adjusting<00:02:13.879> the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
I don't know actually just adjusting the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.679 
I don't know actually just adjusting the
windows<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:14.540> things<00:02:14.959> of<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.379> sort<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.689> just

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
windows and things of that sort and just

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.080
