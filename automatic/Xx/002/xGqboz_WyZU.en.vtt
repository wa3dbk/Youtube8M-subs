00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
to get faster you see what happens here

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.120 
to get faster you see what happens here
you<00:02:23.270> have<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.510> keep<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.780> Rope<00:02:23.959> down<00:02:24.170> low<00:02:24.440> look

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130

four three two one great you want to do
two<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.320> three<00:02:33.500> minutes<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:33.980> this<00:02:34.130> on<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:35.150> off

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
two to three minutes of this on and off

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.280 
two to three minutes of this on and off
perfect<00:02:36.709> form<00:02:36.980> perfect<00:02:37.250> execution<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.989> next

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
perfect form perfect execution the next

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.170 
perfect form perfect execution the next
maneuver<00:02:39.650> up<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:39.950> called<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.280> crossover<00:02:40.910> and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
maneuver up is called the crossover and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.490 
maneuver up is called the crossover and
this<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.510> great<00:02:41.750> because<00:02:41.870> it's<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.200> variation

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
this is great because it's a variation

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.740 
this is great because it's a variation
of<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.950> basic<00:02:43.340> but<00:02:43.760> allows<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.209> tone<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
of the basic but allows you to tone and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.780 
of the basic but allows you to tone and
sculpt<00:02:45.410> your<00:02:45.500> upper<00:02:45.769> body<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.130> little<00:02:46.340> bit<00:02:46.459> more

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
sculpt your upper body a little bit more

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.300 
sculpt your upper body a little bit more
so<00:02:47.450> we'll<00:02:47.600> start<00:02:47.690> off<00:02:47.870> with<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.140> basic<00:02:48.560> and

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
so we'll start off with the basic and

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.009 
so we'll start off with the basic and
then<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.550> start<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.850> cross<00:02:50.209> your<00:02:50.480> hands<00:02:50.750> in

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
then you start to cross your hands in

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.930 
then you start to cross your hands in
front<00:02:51.050> of<00:02:51.350> your<00:02:51.500> body<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.459> hand<00:02:52.700> stay

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
front of your body and the hand stay

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.000 
front of your body and the hand stay
lower<00:02:53.239> than<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.569> waist<00:02:53.810> they<00:02:54.290> get<00:02:54.500> wider<00:02:54.769> than

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
lower than the waist they get wider than

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.770 
lower than the waist they get wider than
the<00:02:55.130> body<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.580> can<00:02:55.730> see<00:02:55.850> Adriana<00:02:56.239> using<00:02:56.690> that

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
the body you can see Adriana using that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.470 
the body you can see Adriana using that
risk<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.230> click<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.739> Rope<00:02:57.920> wide<00:02:58.190> now<00:02:59.180> takes

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
risk to click the Rope wide now takes

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.180 
risk to click the Rope wide now takes
timing<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.140> takes<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.440> little<00:03:00.560> bit<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.799> patience

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
timing it takes a little bit of patience

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.160 
timing it takes a little bit of patience
the<00:03:01.340> Rope<00:03:01.549> will<00:03:01.730> catch<00:03:01.970> your<00:03:02.209> feet<00:03:02.390> but<00:03:02.989> if<00:03:03.079> you

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
the Rope will catch your feet but if you

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.900 
the Rope will catch your feet but if you
