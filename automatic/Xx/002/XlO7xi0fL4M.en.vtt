very well my skin I first thought that I
got<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:26.920> too<00:02:27.550> dark<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.800> complexion<00:02:29.800> color<00:02:30.160> I

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
got so too dark of a complexion color I

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.430 
got so too dark of a complexion color I
got<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.240> dark<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.600> well<00:02:31.780> which<00:02:31.930> was<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.230> deep

got the dark as well which was the deep

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.620 
got the dark as well which was the deep
and<00:02:32.710> I<00:02:33.010> don't<00:02:33.280> look<00:02:33.460> that<00:02:33.670> dark<00:02:33.970> but<00:02:34.600> it

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
and I don't look that dark but it

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.190 
and I don't look that dark but it
actually<00:02:34.900> um<00:02:36.540> blended<00:02:37.540> very<00:02:37.720> well<00:02:37.900> with<00:02:38.020> my

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
actually um blended very well with my

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.160 
actually um blended very well with my
skin<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.160> um<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:40.000> really<00:02:40.480> really<00:02:40.810> like<00:02:40.990> the
