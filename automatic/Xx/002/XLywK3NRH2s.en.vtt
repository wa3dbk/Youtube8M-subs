will pause this video and show you a
little<00:01:01.680> bit<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.220> process<00:01:02.490> on<00:01:03.030> how<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:04.160> put

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
little bit of the process on how I put

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:26.840 
little bit of the process on how I put
together<00:01:05.370> this<00:01:06.120> bumpkin<00:01:06.630> carriage

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:02:58.370 

you

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.960 

so<00:02:59.380> as<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.680> can<00:02:59.830> see<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.220> was<00:03:00.370> pretty<00:03:00.640> simple

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
so as you can see it was pretty simple

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.890 
so as you can see it was pretty simple
to<00:03:01.210> put<00:03:01.390> together

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
to put together

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.460 
to put together
I<00:03:02.160> decided<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.760> adhere<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.840> with<00:03:05.050> glossy

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
I decided to adhere it with glossy

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.860 
I decided to adhere it with glossy
accents<00:03:06.010> first<00:03:06.280> because<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.150> didn't<00:03:07.570> want<00:03:07.750> it

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
accents first because I didn't want it

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.530 
accents first because I didn't want it
to<00:03:07.900> fall<00:03:08.200> apart<00:03:08.620> while<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.190> was<00:03:09.730> painting<00:03:10.240> the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
to fall apart while I was painting the

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.050 
to fall apart while I was painting the
whole<00:03:10.720> thing<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:11.320> I<00:03:12.100> found<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:13.030> is

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
whole thing and I found that it is

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.700 
whole thing and I found that it is
easier<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:14.490> actually<00:03:15.490> spray<00:03:15.850> paint<00:03:16.210> then<00:03:16.960> use

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
easier to actually spray paint then use

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.570 
easier to actually spray paint then use
gesso<00:03:18.550> this<00:03:19.390> time<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.840> decided<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.710> adhere

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
gesso this time I decided to adhere

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.220 
gesso this time I decided to adhere
everything<00:03:22.060> together<00:03:22.390> first<00:03:22.990> and<00:03:23.380> then

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
everything together first and then

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.110 
everything together first and then
spray-painted<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.590> then<00:03:27.010> decoupage<00:03:27.610> the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
spray-painted it and then decoupage the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.810 
spray-painted it and then decoupage the
this<00:03:28.600> piece<00:03:28.930> right<00:03:29.200> here<00:03:29.500> inside<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.490> I

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
this piece right here inside and I

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.590 
this piece right here inside and I
decoupage<00:03:31.890> this<00:03:32.890> part<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:35.410> bottom<00:03:35.800> part

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
decoupage this part in the bottom part

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.160 
decoupage this part in the bottom part
and<00:03:38.040> then<00:03:39.040> for<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.490> as<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:39.910> saw<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.480> actually

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
and then for this as you saw I actually

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.170 
and then for this as you saw I actually
embossed<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.860> because<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.340> was<00:03:42.520> originally

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
embossed it because I was originally

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.140 
embossed it because I was originally
going<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.600> just<00:03:43.960> use<00:03:44.200> my<00:03:44.430> rub<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.610> buff<00:03:45.790> I'm

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
going to just use my rub and buff I'm

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.690 
going to just use my rub and buff I'm
not<00:03:46.870> sure<00:03:47.050> if<00:03:47.200> it's<00:03:47.680> going<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.010> turn<00:03:48.220> out<00:03:48.280> so

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
not sure if it's going to turn out so

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.840 
not sure if it's going to turn out so
beautifully<00:03:49.420> if<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:50.260> did<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.280> wanted<00:03:51.700> it

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
beautifully if I did that so I wanted it

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.810 
beautifully if I did that so I wanted it
to<00:03:52.030> look<00:03:52.180> all<00:03:52.450> glittery<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.250> can<00:03:54.400> see<00:03:54.640> on

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
to look all glittery so you can see on

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.370 
to look all glittery so you can see on
the<00:03:54.970> light<00:03:55.150> there<00:03:55.450> it's<00:03:55.660> all<00:03:55.780> glittery<00:03:56.170> and

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
the light there it's all glittery and

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.350 
the light there it's all glittery and
shiny<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:57.130> things<00:03:57.340> like<00:03:57.460> that<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:57.940> mean<00:03:58.150> I'm

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
shiny and things like that I mean I'm

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.060 
shiny and things like that I mean I'm
sure<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.840> camera<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.260> not<00:03:59.530> even<00:03:59.890> really

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
sure the camera is not even really

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.520 
sure the camera is not even really
capturing<00:04:00.820> how<00:04:01.030> beautiful<00:04:01.630> this<00:04:01.810> thing<00:04:02.110> is

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
capturing how beautiful this thing is

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.460 
capturing how beautiful this thing is
but<00:04:03.010> it's<00:04:03.250> really<00:04:03.550> beautiful<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:05.200> course

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
but it's really beautiful and of course

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.980 
but it's really beautiful and of course
it's<00:04:05.680> all<00:04:05.800> glittery<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.520> stuff<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.210> I'm<00:04:07.690> just

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
it's all glittery and stuff and I'm just

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.860 
it's all glittery and stuff and I'm just
really<00:04:08.260> happy<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:08.860> way<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:09.040> turned<00:04:09.160> out<00:04:09.580> I

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
really happy the way it turned out I

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.110 
really happy the way it turned out I
opted<00:04:10.870> not<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:11.110> add<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.920> lot<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.310> flowers<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:13.000> it

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
opted not to add a lot of flowers in it

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.030 
opted not to add a lot of flowers in it
I<00:04:13.270> just<00:04:13.390> added<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:14.080> part<00:04:14.410> because<00:04:14.770> that's

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
I just added this part because that's

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.660 
I just added this part because that's
where<00:04:15.430> all<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.600> connections<00:04:17.290> were<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:17.920> if<00:04:18.520> I

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
where all the connections were and if I

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.300 
where all the connections were and if I
didn't<00:04:19.030> put<00:04:19.270> the<00:04:19.420> flowers<00:04:19.900> there<00:04:20.290> then<00:04:20.920> it's

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
didn't put the flowers there then it's

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.120 
didn't put the flowers there then it's
not<00:04:21.520> going<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.820> look<00:04:21.970> as<00:04:22.240> good<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:23.620> that's<00:04:23.950> why

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
not going to look as good so that's why

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.340 
not going to look as good so that's why
I<00:04:24.190> decided<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.820> add<00:04:24.970> these<00:04:25.270> cherry<00:04:25.750> blossom

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.650 
I decided to add these cherry blossom
flowers<00:04:26.830> there<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.370> these<00:04:28.060> are<00:04:28.120> all<00:04:28.420> from

wild<00:04:28.960> orchid<00:04:29.380> crafts<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:30.100> then<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:31.120> added<00:04:31.450> the

like<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.180> because<00:04:46.569> I<00:04:46.750> wanted<00:04:47.349> to<00:04:47.500> highlight

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
like that because I wanted to highlight

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.300 
like that because I wanted to highlight
how<00:04:48.849> beautiful<00:04:49.509> the<00:04:49.690> carriage<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.530> without

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
how beautiful the carriage is without

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.230 
how beautiful the carriage is without
adding<00:04:51.759> too<00:04:52.000> much<00:04:52.270> fluff<00:04:52.750> on<00:04:53.759> the<00:04:54.759> carriage

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
adding too much fluff on the carriage

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.879 
adding too much fluff on the carriage
and<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:56.440> I<00:04:56.470> did<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.889> same<00:04:56.919> thing<00:04:57.340> on<00:04:57.460> this<00:04:57.669> side

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
and so I did the same thing on this side

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.100 
and so I did the same thing on this side
added<00:04:59.889> the<00:04:59.919> lace<00:05:00.250> in<00:05:00.819> the<00:05:01.030> flat<00:05:01.270> back<00:05:01.509> pearls

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
added the lace in the flat back pearls

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.890 
added the lace in the flat back pearls
so<00:05:02.889> this<00:05:03.159> part<00:05:03.490> right<00:05:03.550> here<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.120> not<00:05:04.419> embossed

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
so this part right here is not embossed

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.320 
so this part right here is not embossed
because<00:05:05.229> it<00:05:05.349> was<00:05:05.470> difficult<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:06.039> emboss<00:05:06.460> this

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
because it was difficult to emboss this

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.999 
because it was difficult to emboss this
this<00:05:07.870> part<00:05:08.199> because<00:05:08.530> it's<00:05:08.710> so<00:05:09.599> tiny<00:05:10.740> so<00:05:11.740> what<00:05:11.979> I

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
this part because it's so tiny so what I

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.080 
this part because it's so tiny so what I
did<00:05:12.129> was<00:05:12.460> I<00:05:12.520> actually<00:05:12.789> use<00:05:13.300> my<00:05:13.569> rub<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.020> buff

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
did was I actually use my rub and buff

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.600 
did was I actually use my rub and buff
to<00:05:16.090> put<00:05:16.569> the<00:05:16.719> gold<00:05:16.930> there<00:05:17.620> so<00:05:18.009> I<00:05:18.039> wanted<00:05:18.490> to

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
to put the gold there so I wanted to

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.490 
to put the gold there so I wanted to
cover<00:05:18.849> the<00:05:19.120> white<00:05:19.300> parts<00:05:19.750> of<00:05:19.870> it<00:05:20.050> that's<00:05:20.259> why<00:05:20.469> I

gold rub and buff on the sides of the
wheel<00:05:31.840> here<00:05:32.409> but<00:05:32.860> everything<00:05:33.310> else<00:05:33.490> is<00:05:33.639> pretty

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819
