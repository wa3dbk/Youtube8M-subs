 practically forever 18 kilograms 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.249
 while in the first half lag 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:46.379
 did not look very big dzerzhinsky 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.299
 pilot rarely in snatch fix 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:49.600
 result 89 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.530
 bronze medalist pitalenko george 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.260
 Bardem 8 7 and the leader raised 92 bottles more 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.000
 did not work all the same firms movement in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.540
 the second 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.710
 where more could be done 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.420
 the supply of movement is quite a hundred 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.470
 percent is the best result which 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.460
 showed international 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.330
 competition 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.680
 and as for pushing it most likely 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.790
 here said with 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.009
 what place 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.880
 because during preparation a little bit 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.030
 there was another category most such aware 

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:18.260
 6 kilogram 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.530
 because of this force with will not see 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.270
 but even if she left her personal 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.700
 Ukraine record was issued 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.370
 Ukrainian winner list of the world rope 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.170
 so here is a little bit different 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.010
 level 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.410
 itâ€™s natural that even I lost to her 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.410
 It was necessary and the third world we are also talking about 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.290
 a lot 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.120
 in the second gone and no surprises 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.820
 happened 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.730
 after the first approach it became clear how 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.920
 distributed places on the podium pushed 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.970
 105 kilograms of Olga once again 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.110
 proved his claim to medals 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.510
 walk on me think so come true 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.270
 before your 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.860
 our task is to protect 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.560
 woman house capital is another similar 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.830
 championship 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.840
 among the youth that is the will of them 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.180
 maybe get there to perform 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.030
 so do not 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.040
 better tune and 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.349
 me and silver for gold 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.789
 and of course 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.209
 in case of knocking on the main door 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.909
 for the national team 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.069
 this is the main center 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.319
 for now kids exercise flu 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.799
 flu showers and racks 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.459
 working out the technique to perfection 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.079
 strengthening only the strength but also the spirit we 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.209
 believe in our athletes
