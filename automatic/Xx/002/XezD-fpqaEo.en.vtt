and<00:00:15.719> they<00:00:15.809> called<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.139> thermoball<00:00:16.760> and<00:00:17.760> it

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and they called it thermoball and it

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.580 
and they called it thermoball and it
closely<00:00:18.270> mimics<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> loft<00:00:18.960> properties<00:00:19.380> of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
closely mimics the loft properties of

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
closely mimics the loft properties of
down<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.130> benefit<00:00:20.609> however<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.600> it

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
down the benefit however is that it

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.320 
down the benefit however is that it

doesn't lose its loft properties when it

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.880 
doesn't lose its loft properties when it
gets<00:00:24.480> wet<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.619> cool

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
jacket everything about it looks and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.020 
jacket everything about it looks and
really<00:01:01.320> feels<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.859> part<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.609> jacket

even<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.449> square<00:01:03.750> stitching<00:01:04.170> pattern<00:01:04.530> but

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
even this square stitching pattern but

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
even this square stitching pattern but
there<00:01:05.489> are<00:01:05.610> some<00:01:05.850> major<00:01:06.030> differences<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
there are some major differences that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.109 
there are some major differences that
I'd<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> discuss<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:08.369> starters<00:01:08.760> most

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
I'd like to discuss for starters most

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
I'd like to discuss for starters most
down<00:01:09.420> these<00:01:09.720> days<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.380> least<00:01:10.560> 800<00:01:11.100> fill

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
down these days is at least 800 fill

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.760 
down these days is at least 800 fill
power<00:01:11.310> down<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.630> equivalent<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> 600

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
power down this one is equivalent to 600

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.200 
power down this one is equivalent to 600
fill<00:01:13.920> power<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.790> quite<00:01:15.000> as

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
fill power down so it's not quite as

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.390 
fill power down so it's not quite as
warm<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.140> also<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.560> quite<00:01:16.770> as<00:01:16.979> packable

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
warm and it's also not quite as packable

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
warm and it's also not quite as packable
as<00:01:17.580> some<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> modern<00:01:18.240> down<00:01:18.479> jackets<00:01:18.900> on

in a wet climate this jacket is an

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.030 
in a wet climate this jacket is an
obvious<00:01:23.670> choice<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.380> down<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.710> really

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
obvious choice for you down just really

doesn't work when it gets wet and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
doesn't work when it gets wet and
thermoball<00:01:27.900> will<00:01:28.170> maintain<00:01:28.350> its<00:01:28.710> loft<00:01:28.979> even

if it's not raining those high humidity

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.990 
if it's not raining those high humidity
climates<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.979> really<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.430> suck<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.700> life

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
climates can really just suck the life
