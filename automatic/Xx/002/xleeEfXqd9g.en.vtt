00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.200
 hello everyone is a central goal is a 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.599
 new video in this tutorial we will teach 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.830
 to make a paper butterfly if he has 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.010
 interested the subject 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.220
 stay to see how it is done 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:20.030
 the materials that we will occupy will be a 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:24.580
 sheet of machine a rule a scissors or 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.980
 an exact a pencil or a pen 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.279
 the first thing we're going to do is be a 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.950
 square approximately 15 x 15 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.260
 centimeters since it is the measure that I 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.230
 I recommend they will not be too big 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.090
 not too small your figure remember that 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.730
 you can do it to the extent that 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.250
 like 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.820
 once we finish doing our 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.940
 square let's proceed to cut it myself 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.730
 I cut it with an exact one since you have left 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.470
 more right than with scissors but 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.890
 you can do it with what more 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.890
 like 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.909
 It's time to make our mold and to 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.820
 we're going to bend one of the corners 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.630
 with the other 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.630
 marking the bend 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.480
 and the same thing we will do 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.480
 with the other corner 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.900
 the left 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.900
 two long lines of doubles 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.060
 now let's turn the corner to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.320
 center 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.409
 in this way and we mark the fold what 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.409
 same we do with the other three 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.409
 corners 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.770
 remember to mark the folds very well 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.820
 not to fight 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.030
 with the figure must have been something 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.030
 A) Yes 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.600
 once done our four folds 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.500
 let's turn the figure and let's 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.030
 do the same doubles on the other side 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.030
 from the center to the corner 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.480
 and we mark the fold 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:47.469
 we already have the four folds 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.920
 and these four are going to unfold the 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.920
 fiber 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.460
 and they must have stayed 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.460
 the folds equal to these 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.680
 we can see two folds that are the most 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.640
 prolonged in those we will work 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.880
 let's grab one side and we're going to 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.069
 bend towards the center same as the 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.989
 other 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.989
 and we are going to mark the folds 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.720
 thus 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.299
 well the following folds are the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.170
 more complicated let's see how it 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.439
 do we are going to take two ends and we are going to 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.439
 to stretch 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.319
 in this way 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.060
 and once they are straight we are going to 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.620
 mark 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.849
 the folds 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.270
 the same thing a being from the next side 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:54.660
 we take the two corners 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:58.440
 stretch if you have the lumps left 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.800
 here we simply stretch and mark the 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.800
 double 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:11.480
 in this way we are going to turn our 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.480
 figure and we're going to fold through the center 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.579
 and we mark 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.430
 now let's take one of the corners 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.150
 and we're going to double it through the center 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.290
 this form 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:35.160
 and we mark the same thing we will do in the other 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.160
 corner we take and bend through the center 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.789
 thus 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.350
 now let's make the next fold 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.230
 let's drink 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:53.490
 this corner and we are going to bend 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.849
 so that we stay 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.580
 and a straight line with respect to the 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:03.979
 corner once the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.979
 corner let's do the bending 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.569
 the same thing we will do on the other side 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.729
 we doubled until the corner east 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.990
 well folded and we mark the fold 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.460
 we have almost finished our butterfly 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.680
 let's turn it over 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.680
 and in the center we are going to fold 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:45.260
 and finally we are going to make a fold 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.880
 who are we going to base in this corner 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.520
 to fold 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.780
 let's double 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.840
 when you are 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:01.470
 bent the corner and we mark the edge 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.700
 we will do the same 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.700
 on the other hand 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.460
 thus 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.570
 and we open our 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.570
 butterfly 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.340
 and it will not have stayed that way 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.260
 good friends that has been all for this 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:28.380
 video tutorial I hope you have them 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.380
 served and see you in an upcoming bye
