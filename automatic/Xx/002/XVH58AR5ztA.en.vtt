00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.120
 this is hi to all of you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.340
 make an explanation video for you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.200
 to explain you simply 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.059
 how to ride your rank in zombies 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.039
 so it's not very very hard so for 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.640
 raise your rank in zombies and three 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.330
 factors to take into account so your 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.890
 your death ratio that he bites so for 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.609
 the calculation is wrong do your number of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:34.309
 kills / your death toll which of which 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.649
 must be greater than or equal to 450 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.440
 so that's it if you do not have the ratio 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.540
 enough to say we have to go in part 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.530
 custom to mount your who is 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.890
 have them had level required then he 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.010
 ya your injury ratio have always 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.980
 like you do in between dividing 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.949
 number of whom he speaks the number of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.300
 injuries so he must be the same 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.000
 greater than or equal to approximately 250 and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.840
 other precisions so the accuracy and 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.070
 should be around 20 to 30 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.990
 I managed to get to the point with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.060
 1.15 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.189
 so it's not for it's not the same 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.759
 for everyone but usually 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.110
 it's my pump brush with 30 of 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.259
 precision or more so here I know 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.619
 not very complicated so to check that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:37.140
 was worth in we will see in the list 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:45.510
 of friends so at random joseph so he 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:53.360
 has too the sub 1754 style lo 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:57.450
 so he has 20 he has 65 dead 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.430
 so he has a death ratio of 611 so 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.930
 which is not too bad 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:09.030
 see here we can say that it's a good 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:16.710
 player and he has a wound he has ratio 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:18.410
 of injury 278 good so there must they 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.490
 will go back to this injury 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.540
 that's okay he can not 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.910
 always their climb in part 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.770
 custom 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.930
 so here is bombay you can bouvet 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.760
 but the video if you liked it and you 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.130
 subscribe for more videos 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.770
 here and will put comments that makes 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.540
 always pleasure on this wear well 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.540
 and the new video dopant
