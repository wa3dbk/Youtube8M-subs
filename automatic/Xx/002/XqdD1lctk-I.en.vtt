time right now but I kind of did a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.860

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
their experimenting of their own allows

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.700 
their experimenting of their own allows
me<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.939> do<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.210> same<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:33.079> it<00:01:33.170> fits<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.530> bike

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
me to do the same and it fits the bike

know<00:01:59.659> make<00:01:59.929> make<00:02:00.319> them<00:02:00.409> look<00:02:00.590> like<00:02:00.709> they're

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
know make make them look like they're

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.190 
know make make them look like they're
supposed<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.189> be<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.369> way<00:02:01.810> well<00:02:02.810> let's<00:02:02.959> start

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
supposed to be that way well let's start

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.339 
supposed to be that way well let's start
at<00:02:03.349> the<00:02:03.439> front<00:02:03.709> end<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:05.360> talk<00:02:05.720> about<00:02:05.929> the

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
at the front end and talk about the

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:09.279 
at the front end and talk about the
springer<00:02:06.799> front<00:02:06.829> end<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:08.509> how<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.780> set<00:02:09.110> that

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
springer front end and how you set that

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.979 
springer front end and how you set that
up<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:10.429> front<00:02:10.670> end<00:02:10.849> was<00:02:10.940> actually<00:02:11.360> really

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
up the front end was actually really

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.500 
up the front end was actually really
loosely<00:02:12.590> based<00:02:12.769> off<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.160> an<00:02:13.610> early<00:02:13.880> excelsior

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
loosely based off of an early excelsior

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.580 
loosely based off of an early excelsior
front<00:02:14.780> end<00:02:14.959> just<00:02:15.380> like<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.980> style<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.430> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
front end just like the style of it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.990 
front end just like the style of it
similar<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.799> conventional<00:02:19.400> springer<00:02:19.849> you

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
similar to a conventional springer you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.339 
similar to a conventional springer you
know<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.299> it's<00:02:20.450> got<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:20.630> different<00:02:20.840> look<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.319> it

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
know but it's got a different look to it

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.210 
know but it's got a different look to it
it's<00:02:22.280> it's<00:02:23.290> I've<00:02:24.290> got<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.590> dampener<00:02:25.069> I'm

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
it's it's I've got the dampener I'm

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.670 
it's it's I've got the dampener I'm
using<00:02:25.459> from<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:26.030> it's<00:02:27.019> actually<00:02:27.140> an<00:02:27.410> early

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
using from a it's actually an early

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.069 
using from a it's actually an early
British<00:02:28.099> rear<00:02:28.849> shock<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.420> I'm<00:02:29.569> using<00:02:29.780> for

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
British rear shock that I'm using for

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.160 
British rear shock that I'm using for
the<00:02:30.200> for<00:02:30.620> dampening<00:02:30.950> on<00:02:31.130> it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.070 

well<00:02:34.770> that's<00:02:34.890> that's<00:02:35.340> got<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> very<00:02:35.810> Santa<00:02:36.810> look

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
well that's that's got a very Santa look

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.030 
well that's that's got a very Santa look
to<00:02:37.350> it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
to it

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.370 
to it
it<00:02:38.430> looks<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.000> gas<00:02:39.660> tank<00:02:40.020> might<00:02:40.260> have

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
it looks like the gas tank might have

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.820 
it looks like the gas tank might have
taken<00:02:40.560> days<00:02:41.490> maybe<00:02:42.480> even<00:02:42.630> want<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.470> pull

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
taken days maybe even want to pull

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.420 
taken days maybe even want to pull
together

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
together

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.030 
together
well<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> tanks<00:02:45.209> were<00:02:45.500> they're<00:02:46.500> always<00:02:46.740> kind

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
well the tanks were they're always kind

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040 
well the tanks were they're always kind
of<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.280> trick<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.760> know<00:02:47.880> it's<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.330> it's<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
of a trick you know it's it's it's the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.900 
of a trick you know it's it's it's the
centerpiece<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.890> bike<00:02:50.069> for<00:02:50.310> most<00:02:50.520> people

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
centerpiece of the bike for most people

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.940 
centerpiece of the bike for most people
so<00:02:51.120> they've<00:02:51.720> got<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.959> they've<00:02:52.590> got<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:52.830> come

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
so they've got to they've got to come

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.000 
so they've got to they've got to come
out<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.220> way<00:02:53.340> they<00:02:53.490> need<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.830> would<00:02:55.830> say

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
out the way they need to I would say

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.070 
out the way they need to I would say
sheet<00:02:56.280> metal<00:02:56.580> fabrication<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.420> my<00:02:57.570> weak<00:02:57.750> point

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
sheet metal fabrication is my weak point

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.960 
sheet metal fabrication is my weak point
so<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.440> old<00:02:58.560> square<00:02:58.950> stone<00:02:59.220> tanks<00:02:59.610> do<00:02:59.790> good

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
so the old square stone tanks do good

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.600 
so the old square stone tanks do good
for<00:03:00.239> me<00:03:00.380> well<00:03:01.380> they<00:03:01.470> really<00:03:01.680> pulls<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.459> all

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
for me well they really pulls it all

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.300 
for me well they really pulls it all
together<00:03:02.730> talk<00:03:03.390> about<00:03:03.660> your<00:03:03.810> drive<00:03:04.050> line<00:03:04.310> the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
together talk about your drive line the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.150 
together talk about your drive line the
drivetrain<00:03:05.819> is<00:03:06.000> actually<00:03:06.770> odds<00:03:07.770> little

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
drivetrain is actually odds little

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.670 
drivetrain is actually odds little
trickier<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.600> 76<00:03:10.170> Ironhead

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
trickier it's a it's a 76 Ironhead

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.280 
trickier it's a it's a 76 Ironhead
Sportster<00:03:11.459> engine<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> started<00:03:12.510> with<00:03:12.690> I'm

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
Sportster engine that I started with I'm

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.100 
Sportster engine that I started with I'm
using<00:03:13.470> two<00:03:13.769> rear<00:03:13.980> heads<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:15.000> ones<00:03:15.150> turned<00:03:15.600> 180

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
using two rear heads the ones turned 180

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.160 
using two rear heads the ones turned 180
degrees<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.769> on<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.190> front<00:03:17.459> side<00:03:17.640> there

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
degrees and on the front side there

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.100 
degrees and on the front side there
which<00:03:19.170> allowed<00:03:19.500> me<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.570> dual<00:03:21.750> intake

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
which allowed me for the the dual intake

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.240 
which allowed me for the the dual intake
carburetors<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:23.040> then<00:03:23.310> an<00:03:23.700> opposing<00:03:24.269> exhaust

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
carburetors and then an opposing exhaust

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.190 
carburetors and then an opposing exhaust
my<00:03:26.250> back<00:03:26.489> half<00:03:26.730> did<00:03:27.000> it's<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.239> 54<00:03:27.750> BSA

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
my back half did it's a 54 BSA

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.640 
my back half did it's a 54 BSA
transmission<00:03:28.860> behind<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.450> it's<00:03:30.450> using<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.870> 73

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
transmission behind it it's using a 73

triumph<00:03:32.160> clutch<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.850> cut<00:03:33.120> up<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.330> little

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
triumph clutch that I cut up a little

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.449 
triumph clutch that I cut up a little
bit

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.990 

really<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.239> was<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:39.019> open<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.860> open<00:03:40.000> rockers

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
really it was the open the open rockers

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.069 
really it was the open the open rockers
and<00:03:41.150> whatnot<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:42.829> idea<00:03:43.159> came<00:03:43.400> from<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.840> early

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
and whatnot the idea came from the early

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.350 
and whatnot the idea came from the early
knuckles<00:03:45.439> and<00:03:45.590> whatnot<00:03:45.920> when<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.209> leave<00:03:47.209> the

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
knuckles and whatnot when you leave the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.940 
knuckles and whatnot when you leave the
dust<00:03:47.540> covers<00:03:47.930> off<00:03:48.110> and<00:03:48.140> get<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.829> see

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
dust covers off and get to see

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.289 
dust covers off and get to see
everything<00:03:49.310> work<00:03:49.549> so<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.819> tried<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.120> come<00:03:50.269> up

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
everything work so I tried to come up

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.789 
everything work so I tried to come up
with<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.569> better<00:03:50.750> idea<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.620> we're<00:03:51.769> not

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
with a better idea so that we're not

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.240 
with a better idea so that we're not
slinging<00:03:52.250> oil<00:03:52.519> in<00:03:52.700> grease<00:03:52.909> and<00:03:52.939> dirt<00:03:53.510> in<00:03:53.720> there

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
slinging oil in grease and dirt in there

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.770 
slinging oil in grease and dirt in there
so<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.280> basically<00:03:55.700> sealed<00:03:55.939> everything<00:03:56.390> up<00:03:56.599> and

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
so I basically sealed everything up and

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.539 
so I basically sealed everything up and

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
I'm injecting all just where it needs to

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.490 
I'm injecting all just where it needs to
be<00:03:58.670> recycle<00:03:59.480> in<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.599> back<00:03:59.750> into<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.079> cases

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
be recycle in the back into the cases

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.809 
be recycle in the back into the cases
and<00:04:00.709> to<00:04:01.670> my<00:04:01.819> surprise<00:04:02.239> they<00:04:02.450> were<00:04:02.480> curly<00:04:02.930> was

so<00:04:26.350> now<00:04:27.350> talk<00:04:27.590> about<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.460> drivetrain<00:04:29.000> -

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
so now talk about the the drivetrain -

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.330 
so now talk about the the drivetrain -
there<00:04:29.419> -<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:30.050> rear<00:04:30.289> wheel<00:04:30.470> what's

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
there - the rear wheel what's

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.129 
there - the rear wheel what's
interesting<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.030> you've<00:04:32.690> got<00:04:32.840> dual

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
interesting is that you've got dual

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.909 
interesting is that you've got dual
chains<00:04:33.949> so<00:04:34.370> how<00:04:35.090> did<00:04:35.240> that<00:04:35.300> come<00:04:35.479> together

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
chains so how did that come together

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.830 
chains so how did that come together
yeah<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:36.949> did<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.190> jack<00:04:37.789> shaft<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.270> set<00:04:38.479> up<00:04:38.660> so

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
yeah I did a jack shaft it set up so

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.900 
yeah I did a jack shaft it set up so
that<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:39.080> could<00:04:39.259> run<00:04:39.410> a<00:04:39.860> drivetrain<00:04:40.610> on<00:04:40.759> each

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
that I could run a drivetrain on each

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.330 
that I could run a drivetrain on each
side<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.300> bike<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:42.020> know<00:04:42.830> just<00:04:43.070> thinking

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
side of the bike you know just thinking

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.830 
side of the bike you know just thinking
with<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.639> strength<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:44.060> be<00:04:44.210> required<00:04:44.570> in<00:04:44.750> the

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
with the strength to be required in the

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.830 
with the strength to be required in the
whole<00:04:44.960> hill<00:04:45.169> climbing<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:46.220> know<00:04:46.400> deal<00:04:46.840> and

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
whole hill climbing you know deal and

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.770 
whole hill climbing you know deal and
again<00:04:48.560> going<00:04:48.770> back<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:49.190> that<00:04:49.340> era<00:04:49.669> it<00:04:50.510> looks

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
again going back to that era it looks

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.089 
again going back to that era it looks
like<00:04:50.960> it<00:04:51.080> might<00:04:51.260> have<00:04:51.289> been<00:04:51.470> done<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:51.919> know<00:04:52.070> I

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
like it might have been done you know I

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.760 
like it might have been done you know I
didn't<00:04:52.520> didn't<00:04:52.940> see<00:04:53.090> it<00:04:53.180> happen<00:04:53.330> but<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:54.650> know
