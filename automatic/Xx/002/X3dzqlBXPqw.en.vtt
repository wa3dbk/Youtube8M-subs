00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.299

 They go with me to the car 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.900

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.340
 accident 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.340

 Nowadays there are more than accidents 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.549
 Enough she is the only employee 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.919
 here for 25 years without 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.919
 interruption even during the war 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.669
 And now I leave you your job

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.600

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.660
 duels with something in the mountain me 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.660
 knows as little as the clock 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.830
 I have your words thinking the party is 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.550
 Over but until then they will still be blood 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.550
