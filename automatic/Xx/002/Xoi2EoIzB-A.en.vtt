00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:10.320
 in front of his door to door to the body to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.210
 nude bodies for the entire team found 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.599
 a cohesion between us and the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:22.890
 squatters and with our teeth today 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:25.050
 before becoming the fate of your 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.340
 customers you know the name of two 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.320
 people that act is here today 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.410
 it's a pleasure but here it is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.369
 in the match we always see that so 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.140
 that the supporters are always in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.430
 Stade Rennais present in these areas 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 so much is there but not the unique ones and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.950
 me today it's true 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.930
 that today and that's it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.640
 by then we're here for not just a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530
 support and we will see what will happen 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.480
 pass tomorrow 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.050
 listen to us we've made our 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.550
 duty 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.550
 I tell you I repeat it 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.570
 in 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.970
 reacted quickly enough in the interests of 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.680
 players club interests 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.170
 so I hope it pays off 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.260
 and it will bring its white fruits pardon 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.269
 and I'm finding a little bit far 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.310
 this commission of armed civilians still 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.530
 a I think sometimes you have to be a 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.600
 little more responsive but the administration 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.670
 it's very very heavy so I would say 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.490
 greenery get together 3 4 days or a 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.380
 week after her and the time to do 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.440
 to see things is too long 20 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.490
 month after it's been a month the same time 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.430
 I speak more than anything I speak more than 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.479
 two days I wish we were that you 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.729
 ask me more questions and if I 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.410
 would like my judge jean vilar and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.410
 chris mavinga on our weight performance 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.890
 and with a little more to generate l of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.280
 justice pape without thinking without having to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.500
 priori 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.460
 then twice we have a priori I 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.390
 think about the damage he did in 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.729
 France team it was two good 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.869
 matches especially the last and but that 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.690
 looks like the team of France hopes 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.009
 I am talking about the european championship 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.910
 when he odds against Spain he does 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.099
 a very good match 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.200
 it's notably the second half and 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.450
 I feel like I do not see the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.140
 same match and I'm trying too much when 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.399
 we are coach we must be fair 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.090
 to style just because you take 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.530
 the right decision 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.350
 and sometimes I find that the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.470
 the appreciations there is a priori 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.709
 adverse favorable only next 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.709
 people
