00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.090
 the days friends entities today 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.730
 look like the kitchen of joselo in 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.460
 I 'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.980
 stew today a stewed chicken 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 microwave with the same ingredients 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.170
 of the stew I made in the pan 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.269
 paw print 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:44.750
 I'm going to use garlic onion tomato 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.190
 cumin pepper oregano and salt and chicken 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.719
 which is the most important thing then 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.719
 first seasoning we have 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.330
 but is that the pieces of chicken that 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.330
 let's go use 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.089
 the pepper 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.610
 and the code 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:15.120
 with the help of the hand this news 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.120
 until it is completely 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.150
 pigmented 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.150
 I'll take a little olive oil 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.370
 and I'm going inside 12 in it 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.040
 Perez that will allow me 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.130
 as you will see the spirit has residues of 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.630
 water because it is not and every 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.630
 started to help this 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.470
 here I cooked like a little soldier 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.050
 I have not washed is not the spirits wash 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.960
 but it is not dried and on that residue 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.440
 of the water liquid 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.340
 I'm adding 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.340
 and the oil 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.530
 oregano 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.020
 unlike the pan put here 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.120
 let's chop the onion the garlic and the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.550
 tomato and everything together goes to the micro 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.900
 Well, continuing with this stew 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.990
 chicken microwave 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.530
 here we have 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.050
 onion cut in julienne 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.740
 chopped tomato chopped garlic 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.640
 the chicken is seasoned male and 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:36.850
 oregano so that the remaining 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.850
 of the tomato on the onion 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.500
 we touch all the ingredients 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.430
 All the ingredients 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.990
 it's nothing now 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.990
 let's admit inns 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.290
 and we take it 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.680
 to the microwave that we have at home what 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.530
 we cover with the help of a plate 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.190
 and we are going to give it 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.190
 5 minutes 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.470
 this has helped me a cooked 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.620
 cooking 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.670
 here at least we already have the stew of 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.590
 chicken in the microwave 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.940
 I must tell you that apart from the five 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.810
 minutes that he has given him he has given two 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.489
 plus 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.640
 is covered so be very careful to the 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.970
 childbirth time because I look 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.230
 burning 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.230
 the same at the time of 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.180
 touch 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.450
 this burns 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.400
 I completely get everything 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.269
 as if it were made to the pot 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.269
 well nothing 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.980
 chicken 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.410
 more natural than this there is no here the 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.450
 paternal garrison 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.280
 it seems this is some chicken in the canal 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.970
 the kitchen of joselo on youtube made 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.970
 to the microwave
