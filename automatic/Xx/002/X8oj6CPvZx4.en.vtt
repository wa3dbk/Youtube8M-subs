00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.980
 6 about the sample judge stinking 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.229
 experts have revealed the conclusion stone 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:07.529
 interesting and here are 300 million years 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.320
 maybe it was coral when you territory 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.690
 Moscow region stormed the sea and here 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.690
 cosmic in it saw nothing all 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.579
 substance 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:19.749
 trouble 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.039
 by material 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.039
 Kim's materials for the future 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.300
 except platinum group 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.569
 in reducing samples 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.520
 no excess at all 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.920
 audit in relation 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.010
 with its content in the blood was not much 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.480
 however say that if during the day 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.500
 child birth scientists are also solved 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.370
 Cocker's handwriting has a lot to do with 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.760
 meteorite crater 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 Availability 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.490
 so that we are generally speaking 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.410
 very well traced it 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.740
 generally round 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.040
 in the eastern division it is simpler to form 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.840
 first after this country 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.989
 attitude 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.970
 Rivers there field simultaneously 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.610
 she like that rub higher 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.080
 videos and give them not only destruction 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.650
 new puzzles and scientists but also useful 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.200
 fossils have that summer funnel book 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.440
 people often find diamonds result 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.320
 electric shock even the table 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.670
 excessive salt deposits 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.710
 famous oil field 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.530
 they certainly are not formed niche 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.430
 not 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.890
 non-combustible slates on impact 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.180
 they are formed later when the crater is already there 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.400
 hollow 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.590
 there is a bay in which 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.810
 water evaporates 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.310
 deposits from the will 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.100
 tampa die reading 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.230
 accumulate at the bottom compacted 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.430
 oil shale is formed and so on 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.860
 with the help of ambassadors of Roscosmos, scientists 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.740
 try to unravel and in fact it 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.030
 mystery of the universe 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.900
 is there life accusations 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.480
 it turns out there are having researched hundreds 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.620
 Russian meteorites 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.999
 american specialists 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:07.649
 found a typo she station 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.779
 microorganisms 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.679
 it changes the way of 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.219
 the emergence of life on our planet the former 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:14.040
 meteorites 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.499
 most not yet 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.399
 there is only one class meteorite fact 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.689
 called carbonaceous chondrites of them 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.699
 there are children education 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.169
 most let's say so let the chondrites 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:26.779
 was investigated and everywhere we found 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.799
 the remains will impress the ball then some 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.399
 at the same time that it was 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:33.799
 on Thursday 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.129
 and here is how electronic 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.089
 the microscope looks like aliens from 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.969
 space 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.719
 there are enough such bacteria on earth to eat and 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.799
 quite primitive forms of them can 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.769
 see for example and in the summer on reservoirs 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.509
 when they say water is flooded and more 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:48.879
 complex organism 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.419
 St. Petersburg 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.529
 this forum it says it is 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:54.499
 will turn out 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.759
 culture and sports 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.799
 which means it's high enough 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.309
 organized by the body 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:02.709
 that is, those who do not see 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.559
 the most amazing here are a few kinds 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:07.109
 who passed microorganisms 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.749
 more than a year of birth 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.819
 so far our solar system is only 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.879
 life was forming a bush somewhere that was me 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.269
 I think that there is flirting 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.319
 which were already 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.429
 but the warmth of sweden as 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:21.789
 technical will 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.049
 which turned out to be 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:24.939
 company 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:25.859
 microbes 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.029
 and before that 6 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.029
 fragments of these forces by the way interesting 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.009
 today almost attacks can 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.229
 turn global 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.579
 disaster for the first time on a real threat 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.680
 maybe started talking six years ago when 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.489
 first came to the attention of scientists 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.629
 held 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.719
 we counted the money as a few 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.689
 hundred meters of 2020 about 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.379
 a distance of 30 thousand kilometers 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.299
 space standards are very close 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.499
 if there is nothing to orbit then the probability 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.019
 colliding by himself after seven years of his 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.199
 next week increases 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.370
 scientist thinks 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.370
 government can't 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:06.859
 into action 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.379
 the body will be the size of kilometers or more 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.109
 even then it doesn't matter where she is 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.029
 will fall 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:15.029
 global catastrophe 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.259
 the line is open about a hundred thousand asteroids 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.680
 still a diameter of a kilometer or more about 

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:33.520
 This writes today such as meters 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.959
 pay known little space 

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:38.020
 a few meters of Chinese 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.470
 detect and not at all necessary 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.240
 special telescope 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.550
 security requirement problem 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.030
 engaged not only scientists 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.890
 theorists 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.050
 but also federal space 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.170
 agency oil workers can harm and 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.400
 spacecraft 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.310
 if not even threatened by loading the whole 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.520
 grouping 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.879
 spacecraft on 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.860
 geostationary orbits 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.129
 I know that you are from one to two 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:06.699
 spacecraft 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.680
 which includes sat in a single system 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.360
 Here I have especially that affect 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.689
 state security 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.710
 for us and for any country 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.710
 adverse factor 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.689
 pill rescue is meant to solve 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.449
 offers the most different from destruction 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.400
 large asteroids nuclear strike 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.169
 a descendant of serovskim celestial body 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.159
 safe distance 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.529
 however, the first step to international 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.569
 cooperation and the creation of a single 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.789
 global monitoring system and even 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.599
 special space patrol 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.489
 to warn in advance about 

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:46.699
 danger and if necessary 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.229
 evacuate people 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.699
 then guessing won't have to fall no 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:52.139
 will fall
