00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.920 
it to the left and then insert it into
the<00:00:34.170> coil<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.910> will<00:00:36.090> need<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.420> twist<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> hair

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the coil you will need to twist the hair

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.100 
the coil you will need to twist the hair
stick<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.340> very<00:00:38.610> blunt<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.329> then

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
stick because it is very blunt and then

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.910 
stick because it is very blunt and then
once<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.250> hair<00:00:41.489> stick<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.899> coil<00:00:43.200> take

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
once the hair stick is in the coil take

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.790 
once the hair stick is in the coil take
a<00:00:43.950> chunk<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.809> insert<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> hair

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
a chunk and insert it so that the hair

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.700 
a chunk and insert it so that the hair
stick<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.340> locked<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.539> hair<00:00:48.840> will<00:00:49.079> hold<00:00:49.379> with

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
stick is locked the hair will hold with

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.819 
stick is locked the hair will hold with
one<00:00:50.010> hair<00:00:50.340> stick<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.600> using<00:00:52.050> two<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
one hair stick but with using two the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.819 
one hair stick but with using two the
hold<00:00:53.100> will<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.460> much<00:00:53.850> stronger<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:55.020> again<00:00:55.469> go

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
hold will be much stronger so again go

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.430 
hold will be much stronger so again go
into<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.309> middle<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> coil<00:00:57.090> point<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.289> out

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
into the middle of the coil point it out

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.760 
into the middle of the coil point it out
and<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.460> point<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> back<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and then point it back in so that it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.299 
and then point it back in so that it
makes<00:01:02.039> an<00:01:02.219> X<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:03.719> most<00:01:03.960> important<00:01:04.589> tip<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
makes an X the most important tip is to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.480 
makes an X the most important tip is to
go<00:01:05.519> through<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.450> coil<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.439> then<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
go through one coil and then out the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.480 
go through one coil and then out the
second<00:01:08.970> coil<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.510> with<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> second<00:01:10.530> stick<00:01:10.860> go

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
second coil and with the second stick go

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.120 
second coil and with the second stick go
through<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:12.450> coil<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.049> then<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
through one coil and then out in a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.090 
through one coil and then out in a
second<00:01:14.580> coil<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.960> create<00:01:16.170> an<00:01:16.530> X<00:01:16.770> in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
second coil so that you create an X in

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.149 
second coil so that you create an X in
the<00:01:17.250> middle<00:01:17.750> here<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> method<00:01:19.320> again<00:01:19.799> with

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the middle here is the method again with

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.149 
the middle here is the method again with
using<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.700> stick<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:22.110> through<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> middle

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
using one stick going through the middle

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.719 
using one stick going through the middle
coil<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.479> second<00:01:24.930> coil<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:26.040> taking

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
coil out the second coil and then taking

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.880 
coil out the second coil and then taking
a<00:01:26.820> chunk<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.540> hair<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.229> lock<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> hair

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.219 
a chunk of the hair to lock the hair
stick<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.460> place<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.869> take<00:01:31.020> some

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
stick in place it's going to take some

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
stick in place it's going to take some
trial<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.680> error<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.579> your<00:01:32.700> hair<00:01:32.939> will<00:01:33.119> hold

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
trial and error but your hair will hold

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.190 
trial and error but your hair will hold
with<00:01:33.840> using<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.770> hair<00:01:35.130> stick<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:36.200> am

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
with using just one hair stick I am

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.560 
with using just one hair stick I am
going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> show<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:37.979> another<00:01:38.520> method<00:01:38.640> with
