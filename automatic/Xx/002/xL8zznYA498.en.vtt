00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.939 
yeah there's I've been on some awesome
innovations<00:00:18.420> from<00:00:18.660> last<00:00:18.960> year<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
innovations from last year just the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.980 
innovations from last year just the
ability<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.789> player<00:00:21.000> movements<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.779> some

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
ability of the player movements and some

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.380 
ability of the player movements and some
of<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.170> shot<00:00:22.410> animations<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:24.150> some<00:00:24.300> of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
of the shot animations and just some of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.050 
of the shot animations and just some of
the<00:00:24.449> player<00:00:24.660> animations<00:00:25.320> overall<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.070> think

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the player animations overall I think

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.400 
the player animations overall I think
really<00:00:27.390> make<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.689> game<00:00:27.840> awesome<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.380> I

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
really make this game awesome and I

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.669 
really make this game awesome and I
think<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.240> capability<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> online

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
think the the capability of the online

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.170 
think the the capability of the online
one<00:00:31.980> quarter<00:00:32.340> thing<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.640> actually<00:00:32.820> pretty

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
one quarter thing is actually pretty

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.000 
one quarter thing is actually pretty
awesome<00:00:33.270> fact<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:34.110> they<00:00:34.559> gave<00:00:34.770> us<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
awesome fact they they gave us the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.639 
awesome fact they they gave us the
opportunity<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.989> test<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> servers<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
opportunity to test the servers and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
opportunity to test the servers and
things<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.010> nature<00:00:38.149> but<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.329> want<00:00:39.540> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
things of that nature but I just want to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.240 
things of that nature but I just want to
talk<00:00:39.750> about<00:00:39.780> some<00:00:40.320> things<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.680> particular

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
talk about some things in particular

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.650 
talk about some things in particular
that<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:41.700> are<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> lot<00:00:42.000> different<00:00:42.030> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that I think are a lot different and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.090 
that I think are a lot different and
maybe<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:43.230> things<00:00:43.469> it'll<00:00:43.620> take<00:00:43.860> some

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
maybe some things it'll take some

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.729 
maybe some things it'll take some
getting<00:00:44.160> used<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:46.020> whole<00:00:46.170> dribbling

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
getting used to on the whole dribbling

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.549 
getting used to on the whole dribbling
mechanic<00:00:47.579> system<00:00:48.000> thing<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> analog

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
mechanic system thing with the analog

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.200 
mechanic system thing with the analog
stick<00:00:49.590> i<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.190> pretty<00:00:50.370> cool<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:50.969> almost

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
stick i think is pretty cool it's almost

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.660 
stick i think is pretty cool it's almost
like<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> soccer<00:00:52.440> video<00:00:52.800> game<00:00:53.010> type<00:00:53.280> thing<00:00:53.520> like

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
like a soccer video game type thing like

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.150 
like a soccer video game type thing like
fifa<00:00:53.879> or<00:00:54.239> pro<00:00:54.390> evolution<00:00:54.449> um<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.829> y'all<00:00:56.010> play

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
fifa or pro evolution um if y'all play

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.270 
fifa or pro evolution um if y'all play
those<00:00:56.309> games<00:00:56.340> where<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.440> stick<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.039> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
those games where the right stick is I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
those games where the right stick is I
guess<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.850> fakes<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.420> geeks<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> things<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
guess the fakes and geeks and things of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.319 
guess the fakes and geeks and things of
that<00:01:01.260> nature<00:01:01.399> you<00:01:02.399> know<00:01:02.520> Juke<00:01:02.820> moves<00:01:03.090> things

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
that nature you know Juke moves things

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.090 
that nature you know Juke moves things
like<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.320> will<00:01:04.379> definitely<00:01:04.860> take<00:01:04.979> me

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
like that and it will definitely take me

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.410 
like that and it will definitely take me
some<00:01:05.280> getting<00:01:05.460> used<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:05.820> right<00:01:06.060> there<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
some getting used to but right there you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.359 
some getting used to but right there you
see<00:01:06.600> dwade<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.830> little<00:01:07.950> kick-out

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
see dwade with that little kick-out

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.550 
see dwade with that little kick-out
animation<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.119> saw<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.630> some<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
animation that we saw in some of the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.410 
animation that we saw in some of the
early<00:01:10.860> footage<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.490> game<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.970> think<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
early footage of this game I think it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.080 
early footage of this game I think it
the<00:01:12.659> e3<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.400> animation<00:01:14.760> right

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the e3 actually but that animation right

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.789 
the e3 actually but that animation right
there<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.479> pretty<00:01:15.960> awesome<00:01:16.200> because<00:01:16.619> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
there is pretty awesome because it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.190 
there is pretty awesome because it
really<00:01:17.040> adds<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.689> adds<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.020> much

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
really adds a but it just adds so much

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050 
really adds a but it just adds so much
more<00:01:19.320> realism<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.159> basketball<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:20.850> when

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
more realism to basketball because when

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940 
more realism to basketball because when
you're<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> player<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.380> shoot<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> ball

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you're a player and you shoot the ball

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.109 
you're a player and you shoot the ball
like<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.189> if<00:01:23.490> you're<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:23.670> sure<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
like that if you're not sure if the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.730 
like that if you're not sure if the
balls<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> most<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
balls in and go in which is most the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.350 
balls in and go in which is most the
time<00:01:25.950> you're<00:01:26.640> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> kind<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.060> keep<00:01:27.210> your

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
time you're going to kind of keep your

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.910 
time you're going to kind of keep your
leg<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.750> run<00:01:28.049> over<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.470> ball<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:28.890> I

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
leg out and run over to the ball now I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
leg out and run over to the ball now I
don't<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.790> become<00:01:30.630> an<00:01:30.750> animation

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
don't want this to become an animation

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.980 
don't want this to become an animation
that<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.040> often<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.780> kind

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
that we see so often that it just kind

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.399 
that we see so often that it just kind
of<00:01:34.110> becomes<00:01:34.500> comment<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.900> happens<00:01:37.290> more

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
of becomes comment like it happens more

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.080 
of becomes comment like it happens more
often<00:01:37.710> than<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> normal<00:01:38.430> jump<00:01:38.610> shot<00:01:38.909> that's

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
often than the normal jump shot that's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.340 
often than the normal jump shot that's
not<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.420> not<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.200> happen

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
not what not what I want to see happen

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.469 
not what not what I want to see happen
but<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.040> hope<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.210> does<00:01:42.450> happen

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
but I hope that if that does happen

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.080 
but I hope that if that does happen
they're<00:01:42.930> not<00:01:43.079> patching<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.909> feel

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
they're not patching it and I just feel

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.139 
they're not patching it and I just feel
like<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.960> jump<00:01:46.229> shots<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.740> more<00:01:47.149> they're

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
like the the jump shots or more they're

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.030 
like the the jump shots or more they're
more<00:01:48.329> realistic<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.140> ask<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.560> overall

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040

this demo for I guess about an hour to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
themselves into k12 which kind of made

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.670 
themselves into k12 which kind of made
the<00:02:57.240> game<00:02:57.360> not<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.750> realistic<00:02:58.110> as<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.530> could

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
the game not as realistic as it could

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.800 
the game not as realistic as it could
have<00:02:58.710> been<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.270> even<00:03:00.270> even<00:03:00.570> dribble

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
have been and even even dribble

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.510 
have been and even even dribble
animations<00:03:01.410> with<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.770> physics<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.310> all<00:03:02.370> that

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
animations with the physics and all that

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.920 
animations with the physics and all that
look<00:03:02.670> at<00:03:02.790> how<00:03:02.910> D<00:03:03.150> way<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.600> kind<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.810> got

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
look at how D way just kind of got

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.480 
look at how D way just kind of got
knocked<00:03:04.170> over<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.590> there's<00:03:04.770> Westbrook<00:03:05.010> with

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
knocked over and there's Westbrook with

knocked over and there's Westbrook with
the<00:03:05.520> kick-out<00:03:05.910> animation<00:03:06.510> again<00:03:06.810> and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
the kick-out animation again and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.200 
the kick-out animation again and
everything<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.160> looking<00:03:08.430> pretty<00:03:08.640> good<00:03:08.910> and

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
everything is looking pretty good and

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.210 
everything is looking pretty good and
this<00:03:10.020> will<00:03:10.200> be<00:03:10.350> my<00:03:10.470> only<00:03:10.650> demo<00:03:10.920> gameplay

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
this will be my only demo gameplay

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.160 
this will be my only demo gameplay
because<00:03:11.550> I'm<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.060> really<00:03:12.420> really<00:03:12.930> looking

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
because I'm just really really looking

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.810 
because I'm just really really looking

here<00:03:48.330> i'm<00:03:48.420> trying<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.720> make<00:03:48.750> substitutions

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
here i'm trying to make substitutions

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.020

but<00:03:49.650> i<00:03:49.709> couldn't<00:03:49.950> figure<00:03:50.070> out<00:03:50.190> they<00:03:50.550> I<00:03:50.790> don't

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
but i couldn't figure out they I don't

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.970 
but i couldn't figure out they I don't
think<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.300> can<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.780> demo<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.320> figure<00:03:52.860> that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
think you can in the demo I figure that

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.410 
think you can in the demo I figure that
out<00:03:53.010> after<00:03:53.160> hitting<00:03:53.430> start<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:53.970> then<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.150> tried

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
out after hitting start and then I tried

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.690 
out after hitting start and then I tried
the<00:03:54.450> UM<00:03:55.040> polar<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.100> go<00:03:56.250> back<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.400> I'm<00:03:56.550> talking

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
the UM polar I go back to I'm talking

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.520 
the UM polar I go back to I'm talking
about<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.060> post<00:03:57.270> moves<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.690> second<00:03:58.050> that's

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
about the post moves in a second that's

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.810 
about the post moves in a second that's
another<00:03:58.830> thing<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.340> think<00:03:59.640> has<00:03:59.790> really

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
another thing that I think has really

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.990 
another thing that I think has really
been<00:04:00.480> improved<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:01.170> 2k12<00:04:01.950> when<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.520> try<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.730> do

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
been improved in 2k12 when you try to do

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.330 
been improved in 2k12 when you try to do
an<00:04:03.120> intentional<00:04:03.750> foul<00:04:04.100> especially<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.220> end

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
an intentional foul especially the end

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.280 
an intentional foul especially the end
of<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.489> game<00:04:05.520> when<00:04:05.820> there's<00:04:06.000> only<00:04:06.330> maybe<00:04:06.900> two

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290

Mario<00:04:18.660> Chalmers<00:04:18.900> sprint<00:04:19.500> over<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.919> him<00:04:20.039> and

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
to get that intentional foul so that's

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.160 
to get that intentional foul so that's
something

something
I'm<00:04:25.230> really<00:04:25.440> looking<00:04:25.740> forward<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:26.280> seeing<00:04:26.910> in

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
fouls making it that much more realistic

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.620 
fouls making it that much more realistic
because<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.820> was<00:04:32.970> something<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.480> had<00:04:33.510> a

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
also I don't know if they change this in

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.520 
also I don't know if they change this in
this<00:04:41.460> game<00:04:41.640> out<00:04:41.790> think<00:04:42.060> they<00:04:42.270> did<00:04:42.510> but<00:04:42.780> you

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
this game out think they did but you

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.990 
this game out think they did but you
should<00:04:43.710> be<00:04:43.740> able<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:44.100> hurry<00:04:44.310> up<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.550> shot<00:04:44.820> if

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
should be able to hurry up a shot if

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.610 
should be able to hurry up a shot if
there's<00:04:45.180> only<00:04:45.300> like<00:04:45.420> one<00:04:45.750> second<00:04:46.200> left<00:04:46.380> when

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
there's only like one second left when
