00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:02.980
 so I will introduce you 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.250
 the small machine 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.410
 in practice the tiger-cats 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.410
 let's go to the elysÃ©e with a friend 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.899
 it looks a little 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.499
 because you find this market it's only i'm sure no and more 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.499
 robust 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.329
 we have such a motor of sherbrooke a kilowatt 5 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.349
 with a fuse 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.199
 it is also false compensator inside 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.199
 a hundred of his group by the way more 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.020
 keep power in case of 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.150
 even if it is necessary to avoid in case of overload marl 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.810
 from stage managed documents 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.750
 standing on a punctual need of power as the computing engine 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.180
 contador will be the return 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.180
 down simon pulley system 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.980
 so here is my belt pulley system does not necessarily the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.970
 two runners 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.110
 % 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.430
 I had more than 85 on the bank 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.700
 I do not know the diameter at the back and must be happy 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.320
 % it is related to frequency 2 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.900
 protection of elephants in action 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.740
 so I remind you that the machine to turn 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.820
 in the end at 750 rpm 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.049
 hence sometimes economic autonomy 440 rpm 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.979
 good system as it is built 6 it allows me to have a frequency of 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.200
 rotations of 680 rpm so for me it's okay 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.900
 cobbb 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.260
 % is right on the engine here 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.240
 we have no system of lists but to terminate 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.170
 that of many who will allow julie snyder cards and the engine of 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.670
 blame what allows for better but increase or decrease the tension on the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.020
 course 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 his fortune very very well 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.130
 cape then 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.940
 so we go over 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.740
 so we go again my texts 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.240
 with absences works very very well stressed from Thursday night 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.390
 really confirms in town hall 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.110
 we also see many have done some tests with him some paper 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.569
 so the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.419
 did you explain that it does not move 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.740
 this place 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.260
 facing this suffering 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.829
 when I left coupe de france 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.129
 we see that it moves completely innovative 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.079
 it is therefore necessary that the release does not necessarily need 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.180
 I have them all the scenes of this guy since February photo keystone 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.019
 also our identity is a self disappeared too early and hammer 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.989
 what counts in the momentum 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.629
 an extraction mouth 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.399
 here is a disc around him 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:44.509
 when we have our collective except perhaps for fear the beautiful with the 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.529
 frequency that with the centrifugal force take off its end 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.529
 the record makes him turn and the fugitive 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:54.149
 so that she still resists 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.839
 the system to put to prevent that 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.179
 it is necessary that the body 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:00.769
 their toil book 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.079
 I think the cost of the machine is running out 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.079
 especially to avoid that the expos cuts the projects of what 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.769
 the time when we go back 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.509
 I have my job but the roll 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:13.429
 the matrix of all 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.269
 so the right setting and many more that lies the question 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.689
 taboo settings 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.980
 so it's just so nice 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.619
 access to me 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:24.619
 I run smoothly I do not have to touch the matrix 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.219
 also talked about that side 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:28.869
 you do not have to touch the matrix 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.459
 the ideal gap between the previous one millimeter 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.149
 she's kind 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:37.819
 at 20 o'clock warned jacques putzeys these big pumps turn too good 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.819
 shares its author with all the weight of his function as judge 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.209
 always important a system 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.369
 of work 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.419
 to adjust the base height the pressure and the height 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.309
 I do not have too much pressure because 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.059
 % to his empty saga 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.159
 and she 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.309
 she was rolling so offered to help change things on the fly 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.649
 but she's eating an ever-obvious rule 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:05.229
 for my part 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:06.389
 the royal place 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.419
 and I had to ride with my shot after the end it's very important that the 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.599
 anyway 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.119
 go for it summer 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:13.679
 the call to tear 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:15.299
 and M 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.809
 you will not have any more 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.279
 the bridge for smooth operation 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.279
 so percent 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:25.680
 not that it's just 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.909
 a metal plate 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.809
 on which from below if you clicked 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:32.599
 on the site here 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:33.809
 not at all 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:36.499
 we come back this morning this debacle 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.499
 for the police officer 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.110
 it is sure it is that croatia which is therefore the oct 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.309
 a bit of bitumen 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:49.669
 he does not refuse you the same system so not paid with 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.430
 located on the metal tray 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.569
 hilton ran on his art 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.569
 dimitri a record store 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.699
 the course of sugar in the water the ape matrix then of course a match that 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.300
 we 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.770
 pierce all this 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.770
 so percent and combative 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.749
 to break into rodez then port 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.229
 it was DIY in France 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.659
 do not bother to go into details each and every gold at this fund 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.089
 his way of doing things 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:21.210
 grow shortly for this guy or make it work 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.379
 and it works 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.379
 very very good 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:31.309
 to the other 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.259
 still others all the systems the protective covers 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.059
 this is very dangerous saved two balls in the neck judith 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.849
 as to the goodbye 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:03.409
 that's what
