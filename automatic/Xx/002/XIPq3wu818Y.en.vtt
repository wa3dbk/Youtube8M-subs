guys but whenever I play village it kind
of<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.250> gives<00:00:41.399> me<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> hosts<00:00:42.059> lag

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
of it kind of gives me like a hosts lag

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.779 
of it kind of gives me like a hosts lag
is<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> seems<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:43.920> even<00:00:44.460> though<00:00:44.550> if<00:00:44.640> I'm

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
is what it seems like even though if I'm

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.430 
is what it seems like even though if I'm
not<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> host<00:00:45.300> it'll<00:00:45.690> still<00:00:45.899> kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> lag

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
not the host it'll still kind of lag

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.069 
not the host it'll still kind of lag
frame<00:00:47.190> rate<00:00:47.370> rise<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.480> sure<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
frame rate rise I'm not sure if it's the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.930 
frame rate rise I'm not sure if it's the
map<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.469> know<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.100> kind<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.610> happened

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
map I know this kind of kind of happened

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
map I know this kind of kind of happened
in<00:00:51.180> black<00:00:51.420> ops<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.840> radiation<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
in black ops with radiation there was a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.830 
in black ops with radiation there was a
lot<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.980> moving<00:00:53.160> parts<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.910> all<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:54.780> of

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
lot of moving parts and all that kind of

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
lot of moving parts and all that kind of
stuff<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.620> don't<00:00:56.100> know<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.670> guys

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
stuff but I don't know if you guys

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.479 
stuff but I don't know if you guys
experienced<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.449> too<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.920> on<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.070> map<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
experienced this too but on this map it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.700 
experienced this too but on this map it
kind<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.820> seems<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.510> framerate<00:01:00.989> laggy

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
kind of seems a little framerate laggy

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.280 
kind of seems a little framerate laggy
sometimes<00:01:02.370> I'm<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.359> feels<00:01:04.049> really

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
sometimes I'm you know it feels really

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.620 
sometimes I'm you know it feels really
weird<00:01:04.559> sometimes<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:06.240> said<00:01:06.299> it's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
weird sometimes but like I said it's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270 
weird sometimes but like I said it's
it's<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.170> basically<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> hosts<00:01:08.010> lag

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
it's like basically the hosts lag

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.330 
it's like basically the hosts lag
without<00:01:09.090> being<00:01:09.299> hosts<00:01:09.799> which<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> reason

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
without being hosts which is the reason

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.010 
without being hosts which is the reason
why<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.490> don't<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.390> map<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:12.840> I

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
why I don't really like this map but I

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.469 
why I don't really like this map but I
somehow<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> lot<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.830> gameplays<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.490> so

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
somehow get a lot of gameplays on it so

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780 
somehow get a lot of gameplays on it so
uh<00:01:15.509> sorry<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> guys<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:17.490> tell<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.950 
controller kind of took over the sniping
field<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.140> guess<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:49.619> call<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:50.689> now<00:01:51.689> you

know<00:01:51.990> before<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.890> only<00:01:53.460> controller<00:01:53.790> you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
know before that the only controller you

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.310 
know before that the only controller you
could<00:01:54.030> use<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> game<00:01:54.659> which<00:01:54.930> was<00:01:55.079> called

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
could use with the game which was called

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.889 
could use with the game which was called
duty<00:01:55.530> 4<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> Wii<00:01:56.340> Remote<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.750> black

good you know it had definitely helped
when<00:02:03.540> sniping<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.049> made<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.259> sniping<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.740> laugh

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920

the classic controller at all in modern

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.980 
the classic controller at all in modern
warfare<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.530> black<00:02:23.130> ops<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:24.660> used<00:02:24.900> it

warfare in black ops and you used it

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.180 
warfare in black ops and you used it
here<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.260> modern<00:02:25.380> warfare<00:02:25.560> 3<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:25.950> would<00:02:26.070> know

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
here in modern warfare 3 you would know

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.980 
here in modern warfare 3 you would know
just<00:02:26.220> notice<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.910> little<00:02:27.150> bit<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.570> difference

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
just notice a little bit of a difference

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.620 
just notice a little bit of a difference
first<00:02:28.550> first<00:02:29.550> thing<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.850> noticed<00:02:30.240> was<00:02:30.390> there's

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
first first thing I noticed was there's

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.480 
first first thing I noticed was there's
definitely<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> little<00:02:31.590> bit<00:02:31.740> less<00:02:32.160> aim-assist

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
definitely a little bit less aim-assist

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.040 
definitely a little bit less aim-assist
and<00:02:33.450> basically<00:02:33.780> what<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.110> aim-assist<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:35.040> is

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
and basically what that aim-assist is is

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.540 
and basically what that aim-assist is is
basically<00:02:37.050> when<00:02:37.500> you're<00:02:37.650> aiming<00:02:37.800> at<00:02:38.040> an<00:02:38.160> enemy

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
basically when you're aiming at an enemy

player

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.570 
player
it<00:02:40.140> basically<00:02:40.320> tugs<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.190> him<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.460> it

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
it basically tugs on him and it

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.060 
it basically tugs on him and it
automatically<00:02:42.090> locks<00:02:42.450> on<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> enemy<00:02:43.290> if

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
automatically locks on to the enemy if

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.530 
automatically locks on to the enemy if
you<00:02:44.370> know<00:02:44.610> what<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.790> mean<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.240> can<00:02:45.270> be

with<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.660> classic<00:03:01.050> controller<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.440> noticed

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
with the classic controller I noticed

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.970 
with the classic controller I noticed
that<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> little<00:03:03.390> bit<00:03:03.650> less<00:03:04.650> aim-assist

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
that it is a little bit less aim-assist

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.890 
that it is a little bit less aim-assist
and<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.780> kind<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.200> seems<00:03:07.620> as<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.910> continue<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
and it kind of seems as as I continue to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.080 
and it kind of seems as as I continue to
snipe<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.500> Wii<00:03:10.590> Remote<00:03:10.830> here<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.160> they

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
snipe with the Wii Remote here that they

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.760 
snipe with the Wii Remote here that they
kind<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.390> increased<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.990> aim-assist<00:03:13.230> on

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
kind of increased the aim-assist on

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.530 
kind of increased the aim-assist on
though<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.670> Wii<00:03:14.760> Remote<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.180> don't<00:03:15.360> know<00:03:15.450> if

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
though on the Wii Remote I don't know if

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.060 
though on the Wii Remote I don't know if
this<00:03:15.720> was<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.080> balance<00:03:16.410> out<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.590> classic

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
this was to balance out the classic

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.920 
this was to balance out the classic
controller<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.670> Wii<00:03:17.820> Remote<00:03:18.090> kind<00:03:18.720> of

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
controller and the Wii Remote kind of

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.470 
controller and the Wii Remote kind of
controllers<00:03:19.920> in<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.100> game<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.880> don't<00:03:21.300> know

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
controllers in the game I don't know

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.940 
controllers in the game I don't know
like<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.840> said<00:03:22.050> if<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.260> was<00:03:22.380> intentional<00:03:22.860> or

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
like I said if it was intentional or

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.920 
like I said if it was intentional or
unintentional<00:03:23.160> but<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:24.209> kind<00:03:24.450> of<00:03:24.540> seems<00:03:24.780> like

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
unintentional but it kind of seems like

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.479 
unintentional but it kind of seems like
they<00:03:25.050> added<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.410> little<00:03:25.530> bit<00:03:25.709> more<00:03:25.769> emesis<00:03:26.340> to

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
they added a little bit more emesis to

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.800 
they added a little bit more emesis to
the<00:03:26.580> Wii<00:03:26.670> Remote<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.150> little<00:03:27.390> less<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.720> the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
the Wii Remote and a little less to the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.860 
the Wii Remote and a little less to the
classic<00:03:28.170> controller<00:03:28.320> Pro<00:03:28.769> but<00:03:29.870> basically

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
classic controller Pro but basically

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.009 
classic controller Pro but basically
what<00:03:31.650> I've<00:03:32.400> been<00:03:32.640> what<00:03:33.209> I<00:03:33.239> discovered<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
what I've been what I discovered and

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.690 
what I've been what I discovered and
what<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.470> guess<00:03:34.739> I've<00:03:34.950> been<00:03:35.070> hearing<00:03:35.370> over<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
what I guess I've been hearing over the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.520 
what I guess I've been hearing over the
last<00:03:35.850> couple<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.330> weeks<00:03:36.510> with<00:03:36.720> Wii<00:03:37.290> Remote

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
last couple of weeks with Wii Remote

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.380 
last couple of weeks with Wii Remote
sniping<00:03:37.920> as<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.310> see<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.550> lot<00:03:38.760> more<00:03:38.790> people<00:03:39.209> using

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
sniping as I see a lot more people using

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.870 
sniping as I see a lot more people using
the<00:03:39.570> Wii<00:03:39.690> Remote<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.140> snipe<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.730> can

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
the Wii Remote to snipe is that you can

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.180 
the Wii Remote to snipe is that you can
actually<00:03:42.239> attach<00:03:42.540> an<00:03:42.750> ACOG<00:03:43.200> scope<00:03:43.560> onto<00:03:44.160> a

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
actually attach an ACOG scope onto a

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.920 
actually attach an ACOG scope onto a
onto<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.209> know<00:03:45.330> any<00:03:46.160> sniper<00:03:47.160> rifle<00:03:47.580> and

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
onto it you know any sniper rifle and

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.530 
onto it you know any sniper rifle and
basically<00:03:48.930> turn<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.560> on<00:03:49.680> aim<00:03:49.830> assist<00:03:49.980> and

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
basically turn it on aim assist and

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.370 
basically turn it on aim assist and
basically<00:03:51.540> all<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.750> have<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.930> do<00:03:52.050> is<00:03:52.230> use

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
basically all I have to do is use

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.620 
basically all I have to do is use
quick-draw<00:03:52.769> zoom<00:03:53.130> in<00:03:53.340> hit<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.120> hit<00:03:54.450> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
quick-draw zoom in hit the hit the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.600 
quick-draw zoom in hit the hit the
trigger<00:03:54.840> really<00:03:55.170> quick<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.650> basically<00:03:56.400> it's

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
trigger really quick and basically it's

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.280 
trigger really quick and basically it's
like<00:03:56.730> an<00:03:56.820> automatic<00:03:56.970> kill<00:03:57.570> it's<00:03:57.810> it's<00:03:58.050> that

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
like an automatic kill it's it's that

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.960 
like an automatic kill it's it's that
quick<00:03:58.500> because<00:03:58.860> of<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.160> quick<00:03:59.370> scoping<00:03:59.790> and

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
quick because of the quick scoping and

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.949 
quick because of the quick scoping and
all<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.180> stuff

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
all that stuff

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.660 
all that stuff
whereas<00:04:01.380> in<00:04:01.530> black<00:04:01.709> ops<00:04:01.950> if<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.250> tried<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.550> do

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
whereas in black ops if you tried to do

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.009 
whereas in black ops if you tried to do
that<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.060> know<00:04:03.180> since<00:04:03.360> there<00:04:03.540> was<00:04:03.690> no<00:04:03.810> quick

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
that you know since there was no quick

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.720 
that you know since there was no quick
scoping<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.950> want<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.160> really<00:04:05.310> get<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> kill

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
scoping you want to really get a kill

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.910 
scoping you want to really get a kill
but<00:04:05.910> since<00:04:06.120> there's<00:04:06.300> quick<00:04:06.510> draw<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.739> aim

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
but since there's quick draw the aim

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.940 
but since there's quick draw the aim
assist<00:04:08.130> ACOG<00:04:08.880> we<00:04:09.750> were<00:04:09.870> most<00:04:10.049> knifing<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.650> is

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
assist ACOG we were most knifing is is

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.060 
assist ACOG we were most knifing is is
kind<00:04:11.280> of<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.820> guess<00:04:12.420> not<00:04:13.110> really<00:04:13.170> taking<00:04:13.709> over<00:04:14.040> I

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
kind of I guess not really taking over I

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.250 
kind of I guess not really taking over I
wouldn't<00:04:14.340> say<00:04:14.580> that<00:04:14.760> it's<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.540> would<00:04:16.080> say

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
wouldn't say that it's the I would say

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.190 
wouldn't say that it's the I would say
it's<00:04:16.380> more<00:04:16.470> evening<00:04:17.100> out<00:04:17.340> now<00:04:17.729> with<00:04:18.200> classic

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
it's more evening out now with classic

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.659 
it's more evening out now with classic
controller<00:04:19.410> snipers<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.190> we<00:04:20.400> were<00:04:20.489> most

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
controller snipers and we were most

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.670 
controller snipers and we were most
nieghbors<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:22.020> little<00:04:22.229> bit<00:04:22.350> easier<00:04:22.620> to

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
nieghbors it's a little bit easier to

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.409 
nieghbors it's a little bit easier to
snipe<00:04:22.950> with<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.190> Wii<00:04:23.310> Remote<00:04:23.550> now<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.330> it

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
snipe with the Wii Remote now that it

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.530 
snipe with the Wii Remote now that it
was<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:24.720> black<00:04:24.930> ops<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.700> basically

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
was in black ops and basically

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.060 
was in black ops and basically
however<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:27.870> wanted<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.440> get<00:04:28.860> your<00:04:28.950> guy's

braids<00:04:41.280> onto<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.670> enemy<00:04:41.820> even<00:04:42.000> if<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.360> don't

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
braids onto the enemy even if you don't

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.080 
braids onto the enemy even if you don't
see<00:04:42.720> them<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.050> it's<00:04:43.620> basically<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.400> think<00:04:44.580> my

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
see them and it's basically I think my

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.620 
see them and it's basically I think my
friend<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.810> K<00:04:46.020> equals<00:04:46.470> win<00:04:47.240> brought<00:04:48.240> up<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.510> me

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
friend a K equals win brought up to me

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.450 
friend a K equals win brought up to me
that<00:04:48.660> it's<00:04:48.870> basically<00:04:49.170> like<00:04:49.470> an<00:04:49.740> aimbot<00:04:50.040> for<00:04:50.430> a

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
that it's basically like an aimbot for a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.760 
that it's basically like an aimbot for a
split<00:04:50.730> second<00:04:51.210> because<00:04:52.110> as<00:04:52.260> soon<00:04:52.350> as<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.590> quit

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
split second because as soon as you quit

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.520 
split second because as soon as you quit
as<00:04:52.950> soon<00:04:53.010> as<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.400> zoom<00:04:53.700> in<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.510> locks<00:04:55.260> right

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
as soon as you zoom in it locks right

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.720 
as soon as you zoom in it locks right
onto<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.830> enemy<00:04:55.980> and<00:04:56.160> with<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.340> little<00:04:56.460> bit<00:04:56.580> of

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
onto the enemy and with a little bit of

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.350 
onto the enemy and with a little bit of
practice<00:04:56.990> you<00:04:57.990> could<00:04:58.140> easily<00:04:58.290> you<00:04:58.830> know<00:04:59.360> take

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
practice you could easily you know take

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.080 
practice you could easily you know take
out<00:05:00.540> an<00:05:00.690> enemy<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:02.370> know<00:05:02.460> even<00:05:02.700> if<00:05:02.790> you<00:05:02.880> didn't

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
out an enemy you know even if you didn't

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.360 
out an enemy you know even if you didn't
see<00:05:03.210> him<00:05:03.330> it's<00:05:03.540> basically<00:05:03.900> like<00:05:04.170> not<00:05:05.100> really

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
see him it's basically like not really

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.040 
see him it's basically like not really
that<00:05:05.490> much<00:05:05.700> skill<00:05:05.940> involved<00:05:06.360> but<00:05:06.540> that's<00:05:06.900> a

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
that much skill involved but that's a

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.630 
that much skill involved but that's a
whole<00:05:07.140> different<00:05:07.200> story<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.770> think<00:05:08.100> in<00:05:08.430> my

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
whole different story I think in my

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.090 
whole different story I think in my
opinion<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.240> ACOG<00:05:09.660> aim-assist<00:05:09.900> we<00:05:10.650> with<00:05:10.980> the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
opinion the ACOG aim-assist we with the

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.180 
opinion the ACOG aim-assist we with the
Wii<00:05:11.220> Remote<00:05:11.490> is<00:05:11.670> is<00:05:12.060> uh<00:05:12.540> it's<00:05:13.410> not<00:05:13.590> overpowered

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
Wii Remote is is uh it's not overpowered

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.120 
Wii Remote is is uh it's not overpowered
it's<00:05:14.310> not<00:05:14.460> that<00:05:15.120> bad<00:05:15.360> but<00:05:15.720> I<00:05:16.020> think<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:16.950> does

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
it's not that bad but I think it does

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.190 
it's not that bad but I think it does
even<00:05:17.340> out<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:18.120> classic<00:05:18.630> controller<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.140> the

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
even out the classic controller and the

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.540 
even out the classic controller and the
we<00:05:19.290> were<00:05:19.380> most<00:05:19.560> sniping<00:05:19.860> a<00:05:19.920> little<00:05:20.130> better<00:05:20.250> it

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
we were most sniping a little better it

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.280 
we were most sniping a little better it
does<00:05:20.970> give<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.300> Wii<00:05:21.390> Remote<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.720> little<00:05:22.020> bit<00:05:22.140> of

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
does give the Wii Remote a little bit of

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.800 
does give the Wii Remote a little bit of
an<00:05:22.470> advantage<00:05:23.010> when<00:05:23.310> sniping<00:05:23.760> that<00:05:24.690> the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
an advantage when sniping that the

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.210 
an advantage when sniping that the
classic<00:05:25.170> controller<00:05:25.380> doesn't<00:05:25.800> have<00:05:25.920> but

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
classic controller doesn't have but

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.220 
classic controller doesn't have but
obviously<00:05:26.670> the<00:05:26.850> classic<00:05:27.000> controller<00:05:27.420> you

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
obviously the classic controller you

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.350 
obviously the classic controller you
know<00:05:28.320> has<00:05:28.500> smoother<00:05:29.010> has<00:05:29.910> a<00:05:29.940> lot<00:05:30.150> better

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
know has smoother has a lot better

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.850 
know has smoother has a lot better
controls<00:05:30.810> when<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.080> comes<00:05:31.230> down<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.500> regular

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
controls when it comes down the regular

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.400 
controls when it comes down the regular
scope<00:05:32.790> sniping<00:05:33.330> so<00:05:33.930> you<00:05:33.990> know<00:05:34.230> there's

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
scope sniping so you know there's

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.510 
scope sniping so you know there's
there's<00:05:34.740> pros<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.010> cons<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.490> both

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
there's pros and cons to both

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.710 
there's pros and cons to both
controllers<00:05:36.060> when<00:05:36.300> it<00:05:36.390> comes<00:05:36.540> down<00:05:36.660> to
