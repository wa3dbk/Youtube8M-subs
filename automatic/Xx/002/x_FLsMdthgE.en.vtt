 push meeting 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.400
 yes that in such a situation will be 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.960
 produce incomprehensible 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.150
 the first time such I see dear friends 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.100
 I've never seen anything like that 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.799
 coaches could not stand 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.049
 not to mention the players the whole team 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.920
 from the field goes to the podium and 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.840
 the room goes to the locker room 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.220
 I wonder what will happen next what 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.159
 the decision will be made that of course 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.159
 something incredible where it all started not 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.659
 clear on java bench artem tire socks in 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.619
 the last time I saw him we have to 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.420
 mecca for spare 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.700
 with some of the players and steel fights 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.720
 and actually flow seemingly episode 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.540
 has already been completed 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.160
 but then the polygraph was stopped 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.610
 already called example 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.760
 tank itself the main arbitrators and after that 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.190
 already coaches head coaches started 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.760
 sort things out and i'm not really 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:36.770
 I understand how it all began and what 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.370
 became the cause of such aggression with 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.060
 sides of both teams it is clear that at stake 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.130
 reaching the final at stake is very 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.260
 today's high standoff but 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.460
 to care about this, I came this 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.460

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.420
 Places now see Andrew Razin 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.140

 of course you need to do something 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.340
 law enforcement because 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.850
 here it is impossible for the teams to start 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.830
 mass brawl is of course something 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.700

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.710

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.270

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.560
