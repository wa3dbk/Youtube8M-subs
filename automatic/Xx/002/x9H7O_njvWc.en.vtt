you're<00:05:11.280> at<00:05:11.400> nine<00:05:11.580> minutes<00:05:12.060> because<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.360> know

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
you're at nine minutes because you know

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
this I might be able to do it but that

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:29.780 
this I might be able to do it but that
it<00:05:17.160> wasn't<00:05:17.400> more<00:05:17.880> than<00:05:17.910> a<00:05:18.030> minute<00:05:28.430> you<00:05:29.430> have<00:05:29.580> 30

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
right now I feel like whoever invented

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.170 
right now I feel like whoever invented
this<00:05:55.080> was<00:05:55.320> like<00:05:55.470> their<00:05:55.770> theory<00:05:56.640> was<00:05:56.670> slightly

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
this was like their theory was slightly

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.290 
this was like their theory was slightly
flawed<00:05:57.450> because<00:05:57.750> it<00:05:58.200> could<00:05:58.380> have<00:05:58.470> happened<00:05:58.890> if

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
flawed because it could have happened if

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.550 
flawed because it could have happened if
it's<00:06:00.300> just<00:06:00.540> a<00:06:00.690> matter<00:06:00.930> of<00:06:01.050> your<00:06:01.290> esophagus

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
it's just a matter of your esophagus

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.610 
it's just a matter of your esophagus
