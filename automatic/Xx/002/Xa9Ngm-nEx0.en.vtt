Trek London so if you're there and you
find<00:00:09.179> me<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.389> might<00:00:09.719> still<00:00:09.870> have<00:00:10.050> one<00:00:10.200> free<00:00:10.410> for

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
find me I might still have one free for

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.620 
find me I might still have one free for
you<00:00:10.710> first<00:00:11.580> there's<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.000> quick<00:00:12.179> little<00:00:12.330> time

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
you first there's a quick little time

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.999 
you first there's a quick little time
lapse<00:00:12.870> here<00:00:13.110> where<00:00:13.469> I'm<00:00:13.559> going<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.769> describe

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
lapse here where I'm going to describe

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.440 
lapse here where I'm going to describe
exactly<00:00:14.280> how<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.639> put<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.940> together<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
exactly how I put it together and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.420 
exactly how I put it together and
hopefully<00:00:16.230> demonstrate<00:00:16.830> why<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.010> would<00:00:17.250> still

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
hopefully demonstrate why I would still

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.620 
hopefully demonstrate why I would still
like<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:17.910> bit<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.090> donation<00:00:18.480> if

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
like a little bit of donation if

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.700 
like a little bit of donation if
possible<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.490> video<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.820> recorded<00:00:21.060> with

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
possible so this video is recorded with

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.179 
possible so this video is recorded with
10<00:00:22.710> seconds<00:00:23.220> per<00:00:23.490> frame<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.619> still<00:00:25.619> 25<00:00:26.010> frames

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
10 seconds per frame and still 25 frames

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.560 
10 seconds per frame and still 25 frames
per<00:00:26.310> second<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.000> obviously<00:00:27.090> whizzing

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
per second so this is obviously whizzing

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.150 
per second so this is obviously whizzing
through<00:00:27.720> time<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.260> see<00:00:28.830> me<00:00:28.949> taking

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
through time here see me taking

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.769 
through time here see me taking
everything<00:00:29.400> apart<00:00:29.580> testing<00:00:30.269> things<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.660> my

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
everything apart testing things with my

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.359 
everything apart testing things with my
mp3<00:00:31.140> player<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.470> make<00:00:31.590> sure<00:00:31.740> I've<00:00:31.830> wide<00:00:32.070> things

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
mp3 player to make sure I've wide things

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.180 
mp3 player to make sure I've wide things
up<00:00:32.520> properly<00:00:33.140> using<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.260> pizza<00:00:34.440> boxes<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> lid

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
up properly using a pizza boxes the lid

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.490 
up properly using a pizza boxes the lid
there<00:00:35.430> because<00:00:35.850> I've<00:00:36.000> got<00:00:36.210> no<00:00:36.420> nothing<00:00:37.410> else

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
there because I've got no nothing else

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500 
there because I've got no nothing else
to<00:00:37.590> protect<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.920> table<00:00:38.219> after<00:00:38.460> use<00:00:38.850> my<00:00:39.030> face

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
to protect the table after use my face

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.780 
to protect the table after use my face
in<00:00:39.750> order<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> use<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> multimeter<00:00:41.250> properly

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
in order to use the multimeter properly

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.010 
in order to use the multimeter properly
as<00:00:41.850> i'm<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.300> equipment<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> hold<00:00:42.870> things

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
as i'm going to equipment to hold things

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.340 
as i'm going to equipment to hold things
down<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:45.180> begin<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.690> project<00:00:46.110> i<00:00:46.200> was

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
down to begin with this project i was

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.630 
down to begin with this project i was
trying<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> make<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.250> i<00:00:47.280> could<00:00:47.430> integrate

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
trying to make it so i could integrate

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.700 
trying to make it so i could integrate
the<00:00:47.940> original<00:00:48.360> combat<00:00:48.750> circuitry<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the original combat circuitry so that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
the original combat circuitry so that
when<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> tap<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.430> button<00:00:50.719> it<00:00:51.719> would<00:00:51.960> still

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
when you tap the button it would still

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.619 
when you tap the button it would still
chirp<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.190> beep<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.879> were<00:00:54.030> trying<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
chirp and beep like you were trying to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.170 
chirp and beep like you were trying to
make<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.809> Hail<00:00:55.520> which<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.640> why<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> beginning

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
make a Hail which is why the beginning

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.549 
make a Hail which is why the beginning
this<00:00:57.239> video<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.690> focusing<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.199> around<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
this video is focusing all around that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.410 
this video is focusing all around that
however<00:00:58.859> unfortunately<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.030> wasn't

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
however unfortunately it just wasn't

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
however unfortunately it just wasn't
possible<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> circuitry<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.680> comes

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
possible with the circuitry that comes

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280 
possible with the circuitry that comes
in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> default<00:01:02.969> toy<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> lot<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
in the default toy so a lot the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.920 
in the default toy so a lot the
beginning<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> wasted<00:01:05.700> time<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
beginning of this was a wasted time so

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
beginning of this was a wasted time so
measuring<00:01:07.320> everything<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.860> lots<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.670> lots<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
measuring everything up lots and lots of

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.850 
measuring everything up lots and lots of
multimedia<00:01:09.299> testing<00:01:09.900> quite<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> bit<00:01:10.770> of

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
multimedia testing quite a bit of

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.109 
multimedia testing quite a bit of
frustration<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.400> well<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:11.700> things<00:01:11.909> start<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
frustration as well as things start to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.719 
frustration as well as things start to
peel<00:01:12.330> apart<00:01:12.479> its<00:01:13.110> videos<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.530> three<00:01:13.770> pieces<00:01:14.189> so

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
peel apart its videos in three pieces so

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.310 
peel apart its videos in three pieces so
you<00:01:14.790> may<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.270> little<00:01:15.479> change<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.080> in

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
you may see a little change in in

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.219 
you may see a little change in in
orientation<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.130> camera<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.869> I<00:01:18.869> ended<00:01:19.110> up

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
orientation of the camera so I ended up

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.740 
orientation of the camera so I ended up
taking<00:01:19.950> apart<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.580> bluetooth<00:01:20.939> headsets<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.630> do

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
taking apart to bluetooth headsets to do

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.120 
taking apart to bluetooth headsets to do
some<00:01:21.900> testing<00:01:22.290> rewiring<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.450> power<00:01:24.890> slot<00:01:25.890> so

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
some testing rewiring the power slot so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.560 
some testing rewiring the power slot so
that<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> more<00:01:27.150> easily

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that it will be in the more easily

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.510 
that it will be in the more easily
locatable<00:01:28.020> position<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.560> finally<00:01:29.220> found<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
locatable position I finally found a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.340 
locatable position I finally found a
cutting<00:01:29.759> board<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.119> bit<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.259> going

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
cutting board for this bit so just going

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.690 
cutting board for this bit so just going
to<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.500> finishing<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> off<00:01:32.070> doing<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.520> last

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
to be finishing it off doing the last

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
to be finishing it off doing the last
test<00:01:32.939> adding<00:01:33.329> some<00:01:33.509> heat-shrink<00:01:33.810> around<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
test adding some heat-shrink around the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
for a 3.5 mil Jack so you can plug in

whatever<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.789> want<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:10.660> doesn't<00:02:10.720> come<00:02:11.019> out<00:02:11.080> in

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
whatever you want it doesn't come out in

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.930 
whatever you want it doesn't come out in
stereo<00:02:11.560> it's<00:02:11.769> only<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.220> left<00:02:12.430> channel<00:02:12.670> I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.240 
stereo it's only the left channel I
believe<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:14.019> there's<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.560> limitation<00:02:14.950> there

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
believe so there's a limitation there

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.780 
believe so there's a limitation there
but<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.670> does<00:02:15.819> give<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.030> some<00:02:16.180> flexibility<00:02:16.750> as

earpiece the microphone is just here and
just<00:03:57.920> two<00:03:58.040> tests<00:03:58.280> show<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:58.489> it<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:59.110> that

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
just two tests show that it is that
