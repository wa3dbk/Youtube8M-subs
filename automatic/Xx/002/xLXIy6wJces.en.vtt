00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.539
 all the gameplay 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.370
 I'm afraid gentlemen notice them in this 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.340

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.659

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.440

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.490
 I'll tell you, I'm bad for this game 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.680

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.680

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.060
 and well they killed her and we changed a 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.060
 little bit 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.860
 Oh, I can not kill good, so bad 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.040
 that 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.230
 And there was not the other thing is that I'm from 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.920
 those are not you the space you are 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.310
 there are people who have nothing more or two 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.290
 shots and and already and they start to recharge 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.480
 as they say and now they have as I say 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.730
 gun means he has about 12 bullets 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.790
 followed and do not want to recharge that you 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:06.379
 They are scary so I am 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:08.439
 well there is in fact that I had given him a 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.439
 assistance 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.630

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.490
 country and my text I worry 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.870
 I tell you in this game I'm not good at all 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.870
 but much 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.260
 this is the matter matter matters not 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.260
 import 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.800
 ay bothers me that I realized what 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.650
 that I did without wanting or that was stung like 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.730
 months but one stepped on the button this 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.730
 ugly pig button 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.819
 to see your leather upstairs while I 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.590
 I cover that you do not worry because the 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.590
 covers bad assets 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.590
 Oh what lies good attendance 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.440
 I want the gameplay to go well 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.239
 the ball 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.470
 and suburb 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.420
 hey he does not keep killing anything just killed 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.609
 the 15th principle and that's where the 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.859
 gameplay now it's over the fun the 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.410
 gameplay here is one that maybe wants 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.110
 be a subscriber that I did not find it like that 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.840
 that I walk away 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.280
 I saw that the pistolite can also kill 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.160
 of some killed one with the pistolita 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.280
 the district is faster to shoot 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.310
 they gave 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.940
 but well with months but there are also 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:43.980
 red cases like getting the good zoom in there 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.980
 is one of the campers or the jacket 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.390

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.990

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.710

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.710

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.849
 there he did not see me as a means 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:25.400
 and they saw what a ripple with one killed that other 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.789
 time to the walls or that deepens are a 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.789
 falsehood 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:37.810

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.810
