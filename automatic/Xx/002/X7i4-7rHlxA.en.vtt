00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.700
 looking for a lighthouse in these streets 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.639
 gloomy I want to think that I never 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.940
 I'll look for a lighthouse in these streets 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:27.330
 gloomy I want to think that I never 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:29.699
 I surrendered to these streets they know well what 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.279
 I had a hard time parking vices and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.930
 face determined to power by little 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.140
 I was forever hung in that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.570
 shit but pride will keep me from 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.239
 lose those bastards are not going to see me 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.399
 accepting injustice not wanting drugs 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.710
 but impunity unsettles me driving me mad 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.140
 would do more to think how to hurt them more what 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.719
 I swear if they wanted to anesthetize me when 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.210
 fight hard before they could send me to the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.820
 shop other things today if I go it will be for 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.340
 combat this disgusting tyranny 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.829
 bars are going to dine me 7 say something 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.540
 because trampled hold the micro 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.000
 when I record if you get tired 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.310
 showcases manufacturing surface 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.070
 like a spray they decorate the walls with 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.590
 truths a phrase of lenin that wall me 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.380
 happy today through my veins runs blood 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.600
 red and not absinthe does not suck a 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.420
 feeling that I lie to you I do not want a 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.460
 sincere happiness cleaning my head 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.040
 someone said between laughs that we 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.770
 would come out of the forest that is already rotten 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.320
 view them while I enjoy until this 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.270
 cloaca seems sometimes cozy when 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.619
 it's time to be who of himself 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.240
 falls in love 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.820
 there will be no worm that can prevent me 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.789
 will take apple and feed them many 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.490
 goods combines 10 and healthy almost swallow 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.399
 militate these darn daring streets 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 food forever I would leave you 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.400
 I would like to be the most positive but as 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.890
 always reasons to lose joy 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.380
 I have to clean the mud of my mind 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.320
 to run lighter and feel something 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.930
 different I feel like a lion in a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.930
 elevator but the early morning silence 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.330
 whispers only sends in our streets what 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.950
 that cost me does not light the fire at 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.200
 that are full of mansions of 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.850
 guilty confused friendship with this the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.160
 heaven if I say goodbye it's not until then 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.360
 so low I do not arrive as by scum 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.280
 kill myself 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.710
 When I'm a coward I do not give lessons to 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.810
 who are not but walking stones 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.760
 they want to give them to our heart, not what 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.580
 we will allow our facts will be the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.280
 defense that leaves we see ourselves collapsed 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.320
 before the intense nobody who thinks like 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.209
 annihilate enemies friendship 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.640
 beggars do it I leave me what 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.310
 dear we will put these senses not 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.500
 they pull the head ticks do not feel 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.110
 the skin for having cuffs I follow three 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.970
 threats of fascism this is so strong 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.040
 that can not stop him or death 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.720
 now insurgents always my mind 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.030
 shoals eliminates no longer lies with 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.130
 amphetamines the adrenaline will be routine if 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.260
 my forces are united 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.780
 these dark streets are not going to turn off the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.920
 torch that one day your head will learn 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.920
 with allergy is red
