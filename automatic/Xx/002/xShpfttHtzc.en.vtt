00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.469 

now<00:06:41.940> you<00:06:42.000> can<00:06:42.270> see<00:06:42.479> that<00:06:42.630> the<00:06:42.750> walls<00:06:43.220> are<00:06:44.220> not

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
now you can see that the walls are not

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.140 
now you can see that the walls are not
curving<00:06:45.479> that<00:06:46.470> all<00:06:46.830> the<00:06:46.979> sides<00:06:47.220> are<00:06:47.610> going<00:06:48.000> up

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
curving that all the sides are going up

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.560 
curving that all the sides are going up
more<00:06:48.510> or<00:06:48.600> less<00:06:48.750> straight<00:06:49.020> so<00:06:49.650> when<00:06:49.919> we<00:06:50.570> hang

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
more or less straight so when we hang

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.629 
more or less straight so when we hang
this<00:06:52.169> part<00:06:52.530> done

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
this part done

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.390 
this part done
we're<00:06:54.570> gaining<00:06:54.780> a<00:06:55.199> lot<00:06:55.440> of<00:06:55.560> room<00:06:55.740> that<00:06:55.949> we

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
we're gaining a lot of room that we

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.230 
we're gaining a lot of room that we
didn't<00:06:56.699> have<00:06:56.850> before

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
didn't have before

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.219 
didn't have before
so<00:06:57.810> now<00:06:57.990> I<00:06:58.229> wouldn't<00:06:58.620> guide<00:06:59.280> out<00:06:59.520> and<00:06:59.910> put<00:07:00.229> this

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
so now I wouldn't guide out and put this

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:06.230 
so now I wouldn't guide out and put this
meat<00:07:01.650> guy<00:07:02.460> out<00:07:02.639> points<00:07:02.669> in<00:07:03.860> not<00:07:04.860> big<00:07:05.190> shape<00:07:05.580> is

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
meat guy out points in not big shape is

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:14.270 
meat guy out points in not big shape is
now<00:07:10.250> that's<00:07:11.250> it<00:07:11.520> was<00:07:11.729> that<00:07:11.880> simple
