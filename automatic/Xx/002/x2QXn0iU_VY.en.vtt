00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.000
 as good as the latency 3 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.610
 and the good is but really only a player the man can with one 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.810
 Player two decks tax 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.610
 when a question I know that so 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.670

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.929
 is something new and only in conjunction with the driver 7 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:53.229
 Pauli still knows that from a censored FX data like Robinson effect

 4 7 integrated and candidate stretches 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.099
 on the controller control 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.289
 if that is nothing 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.759
