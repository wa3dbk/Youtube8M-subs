for<00:00:18.090> me<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.240> think<00:00:18.420> there's<00:00:18.930> uh<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.590> think<00:00:20.310> he's

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
for me I think there's uh I think he's

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.580 
for me I think there's uh I think he's
ready<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.880> debut<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.330> think<00:00:21.960> there's<00:00:22.170> been<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
ready to debut I think there's been a

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.099 
ready to debut I think there's been a
lot<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.830> silence<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.580> think<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.109> just

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
lot of silence and I think the just

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.870 
lot of silence and I think the just
everything's<00:00:25.619> blown<00:00:25.890> over<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> fact<00:00:26.730> that

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
everything's blown over to the fact that

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.609 
everything's blown over to the fact that
everyone<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.019> rumors<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:28.470> been<00:00:28.560> running

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
everyone the rumors have been running

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.259 
everyone the rumors have been running
rampant<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.429> now<00:00:29.550> they've<00:00:29.760> kind<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.060> slowed

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
rampant but now they've kind of slowed

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.510 
rampant but now they've kind of slowed
down<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.510> think<00:00:30.750> now<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> time<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.710> I

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
down I think now is the time that I

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.670 
down I think now is the time that I
guess<00:00:32.700> sting<00:00:33.149> kind<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.660> thought<00:00:34.110> about<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.559> you
