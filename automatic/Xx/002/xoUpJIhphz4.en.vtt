its travel it closes the intake valve

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.660 
its travel it closes the intake valve
and<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.360> starts<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.960> open<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.040> discharge

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670

valve piston comes up compresses and now

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.630 
valve piston comes up compresses and now
the<00:01:23.250> cycle<00:01:23.850> repeats<00:01:24.240> itself<00:01:25.400> what<00:01:26.400> one
