00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
the talk i talked about how to analyze

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.970 
the talk i talked about how to analyze
these<00:00:14.830> top<00:00:15.160> floor<00:00:15.460> cards<00:00:15.969> okay<00:00:16.630> and<00:00:16.920> i<00:00:17.920> gave

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
these top floor cards okay and i gave

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.130 
these top floor cards okay and i gave
you<00:00:18.340> some<00:00:18.610> ideas<00:00:19.000> using<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.480> elements<00:00:19.960> and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
you some ideas using the elements and

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.630 
you some ideas using the elements and
the<00:00:20.259> relationship<00:00:20.800> for<00:00:21.040> the<00:00:21.070> height<00:00:21.310> of<00:00:21.340> the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
the relationship for the height of the

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.179 
the relationship for the height of the
cloud<00:00:21.849> as<00:00:22.060> well<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:23.320> thing<00:00:23.560> you<00:00:23.770> may<00:00:23.919> want<00:00:23.950> to

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
cloud as well one thing you may want to

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.580 
cloud as well one thing you may want to
noticed<00:00:24.730> is<00:00:25.029> that<00:00:25.090> i<00:00:25.390> didn't<00:00:25.869> actually<00:00:26.020> talked

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
noticed is that i didn't actually talked

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.440 
noticed is that i didn't actually talked
about<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:27.040> orientation<00:00:27.700> of<00:00:27.759> the<00:00:27.820> cars<00:00:28.119> in

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
about the orientation of the cars in

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.389 
about the orientation of the cars in
this<00:00:29.079> one<00:00:29.259> here<00:00:29.439> that<00:00:29.529> all<00:00:29.739> is<00:00:29.919> the<00:00:30.040> right<00:00:30.220> way

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
this one here that all is the right way

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.900 
this one here that all is the right way
up<00:00:31.110> while<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:33.030> strength<00:00:34.030> card<00:00:34.300> is<00:00:34.480> reversed

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
up while the strength card is reversed

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.079 
up while the strength card is reversed
the<00:00:36.910> summer<00:00:37.780> cup<00:00:38.019> the<00:00:38.199> balls<00:00:38.379> is<00:00:38.649> reversed

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.089 
the summer cup the balls is reversed

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.240 
the summer cup the balls is reversed
while<00:00:40.089> the<00:00:40.359> devil<00:00:40.750> card<00:00:41.019> is<00:00:41.469> the<00:00:41.649> right<00:00:41.859> way<00:00:42.039> up

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
while the devil card is the right way up

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.479 
while the devil card is the right way up
they<00:00:43.030> didn't<00:00:43.870> place<00:00:44.289> any<00:00:44.499> importance<00:00:45.129> on<00:00:45.339> them

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
they didn't place any importance on them

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.560 
they didn't place any importance on them
at<00:00:45.579> all<00:00:46.140> spends<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.739> reason<00:00:48.129> is<00:00:48.309> is<00:00:49.179> that

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
at all spends the reason is is that

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.729 
at all spends the reason is is that
using<00:00:50.260> this<00:00:50.409> system<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:52.109> weather<00:00:53.109> Accardo<00:00:53.589> is

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
using this system the weather Accardo is

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.459 
using this system the weather Accardo is
reversed<00:00:54.190> or<00:00:54.999> the<00:00:55.179> right<00:00:55.359> way<00:00:55.539> up<00:00:55.749> is<00:00:55.960> not<00:00:56.230> as

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
reversed or the right way up is not as

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.069 
reversed or the right way up is not as
important<00:00:57.129> as<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:58.269> relationships<00:00:58.899> between

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
important as the relationships between

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.660 
important as the relationships between
it<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.829> other<00:00:59.949> cards<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.760> almonds

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it and the other cards and the almonds

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.270 
it and the other cards and the almonds
if<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.909> had<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.379> more<00:01:05.590> important<00:01:06.100> if<00:01:06.159> you're

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
if you had it's more important if you're

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.740 
if you had it's more important if you're
doing<00:01:06.460> positional<00:01:06.970> spread<00:01:07.240> because<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.690> a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
doing positional spread because of a

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.020 
doing positional spread because of a
positional<00:01:08.200> spread<00:01:08.500> you<00:01:09.130> have<00:01:09.280> just<00:01:09.430> one<00:01:09.670> card

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
positional spread you have just one card

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.750 
positional spread you have just one card
on<00:01:10.240> one<00:01:10.450> position<00:01:10.960> they<00:01:11.800> get<00:01:12.010> one<00:01:12.190> card<00:01:12.490> in<00:01:12.580> one

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
on one position they get one card in one

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.110 
on one position they get one card in one
position<00:01:13.230> it<00:01:14.230> means<00:01:14.530> that<00:01:14.760> there's<00:01:15.760> only<00:01:15.910> one

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
position it means that there's only one

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.340 
position it means that there's only one
way<00:01:16.300> you<00:01:16.360> can<00:01:16.480> see<00:01:16.690> it<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.870> can<00:01:16.900> understate

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
way you can see it you can understate

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.270 
way you can see it you can understate
that<00:01:17.560> way<00:01:17.680> up<00:01:17.800> well<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.850> way<00:01:19.060> up<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:20.280> because

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
that way up well that way up and because

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.100 
that way up well that way up and because
of<00:01:21.310> this<00:01:21.490> everything<00:01:22.270> else<00:01:22.420> around<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:22.810> is<00:01:22.960> on

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
of this everything else around it is on

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.830 
of this everything else around it is on
its<00:01:23.530> on<00:01:23.650> its<00:01:23.800> own<00:01:24.010> its<00:01:24.760> way<00:01:24.970> up<00:01:25.000> all<00:01:25.390> this<00:01:25.630> way

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
its on its own its way up all this way

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.390 
its on its own its way up all this way
our<00:01:26.020> victim<00:01:26.380> was<00:01:26.440> very<00:01:26.800> important<00:01:27.370> because

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
our victim was very important because

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.310 
our victim was very important because
it's<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:27.880> only<00:01:27.910> reference<00:01:28.210> do<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:28.720> have<00:01:28.930> I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
it's the only reference do you have I

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.070 
it's the only reference do you have I
don't<00:01:29.980> have<00:01:30.160> that<00:01:30.220> problem<00:01:30.580> in<00:01:31.450> this<00:01:31.780> spread

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
don't have that problem in this spread

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.650 
don't have that problem in this spread
because<00:01:32.260> when<00:01:33.160> I<00:01:33.190> read<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.580> cards<00:01:34.000> I'm

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
because when I read the cards I'm

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.630 
because when I read the cards I'm
reading<00:01:35.110> them<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:37.150> a<00:01:37.210> sequence<00:01:37.720> like<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
reading them in a sequence like this

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.620 
reading them in a sequence like this
okay<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:41.170> in<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.440> sequence<00:01:42.030> these<00:01:43.030> positions

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
okay so in a sequence these positions

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.770 
okay so in a sequence these positions
didn't<00:01:44.050> mean<00:01:44.620> as<00:01:44.860> much<00:01:44.890> as<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:45.490> might<00:01:45.640> think

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
didn't mean as much as you might think

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.270 
didn't mean as much as you might think
and<00:01:46.780> something<00:01:47.170> else<00:01:47.290> that<00:01:47.560> happens<00:01:47.950> when<00:01:48.130> you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
and something else that happens when you

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.310 
and something else that happens when you
wouldn't<00:01:48.640> read<00:01:48.760> cars<00:01:49.060> like<00:01:49.330> this<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:50.170> can

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
wouldn't read cars like this you can

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.810 
wouldn't read cars like this you can
actually<00:01:50.470> find<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.220> get<00:01:51.370> a<00:01:51.400> group<00:01:51.640> of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
actually find that you get a group of

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.220 
actually find that you get a group of
cars<00:01:52.120> that<00:01:53.020> are<00:01:53.110> one<00:01:53.290> way<00:01:53.500> or<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:54.010> other<00:01:54.160> and

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
cars that are one way or the other and

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.950 
cars that are one way or the other and
if<00:01:56.230> there's<00:01:56.860> four<00:01:57.070> cards<00:01:57.520> or<00:01:58.120> five<00:01:58.360> cards<00:01:58.810> are

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
if there's four cards or five cards are

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.830 
if there's four cards or five cards are
all<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.140> same<00:01:59.350> orientation<00:02:00.300> to<00:02:01.300> cut<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.690> two

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
all the same orientation to cut the two

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.690 
all the same orientation to cut the two
cultures<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.440> can't<00:02:02.710> in<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:02.980> middle<00:02:03.250> they're

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
cultures you can't in the middle they're

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.670 
cultures you can't in the middle they're
the<00:02:03.880> same<00:02:04.060> orientation<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:05.320> they're<00:02:05.530> the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
the same orientation so they're the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.119 
the same orientation so they're the
right<00:02:05.830> way<00:02:06.040> up<00:02:06.480> in<00:02:07.480> that<00:02:07.750> group<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.319> it's<00:02:08.979> a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
right way up in that group and it's a

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.889 
right way up in that group and it's a
useful<00:02:09.340> we're<00:02:09.640> actually<00:02:09.819> working<00:02:10.239> on<00:02:10.599> see

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
useful we're actually working on see

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.569 
useful we're actually working on see
cards<00:02:11.640> as<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.700> group<00:02:13.170> using<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.579> approach

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
cards as a group using the approach

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.080 
cards as a group using the approach
reversals<00:02:16.269> rather<00:02:17.079> than<00:02:17.439> any<00:02:17.680> other<00:02:17.859> methods

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
reversals rather than any other methods

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.160 
reversals rather than any other methods
in<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.569> case<00:02:19.810> let's<00:02:20.739> have<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> look<00:02:21.959> what<00:02:22.959> do

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
in this case let's have a look what do

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:33.210 
in this case let's have a look what do
your<00:02:23.319> house

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.380 

actually<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.250> lot<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.550> cars<00:02:34.820> here<00:02:35.120> are

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
actually a lot of the cars here are

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.040 
actually a lot of the cars here are
pretty<00:02:35.600> much<00:02:35.870> all<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.320> same<00:02:36.350> way<00:02:36.770> up<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.870> all

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
pretty much all the same way up so all

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.960 
pretty much all the same way up so all
these<00:02:39.140> cars<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.710> see<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.190> his<00:02:40.760> group

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
these cars you see is in his group

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.250 
these cars you see is in his group
together<00:02:41.380> where<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.500> becomes<00:02:42.800> interesting<00:02:43.670> is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
together where it becomes interesting is

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.890 
together where it becomes interesting is
these<00:02:45.260> two<00:02:45.470> cards<00:02:45.860> at<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.040> back<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
these two cards at the back and the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.920 
these two cards at the back and the
princess<00:02:48.290> or<00:02:48.530> cups<00:02:48.830> in<00:02:49.400> Aquinnah<00:02:49.700> cups<00:02:50.060> and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
princess or cups in Aquinnah cups and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.680 
princess or cups in Aquinnah cups and
the<00:02:50.960> queen<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.320> cups<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.770> reversed<00:02:52.210> so<00:02:53.210> we

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
the queen of cups is reversed so we

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.250 
the queen of cups is reversed so we
could<00:02:54.080> say<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.290> there<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.830> some<00:02:55.040> kind<00:02:55.370> of

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
could say that there is some kind of

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.870 
could say that there is some kind of
dissonance<00:02:57.260> between<00:02:57.410> these<00:02:58.010> two<00:02:58.220> cards<00:02:58.730> is

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
dissonance between these two cards is

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.040 
dissonance between these two cards is
that<00:02:59.030> like<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.180> supremes<00:02:59.540> alright<00:02:59.840> we<00:03:00.020> are

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
that like the supremes alright we are

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.290 
that like the supremes alright we are
they<00:03:00.740> did<00:03:00.980> work<00:03:01.190> very<00:03:01.220> well<00:03:01.550> together<00:03:01.880> like

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
they did work very well together like

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.780 
they did work very well together like
peas<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.780> pod<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.560> revised<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.610> some

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
peas in a pod the revised is some

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.030 
peas in a pod the revised is some
difficulties<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.990> only<00:03:06.230> way<00:03:06.380> we<00:03:06.590> could<00:03:06.740> tell

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
difficulties the only way we could tell

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.360 
difficulties the only way we could tell
how<00:03:08.000> those<00:03:08.630> are<00:03:08.840> cars<00:03:09.050> are<00:03:09.260> related<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:10.070> by<00:03:10.310> the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
how those are cars are related is by the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.800 
how those are cars are related is by the
cars<00:03:10.700> underneath<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:12.590> in<00:03:12.770> this<00:03:12.890> case<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.810> you

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
cars underneath and in this case and you

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.250 
cars underneath and in this case and you
have<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.890> take<00:03:16.100> these<00:03:16.310> three<00:03:16.580> constant<00:03:17.260> you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
have to take these three constant you

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.320 
have to take these three constant you
see<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.530> ten<00:03:18.740> of<00:03:18.770> swords<00:03:19.070> there<00:03:19.460> so<00:03:20.210> the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
see the ten of swords there so the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.120 
see the ten of swords there so the
katana<00:03:20.900> swords<00:03:22.210> is<00:03:23.210> the<00:03:23.420> wrong<00:03:23.690> way<00:03:23.990> out<00:03:24.380> to

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
katana swords is the wrong way out to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.480 
katana swords is the wrong way out to
the<00:03:25.160> queen<00:03:25.460> of<00:03:25.490> sauce<00:03:26.800> see<00:03:27.800> you<00:03:27.860> habanero

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
the queen of sauce see you habanero

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.760 
the queen of sauce see you habanero
sauce<00:03:28.790> that's<00:03:29.720> right<00:03:29.960> way<00:03:30.140> up<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.530> queen<00:03:30.740> of

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
sauce that's right way up the queen of

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.640 
sauce that's right way up the queen of
sores<00:03:31.130> is<00:03:31.940> reversed<00:03:32.440> then<00:03:33.440> there's<00:03:33.620> the

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
sores is reversed then there's the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.030 
sores is reversed then there's the
Prince<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.040> cops<00:03:34.990> so<00:03:35.990> she's<00:03:36.500> clearly<00:03:36.800> under

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
Prince of cops so she's clearly under

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.550 
Prince of cops so she's clearly under
some<00:03:37.250> kind<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.610> stress<00:03:37.910> about<00:03:38.660> relationships

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
some kind of stress about relationships

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.560 
some kind of stress about relationships
not<00:03:40.430> quite<00:03:40.700> sure<00:03:40.730> whether<00:03:41.090> she<00:03:41.209> probably

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
not quite sure whether she probably

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.030 
not quite sure whether she probably
wants<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:41.959> end<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.200> all<00:03:42.260> or<00:03:42.530> something<00:03:42.860> like

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
wants to end it all or something like

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.640 
wants to end it all or something like
this<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:43.970> here's<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.750> kind<00:03:44.989> of<00:03:45.080> way<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:45.260> looking

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
this so here's a kind of way of looking

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.590 
this so here's a kind of way of looking
at<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.800> cards<00:03:46.220> that<00:03:46.430> gives<00:03:47.330> you<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.450> lot<00:03:47.540> more

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
at the cards that gives you a lot more

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.500 
at the cards that gives you a lot more
freedom<00:03:48.459> about<00:03:49.459> how<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.790> cars<00:03:50.180> relay

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
freedom about how the cars relay

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.270 
freedom about how the cars relay
together<00:03:50.900> in<00:03:51.230> terms<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.739> groups<00:03:52.010> as<00:03:52.250> a

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
together in terms of groups as a

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.140 
together in terms of groups as a
orientation<00:03:52.959> rather<00:03:53.959> than<00:03:54.260> just<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.560> simple

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
orientation rather than just a simple

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.600 
orientation rather than just a simple
reversed<00:03:56.150> or<00:03:56.690> upright<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:58.100> gets<00:03:58.280> away

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
reversed or upright and it gets away

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.240 
reversed or upright and it gets away
from<00:03:58.640> this<00:03:59.000> idea<00:03:59.209> of<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.230> reverse<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.860> reverse

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
from this idea of the reverse a reverse

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.699 
from this idea of the reverse a reverse
card<00:04:01.580> has<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.760> reverse<00:04:02.060> meaning<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.540> doesn't

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
card has a reverse meaning it doesn't

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.050 
card has a reverse meaning it doesn't
reverse<00:04:03.709> cards<00:04:04.100> simply<00:04:04.459> indicates<00:04:04.790> there's

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
reverse cards simply indicates there's

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.000 
reverse cards simply indicates there's
something<00:04:05.360> different<00:04:05.510> about<00:04:05.780> that<00:04:06.110> card<00:04:06.380> that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
something different about that card that

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.070 
something different about that card that
you<00:04:07.100> need<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:07.400> look<00:04:07.550> at<00:04:07.700> your<00:04:07.820> relationship<00:04:08.450> to

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
you need to look at your relationship to

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.740 
you need to look at your relationship to
all<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.350> other<00:04:09.500> cars<00:04:09.739> around<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:11.480> that's<00:04:11.630> a

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
all the other cars around it so that's a

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.080 
all the other cars around it so that's a
simple<00:04:11.930> tip<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:13.040> it's<00:04:13.160> a<00:04:13.220> much<00:04:13.400> more<00:04:13.580> simpler

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
simple tip and it's a much more simpler

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.449 
simple tip and it's a much more simpler
you<00:04:14.660> see<00:04:14.870> them<00:04:15.050> far<00:04:15.290> more<00:04:15.320> sophisticated<00:04:15.739> way

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
you see them far more sophisticated way

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.610 
you see them far more sophisticated way
of<00:04:16.580> living<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.000> tarot<00:04:17.270> cards<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:18.410> just

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
of living the tarot cards and just

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.609 
of living the tarot cards and just
simple<00:04:19.040> reversals
