00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 story of Luke chapter 1 the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.160
 awakening of the gods in the beginning 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.200
 there was only one large void open 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.880
 He was everywhere and nowhere in 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.370
 this empty two powerful entities 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.529
 appeared who eventually were 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.990
 known as the higher gods 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.180
 bales the creator and human other who 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.939
 combined in 2000 to unequal des 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.920
 one of these halves was a man the wise 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.930
 benign god that was adopted from a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.820
 divine intellect while the trot is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.219
 destroyer was the other half dark 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.110
 these were the two halves of a 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.910
 enigmatic entity alone and although 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.520
 any of them had the ability 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.700
 to act on their own as if 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.770
 they were independent they were not 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.350
 bound by an eternal bond that could not 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.079
 to be broken ever and his destiny was the same 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.600
 nobody knows where those gods came from 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.850
 superiors or if they had always 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.219
 existed and finally awakened from 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.140
 eternal dream but somewhere like 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.750
 along the way they decided to create a 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.059
 universe surely bale will be the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.430
 initiator since he was led by the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.960
 need to create and give life him 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.150
 It was full of power created 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 and he was impatient to be able 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.440
 release it so I walk through the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.380
 existence and began to release their 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.450
 powers him however none of his 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.450
 attempts to create achieved its purpose 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.460
 all his creations were swallowed by 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.550
 the vacuum before they were completed 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.560
 and none survived satrud considered 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.350
 the bale tasks thoughtfully mind 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.440
 human who was very sagas had powers 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.570
 incomparable magicals even more important 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.580
 is the fact that it was driven by a 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.250
 insatiable hunger for knowledge 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.500
 and the enlightenment in its essence he 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.929
 it looked like bales but where bales 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.580
 worked openly and logically the 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.610
 sphere in a way the kingdom of 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.710
 mystery anyway he shared the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.690
 bales interest to the creation while 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.050
 that his dark half of za trot was 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.270
 essentially corruptive 40 a vain god 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.130
 and I was painfully aware that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.860
 his own creative powers were 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.229
 poor because of this he looked at the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.360
 bale work with jealousy and from 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.250
 from the beginning he was determined to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.600
 prevent or corrupt anything from 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.300
 the one that was capable 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.400
 bales that he did not suspect anything asked him the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.230
 help because he had accepted the fact 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.750
 that he could not get the creation 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.500
 alone but of course it is next 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.630
 However, he agreed to help and 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.760
 from this moment humanize two 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.520
 they worked together on the great project of 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.830
 the creation unfortunately its 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.140
 combined efforts failed to achieve 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.360
 effects just like before 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.340
 everything that bales and umÃ¡n created was 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.320
 swallowed by the vacuum as soon as 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.630
 this appeared and the two gods 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.430
 sadly they saw their creation escape 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.550
 of your fingers like water through a sieve 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.770
 on the other hand atrocious he had been 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.410
 looking at his efforts with suspicion he 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.350
 glad the ridicule made his efforts 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.450
 however his rejoicing was changed in 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.610
 surprise and anger when he found that 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.650
 something strange had happened something that 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.500
 maybe humanize them did not wait for 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.120
 themselves to this day nobody knows 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.580
 exactly what happened 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.920
 perhaps the power that had been spent 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.080
 attracted another entity from the vacuum or could 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.240
 be that this simply woke up another 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.950
 divine entity of your dream 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.840
 some even claim that somehow 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.150
 mysterious the power that had been 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.090
 spent by humanizing two really created 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.830
 a new entity independently of 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.260
 what the truth can do a new 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.960
 goddess walked from the void like a mermaid 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.940
 newly born from its shell the gods 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.950
 superiors looked at their divine beauty and 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.410
 they admired her because everything in her 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.480
 I found in perfect harmony they 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.660
 they agreed to call the lukewarm their the 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.390
 however, he was prepared and 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.370
 made smoke with silent hatred but 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.650
 with cunning he hid his 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.840
 resentment and pretended to share the 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.840
 joy of the other higher gods
