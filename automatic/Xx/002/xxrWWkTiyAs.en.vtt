yes<00:00:05.580> yeah<00:00:06.540> we're<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.050> look<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.319> little

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:07.439 
yes yeah we're going to look a little

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.250 
yes yeah we're going to look a little
bit<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.700> long<00:00:09.150> ring<00:00:09.360> now<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:10.110> long

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
bit of the the long ring now the long

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:26.050 
bit of the the long ring now the long
wing<00:00:10.469> does<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.980> span<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:12.170> just<00:00:13.170> below<00:00:13.710> 2<00:00:13.950> meters

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.040 

makes<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:29.119> extend<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.390> expand<00:00:30.750> without

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
makes it extend that we expand without

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.650 
makes it extend that we expand without
changing<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> see<00:00:32.070> need<00:00:32.330> that's<00:00:33.330> why<00:00:33.510> they

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
changing the see need that's why they

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.220 
changing the see need that's why they
have<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.949> special<00:00:34.949> for<00:00:35.129> a<00:00:35.340> special<00:00:35.519> design<00:00:36.230> if

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
have a special for a special design if

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.660 
have a special for a special design if
you<00:00:37.350> look<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.590> differences<00:00:38.130> between<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you look at the differences between the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.490 
you look at the differences between the
relation<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.180> me<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> long<00:00:39.719> wing<00:00:39.930> they

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
relation with me in the long wing they

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.340 
relation with me in the long wing they
have<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.920> different<00:00:41.219> purposes<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.000> that

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
have the in different purposes and that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.959 
have the in different purposes and that
this<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.770> think<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.250> made<00:00:44.550> quite<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
this is I think we have made quite a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.319 
this is I think we have made quite a
good<00:00:45.260> compromise<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.550> always<00:00:47.940> when<00:00:48.239> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
good compromise here and always when you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.209 
good compromise here and always when you
design<00:00:48.719> an<00:00:49.050> airplane<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:49.980> some

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
design an airplane you have to do some

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.119 
design an airplane you have to do some
compromises<00:00:51.020> especially<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
compromises especially if you like a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.670 
compromises especially if you like a
quite<00:00:53.340> wide<00:00:53.670> flight<00:00:54.450> envelope<00:00:57.170> design<00:00:58.170> for

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
quite wide flight envelope design for

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.000 
quite wide flight envelope design for
more<00:00:59.070> agile<00:00:59.550> you<00:01:00.360> are<00:01:00.840> banding<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.320> hotspots

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
more agile you are banding or hotspots

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.889 
more agile you are banding or hotspots
Mike<00:01:02.719> it's<00:01:03.719> faster<00:01:05.090> has<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> higher<00:01:06.390> wing<00:01:06.690> load

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
Mike it's faster has a higher wing load

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.200 
Mike it's faster has a higher wing load
because<00:01:07.530> probably<00:01:08.039> more<00:01:08.490> better<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.000> high

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
because probably more better in high

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.250 
because probably more better in high
wind<00:01:10.400> but<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> long<00:01:11.610> wing<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.180> course<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.780> very

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
wind but a long wing of course is very

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.030 
wind but a long wing of course is very
if<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.130> want<00:01:14.340> long<00:01:14.939> range<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.600> want<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.140> climb

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
if you want long range you want to climb

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.399 
if you want long range you want to climb
very<00:01:17.340> fast<00:01:17.700> too<00:01:18.240> high<00:01:18.390> altitude<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> they<00:01:22.110> have

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
very fast too high altitude so they have

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.080 
very fast too high altitude so they have
different<00:01:22.650> different<00:01:23.340> different<00:01:23.430> purposes

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
different different different purposes

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.999 
different different different purposes
of<00:01:24.509> course<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.990> short<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.560> will<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.860> easier

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
of course this short one will be easier

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.359 
of course this short one will be easier
to<00:01:26.340> live<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.810> we'll<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> speed<00:01:28.920> better

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to live with we'll have a speed better

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.719 
to live with we'll have a speed better
than<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.030> long<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.830> so<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:32.100> shouldn't

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
than the long one so you shouldn't

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.520 
than the long one so you shouldn't
actually<00:01:33.030> push<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.380> long<00:01:34.560> wing<00:01:34.799> too<00:01:35.130> hard<00:01:35.369> i

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
actually push the long wing too hard i

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.840 
actually push the long wing too hard i
should<00:01:37.530> say<00:01:37.680> i've<00:01:37.860> flown<00:01:38.130> mine<00:01:43.100> if<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.579> really

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
should say i've flown mine if not really

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.649 
should say i've flown mine if not really
besides<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.540> about

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
besides that you have to think about

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.270 
besides that you have to think about
speed

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
speed

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.219 
speed
as<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.400> mentioned<00:01:51.430> earlier<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.840> doing

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
as I mentioned earlier the doing

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.130 
as I mentioned earlier the doing
extensions<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:55.030> also<00:01:55.180> have<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.510> covers<00:01:55.840> you

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
extensions they also have the covers you

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.469 
extensions they also have the covers you
can<00:01:56.290> mount<00:01:56.740> separate<00:01:57.369> server<00:01:57.700> leads<00:01:57.940> here<00:01:58.180> as

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
can mount separate server leads here as

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.219 
can mount separate server leads here as
some<00:01:58.960> people<00:02:00.390> gluing<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.540> extensions<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.200> the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
some people gluing the extensions to the

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.499 
some people gluing the extensions to the
wing<00:02:02.470> panels<00:02:02.680> then<00:02:03.400> of<00:02:03.610> course<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.270> have

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
wing panels then of course you you have

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.120 
wing panels then of course you you have
to<00:02:04.630> buy<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.780> new<00:02:04.960> pair<00:02:05.259> wing<00:02:05.530> panels<00:02:05.740> if<00:02:06.009> you

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
to buy a new pair wing panels if you

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.029 
to buy a new pair wing panels if you
want<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.430> use<00:02:06.520> them<00:02:07.470> with<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> short<00:02:08.739> portion

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
want to use them with a short portion

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.590 
want to use them with a short portion
and<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.720> have<00:02:11.290> similar<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.150> Simon<00:02:13.150> superfluous

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
and I have similar to Simon superfluous

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.640 
and I have similar to Simon superfluous
solution<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.680> have<00:02:14.830> yes<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.489> lost<00:02:16.360> goose<00:02:16.569> and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.370 

play<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.890> short<00:02:21.010> configuration

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
play on the short configuration

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.000 
play on the short configuration
otherwise<00:02:23.380> they<00:02:23.590> are<00:02:23.650> quite<00:02:24.430> similar

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
otherwise they are quite similar

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.080 
otherwise they are quite similar
something<00:02:27.010> we<00:02:27.100> didn't<00:02:27.340> mentioned<00:02:27.670> earlier<00:02:27.940> is

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
something we didn't mentioned earlier is

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.870 
something we didn't mentioned earlier is
that<00:02:28.739> there<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:29.890> in<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.190> power<00:02:30.400> get<00:02:30.580> there<00:02:30.790> is

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
that there is in the power get there is

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.610 
that there is in the power get there is
a<00:02:32.010> problem<00:02:33.010> with<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.280> spinner<00:02:33.989> also<00:02:34.989> make<00:02:35.170> at

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
a problem with a spinner also make at

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.170 
a problem with a spinner also make at
the<00:02:35.860> moment<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.280> have<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.580> make<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.970> prom

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
the moment you have to make the prom

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.890 
the moment you have to make the prom
stops<00:02:37.980> yourself<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.420> make<00:02:40.870> sure

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
stops yourself and that is to make sure

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.420 
stops yourself and that is to make sure
that<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.380> prof<00:02:41.560> doesn't<00:02:42.750> either<00:02:43.750> way<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.860> use

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
that the prof doesn't either way I use

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.449 
that the prof doesn't either way I use
also<00:02:45.910> Simon<00:02:46.660> use<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.140> APC<00:02:47.650> holding<00:02:48.280> drop

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
also Simon use in the APC holding drop

also Simon use in the APC holding drop
it<00:02:48.940> has<00:02:49.150> built-in<00:02:49.810> stops<00:02:52.590> performance<00:02:53.730> anyway

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
it has built-in stops performance anyway

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.319 
it has built-in stops performance anyway
included<00:02:56.260> spinner<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.610> most<00:02:57.790> nicer<00:02:58.180> than

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
included spinner is the most nicer than

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:10.080 
included spinner is the most nicer than
India<00:02:59.040> carbon<00:03:00.040> fiber<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:08.790> don't<00:03:09.790> really<00:03:09.940> like

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
India carbon fiber I don't really like

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.670 
India carbon fiber I don't really like
the<00:03:10.390> ABC<00:03:10.690> I've<00:03:10.840> ever<00:03:12.329> actually<00:03:13.329> this<00:03:14.230> morn<00:03:14.500> is

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the ABC I've ever actually this morn is

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.710 
the ABC I've ever actually this morn is
broken<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.190> there<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.579> then<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.269> puts<00:03:16.570> a

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
broken in there and then you it puts a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.870 
broken in there and then you it puts a
tremendous<00:03:16.900> force<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.799> motor<00:03:18.250> mounts<00:03:18.609> so

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
tremendous force on the motor mounts so

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.780 
tremendous force on the motor mounts so
it's<00:03:19.030> easy<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.450> break<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:19.870> them<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.519> can<00:03:21.760> be

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
it's easy to break in them and it can be

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.000 
it's easy to break in them and it can be
broken<00:03:22.030> if<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.720> have<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:23.230> one<00:03:23.410> plate<00:03:28.829> yeah<00:03:29.829> I

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
broken if you have just one plate yeah I

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.370 
broken if you have just one plate yeah I
have<00:03:30.190> unless<00:03:30.400> sik<00:03:30.910> ryeom<00:03:30.940> use<00:03:31.480> their<00:03:32.109> phone

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
have unless sik ryeom use their phone

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.140 
have unless sik ryeom use their phone
knows<00:03:32.650> too<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.750> its<00:03:34.870> body<00:03:35.170> see<00:03:35.670> if<00:03:36.670> she

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
knows too and its body see if she

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.500 
knows too and its body see if she
actually<00:03:37.900> asked<00:03:41.400> proximately<00:03:42.400> as<00:03:42.970> big<00:03:43.209> as<00:03:43.359> the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
actually asked proximately as big as the

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.630 
actually asked proximately as big as the
whole<00:03:43.630> place<00:03:43.870> just<00:03:44.140> put<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.709> in<00:03:44.799> like<00:03:45.489> this

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
whole place just put it in like this

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.759 
whole place just put it in like this
just<00:03:46.390> in<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.660> right<00:03:47.070> in<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.340> right<00:03:48.519> area<00:03:49.000> and

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
just in the right in the right area and

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.390 
just in the right in the right area and
then<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:50.799> used<00:03:51.100> to<00:03:51.280> get<00:03:51.549> exact

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
then I used to get exact

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.350 
then I used to get exact
out<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:54.829> just<00:03:55.829> push<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.069> in<00:03:56.280> some<00:03:56.970> well<00:03:57.120> crew

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
out and just push it in some well crew

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.050 
out and just push it in some well crew
well<00:03:58.230> grow<00:03:58.439> helping<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.040> also<00:03:59.250> use<00:03:59.700> such<00:03:59.939> as

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
well grow helping it I also use such as

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.300 
well grow helping it I also use such as
you<00:04:00.150> can<00:04:00.299> see<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.540> GoPro<00:04:00.689> connector<00:04:01.409> which

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
you can see the GoPro connector which

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.360 
you can see the GoPro connector which
both<00:04:03.120> takes<00:04:03.599> out<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.840> video<00:04:04.530> feed<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.860> also

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
both takes out the video feed and also

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.720 
both takes out the video feed and also
short<00:04:06.150> just<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.510> go<00:04:06.629> there's<00:04:07.140> been<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.860> think

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
short just to go there's been I think

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.640 
short just to go there's been I think
there<00:04:08.970> is<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.180> quite<00:04:09.390> being<00:04:09.689> reluctant<00:04:10.019> in<00:04:10.439> some

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
there is a quite being reluctant in some

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.500 
there is a quite being reluctant in some
I<00:04:10.799> believe<00:04:11.250> violence<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.760> use<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.000> GoPro<00:04:12.329> for

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
I believe violence to use the GoPro for

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.240 
I believe violence to use the GoPro for
every<00:04:12.720> weekend<00:04:13.109> I<00:04:13.319> really<00:04:13.950> love<00:04:14.069> it

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
every weekend I really love it

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.949 
every weekend I really love it
especially<00:04:14.430> for<00:04:14.819> a<00:04:15.000> multicopters<00:04:15.720> books

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
especially for a multicopters books

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.749 
especially for a multicopters books
because<00:04:16.440> then<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.650> have<00:04:16.769> like<00:04:16.799> wide-angle

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
because then you have like wide-angle

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.870 
because then you have like wide-angle
you<00:04:17.880> don't<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.239> like<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:20.430> doesn't<00:04:20.459> go

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
you don't have like that it doesn't go

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.480 
you don't have like that it doesn't go
so<00:04:21.030> fast<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.449> Mahinda<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.169> then<00:04:22.289> of<00:04:22.380> course

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
so fast and Mahinda and then of course

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.879 
so fast and Mahinda and then of course
the<00:04:23.490> picture<00:04:24.360> but<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:24.960> really<00:04:25.259> like<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:25.590> and

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
the picture but I really like this and

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.779 
the picture but I really like this and
it<00:04:25.979> charges<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.490> GoPro<00:04:27.090> if<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.389> have<00:04:27.510> five<00:04:27.810> of

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
it charges the GoPro if you have five of

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.400 
it charges the GoPro if you have five of
both<00:04:29.789> feet<00:04:30.330> from<00:04:30.630> there<00:04:30.810> or<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.110> stay<00:04:31.350> for

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
both feet from there or you stay for

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.170 
both feet from there or you stay for
example<00:04:31.919> just<00:04:32.580> make<00:04:32.729> sure<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.940> have<00:04:33.150> the

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
example just make sure you have the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.529 
example just make sure you have the
unperson<00:04:33.630> or<00:04:33.960> we<00:04:34.139> will<00:04:34.229> see<00:04:34.410> in<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.590> right<00:04:34.800> way

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
unperson or we will see in the right way

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.420 
unperson or we will see in the right way
and<00:04:36.539> also<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:37.139> has<00:04:37.470> an<00:04:37.800> over<00:04:38.070> from<00:04:38.220> the

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
and also it has an over from the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.040 
and also it has an over from the
overvoltage<00:04:38.820> protection<00:04:39.060> which<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:39.840> really

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
overvoltage protection which is really

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.770 
overvoltage protection which is really
good<00:04:40.199> so<00:04:40.470> if<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:40.680> haven't<00:04:41.180> if<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.270> forgot<00:04:42.539> to

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
good so if you haven't if you forgot to

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.830 
good so if you haven't if you forgot to
change<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.880> power<00:04:44.880> feed<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:47.570> won't<00:04:48.570> destroy

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
change the power feed it won't destroy

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:57.100 
change the power feed it won't destroy
your<00:04:48.990> GoPro<00:04:49.320> which<00:04:49.830> can<00:04:50.099> happen<00:04:50.580> if<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:50.970> have

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.339 

turned<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.320> start<00:04:59.310> recording<00:04:59.960> put<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.050> in<00:05:01.139> and

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
turned on start recording put it in and

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.029 
turned on start recording put it in and
then<00:05:02.539> works<00:05:03.539> really<00:05:03.750> well<00:05:03.840> also<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:04.889> have<00:05:05.010> the

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
then works really well also you have the

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.070 
then works really well also you have the
possibility<00:05:05.220> if<00:05:05.820> you<00:05:05.970> crash<00:05:06.210> there<00:05:06.990> is

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
possibility if you crash there is

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.860 
possibility if you crash there is
nothing<00:05:07.410> holding<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:08.030> tight<00:05:09.030> it<00:05:09.270> can<00:05:09.510> be

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
nothing holding it tight it can be

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.180 
nothing holding it tight it can be
pushed<00:05:10.110> in<00:05:10.320> in<00:05:10.770> words<00:05:11.070> so<00:05:11.490> it's<00:05:13.070> secure<00:05:14.070> a

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
pushed in in words so it's secure a

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.439 
pushed in in words so it's secure a
little<00:05:14.849> bit<00:05:16.550> much<00:05:17.550> more<00:05:17.789> should<00:05:17.970> audition<00:05:18.270> I

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
little bit much more should audition I

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:24.230 
little bit much more should audition I
have<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:18.780> share<00:05:19.349> mounted<00:05:20.039> inside<00:05:23.060> range<00:05:24.060> with

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
have the share mounted inside range with

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:35.170 
have the share mounted inside range with
you<00:05:24.500> one<00:05:25.500> point<00:05:33.320> keeping<00:05:34.320> us<00:05:34.590> on<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.830> side

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
you one point keeping us on the side
