and<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.460> course<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> game<00:01:18.000> ends<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.540> right

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and of course the game ends like right

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.149 
and of course the game ends like right
in<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> middle<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.110> my<00:01:19.229> AC<00:01:19.350> 130<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.009> kind

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
in the middle of my AC 130 so it's kind

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.399 
in the middle of my AC 130 so it's kind
of<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.520> double<00:01:21.240> fail<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.930> guy<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.259> chasing

was hiding down there probably if he was

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.960 
was hiding down there probably if he was
running<00:01:25.590> back<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.490> kind<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> same

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
running back that's kind of the same

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
running back that's kind of the same
thing<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.270> would<00:01:27.420> do<00:01:27.540> from<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> from<00:01:28.470> where<00:01:28.799> he

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
thing I would do from the from where he

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.370 
thing I would do from the from where he
was<00:01:28.920> that's<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> same<00:01:29.970> thing<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.380> wanted

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
was that's the same thing that I wanted

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.010 
was that's the same thing that I wanted
to<00:01:31.439> avoid<00:01:31.799> doing<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:33.000> running<00:01:33.540> away<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to avoid doing is not running away and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.330 
to avoid doing is not running away and
then<00:01:34.110> having<00:01:34.290> somebody<00:01:34.500> catch<00:01:34.829> me<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.189> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
then having somebody catch me and and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.420 
then having somebody catch me and and
snake<00:01:35.970> me<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.740> but<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.100> hopefully<00:01:38.250> I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
snake me like that but so hopefully I

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.330 
snake me like that but so hopefully I
kill<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> buzz<00:01:38.970> killed<00:01:39.240> him<00:01:39.860> unfortunately<00:01:40.860> he

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
kill I buzz killed him unfortunately he

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.740 
kill I buzz killed him unfortunately he
probably<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> same<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.180> buzz<00:01:42.479> killed

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
probably is the same to that buzz killed

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.420 
probably is the same to that buzz killed
me<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.380> guess<00:01:43.799> we'll<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> little

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
me so I guess we'll see here it a little

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.300 
me so I guess we'll see here it a little
bit<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:44.820> oh<00:01:45.540> yeah<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.590> me<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.100> still

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
bit but oh yeah to me it was it still

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.550 
bit but oh yeah to me it was it still
fail<00:01:47.579> even<00:01:47.790> though<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> wasn't<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.930> was

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560

just one of those wands I figured it
would<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.480> good<00:02:24.570> discussion<00:02:25.170> point<00:02:25.590> you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
would be a good discussion point you

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.710 
would be a good discussion point you
know<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.580> feeling<00:02:26.940> again<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.420> you're

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720

so<00:02:27.960> close<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.380> getting<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.980> c-130<00:02:29.880> up<00:02:30.030> in

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
so close to getting that a c-130 up in

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.190 
so close to getting that a c-130 up in
the<00:02:30.240> air<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.600> then<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:30.930> die<00:02:31.170> right

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the air and then you just die right

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200 
the air and then you just die right
before<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.800> call<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.700> then<00:02:32.850> even

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
before you call it in and and then even

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.550 
before you call it in and and then even
worse<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.690> getting<00:02:33.960> enough<00:02:34.080> kills<00:02:34.380> that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
worse you getting enough kills that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.680 
worse you getting enough kills that
would<00:02:35.070> have<00:02:35.160> got<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.640> nuke<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.420> it

the<00:03:32.160> ac-130<00:03:33.120> earlier<00:03:33.630> before<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.680> was<00:03:34.830> trying

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
the ac-130 earlier before I was trying

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.620 
the ac-130 earlier before I was trying
to<00:03:35.130> like<00:03:35.220> hide<00:03:35.459> in<00:03:35.640> my<00:03:35.670> little<00:03:35.940> spot<00:03:36.420> I

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.390 
to like hide in my little spot I
probably<00:03:36.900> would<00:03:37.769> have<00:03:37.830> been<00:03:37.980> able<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.220> make

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
probably would have been able to make

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.160 
probably would have been able to make
this<00:03:38.519> new<00:03:38.730> cabin<00:03:39.150> because<00:03:39.300> I<00:03:39.420> had<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> pretty

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
this new cabin because I had a pretty

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.560 
this new cabin because I had a pretty
decent<00:03:40.230> start<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.239> you<00:03:42.239> know<00:03:42.330> I<00:03:42.360> had<00:03:42.540> a

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
decent start and you know I had a

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.820 
decent start and you know I had a
handful<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:42.989> bursts<00:03:43.260> left<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.800> had

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
handful of bursts left and I had

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.800 
handful of bursts left and I had
probably<00:03:44.160> five<00:03:44.370> or<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.790> kills<00:03:45.060> left<00:03:45.330> but<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
probably five or so kills left but the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.080 
probably five or so kills left but the
game<00:03:45.989> ended<00:03:46.290> instead<00:03:46.769> since<00:03:47.400> they<00:03:47.550> kept<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.940> B

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
game ended instead since they kept the B

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.509 
game ended instead since they kept the B
flag<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.810> was<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:49.500> kind<00:03:50.100> of<00:03:50.160> crappy

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
