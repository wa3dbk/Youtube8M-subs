 ai where i br i is always the troxa 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.590

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.590
 We're going to win the fuck 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.260

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.880
 there is certain 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.400
 Our color only here 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.670
 positioning here 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:36.610
 I did not like to give a video 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.610
 young man on a favorite video also go 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:48.620
 look but do not forget that tds lai 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:53.390
 favorite because it helps a lot and comment 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:56.630
 also if you want you can comment 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.020
 the results the athletic lose you are the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.820
 kind of a cruise in a maria and cheering 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.340
 against 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.290
 there is no way your team lost and 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.060
 you are atleticano are seeing this only 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.830
 to look in the face of the would do that neither I 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.130
 I'm going to play a thousand times 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.130
 If the team wins there, right? 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.260
 can also click 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.879
 or if the team loses also the team lost 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.700
 If you're hoping for the team to get in 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.629
 make this fact only have work here 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.629
 so light 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:52.930
 I will not show the time here because the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.900
 computer hangs a lot in a precise year 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.970
 prove to no one that seven in the morning 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:03.390
 and I'm confirming this is a job 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.390
 on here 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.220
 he made the control or dung goal 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.940
 to the goal 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.820
 This quality is not saying that I 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:51.900
 I'm filming is that actually the 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:57.420
 transmission at 240 I think it 's seems like 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:02.420
 this is what also with a little square in the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:06.900
 Face our psycho face he did 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.830
 and saw the goalkeeper in the 20% to hit 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.830
 now 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.989
 and this will soon 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.980
 and now 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:38.699
 has to oblige singer has no way 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.699
 winning cell battery can handle 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:55.520
 and this charge is even faster 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.520
 the battery is running out
