I actually had to record this part of

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.600 
I actually had to record this part of
the<00:00:40.330> video<00:00:40.450> twice<00:00:40.900> because<00:00:41.200> one<00:00:41.680> or<00:00:41.980> two<00:00:42.280> weeks

if you're going to use old resin make
sure<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:58.690> do<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:58.840> small<00:00:59.110> test<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.559> see<00:00:59.710> if<00:00:59.739> it's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
sure to do a small test to see if it's

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.650 
sure to do a small test to see if it's
any<00:01:00.040> good<00:01:00.190> before<00:01:00.489> wasting<00:01:01.030> your<00:01:01.150> time<00:01:01.360> like<00:01:01.629> I

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
any good before wasting your time like I

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:55.380 
any good before wasting your time like I
did

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:23.640 

and<00:01:56.730> then<00:01:57.730> make<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.090> juice<00:01:58.270> bottle<00:01:58.600> as<00:01:58.720> well

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.539 

I<00:02:25.409> baked<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:26.560> bottle<00:02:26.860> for<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.069> few<00:02:27.280> minutes

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
I baked the bottle for a few minutes

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.550 
I baked the bottle for a few minutes
before<00:02:27.790> adding<00:02:28.269> this<00:02:28.420> last<00:02:28.720> strip<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.260> clay

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
before adding this last strip of clay

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:49.710 
before adding this last strip of clay
just<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.340> wouldn't<00:02:30.580> lose<00:02:30.790> shape

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.060 

then<00:02:50.720> once<00:02:50.960> you're<00:02:51.110> done<00:02:51.260> bake<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.800> bottle

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
then once you're done bake the bottle

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.220 
then once you're done bake the bottle
and<00:02:52.190> cup<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.580> use<00:02:52.730> them<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.060> make<00:02:53.180> molds<00:02:53.660> the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
and cup and use them to make molds the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.380 
and cup and use them to make molds the
mold<00:02:54.440> make<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.770> used<00:02:55.070> is<00:02:55.250> called<00:02:55.490> silicon<00:02:56.150> but

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
mold make I used is called silicon but

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.150 
mold make I used is called silicon but
you<00:02:56.480> can<00:02:56.600> also<00:02:56.720> use<00:02:57.080> amazing<00:02:57.470> mold<00:02:57.680> putty<00:02:57.920> or

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
you can also use amazing mold putty or

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:11.559 
you can also use amazing mold putty or
any<00:02:58.520> other<00:02:58.730> silicon<00:02:59.240> based<00:02:59.450> mold<00:02:59.780> maker

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.509 

to<00:03:12.110> make<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.379> juice<00:03:12.560> bottle<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.010> just<00:03:13.219> mix<00:03:13.459> some

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
to make the juice bottle I just mix some

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.459 
to make the juice bottle I just mix some
transparent<00:03:14.180> orange<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.750> press<00:03:15.049> it<00:03:15.200> into<00:03:15.319> the

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
mold then baked for the coffee's I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.039 
mold then baked for the coffee's I
roughly<00:03:22.819> mix<00:03:22.969> a<00:03:23.120> couple<00:03:23.299> of<00:03:23.420> shades<00:03:23.629> of<00:03:23.780> clay

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
roughly mix a couple of shades of clay

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.929 
roughly mix a couple of shades of clay
so<00:03:24.379> the<00:03:24.530> swirls<00:03:24.799> who<00:03:25.010> are<00:03:25.069> still<00:03:25.280> visible<00:03:25.640> I

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:25.939 
so the swirls who are still visible I

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.059 
so the swirls who are still visible I
then<00:03:26.569> press<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.989> into<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.260> mold<00:03:27.349> and<00:03:27.769> rolled

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
then press it into the mold and rolled

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.190 
then press it into the mold and rolled
it<00:03:28.220> slightly<00:03:28.519> thinner<00:03:28.879> it<00:03:29.540> might<00:03:29.810> not<00:03:30.019> make

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
it slightly thinner it might not make

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.110 
it slightly thinner it might not make
much<00:03:30.470> sense<00:03:30.739> at<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.099> point<00:03:31.220> but<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.760> just

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
much sense at this point but you just

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.880 
much sense at this point but you just
want<00:03:32.359> to<00:03:32.540> make<00:03:32.659> a<00:03:32.689> small<00:03:33.049> space<00:03:33.349> between<00:03:33.530> the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
want to make a small space between the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.399 
want to make a small space between the
coffee<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.549> mold<00:03:37.030> I'm<00:03:38.030> not<00:03:38.930> sure<00:03:39.170> if<00:03:39.319> I

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
coffee and the mold I'm not sure if I

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.319 
coffee and the mold I'm not sure if I
included<00:03:39.980> this<00:03:40.129> clip<00:03:40.459> in<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:40.670> video<00:03:40.879> but<00:03:41.180> I

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
included this clip in the video but I

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.300 
included this clip in the video but I
put<00:03:41.569> a<00:03:41.599> small<00:03:41.900> amount<00:03:42.230> of<00:03:42.319> fimo<00:03:42.620> deco<00:03:42.829> deal<00:03:43.099> in

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
put a small amount of fimo deco deal in

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.369 
put a small amount of fimo deco deal in
the<00:03:43.430> bottom<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:43.939> coffee<00:03:44.180> molds<00:03:44.659> and<00:03:44.810> bake

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
the bottom of the coffee molds and bake

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.800 
the bottom of the coffee molds and bake
that<00:03:45.620> before<00:03:46.010> adding<00:03:46.340> any<00:03:46.430> resin<00:03:46.909> this<00:03:47.510> way

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
that before adding any resin this way

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.509 
that before adding any resin this way
you'll<00:03:48.019> get<00:03:48.230> that<00:03:48.409> translucent<00:03:48.950> looking

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
you'll get that translucent looking

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.520 
you'll get that translucent looking
bottom<00:03:49.849> piece<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.389> cup<00:03:50.629> but<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.349> don't

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
bottom piece to the cup but you don't

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.509 
bottom piece to the cup but you don't
have<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.919> do<00:03:52.099> this

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
have to do this

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.520 
have to do this
just<00:03:53.090> make<00:03:53.269> sure<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.750> if<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.019> do<00:03:54.169> add<00:03:54.379> the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
just make sure that if you do add the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.929 
just make sure that if you do add the

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
liquid clay to the bottom of the mold

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.420 
liquid clay to the bottom of the mold
you<00:03:56.150> need<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.989> make<00:03:57.139> the<00:03:57.260> coffee<00:03:57.470> pot<00:03:57.919> shorter
