00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.390 

and<00:01:51.160> one<00:01:51.760> thing<00:01:51.970> I<00:01:52.090> have<00:01:52.270> been<00:01:52.480> grateful<00:01:53.400> that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
and one thing I have been grateful that

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.370 
and one thing I have been grateful that
I<00:01:54.430> have<00:01:54.730> learned<00:01:54.940> how<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.240> do<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.990> take<00:01:56.200> out

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
I have learned how to do is to take out

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.710 
I have learned how to do is to take out
these<00:01:56.590> these<00:01:57.160> smaller<00:01:57.520> ones<00:01:59.700> without<00:02:00.720> ripping

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
these these smaller ones without ripping

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.990 
these these smaller ones without ripping
out<00:02:01.900> all<00:02:01.930> my<00:02:02.170> hair<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:06.040> really<00:02:06.580> do<00:02:06.700> stick

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
out all my hair and they really do stick

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.140 
out all my hair and they really do stick
well<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:09.100> that's<00:02:09.280> kind<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.640> key<00:02:09.790> is<00:02:09.970> to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
well so that's kind of a key is to

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.790 
well so that's kind of a key is to
isolate<00:02:10.300> them<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.020> they<00:02:11.140> don't<00:02:11.260> grab<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
isolate them so they don't grab the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.740 
isolate them so they don't grab the
other<00:02:11.920> hair

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.320

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
was just beautiful but at nighttime it

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.690 

it<00:02:45.080> also<00:02:45.230> helps<00:02:45.590> when<00:02:45.860> you're<00:02:46.040> unrolling<00:02:46.430> if

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
it also helps when you're unrolling if

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.009 
it also helps when you're unrolling if
you've<00:02:46.849> been<00:02:47.030> watching<00:02:47.239> some<00:02:47.659> of<00:02:47.750> my<00:02:47.870> other

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
videos to sort of cushion when you are

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.160 
videos to sort of cushion when you are
unrolling<00:02:54.590> them<00:02:55.299> so<00:02:56.299> you're<00:02:56.450> not<00:02:56.569> pulling<00:02:56.900> it

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
unrolling them so you're not pulling it

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:07.760 
unrolling them so you're not pulling it
out<00:02:57.260> but<00:02:57.489> actually<00:02:58.489> let<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:59.650> do<00:03:00.650> their<00:03:00.890> thing

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.980 

and<00:03:07.920> these<00:03:08.460> are<00:03:08.520> all<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.570> smallest

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
and these are all of the the smallest

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:24.150 
and these are all of the the smallest
rollers<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.800> have<00:03:11.070> in<00:03:11.580> my<00:03:12.210> hair

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.180 

it<00:03:36.040> gives<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.310> more<00:03:36.490> sort<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.060> 70s

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190
