different<00:00:17.660> surfaces<00:00:18.170> just<00:00:18.380> to<00:00:18.439> find<00:00:18.650> out<00:00:18.710> what

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
different surfaces just to find out what

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.769

the<00:00:19.009> people<00:00:19.250> go<00:00:19.369> onto<00:00:19.520> how<00:00:20.240> it<00:00:20.330> would<00:00:20.480> look<00:00:20.509> on

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
the people go onto how it would look on

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.019 
the people go onto how it would look on
different<00:00:21.080> surfaces<00:00:21.230> basically<00:00:22.070> for<00:00:22.700> harmful

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
different surfaces basically for harmful

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.519 
different surfaces basically for harmful
and<00:00:23.119> anything<00:00:23.329> it<00:00:23.450> doesn't<00:00:23.630> go<00:00:23.779> on<00:00:23.930> to<00:00:24.110> yet<00:00:24.290> so

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
and anything it doesn't go on to yet so

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.580 
and anything it doesn't go on to yet so
the<00:00:25.040> obvious<00:00:25.460> things<00:00:25.730> things<00:00:26.119> like<00:00:26.590> ordinary
