00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
look at the videos so the reason why

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.479 
look at the videos so the reason why
this<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.430> big<00:00:50.640> deal<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.969> because<00:00:51.000> safety

check blind spots on the movies
unnecessary<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.290> dangerous<00:02:01.880> especially

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
unnecessary and dangerous especially

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.090 
unnecessary and dangerous especially
when<00:02:03.270> driving<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.719> high<00:02:03.869> speeds<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.770> time

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
when driving at high speeds in the time

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.760 
when driving at high speeds in the time
it<00:02:05.280> takes<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> time<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.320> takes

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it takes you in the time it takes

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.770 
it takes you in the time it takes
you'll<00:02:07.979> lose<00:02:08.640> touch<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.030> what's<00:02:09.390> happening

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
you'll lose touch with what's happening

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.210 
you'll lose touch with what's happening
in

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
in

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.680 
in
so<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.890> DSA<00:02:13.340> these<00:02:14.150> are<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.360> people

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
so this is the DSA these are the people

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.440 
so this is the DSA these are the people
that<00:02:14.720> do<00:02:15.080> are<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.220> examiners<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:17.000> driving

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
that do are the examiners on driving

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.360 
that do are the examiners on driving
tests<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.930> they're<00:02:18.470> very<00:02:18.650> very<00:02:18.920> clear<00:02:19.190> on

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
tests and they're very very clear on

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.690 
tests and they're very very clear on
that

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.490 
that
regular<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.540> sensible<00:02:20.930> use<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.290> mirrors

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
regular and sensible use of the mirrors

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.080 
regular and sensible use of the mirrors
will<00:02:21.650> keep<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.950> up<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.160> date<00:02:22.310> with<00:02:22.520> what's

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
will keep you up to date with what's

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.210 
will keep you up to date with what's
happening<00:02:23.420> behind<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:24.290> all<00:02:24.440> however<00:02:24.650> still

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
happening behind you all however still

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.280 
happening behind you all however still
need<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.490> know<00:02:25.700> when<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.420> glance<00:02:26.840> into<00:02:27.170> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
need to know when a glance into the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.650 
need to know when a glance into the
blind<00:02:27.560> spots<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.250> needed<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.300> drive

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
blind spots is needed so a drive

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.540 
blind spots is needed so a drive
instructor<00:02:30.260> should<00:02:30.860> be<00:02:30.980> able<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.220> give<00:02:31.400> you

instructor should be able to give you

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.910 
instructor should be able to give you
good<00:02:31.820> indications<00:02:32.480> as<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.750> when<00:02:32.960> the<00:02:33.500> timing

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
good indications as to when the timing

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.700 
good indications as to when the timing
of<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.310> when<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:34.700> should<00:02:34.910> be<00:02:35.290> appropriate<00:02:36.290> so

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
of that when it should be appropriate so

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
don't keep driving at a hazard so just

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
don't keep driving at a hazard so just
go<00:03:28.700> over<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.850> again<00:03:29.000> you're<00:03:29.360> looking

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
yeah that writes sideways glance and it

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.190 
yeah that writes sideways glance and it
is<00:04:32.520> literally<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.270> if<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.720> was<00:04:33.840> driving<00:04:34.139> along

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
is literally it's if I was driving along

now it's come on to joke right I'll at

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.730 
now it's come on to joke right I'll at
once<00:04:35.820> look<00:04:36.330> forward<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.840> look<00:04:36.960> twice<00:04:37.290> look

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
once look forward to look twice look

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.220 
once look forward to look twice look
forwards<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.280> it's<00:04:38.430> literally<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.660> it's

forwards and it's literally that it's

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.450 
forwards and it's literally that it's
just<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:41.419> momentary<00:04:42.419> glance<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:43.320> see<00:04:43.350> if<00:04:43.980> in<00:04:44.280> the

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
just a momentary glance to see if in the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.909 
just a momentary glance to see if in the
blind<00:04:44.760> spot<00:04:44.880> there<00:04:45.840> is<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:45.990> motorbike<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:46.770> you

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
blind spot there is a motorbike that you

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.040 
blind spot there is a motorbike that you
can't<00:04:47.220> see<00:04:47.460> in<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.669> right<00:04:47.820> mirror<00:04:48.090> massive

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.260 
can't see in the right mirror massive
massively<00:04:49.650> important<00:04:50.130> this<00:04:50.280> because<00:04:51.030> if<00:04:51.180> you

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
massively important this because if you

proper blind spot checks the time it

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.060 
proper blind spot checks the time it
takes<00:04:56.669> you<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:56.910> do<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:57.330> look<00:04:57.770> blind<00:04:58.770> spot

in<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:07.620> short<00:05:07.889> time<00:05:08.010> that<00:05:08.370> takes<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:08.700> to<00:05:08.820> do

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
in that short time that takes you to do

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.300 
in that short time that takes you to do

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
that and that is wife we're traveling in

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.760 
that and that is wife we're traveling in
that<00:05:11.340> direction<00:05:11.840> main<00:05:12.840> attention<00:05:13.229> needs<00:05:13.680> to

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
that direction main attention needs to

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.100 
that direction main attention needs to
be<00:05:13.860> in<00:05:14.310> that<00:05:14.370> direction<00:05:14.580> just<00:05:15.510> like<00:05:15.630> with<00:05:15.990> the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
be in that direction just like with the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.500 
be in that direction just like with the
maneuvers<00:05:16.560> if<00:05:16.860> you're<00:05:17.160> reversing<00:05:17.970> if<00:05:18.360> you're

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
maneuvers if you're reversing if you're

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.110 
maneuvers if you're reversing if you're
doing<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.900> reversing<00:05:19.560> maneuver<00:05:20.010> then<00:05:20.370> most<00:05:20.910> of

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
doing a reversing maneuver then most of

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.790 
doing a reversing maneuver then most of
your<00:05:21.330> attention<00:05:21.780> needs<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.020> be<00:05:22.110> out<00:05:22.320> that<00:05:22.350> rear

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
your attention needs to be out that rear

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.940 
your attention needs to be out that rear
windscreen<00:05:23.120> so<00:05:24.120> I<00:05:24.360> just<00:05:24.660> wanted<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:25.380> emphasize

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
windscreen so I just wanted to emphasize

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.680 
windscreen so I just wanted to emphasize
this<00:05:26.610> point<00:05:28.580> because<00:05:29.580> it's<00:05:29.820> a<00:05:29.880> safety<00:05:30.180> issue

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
this point because it's a safety issue

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.300 
this point because it's a safety issue
I<00:05:30.810> mean<00:05:31.020> if<00:05:31.169> for<00:05:31.530> sure<00:05:31.710> it<00:05:32.010> wouldn't<00:05:32.220> be

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
I mean if for sure it wouldn't be

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.279 
I mean if for sure it wouldn't be
acceptable<00:05:32.640> on<00:05:32.789> test<00:05:33.060> either<00:05:33.300> but<00:05:33.660> more<00:05:34.140> to

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
acceptable on test either but more to

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.680 
acceptable on test either but more to
the<00:05:34.320> point<00:05:34.410> for<00:05:35.340> me<00:05:35.490> is<00:05:35.729> actually<00:05:36.000> a<00:05:36.270> safety

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
the point for me is actually a safety
