00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
it seems like a lot of the decks weren't

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.949 
it seems like a lot of the decks weren't
really<00:03:13.680> playing<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.400> few<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.810> while

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
really playing it a few like a while

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.509 
really playing it a few like a while
back<00:03:16.170> they<00:03:16.800> were<00:03:16.890> just<00:03:17.010> playing<00:03:17.220> like<00:03:17.340> more

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
back they were just playing like more

scenarios<00:03:19.880> but<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:20.940> do<00:03:21.060> think<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.570> stifle<00:03:22.019> is

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
scenarios but I do think that stifle is

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.080 
scenarios but I do think that stifle is
one<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:23.070> main<00:03:23.250> cards<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.730> really<00:03:23.910> does

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
one of the the main cards it really does

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.970 
one of the the main cards it really does
make<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.630> deck<00:03:24.810> function<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.800> highest

capacity for civil you definitely just

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.610

main deck we have a graph diggers cage
I've<00:05:34.440> tried<00:05:35.160> between<00:05:35.669> surgical<00:05:36.090> extraction

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570

graphics<00:05:41.010> cage<00:05:41.130> is<00:05:41.250> probably<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.820> best<00:05:41.970> one

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
graphics cage is probably the best one

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.270 
graphics cage is probably the best one
because<00:05:43.050> it<00:05:43.260> also<00:05:43.380> stops<00:05:43.710> green<00:05:43.950> sun's<00:05:44.190> zenith

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280

as them and so if you can like loam

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.750 
as them and so if you can like loam
wasteland<00:06:37.470> lock<00:06:37.620> them<00:06:37.860> then<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.610> games

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
wasteland lock them then the games

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.660 
wasteland lock them then the games
usually<00:06:39.030> pretty

of pie robles usually I've seen list
with<00:06:48.880> just<00:06:49.030> two<00:06:49.210> of<00:06:49.240> these<00:06:49.450> but<00:06:50.080> I<00:06:50.260> think<00:06:50.350> that

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
with just two of these but I think that

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.080 
with just two of these but I think that
if<00:06:50.710> the<00:06:50.860> metagame<00:06:51.100> is<00:06:51.370> picking<00:06:51.700> up<00:06:51.850> on<00:06:51.970> like

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
if the metagame is picking up on like

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.520 
if the metagame is picking up on like
the<00:06:52.180> combo<00:06:52.510> decks<00:06:52.690> where<00:06:52.930> there's<00:06:53.110> like<00:06:53.290> a<00:06:53.320> lot

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
the combo decks where there's like a lot

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.950 
the combo decks where there's like a lot

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
and in into the infinite ducks you can

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.370 
and in into the infinite ducks you can
get<00:07:00.280> them<00:07:00.430> with<00:07:00.460> the<00:07:00.760> other<00:07:01.720> three<00:07:01.990> pyroblast
