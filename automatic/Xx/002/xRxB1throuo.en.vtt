00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.710

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:42.280
 for the content of such domestic 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.280
 animals what else you need to build 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.450
 so do not cry for the content of dwarf 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.030
 sheep you will need at least 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.130
 winter pen I have a big cross here 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.090
 place all chickens for all animals 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.880
 sheep and goats but otherwise you will need 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.690
 pen where they will stand in winter 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.840
 This law is made in such a way that 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.980
 earth floor then goes down the power 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.240
 basic diet is hay 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.570
 must be fresh water 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.250
 every day is desirable not to cold and 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.100
 salt and of course you give in winter 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.610
 some juicy feed be it carrot 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.620
 apples also you give corn well and 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.870
 feed them a tasty snack 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.150
 cream too as a delicacy also we 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.440
 separately we dry brooms birch brooms 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.260
 do not give and try a week for everything in 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.030
 France of these sheep contains as I have 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.490
 said for wool because they have 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.740
 fine cut by the way show now 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.940
 what do we make of it life and knit on 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.800
 these socks are very warm I can not say 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.810
 that they are insane soft but not very 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.820
 good quality and that is typical 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.370
 the brown part is from brown 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.480
 lamb white part of white omichki then 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.670
 have we pass nothing years on 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.770
 real true color and in due time 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.230
 in France and kept precisely because of the color 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.620
 also because so saturated 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.109
 Brown seems to me without knowing 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.100
 it was impossible then to get add 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.100
 any dye 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.850
 show you our offspring naturally 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.460
 for fun is our offspring 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.860
 this year it was born through this language 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.880
 language born for Christmas fawn born 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.690
 on old new year 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.870
 what a quietly amazing event which 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.590
 wonderful cartoons 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:48.080
 let's go they run plays already at 10 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.970
 days are chewing hay and it's amazing how much 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.370
 before it is born literally after 15 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.160
 minutes they start to run already jumping and 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.920
 jump cons like any animal this 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.450
 requires a lot of attention it will require 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.700
 some kind of investment to 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.730
 to build 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.370
 pen winter well, by and large 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.470
 the rest of the drawbacks I do not see good 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.870
 pet for fun and won 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.010
 case the choice is yours and before you buy 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.310
