00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.520
 Welcome to another episode 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.930
 the microsoft news and will say 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.930
 willing debate with high going on 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.509
 I myself have noticed that 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.400
 new project minecraft aura is 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.619
 but the project is supposed to start 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.970
 not the megaproject 2.0 are from the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.500
 last time it works out spoken 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.540
 had the minecraft euro project 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.370
 is a striking transition project to the new one 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.870
 mega project and that is the new mega 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.129
 project a huge mod pack were 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.110
 already for a very long time 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.519
 is planned and what a few more 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.710
 It will take months until it ends 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.000
 is ready to start and until then with just 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.409
 Michael theurer played what I too 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 a very cool project finds michael 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.140
 Bauer can be found as a skype blog 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.339
 imagine multiplayer 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.809
 I do not know if you open the project 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.040
 lasting with but so far I find 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.269
 In any case, really good as it is 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.610
 From you she writes my comments 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.920
 We wanted to be like the others 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.000
 server projects and we have many 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.860
 people wrote the comments 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.119
 When is the new project coming? 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.559
 you always do new project 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.909
 and so and we have all the time 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.770
 already worked on a project but 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.720
 that is with many mod packs too 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.460
 own mod packs and compiled 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.659
 things where we just do not like that 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.650
 make it fast and it still takes 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.180
 probably a few more months to go 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.780
 we can do it until we get the project 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.729
 start 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.170
 and there are so many spectators counted 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.430
 says l wand comes again again 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.229
 we also own bock truth 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.460
 super gladly so server project together 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.990
 play and on the channel of siltronic 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.789
 ag we have been very much lately 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.319
 very irregular videos and now has 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.490
 just a statement made 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.810
 he just says that because of 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.189
 different customers just do not feel like it 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.719
 more on microsoft no desire to 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.009
 youtube has and now in this one 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.030
 somebody else's channel 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.740
 will continue 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.030
 i think it's better if youtuber 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.079
 just say openly that they are straight 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.819
 no more desire one just has 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.619
 half-hearted videos to do the same 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.509
 is now at lukas now just 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.679
 also adopted by youtube meidinger 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.999
 After all, he does not want to 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.469
 on mike reid had around monthly 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.549
 actually only cars lost 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.409
 his subscribers are me again 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.030
 under the hundred thousand mark 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.799
 which of course has fallen a lot 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.420
 sad decline in subscribers is and 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.530
 there it is clear to me that one 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.389
 There just a final stroke 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.829
 instead of having to pull in completely 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:02.060
 to make a fool of, and it just 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.799
 completely degenerate 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.420
 what do you say goodbye to 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.009
 youtube or in pauses over the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.110
 comments a new hype has the 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.880
 minecraft play mode cap tip triggered 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.410
 here it comes as many it 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.150
 you push it in minecraft to reach 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.069
 very much to expand his game world 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.360
 many German of is playing and player 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.770
 I really have to say the game mode 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.360
 really has what i can only recommend 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.250
 give him a chance to gamble on this link 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.319
 her down in the video description of 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.720
 Bergmann has now started live every day 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.950
 stream on twitter and we 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.790
 Write and I really recommend you 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.990
 to have a look 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.090
 because the streams are very entertaining 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.290
 are designed 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.660
 now also take place more often 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.250
 will minecraft skins 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.599
 be downsized so far is the whole 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.980
 year is pretty clunky and shows you 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.090
 Here's a picture like they are in now 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.050
 future 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.370
 I think the whole thing really looks 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.420
 better and of course fits too 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.680
 new skin system 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.360
 We want to see how your favorites 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.860
 player and youtuber on a long time 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.019
 travel beat that is not now 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.480
 problem because the airflow word hello 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.069
 desilets blame and sebastian have clever 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.739
 now in cooperation with the media force 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.269
 network started the road trip 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.950
 They drove through the two cars 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.269
 different cities you can 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.709
 their daily blogs on all channels 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.000
 I accompany for the whole 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.440
 pretty cool especially once just such 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.269
 youtuber in virtually unfamiliar 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:36.100
 environment sees the left find 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:37.690
 of course and the video car is supposed to 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.100
 youtube school of mister miner and 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.079
 unplayed start we may already 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.430
 to admire the intro a bit 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.970
 traffic to you there I had something like that too 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.470
 is wanted 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.450
 I was definitely curious what 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.519
 there's something waiting for us now 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.959
 own instance and that is what I have 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.920

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.420
 reasons and of course I have too 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.530
 martin partner agreed and will 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.510
 all the people in the project who of you 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.160
 Bock has a server team to join 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.780
 I can with the rice in the server 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.519
 recommend where I as a developer and 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.319
 You can apply pictures to the form 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.180

 this follow the mic refuge when 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.319
 had fallen even easier 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.160
 be on the go or have to get in the skin 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.160
