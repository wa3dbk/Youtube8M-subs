00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 good day today we go currant buns 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.390
 we are going to make for making 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.610
 currant buns that has what we have 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.370
 we need special techniques 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.940
 initially had to flour 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.230
 milk powder 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.080
 sugar yeast developed water 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.670
 and was a much later stage 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.100
 let's go get the butter there 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.859
 level fresh full of add and if 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.640
 last of course kept to be 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.529
 there to stop what we're doing is a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.340
 contrary to what has been before 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.280
 seized 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.280
 we now go the blind milk powder 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.710
 the sugar the salt 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.699
 go all in advance then they mix 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.960
 namely 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.239
 she is pretty much Krist is in it 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.190
 and did n't first start her again 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.190
 mix briefly 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.460
 roll the ingredients 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.700
 schouten level developed by one 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:21.940
 own brand is not entirely 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:21.940
 sort according to go here at google 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:35.720
 I water or the last here again at this 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.720
 has 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.990
 just needed not go to school law 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.930
 let this pass quietly as neede 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.789
 to hear a nice long ball and 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.710
 on releasing the camp 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.479
 if then we are going to have the chance to ever be 10 again 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.690
 minutes intensive downstairs is already one 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.360
 beautiful ending arise time and back and 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.929
 have been considered and now we will go 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.759
 try walking terry stand should 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:10.070
 go on such things mobile data that 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:13.070
 down until it stops must be recorded 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:19.970
 by door b and then we are ready 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:22.370
 not much longer than me like me that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.250
 full again the nice goal 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:30.019
 how does a number deliver then 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.450
 has such as MIMO, the dead 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.299
 sustained by that being my own 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.019
 Now all places are clean 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:43.489
 by his grace we were allowed to mix 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.299
 let me also walk whole and we are 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.110
 underneath 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:52.270
 be in the decor 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:56.680
 ok we are now in the human thing 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.960
 accuses get the thing off the couch 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.240
 and he wants to moor 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.630
 I then leave for about 20 minutes 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.480
 let them travel and then when you have done that 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.150
 do we go beyond making spheres 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.510
 and he does them that you accuracy 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.510
 them alive 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:28.150
 plastic nice very short and object all 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.610
 came state and see there is now after the first 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.950
 rising is a nice smooth dough there 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.780
 and some food feels very soft 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.130
 actually what we are going to do now 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.980
 we are going to deviate pieces of 70 grams and more 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.800
 going as we go billowing 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.290
 we are going to make a little ball out of it 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.440
 and that leaves according to let's again 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.010
 take a rest and then we will put it on one 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.390
 laying a baking tray on winning is one 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.010
 basically a little message one 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.160
 technique that would be mastered 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.630
 gotta get it nicer I state 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.620
 actually a really nice boat 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.420
 to be 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.489
 the principle then of is actually that you 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.400
 with a flat hand 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.820
 first starts rolling up and then 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.890
 careful with the dogs emerge 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.359
 a copy everyone last emerged 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.250
 and then you actually leave it a bit 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.459
 injured rollers and then you get give up 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.660
 you will get nice breasts then 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.910
 to be completely smooth to them 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.440
 soon we will bulge one more time 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.229
 for a line and go on the baking sheet 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.210
 then our and passion was something 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.919
 you roll 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.810
 so basically principle and that's how we go 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:39.220
 dry to have the voucher on 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.650
 globules now have about an hour or 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.080
 ten we raised them now 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.250
 final form help they give is about 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.740
 we are to them one more time 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.729
 do not push bulbs too hard and down 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.009
 it is only intended to be there 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.990
 just found a nice sphere 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.199
 we are going to put them on the baking tray 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.349
 I seem to put them in rows of five and 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.569
 roll 3 wide so my 15 on the bar instead 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.789
 is for 100 space loose such a put out one 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.740
 they will be much bigger then 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.520
 we are going to finish a lot more 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.830
 with some egg yolk and be so say he does 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.960
 and or be careful do it is just there 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.309
 also just good ironing also always just 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.169
 equally beautiful or 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:18.149
 because the egg yolk will take care of it later 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.379
 for a nice shine and color you go 

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:21.599
 to get 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.339
 and if you didn't do that then yes 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.249
 the result it will finally be something 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:28.259
 less will be fine 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.419
 So if we go a little further, and so 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.490
 finished and they go into the oven 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.649
 with me at least to travel the 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.930
 oven is not where we have 35 degrees 

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:38.610
 that will be about a minute for 40 60 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.879
 minutes and then they can go 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.889
 baking 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.839
 the farmers now have about 5 minutes 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.080
 I have already been in the over anyway 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:48.539
 preheated at 22 degrees 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.430
 and so we try to hear how the 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.050
 bake the balls 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.969
 we do that for about 10 minutes in the 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.249
 pre-heated oven 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:06:02.789
 so not so very difficult to put them in 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:07.459
 it was the boats have now 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:14.099
 10 minutes remained beautiful in color 

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:16.019
 and nice what I am coming according to in the 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:18.779
 first unbaked 

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:20.729
 he has to do yourself how is bad 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:23.069
 not arrive until the brothers really 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.439
 off time should you arrive and now 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.819
 they drop in and on that sort of thing too 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.349
 very unfortunate but that happens 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.779
 no longer on my that they have cooled 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:34.559
 party it likes you like it 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:39.110
 let me know anything you have questions mail or 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:39.110
 respond very briefly until next time
