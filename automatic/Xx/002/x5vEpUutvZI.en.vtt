course<00:00:31.590> if<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> think<00:00:31.890> about<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.699> are

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
course if you think about it you are

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.820 
course if you think about it you are
wearing<00:00:33.150> the<00:00:33.330> contact<00:00:33.720> lens<00:00:33.930> right<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.589> the

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
wearing the contact lens right on the

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.560 
wearing the contact lens right on the
surface<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.400> your<00:00:35.519> cornea<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.269> is<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
surface of your cornea which is the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.660 
surface of your cornea which is the
front<00:00:36.960> part<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.320> your<00:00:37.379> eye<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.489> it's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
front part of your eye and so it's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.610 
front part of your eye and so it's
important<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.480> stays<00:00:39.780> very<00:00:40.079> healthy

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
important that that stays very healthy

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
important that that stays very healthy
because<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.219> clarity<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.030> cornea<00:00:42.420> is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
because the clarity of the cornea is

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.840 
because the clarity of the cornea is
what<00:00:42.780> allows<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.379> see<00:00:43.620> well<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
what allows you to see well when you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.660 
what allows you to see well when you
wear<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> contact<00:00:45.600> lens<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.829> affect<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
wear a contact lens it can affect the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.000 
wear a contact lens it can affect the
clarity<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.390> cornea<00:00:48.840> by<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.590> allowing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
clarity of the cornea by not allowing

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.580 
clarity of the cornea by not allowing
enough<00:00:50.070> oxygen<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> surface<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.379> when

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
enough oxygen to the surface and so when

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.200 
enough oxygen to the surface and so when
you're<00:00:52.710> wearing<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.100> contact<00:00:53.550> lens<00:00:53.699> that's<00:00:54.030> one

going to want to watch for is to make

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.599 
going to want to watch for is to make
sure<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.930> you're<00:00:58.170> getting<00:00:58.320> enough<00:00:58.609> oxygen

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
sure that you're getting enough oxygen

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.660 
sure that you're getting enough oxygen
to<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.750> surface<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> cornea<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.519> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
to the surface of the cornea so that the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
to the surface of the cornea so that the
clarity<00:01:02.940> stays<00:01:03.359> very<00:01:03.570> good<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.140> course

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
clarity stays very good of course

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.389 
clarity stays very good of course

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
concerns with hygiene and infections are

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.850 
concerns with hygiene and infections are
also<00:01:08.550> a<00:01:08.759> concern<00:01:08.940> with<00:01:09.360> contact<00:01:09.840> lenses<00:01:09.899> well

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
also a concern with contact lenses well

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.290 
also a concern with contact lenses well
it's<00:01:11.190> not<00:01:11.399> good<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.789> have<00:01:11.940> just<00:01:12.179> a<00:01:12.270> general

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
it's not good to have just a general

infection from a contact lens one of the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.699 
infection from a contact lens one of the
things<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.509> worry<00:01:15.810> about<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> most<00:01:16.410> is

00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:16.709 
things we worry about the most is

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.100 
things we worry about the most is
something<00:01:17.069> called<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.399> corneal<00:01:17.910> ulcer<00:01:18.450> which

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
something called a corneal ulcer which

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.320 
something called a corneal ulcer which
is<00:01:19.289> where<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.649> infection<00:01:20.250> actually<00:01:20.490> invades

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
is where the infection actually invades

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.290 
is where the infection actually invades
into<00:01:21.599> the<00:01:21.869> cornea<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.860> if<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.759> not<00:01:23.970> caught

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
into the cornea and if it's not caught

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.320 
into the cornea and if it's not caught
quickly<00:01:24.899> and<00:01:25.080> treated<00:01:25.470> very<00:01:25.849> properly<00:01:26.849> and

quickly and treated very properly and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
quickly and treated very properly and
swiftly<00:01:27.899> can<00:01:28.530> result<00:01:28.830> in<00:01:29.009> scarring<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
swiftly can result in scarring on the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.669 
swiftly can result in scarring on the
cornea<00:01:30.119> which<00:01:30.330> can<00:01:30.599> affect<00:01:30.929> your<00:01:31.080> ability<00:01:31.200> not
