00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
hi in this video I'm going to talk about

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.450 
hi in this video I'm going to talk about
an<00:00:02.280> alternative<00:00:02.510> storage<00:00:03.510> solution<00:00:04.310> to<00:00:05.310> the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
an alternative storage solution to the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.110 
an alternative storage solution to the
microSD<00:00:06.150> card<00:00:06.390> with<00:00:07.069> Samsung<00:00:08.069> Galaxy<00:00:08.490> s6<00:00:08.910> edge

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
microSD card with Samsung Galaxy s6 edge

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.350 
microSD card with Samsung Galaxy s6 edge
it<00:00:09.540> no<00:00:09.780> longer<00:00:10.200> come<00:00:10.950> with<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.370> us<00:00:11.610> an<00:00:11.969> S<00:00:12.179> this

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
it no longer come with for us an S this

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.320 
it no longer come with for us an S this
car<00:00:13.019> slot<00:00:13.290> where<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.250> simply<00:00:14.730> poop<00:00:15.120> and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
car slot where you can simply poop and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.240 
car slot where you can simply poop and
pull<00:00:15.809> out<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.929> back<00:00:16.170> cover<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.500> put<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
pull out the back cover and put in the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.650 
pull out the back cover and put in the
SD<00:00:17.609> card<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:19.020> s6<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.670> choose<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
SD card so on s6 you have to choose the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.750 
SD card so on s6 you have to choose the
font<00:00:21.869> size<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.519> 32<00:00:23.519> gig<00:00:23.760> 64<00:00:24.420> 128<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.769> if

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
font size in a 32 gig 64 128 and if

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.179 
font size in a 32 gig 64 128 and if
you're<00:00:26.939> running<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.330> memory<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.980> just

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
you're running out memory and you just

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.900 
you're running out memory and you just
need<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.580> clear<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.090> some<00:00:30.619> some<00:00:31.619> files<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.640> in

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
about an alternative a storage solution

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.590 
about an alternative a storage solution
which<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.610> USB<00:00:40.040> thumb<00:00:41.040> drive<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:42.420> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
which is the USB thumb drive so here is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.260 
which is the USB thumb drive so here is
the<00:00:42.840> an<00:00:43.110> adapter<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:44.700> adapter

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the an adapter it's on the go adapter

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.420 
the an adapter it's on the go adapter
which<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.260> simply<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.860> plug<00:00:47.250> directly

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
which you can simply just plug directly

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.319 
which you can simply just plug directly
into<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.059> USB<00:00:48.570> port<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.789> if<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.969> plug<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
into the USB port here if you plug that

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.610 
into the USB port here if you plug that
in<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.980> USB<00:00:53.430> port<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.420> actually

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
in to the USB port you can actually

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.549 
in to the USB port you can actually
store<00:00:55.620> some<00:00:56.280> data<00:00:56.719> into<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.870> drive<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
store some data into this drive here so

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.279 
store some data into this drive here so
you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.579> as<00:00:59.730> soon<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.210> plug<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you can see as soon as I plug it in the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
you can see as soon as I plug it in the
phone<00:01:01.500> automatically<00:01:02.190> detects<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.149> shows

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
phone automatically detects and it shows

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
phone automatically detects and it shows
the<00:01:04.170> drive<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.909> actually<00:01:06.840> use<00:01:07.799> this

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the drive and you can actually use this

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.609 
the drive and you can actually use this
drive<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.810> start<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> transfer<00:01:10.380> files

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
drive or you can start to transfer files

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.520 
drive or you can start to transfer files
on<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.070> phone<00:01:11.310> into<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.119> USB<00:01:12.330> Drive<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
on your phone into this and USB Drive so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.960 
on your phone into this and USB Drive so
let's<00:01:13.710> say<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:13.920> you've<00:01:14.040> got<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> lot<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.400> photos

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
let's say if you've got a lot of photos

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.480 
let's say if you've got a lot of photos
or<00:01:15.180> movies<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.799> phone<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.070> getting<00:01:17.220> full

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
or movies and your phone is getting full

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.940 
or movies and your phone is getting full
you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:18.000> simply<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.630> transfer<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.320> over<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you can simply just transfer it over and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.789 
you can simply just transfer it over and
this<00:01:20.790> allows<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.420> kind<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.259> use<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this allows you to kind of like use as a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.130 
this allows you to kind of like use as a
backup<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.340> well<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.360> here's<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.659> two<00:01:24.869> videos

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
backup as well so here's the two videos

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.870 
backup as well so here's the two videos
that<00:01:25.200> I've<00:01:25.409> got<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.729> just

USB storage and you can either place it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.210 
USB storage and you can either place it
at<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.610> root<00:01:38.880> move<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:41.040> into

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
at the root move it here you can go into

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.690 
at the root move it here you can go into
a<00:01:41.340> folder<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.030> paste<00:01:42.720> into<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.110> folder<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.520> I'll

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
a folder and paste into a folder so I'll

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.190 
a folder and paste into a folder so I'll
do<00:01:44.909> I'm<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.090> gonna<00:01:45.329> move<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.630> into<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.049> root

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
do I'm just gonna move it into the root

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.499 
do I'm just gonna move it into the root
folder<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.409> how<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:50.009> use<00:01:50.549> them

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
folder and that's how you can use them

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.710 
folder and that's how you can use them
an<00:01:51.780> alternative<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.500> storage<00:01:52.950> solution<00:01:53.720> for
