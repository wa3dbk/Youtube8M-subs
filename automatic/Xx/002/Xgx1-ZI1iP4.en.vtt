yes<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> recipe<00:00:38.640> right<00:00:38.760> here<00:00:38.940> which<00:00:39.750> is

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
yes or have a recipe right here which is

yes or have a recipe right here which is
probably<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.290> smart<00:00:40.530> idea<00:00:40.910> because<00:00:41.910> it's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
probably a smart idea because it's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
probably a smart idea because it's
probably<00:00:42.989> gonna<00:00:43.110> turn<00:00:43.320> out<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.500> either<00:00:44.070> way

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
probably gonna turn out that either way

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.790 
probably gonna turn out that either way
first<00:00:44.789> step<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.420> preview<00:00:45.629> thousand<00:00:46.170> who

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
first step is to preview thousand who

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.459 
first step is to preview thousand who
would<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.129> known<00:00:47.480> not<00:00:48.480> me<00:00:48.750> because<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.289> almost

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
would have known not me because I almost

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.950 
would have known not me because I almost
forgot<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.250> next<00:00:50.399> step<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.239> boil<00:00:51.570> water

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960

good for lasagna
well<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> wait<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> water<00:01:12.540> well<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:13.320> can

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
well the wait for the water well we can

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740 
well the wait for the water well we can
start<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.860> prepare<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.340> cheese<00:01:14.549> stuff<00:01:14.820> that

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
start to prepare the cheese stuff that

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.020 
start to prepare the cheese stuff that
is<00:01:16.070> time<00:01:17.210> efficiency<00:01:19.400> learning<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:20.939> is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
is time efficiency learning so here is

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.760 
is time efficiency learning so here is
their<00:01:21.150> bowl<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.439> put

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
their bowl and I think we just put

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.380 
their bowl and I think we just put
everything<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.250> there<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> makes<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.970> I'm<00:01:24.090> not

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
everything in there it makes it I'm not

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.920 
everything in there it makes it I'm not
circle<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.710> am<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.920> ever<00:01:25.950> sure<00:01:26.630> exactly

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
circle when am I ever sure exactly

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.890 
circle when am I ever sure exactly
so<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> first<00:01:28.680> cheese<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.130> needed<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.900> ricotta

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
so the first cheese be needed is ricotta

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350 
so the first cheese be needed is ricotta
cheese<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.220> don't<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.460> what<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.909> so

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
cheese but I don't know what that is so

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
cheese but I don't know what that is so
I'm<00:01:33.509> using<00:01:33.720> cottage<00:01:34.200> cheese<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:34.890> sound<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
I'm using cottage cheese they sound the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.359 
I'm using cottage cheese they sound the
same<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.820> I'm<00:01:36.090> guessing<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.159> it'll<00:01:38.159> work

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
same so I'm guessing that it'll work

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.280 
same so I'm guessing that it'll work
in<00:01:38.610> Czech<00:01:38.820> Plus<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.840> stuff<00:01:40.079> looks

disgusting it looks like a lot of sheep

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.310 
disgusting it looks like a lot of sheep
were<00:01:45.200> rounded<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:47.689> I'm<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.930> gonna<00:01:49.020> stop
