will see which apps consumed most data
data<00:05:42.070> usage<00:05:42.610> since<00:05:43.419> the<00:05:43.960> boot<00:05:44.700> it's<00:05:45.700> not

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
data usage since the boot it's not

data usage since the boot it's not
separated<00:05:47.160> from<00:05:48.160> 3g<00:05:48.760> and<00:05:49.060> Wi-Fi<00:05:50.010> because<00:05:51.010> it's

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
separated from 3g and Wi-Fi because it's

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.890 
separated from 3g and Wi-Fi because it's
not<00:05:51.460> possible<00:05:53.040> but<00:05:54.120> it's<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.210> nice<00:05:55.360> indicator

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
to see which apps consume the most data

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.140 
to see which apps consume the most data
you<00:05:59.650> can<00:05:59.770> also<00:05:59.950> switch<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.610> system<00:06:00.970> app

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
you can also switch to the system app

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.750 
you can also switch to the system app
and<00:06:01.419> can<00:06:01.570> see<00:06:01.750> which<00:06:02.440> system<00:06:02.950> apps<00:06:03.130> consumes

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
and can see which system apps consumes

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.370 
and can see which system apps consumes
data<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:04.720> so<00:06:05.140> on<00:06:05.260> a<00:06:05.440> search<00:06:06.250> functionality
