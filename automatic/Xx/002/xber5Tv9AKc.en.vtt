00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.840
 so hoist the good you just have to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.029
 see the eighth match 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.740
 then you left the shrine that is going 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.769
 give you the master bowl you go back 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.010
 here and she'll tell you that he's a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.080
 strange storm on the road 7 so when 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.370
 very well trained very well you 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.850
 take or style and flight you go apart 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719

 this video you will see that this is 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.820
 really very very simple but after me 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.010
 it's going to be pretty fast because I 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.090
 will use the master bowl for 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 catch him because he's a runaway 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.910
 but a passionate fugitive is a little 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.350
 like the as if no pre-costs and in 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.149
 pay that is to say that 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.129

 attack all that and then go away so 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.229
 it's just right for that so 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.580
 I do not have but otherwise I could very 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.780

00:02:48.690 --> 00:03:01.050
 the bike we go here you push yourself 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.380

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.390
 good weather road 5 good weather by ie9 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:16.920

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:19.640

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.870
 here he is 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:29.470
 it's beautiful and here is a wild lightning 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:33.040
 devices nothing very complicated so the 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.110
 zumba everybody dance samba 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.440
 it starts to rain but I 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.820
 crazy all because I could master 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:47.900
 for not an object fight ball master 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:51.500
 ball use it and here we talk about it 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.770
 more the fast and clear the first time 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.060
 when I think it's beautiful and then 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.320
 so that's what I advise you 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.519
 it is to do like me it is either you 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.600
 go to a region of South Kivu is this 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.370
 that you are the political beating 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.769
 you are in a region of the north path 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.700
 is evening 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.370
 and then I was lucky enough to 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.320
 to fall on the first end but otherwise 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.170
 you can go exactly to the same 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.570
 place and if but you can not find it 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.489
 not or do you expect that 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:21.079
 that she react nokia no storm you 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.099
 do that for ie9 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.280
 you turn back road 5 beats you back 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:29.590
 to turn road 5 you do that 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.909
 does that then after a while 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.250
 well there will be storm and there 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:36.229
 you just have to do nothing again 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.990
 complicated so there I calm you 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:43.819
