00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
today my name is John and I thought I

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.240 
today my name is John and I thought I
would<00:00:03.600> continue<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.230> video<00:00:04.770> that<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.009> did<00:00:05.069> a

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
would continue a video that I did a

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.010 
would continue a video that I did a
little<00:00:05.430> bit<00:00:05.670> ago<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.240> when<00:00:06.450> we<00:00:06.540> learned<00:00:06.839> that

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
little bit ago so when we learned that

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.210 
little bit ago so when we learned that
the<00:00:07.140> next<00:00:07.440> extinction<00:00:07.919> event<00:00:08.069> would<00:00:08.160> be

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
the next extinction event would be

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.250 
the next extinction event would be
underwater<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.790> was<00:00:09.030> inspired<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.660> write<00:00:09.870> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
underwater I was inspired to write the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.190 
underwater I was inspired to write the
next<00:00:10.530> extinction<00:00:11.219> maps<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.969> left<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.960> sort

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
next extinction maps so I left it sort

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.839 
next extinction maps so I left it sort
of<00:00:13.290> open<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.980> wanted<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.370> continue<00:00:14.639> with

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
of open and I wanted to continue with

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.820 
of open and I wanted to continue with
today<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.410> underwater

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
today so this is the underwater

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
today so this is the underwater
extinction<00:00:17.760> map<00:00:17.970> part<00:00:18.359> 2<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:18.810> there's

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
extinction map part 2 now there's

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.689 
extinction map part 2 now there's
something<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.289> should<00:00:19.410> note<00:00:19.920> if<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.460> would

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
just a wall of water in front of it like

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.119 
just a wall of water in front of it like
a<00:03:02.609> waterfall<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:04.019> this<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.440> all<00:03:04.650> underwater

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
a waterfall but this is all underwater

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.830 
a waterfall but this is all underwater
so<00:03:05.489> technically<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.329> water<00:03:06.540> should<00:03:06.810> be

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
so technically the water should be

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.250 
so technically the water should be
running<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.620> but<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.579> not<00:03:08.940> what's<00:03:09.720> going<00:03:10.079> on

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
running in but it's not what's going on

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.449 
running in but it's not what's going on
is<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.829> your<00:03:10.920> teammates<00:03:11.220> are<00:03:11.280> going<00:03:11.400> to

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
is you and your teammates are going to

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.830 
is you and your teammates are going to
have<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:11.730> investigate<00:03:12.239> you're<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:12.720> look

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
have to investigate you're going to look

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.869 
have to investigate you're going to look
around<00:03:12.989> see<00:03:13.769> if<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:14.040> find<00:03:14.159> any<00:03:14.310> clues<00:03:14.670> and

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
around see if you can find any clues and

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.099 
around see if you can find any clues and
eventually<00:03:15.390> you're<00:03:15.569> going<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:15.720> deduct<00:03:15.989> that

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
eventually you're going to deduct that

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.309 
eventually you're going to deduct that
there<00:03:16.379> is<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> slime<00:03:17.430> type<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.209> goo<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.870> front<00:03:19.200> of

aliens work is that they're going to
shoot<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.209> go<00:04:12.389> at<00:04:12.599> you<00:04:12.629> and<00:04:12.900> if<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.049> get<00:04:13.199> caught

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
shoot a go at you and if you get caught

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.559 
shoot a go at you and if you get caught
in<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:13.620> go<00:04:13.889> you're<00:04:14.160> gonna<00:04:14.250> move<00:04:14.579> noticeably

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
in this go you're gonna move noticeably

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.390 
in this go you're gonna move noticeably
slower<00:04:15.840> if<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.260> can<00:04:16.410> imagine<00:04:16.500> they<00:04:16.949> function

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
slower if you can imagine they function

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.479 
slower if you can imagine they function
very<00:04:17.609> similarly<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.329> these<00:04:19.160> scabs<00:04:20.160> in

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
very similarly to these scabs in

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.730 
very similarly to these scabs in
Minecraft<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.269> once<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.989> walk<00:04:22.169> in<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.590> you're

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
Minecraft so once you walk in it you're

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.990 
Minecraft so once you walk in it you're
going<00:04:22.860> to

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
going to

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.480 
going to
stuck<00:04:23.450> there<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:23.720> of<00:04:24.140> course<00:04:24.380> if<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:25.130> wanted

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
stuck there and of course if you wanted

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.010 
stuck there and of course if you wanted
you<00:04:25.520> could<00:04:25.640> sort<00:04:26.060> of<00:04:26.240> fight<00:04:26.450> your<00:04:26.600> way<00:04:26.780> out<00:04:26.810> and

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
you could sort of fight your way out and

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.620 
you could sort of fight your way out and
it's<00:04:27.650> kind<00:04:28.010> of<00:04:28.160> like<00:04:28.310> being<00:04:28.610> shot<00:04:29.000> with<00:04:29.360> the

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
it's kind of like being shot with the

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.230 
it's kind of like being shot with the
gas<00:04:29.960> from<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.470> scorpion<00:04:31.130> where<00:04:31.340> once<00:04:31.970> here<00:04:32.210> in

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
gas from a scorpion where once here in

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.880 
gas from a scorpion where once here in
the<00:04:32.450> gas<00:04:32.720> you're<00:04:32.990> pretty<00:04:33.170> slow<00:04:33.440> but<00:04:33.620> as<00:04:33.740> soon

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
the gas you're pretty slow but as soon

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.710 
the gas you're pretty slow but as soon
as<00:04:34.040> you<00:04:34.190> get<00:04:34.340> out<00:04:34.400> you<00:04:34.790> will<00:04:35.000> resume<00:04:35.450> normal

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
as you get out you will resume normal

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.900 
as you get out you will resume normal
pace<00:04:36.140> now<00:04:36.470> eventually<00:04:37.430> you're<00:04:37.580> going<00:04:37.700> to<00:04:37.760> see

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
pace now eventually you're going to see

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.910 
pace now eventually you're going to see
the<00:04:38.060> submarine<00:04:38.630> break<00:04:38.930> into<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.440> cave<00:04:39.680> is

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
the submarine break into the cave is

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.250 
the submarine break into the cave is
going<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.310> remove<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.850> GUI<00:04:41.030> layer<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.630> you

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
going to remove the GUI layer and you

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.540 
going to remove the GUI layer and you
are<00:04:42.530> going<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:42.920> have<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.190> get<00:04:43.280> into<00:04:43.490> that

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
are going to have to get into that

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.940 
are going to have to get into that
submarine<00:04:44.090> as<00:04:44.360> fast<00:04:44.660> as<00:04:45.020> possible<00:04:45.200> if<00:04:45.860> you

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
submarine as fast as possible if you

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.040 
submarine as fast as possible if you
don't<00:04:46.130> get<00:04:46.250> in<00:04:46.460> in<00:04:46.580> time<00:04:46.850> you<00:04:47.390> may<00:04:47.540> be<00:04:47.600> whisked

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
don't get in in time you may be whisked

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.810 
don't get in in time you may be whisked
away by<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.500> water<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.040> you<00:04:49.220> will<00:04:49.400> fail<00:04:49.610> the

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
away by the water and you will fail the

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.030 
away by the water and you will fail the
mission<00:04:50.090> so<00:04:50.420> this<00:04:50.570> is<00:04:50.720> almost<00:04:50.990> one<00:04:51.320> final<00:04:51.770> test

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
mission so this is almost one final test

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.390 
mission so this is almost one final test
before<00:04:52.730> it<00:04:53.300> is<00:04:53.450> over<00:04:53.630> that<00:04:54.620> is<00:04:54.650> basically<00:04:55.250> the

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
before it is over that is basically the

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.980 
before it is over that is basically the
mission<00:04:55.760> your<00:04:55.910> whole<00:04:56.030> team<00:04:56.210> will<00:04:56.450> enter<00:04:56.630> the

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
mission your whole team will enter the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.540 
mission your whole team will enter the
submarine<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.560> then<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.770> will<00:04:57.890> see<00:04:58.010> cutscene

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
submarine and then you will see cutscene

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.040 
submarine and then you will see cutscene
it<00:04:58.700> will<00:04:58.820> basically<00:04:58.970> be<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.450> United<00:04:59.900> States

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
it will basically be the United States

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.840 
it will basically be the United States
some<00:05:00.440> reach<00:05:00.590> or<00:05:00.830> researchers<00:05:01.550> trying<00:05:01.790> to

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
some reach or researchers trying to

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.790 
some reach or researchers trying to
figure<00:05:02.060> out<00:05:02.180> what's<00:05:02.330> going<00:05:02.600> on<00:05:02.780> in<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.500> cave

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800
