00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.309
 welcome to a new episode of the 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.089
 photokina 2014 we are at nikon and 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.010
 here, among other things, the nikon it 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.640
 6900 presented what exactly is that for 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.970
 a camera 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.560
 So it's a compact camera that is 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.850
 our latest development we have them 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.859
 built to be as flexible as possible 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.180
 to be able to photograph and how we 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.470
 Believe have a very good savings 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.150
 Camera built with it 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.679
 self, that's why we say the camera 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.850
 is suitable by its rotatable 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.989
 I monitor you have a bit of 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.719
 the camera courses so that works well 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.440
 just that I actually do it myself 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.420
 can shoot 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 but the possibility with the camera 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.840
 but then also without contact 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.820
 which, of course, a small trigger 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.440
 difference to the usual long arm 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.020
 the picture in the picture is finally 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.270
 results then the camera offers a 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.640
 very wide possibility besides safety 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.550
 also pictures to edit pictures beautiful 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.840
 to alienate beauty through filter 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.270
 your team what you want to do 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.969
 that means a lot in addition to photography 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.500
 to have fun and at the end of the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.600
 Pictures can all be transferred 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.280
 So a camera has the females 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.390
 Immediately connect to the smartphone 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.979
 so that the data on that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.310
 smartphone are transferred over 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.720
 can 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.979
 and then it can go on direction 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.220
 facebook wherever the data 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.380
 to be uploaded ok 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.320
 Nevertheless , the camera has synonymous 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.250
 not so bad technical 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.250
 possibilities what exactly is inside 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.619
 put in a 16 megapixel cmos sensor 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.030
 So the sensors are the ones that are relative 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.369
 give a little noise 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.500
 it has a 12x zoom least the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.619
 is called a strong wide angle 25 mm 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.450
 it then goes to 300 mm that is for 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.579
 many had already been very neat 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.040
 built-in image stabilizer at 300 mm 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.229
 not shaky and that supports 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.939
 of course the photographer extreme and that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.030
 are just the things that one 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.530
 camera ahead of a smartphone i have 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.149
 can choose the neckline and I can 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.090
 take a sharp picture and I can 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.780
 Do exactly what I want 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.189
 ok last, of course, the question what 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.430
 It costs the whole and when it gets to the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.580
 Market costs 249 euros 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.290
 That's our recommendation 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.330
 Of course, the market price will always be 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.030
 form and the camera will be centered 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.260
 october in the market come many thanks 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.590
 so that was the nikon es 6900 here at 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.590
 nikon
