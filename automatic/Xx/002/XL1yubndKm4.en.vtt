race<00:00:58.579> we<00:00:59.579> made<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.660> track<00:01:01.050> sort<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.469> like

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
race we made this track sort of like

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.000 
race we made this track sort of like
this<00:01:02.030> because<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.750> Mario<00:01:04.530> Kart<00:01:04.799> game

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
this because like in the Mario Kart game

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.300 
this because like in the Mario Kart game
I<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.970> these<00:01:06.240> fast<00:01:06.900> panels<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.070> have

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
I like these fast panels that you have

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
I like these fast panels that you have
to<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:09.479> kind<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> slope<00:01:10.140> like

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
to go on it's kind of like a slope like

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.130 
to go on it's kind of like a slope like
this<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:11.640> why<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.090> made<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:12.960> that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
this so that's why we made it like that

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.190 
this so that's why we made it like that
I<00:01:13.850> have<00:01:14.850> turned<00:01:15.240> them<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:18.689> I'm

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
I have turned them on so right now I'm

00:01:19.200 --> 00:02:32.949 
I have turned them on so right now I'm
gonna<00:01:19.350> let<00:01:19.560> them<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.970> three<00:01:21.020> two<00:01:22.340> one<00:01:23.340> go

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.140 

and<00:02:33.469> that<00:02:33.799> is<00:02:34.069> all<00:02:34.519> for<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.180> custom<00:02:35.810> track
