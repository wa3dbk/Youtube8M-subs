00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:12.080
 or the old good in this short video 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.330
 I intend to explain how the 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.910
 chocolate machine 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.609
 this is the packing box that was going to 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.880
 receive you in santiago and that today 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:27.929
 it is boiled 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.929
 and here is the chocolate machine 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.300
 The machine has 6 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:40.680
 pieces I hope you can see clearly 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.620
 first before setting up the machine and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.410
 use it you have to acquire a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.140
 transformer 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.020
 more or less this size or this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.650
 model in this transformer I bought it 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.030
 in the sodimac homecenter and the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.980
 particularity that this has to have 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.500
 transformer is that it has to be 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.500
 greater than 300 watts 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.990
 is to transform the current of this 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.240
 machine that is 110 as American 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.479
 to 220 that corresponds to the other country 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.450
 and to start the operation of the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:24.070
 could you want the transformer 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.000
 I plugged it into the 110 volt area 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.140
 Y 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.030
 to the current of our country 220 the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:40.380
 Plug home 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:44.570
 Well the machine has 6 pieces 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.640
 6 and the form of armed the next day 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.310
 first take the two cylinders 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.180
 the first largest cylinder what 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.780
 introduce in some rolls shoes 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.780
 perfect 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.999
 he puts it in the little eyes and then he takes 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.979
 the other cylinder where there is a cavity 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:11.340
 just one quality because in the other 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.040
 extreme there are two cavities and it does 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.069
 match a little frog 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.719
 that are in this place 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.790
 working alone I do not have any person 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.310
 I can zoom in but there's a 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.989
 great unit that you can fit the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.250
 perfect and then take the discs 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:34.260
 first the largest disc and what 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.599
 introduces and falls perfect and the second in 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.580
 the second smallest disk 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.610
 perfect 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.150
 this piece that is the last penultimate 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.600
 forgiveness there is always error is like a 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.690
 funnel shape and has the same shape 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.780
 you enter it and it has two cavities 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.400
 and here are two slots and they're going to fall 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.420
 perfect 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.360
 I do not know how to introduce and 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.350
 because there are low wolves will not work 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.100
 are introduced in this way 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.100
 Oh, sorry 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.580
 before this piece for the screw without 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:22.180
 end the endless screw that ejects or 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.790
 gives the strength to raise the chocolate and 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.790
 here like the blind diaz has a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.940
 cavities that go into shoes mutually 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.780
 a little thing that has more down and now 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.780
 this piece 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.410
 and there you have it working 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.500
 and to make it work it has two 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.980
 switches 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.950
 switch for the temperature before 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.050
 throw the chocolate have to wait 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.209
 about 5 minutes to warm this up 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.190
 Preserves chocolate 50 degrees and 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.610
 then turn on the engine 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.390
 that phase sound of strong you 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.090
 incorporate machine cells 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.430
 They were not like they can keep 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.129
 lit more than 10 continuous hours 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.130
 after that since he has his machine 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:20.900
 proven you already learn to use requires 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:24.740
 two instruments more hobby a pot and 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.620
 a pool for melting the chocolate 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.690
 the bowl does not have to touch the bottom of the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.370
 pot since we have to do the process 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.020
 of bathroom maria workers of this 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.880
 machine is filled with three kilos of 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.960
 chocolate 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.250
 you incorporate the melted chocolate 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.160
 first it chops the chocolate our 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.250
 kilo and it is melting by step 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.910
 one kilo for example cast logar 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.730
 beating and when it is well melted 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.639
 it incorporates the other kilo ends it 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.440
 found until you complete the 3 kilos 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:07.240
 to melt the chocolate again 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:10.560
 it has well melted its its chocolate and already 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.680
 have with the machine with temperature and 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.680
 turn on the engine 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:18.259
 and incorporates chocolate in this area 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:26.010
 until completely emptying your bowl on 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:29.060
 chocolate is not incorporated here above 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.060
 incorporate below 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.100
 once you finish being your 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.110
 machine 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.400
 in simple cleaning and disarming 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.280
 just as it is soul 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.780
 they are going to get dirty but it does not matter 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.950
 first take out the top 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:53.060
 it is supported here to take out the first disc takes out 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.060
 the second disc 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.370
 takes out the first cylinder the screw without 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.520
 finish 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.669
 and the last cylinder all these pieces 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.970
 They are washable in hot water under 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.550
 keys with soap and water and the machine 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.560
 also under a jet but always and 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.060
 When I do not know I do not know 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.639
 introduce know get the water here is 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.919
 the area the engine 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.220
 and the treatment just like the engine of 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.250
 I played 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.630
 I say I hope this video has 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:32.890
 any doubt calls me and good 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:36.250
 that salgado greet the bulls has 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.250
 wanted to lie
