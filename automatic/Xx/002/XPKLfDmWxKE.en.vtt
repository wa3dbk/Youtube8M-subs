hello youtube this is Keith again with
another<00:00:08.010> minecraft<00:00:08.340> tutorial<00:00:09.269> today<00:00:09.900> I'm

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
another minecraft tutorial today I'm

another minecraft tutorial today I'm
going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.710> showing<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.219> how<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.370> make<00:00:11.639> an

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
going to be showing you how to make an

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.690 
going to be showing you how to make an
ice<00:00:12.360> generator<00:00:12.929> now<00:00:13.290> I've<00:00:13.469> seen<00:00:13.769> etho<00:00:14.370> make<00:00:14.670> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
ice generator now I've seen etho make a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.029 
ice generator now I've seen etho make a
nice<00:00:14.940> generator<00:00:15.389> using<00:00:15.690> pistons<00:00:16.049> I've<00:00:16.710> seen<00:00:17.010> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
nice generator using pistons I've seen a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.689 
nice generator using pistons I've seen a
version<00:00:17.779> using<00:00:18.779> dispensers<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:20.010> even<00:00:20.550> had<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
version using dispensers I even had a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.330 
version using dispensers I even had a
thought<00:00:20.910> myself<00:00:21.150> about<00:00:21.720> using<00:00:22.080> glowstone<00:00:22.680> but

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
thought myself about using glowstone but

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.939 
thought myself about using glowstone but
then<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> realized<00:00:24.029> something<00:00:24.680> you<00:00:25.680> don't<00:00:25.830> need

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
then I realized something you don't need

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.800 
then I realized something you don't need
any<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.279> stuff<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> nice

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
any of that stuff this is a nice

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.720 
any of that stuff this is a nice
generator<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.410> front<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.710> me<00:00:28.830> there<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.460> no

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
generator in front of me there is no

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.790 
generator in front of me there is no
redstone<00:00:30.269> there<00:00:30.779> are<00:00:30.900> no<00:00:31.019> contraptions

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
redstone there are no contraptions

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.940 
redstone there are no contraptions
there's<00:00:32.579> no<00:00:32.850> light<00:00:33.090> sources<00:00:33.719> melting<00:00:34.230> ice<00:00:34.440> you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
there's no light sources melting ice you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.470 
there's no light sources melting ice you
see<00:00:35.100> these<00:00:35.219> torches<00:00:35.550> they're<00:00:36.059> not<00:00:36.239> needed

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
see these torches they're not needed

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.240 
see these torches they're not needed
they're<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.110> keep<00:00:37.230> mobs<00:00:37.559> from<00:00:37.860> spawning

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
they're here to keep mobs from spawning

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.209 
they're here to keep mobs from spawning
on<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.910> okay<00:00:39.329> that's<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.140> they're<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:41.010> for

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
on here okay that's it they're not for

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.760 
on here okay that's it they're not for
any<00:00:41.460> other<00:00:41.579> reason<00:00:41.760> they<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.450> nothing<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
any other reason they do nothing the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.400 
any other reason they do nothing the
whole<00:00:44.040> key<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.789> ice<00:00:45.120> generator<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
whole key to this ice generator is the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.650 
whole key to this ice generator is the
fact<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.950> place<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> block<00:00:47.660> above

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
fact that if you place a block above

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.000 
fact that if you place a block above
water<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.280> water<00:00:50.910> source<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:52.710> won't

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
water here a water source it won't

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.060 
water here a water source it won't
freeze<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.930> skip<00:00:55.199> every<00:00:55.590> other<00:00:55.620> block

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
freeze so we just skip every other block

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.270 
freeze so we just skip every other block
and<00:00:56.449> we<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.600> water<00:00:57.840> sources<00:00:58.289> alright<00:00:59.070> let<00:00:59.250> me

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and we have water sources alright let me

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.070 
and we have water sources alright let me
switch<00:00:59.699> over<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:03.680> survival<00:01:04.680> mode<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:06.080> I'll

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
switch over to survival mode and I'll

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.039 
switch over to survival mode and I'll
show<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.530> how<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.700> works<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.720> pretty

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
show you how this works it's pretty

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.630 
show you how this works it's pretty
simple<00:01:10.350> except<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.700> am<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.640> not

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
simple except that I am you know not

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.760 
simple except that I am you know not
able<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.210> thank<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.900> second<00:01:16.290> alright

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
able to thank right this second alright

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.999 
able to thank right this second alright
so<00:01:17.330> all<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.540> got<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> silk<00:01:19.770> touch

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
so all we got to do we have a silk touch

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.429 
so all we got to do we have a silk touch
mining<00:01:20.460> pick<00:01:20.700> obviously<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:22.080> required

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
mining pick obviously that's required

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.450 
mining pick obviously that's required
and<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.490> mind<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.780> here

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
and we just mind that's all we do here

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.080 
and we just mind that's all we do here
we<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.060> gonna<00:01:27.240> mine<00:01:28.340> no<00:01:29.340> leavers<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.880> flip

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
we go just gonna mine no leavers to flip

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.789 
we go just gonna mine no leavers to flip
no<00:01:30.960> button<00:01:31.320> suppress<00:01:32.240> Pistons<00:01:33.240> no<00:01:34.110> redstone

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
no button suppress Pistons no redstone

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.770 
no button suppress Pistons no redstone
nothing<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:35.850> accidentally<00:01:36.390> break

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
nothing you can accidentally break

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.359 
nothing you can accidentally break
because<00:01:37.259> we've<00:01:37.439> built<00:01:37.619> everything<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
because we've built everything out of

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.700 
because we've built everything out of
obsidian<00:01:38.970> now<00:01:39.240> yeah<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.720> could<00:01:40.079> break<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.530> but

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
obsidian now yeah you could break it but

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.770 
obsidian now yeah you could break it but
to<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.670> accident<00:01:41.909> there's<00:01:42.390> something

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
to do it on accident there's something

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.710 
to do it on accident there's something
terribly<00:01:43.110> terribly<00:01:43.710> wrong<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.880> right<00:01:45.030> just

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
terribly terribly wrong all right just

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.690 
terribly terribly wrong all right just
go<00:01:45.990> around<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.560> break<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> ice<00:01:46.950> that's<00:01:47.579> all

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
go around and break the ice that's all

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.590 
go around and break the ice that's all
you<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.149> that's<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
you have to do that's it that is it

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.620 
you have to do that's it that is it
break<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> ice<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.700> know<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> can't

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
break the ice I know that I can't

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.740 
break the ice I know that I can't
explain<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.770> any<00:01:55.979> other<00:01:56.219> way<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.450> I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
explain this in any other way it's I

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.630 
explain this in any other way it's I
know<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.020> sound<00:01:58.259> repetitive<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.070> redundant

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
know I sound repetitive and redundant

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.929 
know I sound repetitive and redundant
and<00:01:59.759> repetitive<00:02:00.799> but<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:01.979> really<00:02:02.280> all

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and repetitive but that's really all

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.749 
and repetitive but that's really all
there<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.890> break<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.729> ice

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
there is to it you just break the ice

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.310 
there is to it you just break the ice
now<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.479> make<00:02:06.630> sure<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.869> break<00:02:07.140> all

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
now you have to make sure you break all

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.779 
now you have to make sure you break all
of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.590> ice<00:02:07.770> because<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.340> don't<00:02:08.550> break

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
of the ice because if you don't break

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.680 
of the ice because if you don't break
the<00:02:08.970> ice<00:02:09.000> between<00:02:09.300> these<00:02:10.250> it<00:02:11.250> may<00:02:11.520> not<00:02:11.700> clear

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the ice between these it may not clear

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.780 
the ice between these it may not clear
out<00:02:12.870> perfectly

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
out perfectly

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.610 
out perfectly
but<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.269> see<00:02:14.450> we're<00:02:14.629> standing<00:02:15.019> in<00:02:15.110> stillwater

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
but you see we're standing in stillwater

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.539 
but you see we're standing in stillwater
right<00:02:15.890> now<00:02:17.140> stillwater<00:02:18.140> folks<00:02:18.530> all<00:02:19.189> right<00:02:19.370> so

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
right now stillwater folks all right so

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.119 
right now stillwater folks all right so
what<00:02:19.849> I'm<00:02:19.939> going<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.120> do<00:02:20.329> is<00:02:21.079> finish<00:02:21.680> mining

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
what I'm going to do is finish mining

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.530 
what I'm going to do is finish mining
this<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.579> then<00:02:22.849> i'm<00:02:23.000> going<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.209> show<00:02:23.329> you<00:02:23.359> how

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
this and then i'm going to show you how

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.780 
this and then i'm going to show you how
to<00:02:23.599> make<00:02:23.659> it<00:02:24.140> while<00:02:25.129> we<00:02:25.310> let<00:02:25.489> this<00:02:25.640> one

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
to make it while we let this one

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.000 
to make it while we let this one
regenerate<00:02:26.390> but<00:02:26.599> if<00:02:26.689> you<00:02:26.810> notice<00:02:27.010> it's

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
regenerate but if you notice it's

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.030 
regenerate but if you notice it's
already<00:02:28.430> started<00:02:28.939> ok<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.810> i<00:02:30.109> guarantee<00:02:30.439> you

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
already started ok and i guarantee you

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.190 
already started ok and i guarantee you
there<00:02:31.879> will<00:02:31.909> still<00:02:32.359> be<00:02:32.420> water<00:02:32.780> sources

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
there will still be water sources

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.860 
there will still be water sources
underneath<00:02:33.950> these<00:02:34.220> obsidian<00:02:34.790> blocks<00:02:35.060> alright

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
underneath these obsidian blocks alright

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.839 
underneath these obsidian blocks alright
so<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.989> first<00:02:39.019> step<00:02:39.439> is<00:02:39.829> to<00:02:39.920> create<00:02:40.639> a

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
so the first step is to create a

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.000 
so the first step is to create a
platform<00:02:41.329> that<00:02:42.109> is<00:02:42.590> 14<00:02:43.250> x<00:02:43.879> 14<00:02:44.739> made<00:02:45.739> out<00:02:45.889> of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
platform that is 14 x 14 made out of

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.190 
platform that is 14 x 14 made out of
obsidian<00:02:46.609> i'm<00:02:47.420> going<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.629> do<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.870> up<00:02:48.049> in<00:02:48.139> the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
obsidian i'm going to do this up in the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.589 
obsidian i'm going to do this up in the
air<00:02:48.379> so<00:02:48.739> you<00:02:48.829> can<00:02:49.040> see<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:51.620> place<00:02:52.280> blocks

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
air so you can see it just place blocks

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.170 
air so you can see it just place blocks
obviously<00:02:53.599> i'm<00:02:53.840> flying<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:55.519> most<00:02:55.939> likely

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
obviously i'm flying you most likely

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.940 
obviously i'm flying you most likely
won't<00:02:56.540> be<00:02:56.780> if<00:02:57.079> you're<00:02:57.290> in<00:02:57.470> creative<00:02:57.919> mode

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
won't be if you're in creative mode

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.099 
won't be if you're in creative mode
there's<00:02:58.909> no<00:02:59.269> reason<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.569> make<00:02:59.659> one<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.019> these

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
there's no reason to make one of these

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.940 
there's no reason to make one of these
just<00:03:00.709> spawn<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.159> ice<00:03:01.310> ok<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:02.720> I'm<00:03:03.560> going<00:03:03.769> to<00:03:03.859> go

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
just spawn the ice ok so I'm going to go

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.259 
just spawn the ice ok so I'm going to go
14<00:03:04.489> blocks<00:03:04.760> in<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.959> direction<00:03:06.230> 1<00:03:06.919> 2<00:03:07.069> 3<00:03:07.099> 4<00:03:07.760> 5<00:03:08.239> 6

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and then we're

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.659 
7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and then we're
going<00:03:13.939> to<00:03:14.000> go<00:03:14.150> 14<00:03:14.659> in<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:16.010> direction<00:03:16.220> that's

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
going to go 14 in this direction that's

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:24.879 
going to go 14 in this direction that's
2<00:03:17.000> 3<00:03:17.510> 4<00:03:17.989> 5<00:03:18.440> 6<00:03:18.470> 7<00:03:19.250> 8<00:03:19.669> 9<00:03:19.970> 10<00:03:20.419> 11<00:03:20.810> 12<00:03:21.590> 13<00:03:21.829> 14<00:03:22.729> and<00:03:23.889> then

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and then

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.979 
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and then
we<00:03:25.430> just<00:03:25.639> carry<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.199> out<00:03:27.199> this<00:03:27.590> direction<00:03:27.979> 14

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
we just carry it out this direction 14

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.430 
we just carry it out this direction 14
and<00:03:30.459> over<00:03:31.459> here<00:03:31.639> 14<00:03:32.329> and<00:03:32.690> then<00:03:32.840> we<00:03:32.959> fill<00:03:33.169> it<00:03:33.199> in

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
and over here 14 and then we fill it in

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.640 
and over here 14 and then we fill it in
ok<00:03:34.069> I'm<00:03:34.280> going<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.519> do<00:03:34.669> that<00:03:35.229> but<00:03:36.229> first<00:03:36.409> i'm

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
ok I'm going to do that but first i'm

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.259 
ok I'm going to do that but first i'm
going<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.829> show<00:03:36.949> you<00:03:36.979> that<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.790> ice<00:03:37.940> is

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
going to show you that the ice is

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.460 
going to show you that the ice is
regenerating<00:03:40.750> alright<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.109> we've<00:03:42.319> got<00:03:42.440> a

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
regenerating alright so we've got a

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.460 
regenerating alright so we've got a
platform<00:03:43.010> it's<00:03:43.220> 14<00:03:43.609> x<00:03:43.760> 14<00:03:43.790> if<00:03:44.540> it's<00:03:44.690> snowing<00:03:45.229> in

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
platform it's 14 x 14 if it's snowing in

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.500 
platform it's 14 x 14 if it's snowing in
your<00:03:45.709> Tyga<00:03:46.220> which<00:03:46.639> by<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:46.879> way<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.120> have<00:03:47.389> to

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
your Tyga which by the way you have to

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.939 
your Tyga which by the way you have to
do<00:03:47.599> this<00:03:47.720> in<00:03:47.930> taiga<00:03:48.319> I<00:03:48.470> don't<00:03:48.680> know<00:03:48.769> if<00:03:48.829> you're

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
do this in taiga I don't know if you're

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.250 
do this in taiga I don't know if you're
aware<00:03:49.129> of<00:03:49.190> that<00:03:49.430> but<00:03:50.030> water<00:03:50.299> only<00:03:50.479> freezes<00:03:51.079> in

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
aware of that but water only freezes in

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.469 
aware of that but water only freezes in
taiga<00:03:51.799> so<00:03:52.040> clearly<00:03:52.639> you<00:03:52.940> have<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.180> build<00:03:53.389> it

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479 
taiga so clearly you have to build it

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.899 
taiga so clearly you have to build it
there<00:03:53.690> ice<00:03:54.169> is<00:03:54.500> regenerating<00:03:55.159> alright<00:03:55.760> next

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
there ice is regenerating alright next

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.909 
there ice is regenerating alright next
step<00:03:56.329> what<00:03:56.750> we're<00:03:56.870> going<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.049> do<00:03:57.169> is<00:03:57.319> go<00:03:57.439> up<00:03:57.470> one

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
step what we're going to do is go up one

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.119 
step what we're going to do is go up one
and<00:03:58.159> out<00:03:58.519> one<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.680> we're<00:04:00.680> just<00:04:00.799> going<00:04:00.919> to

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
and out one and we're just going to

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.640 
and out one and we're just going to
create<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.060> border<00:04:02.540> around<00:04:02.720> this<00:04:03.049> whole<00:04:03.319> thing

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
create a border around this whole thing

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.610 
create a border around this whole thing
one<00:04:04.519> block<00:04:04.760> hi<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.840> is<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.229> to<00:04:06.319> hold<00:04:06.439> the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
one block hi this is just to hold the

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.159 
one block hi this is just to hold the
water<00:04:06.799> in<00:04:07.069> I'm<00:04:07.669> going<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.849> do<00:04:08.030> that<00:04:08.299> I<00:04:08.599> think

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
water in I'm going to do that I think

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.800 
water in I'm going to do that I think
you<00:04:09.290> can<00:04:09.439> manage<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:10.009> rest<00:04:10.329> all<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.599> have<00:04:11.689> to

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
need to go underneath and so we're going

to go up that high and now we're do

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.900 
to go up that high and now we're do
doing<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.110> all<00:04:27.380> I'm<00:04:27.650> doing<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.370> all<00:04:28.639> in

mode what you're going to need to do is

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.740 
mode what you're going to need to do is

like this and you're going to do this

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.060 
like this and you're going to do this
all<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:43.910> way<00:04:44.240> down<00:04:44.509> on<00:04:44.750> this<00:04:44.930> side<00:04:45.199> and<00:04:45.860> all

all the way down on this side and all

all the way down on this side and all
the<00:04:46.190> way<00:04:46.310> down<00:04:46.520> on<00:04:46.789> the<00:04:47.120> side<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.360> your<00:04:47.600> choice

but it needs to be next to this one let
me<00:04:53.060> show<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.180> what<00:04:53.389> I'm<00:04:53.479> talking<00:04:53.509> about<00:04:53.810> here

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
me show you what I'm talking about here

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.640 
me show you what I'm talking about here
we<00:04:54.169> go<00:04:54.770> this<00:04:55.190> way<00:04:55.490> or<00:04:55.840> you<00:04:56.840> can<00:04:56.990> go<00:04:57.110> over<00:04:57.139> here

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
we go this way or you can go over here

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.969 
we go this way or you can go over here
and<00:04:57.710> do<00:04:57.919> it<00:04:57.949> on<00:04:58.190> this<00:04:58.789> side<00:04:59.530> once<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.770> have

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
and do it on this side once you have

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.070 
and do it on this side once you have
this<00:05:01.310> like<00:05:01.610> this<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:02.000> want<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.270> break<00:05:02.600> the

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
this like this you want to break the

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.500 
this like this you want to break the
stone<00:05:03.400> this<00:05:04.400> is<00:05:04.580> why<00:05:04.760> you're<00:05:04.940> not<00:05:04.970> doing<00:05:05.389> it

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
stone this is why you're not doing it

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.020 
stone this is why you're not doing it
with<00:05:05.600> obsidian<00:05:05.930> I<00:05:06.470> could<00:05:07.310> do<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.520> with<00:05:07.760> all

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
with obsidian I could do it with all

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.730 
with obsidian I could do it with all
obsidian<00:05:08.660> because<00:05:08.960> I'm<00:05:09.080> in<00:05:09.199> creative<00:05:09.710> mode

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
obsidian because I'm in creative mode

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.610 
obsidian because I'm in creative mode
but<00:05:10.220> I'm<00:05:10.460> just<00:05:10.760> demonstrating<00:05:11.479> how<00:05:12.169> you<00:05:12.229> would

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
but I'm just demonstrating how you would

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.170 
but I'm just demonstrating how you would
build<00:05:12.800> it<00:05:12.979> alright<00:05:13.760> it's<00:05:14.479> it's<00:05:15.260> pretty<00:05:15.560> simple

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
build it alright it's it's pretty simple

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.580 
build it alright it's it's pretty simple
now<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.240> reason<00:05:17.539> why<00:05:17.870> we're<00:05:18.050> breaking<00:05:18.500> the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
now the reason why we're breaking the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.020 
now the reason why we're breaking the
blocks<00:05:18.860> in<00:05:19.190> between<00:05:19.940> is<00:05:21.039> first<00:05:22.039> of<00:05:22.310> all<00:05:22.460> we

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
blocks in between is first of all we

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.570 
blocks in between is first of all we
don't<00:05:23.180> need<00:05:23.630> water<00:05:24.470> sources<00:05:24.889> there<00:05:25.190> we<00:05:25.400> only

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
don't need water sources there we only

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.510 
don't need water sources there we only
need<00:05:25.849> water<00:05:26.090> sources<00:05:26.449> every<00:05:26.930> other<00:05:27.050> block<00:05:27.520> the

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
need water sources every other block the

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.180 
need water sources every other block the
other<00:05:28.789> thing<00:05:29.360> is<00:05:29.900> that<00:05:29.960> if<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:30.949> actually

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
other thing is that if you actually

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.080 
other thing is that if you actually
place<00:05:32.150> those<00:05:32.479> blocks<00:05:32.870> there<00:05:33.199> ice<00:05:33.889> may<00:05:34.849> not

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
place those blocks there ice may not

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.020 
place those blocks there ice may not
form<00:05:35.389> anywhere<00:05:36.289> in<00:05:36.470> here<00:05:36.500> at<00:05:36.770> all<00:05:36.919> it's<00:05:37.639> kind

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
form anywhere in here at all it's kind

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.879 
form anywhere in here at all it's kind
of<00:05:38.210> buggy<00:05:38.449> but<00:05:38.870> trust<00:05:39.199> me<00:05:39.289> on<00:05:39.470> this<00:05:39.590> i<00:05:39.770> was

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
of buggy but trust me on this i was

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.469 
of buggy but trust me on this i was
working<00:05:40.220> on<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.340> glowstone<00:05:40.849> version<00:05:41.300> and

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
working on a glowstone version and

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.779 
working on a glowstone version and
discovered<00:05:41.990> that<00:05:42.110> if<00:05:42.289> you<00:05:42.440> put<00:05:42.979> a<00:05:43.159> solid<00:05:43.610> line

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
discovered that if you put a solid line

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.830 
discovered that if you put a solid line
over<00:05:44.180> this<00:05:44.300> thing<00:05:44.800> ice<00:05:45.800> won't<00:05:46.130> form<00:05:46.599> you<00:05:47.599> might

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
over this thing ice won't form you might

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.450 
over this thing ice won't form you might
can<00:05:48.080> get<00:05:48.199> it<00:05:48.289> working<00:05:48.409> but<00:05:48.830> there's<00:05:49.039> no<00:05:49.190> reason

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
can get it working but there's no reason

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.600 
can get it working but there's no reason
to<00:05:49.760> do<00:05:50.060> it<00:05:50.090> because<00:05:50.389> this<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.229> going<00:05:52.099> to<00:05:52.370> take

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
to do it because this is going to take

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.310 
to do it because this is going to take
care<00:05:53.000> of<00:05:53.180> it<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.599> just<00:05:53.810> need<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.080> place<00:05:54.289> a

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
care of it you just need to place a

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.950 
care of it you just need to place a
water<00:05:54.710> source<00:05:55.270> underneath<00:05:56.270> each<00:05:56.539> of<00:05:56.840> these

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
water source underneath each of these

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.620 
water source underneath each of these
obsidian<00:05:57.500> blocks<00:05:57.800> okay<00:05:58.280> directly<00:05:59.240> underneath

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
obsidian blocks okay directly underneath

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.960 
obsidian blocks okay directly underneath
each<00:05:59.960> one<00:06:00.409> and<00:06:01.030> that<00:06:02.030> should<00:06:02.539> stabilize<00:06:02.960> and

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
each one and that should stabilize and

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.540 
each one and that should stabilize and
create<00:06:04.970> infinite<00:06:05.720> water<00:06:06.050> all<00:06:06.590> over<00:06:06.620> this

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
create infinite water all over this

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.520 
create infinite water all over this
thing<00:06:07.610> those<00:06:08.270> are<00:06:08.419> the<00:06:08.510> only<00:06:08.630> places<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.199> need

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
to place the water and it's stable

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.939 
to place the water and it's stable
alright<00:06:13.070> that's<00:06:13.970> it<00:06:14.240> it's<00:06:14.780> done<00:06:14.960> you<00:06:15.680> don't

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
alright that's it it's done you don't

need to place torches up there if you
don't<00:06:17.479> want<00:06:17.720> to<00:06:17.870> and<00:06:18.110> as<00:06:18.199> you<00:06:18.380> can<00:06:18.530> see<00:06:18.560> it's

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
don't want to and as you can see it's

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.730 
don't want to and as you can see it's
already<00:06:19.250> generating<00:06:20.199> all<00:06:21.199> right<00:06:21.349> let's<00:06:21.590> go

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
already generating all right let's go

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.950 
already generating all right let's go
over<00:06:21.889> to<00:06:22.010> the<00:06:22.130> other<00:06:22.280> one<00:06:22.520> it's<00:06:23.449> not<00:06:23.659> quite

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
over to the other one it's not quite

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.360 
over to the other one it's not quite
full<00:06:24.229> so<00:06:24.500> I'm<00:06:24.620> going<00:06:24.770> to<00:06:24.800> cut<00:06:24.979> the<00:06:25.070> footage

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
full so I'm going to cut the footage

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.339 
full so I'm going to cut the footage
here<00:06:25.699> and<00:06:25.909> we'll<00:06:26.240> come<00:06:26.449> back<00:06:26.810> once<00:06:27.470> it<00:06:27.710> is<00:06:27.740> and

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
here and we'll come back once it is and

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:32.649 
here and we'll come back once it is and
there<00:06:30.349> you<00:06:30.500> go<00:06:30.820> completely<00:06:31.820> refilled<00:06:32.510> with

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:32.659 
there you go completely refilled with

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.219 
there you go completely refilled with
ice<00:06:33.169> I<00:06:33.729> may<00:06:34.729> have<00:06:34.909> cheated<00:06:35.180> a<00:06:35.450> block<00:06:35.690> or<00:06:35.719> two<00:06:35.900> in

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:36.229 
ice I may have cheated a block or two in

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.230 
ice I may have cheated a block or two in
but<00:06:36.500> for<00:06:36.529> the<00:06:36.740> most<00:06:36.860> part<00:06:36.979> I<00:06:37.340> was

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
but for the most part I was

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.760 
but for the most part I was
experimenting<00:06:38.630> with<00:06:38.900> some<00:06:39.169> stairs

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
experimenting with some stairs

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.180 
experimenting with some stairs
first<00:06:39.860> I<00:06:40.069> did<00:06:40.430> something<00:06:40.729> like<00:06:40.849> this<00:06:41.060> and<00:06:42.190> this

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
first I did something like this and this

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.760 
first I did something like this and this
one<00:06:43.400> didn't<00:06:43.639> want<00:06:43.759> to<00:06:43.819> form<00:06:44.440> but<00:06:45.440> it<00:06:45.590> may<00:06:45.740> just

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
one didn't want to form but it may just

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.909 
one didn't want to form but it may just
be<00:06:46.099> random<00:06:46.690> anyway<00:06:47.690> I<00:06:47.900> just<00:06:48.440> threw<00:06:48.590> them<00:06:48.680> over

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
be random anyway I just threw them over

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.200 
be random anyway I just threw them over
here<00:06:49.069> so<00:06:49.280> I<00:06:49.340> could<00:06:49.400> get<00:06:49.580> from<00:06:49.789> here<00:06:49.940> to<00:06:50.000> here

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
here so I could get from here to here

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.999 
here so I could get from here to here
without<00:06:50.389> flying<00:06:50.840> and<00:06:51.229> then<00:06:51.319> I<00:06:51.440> turned<00:06:51.650> flying

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:52.009 
without flying and then I turned flying

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.600 
without flying and then I turned flying
on<00:06:52.250> so<00:06:52.879> anyway<00:06:53.870> that's<00:06:54.620> it<00:06:54.889> you<00:06:55.220> notice<00:06:55.490> there

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
on so anyway that's it you notice there

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.119 
on so anyway that's it you notice there
are<00:06:55.699> no<00:06:55.729> torches<00:06:56.180> here<00:06:56.690> and<00:06:56.930> it<00:06:57.139> still<00:06:57.530> follows

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:58.129 
are no torches here and it still follows

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:00.700 
are no torches here and it still follows
the<00:06:58.310> same<00:06:58.580> rule<00:06:59.090> if<00:06:59.419> you<00:06:59.690> place<00:06:59.960> a<00:06:59.990> block<00:07:00.349> above

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
the same rule if you place a block above

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.939 
the same rule if you place a block above
it<00:07:00.919> it<00:07:01.340> will<00:07:01.580> not<00:07:01.849> form<00:07:02.240> ice<00:07:02.539> that's<00:07:03.470> the<00:07:03.770> key

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949 
it it will not form ice that's the key

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.909 
it it will not form ice that's the key
to<00:07:04.099> many<00:07:04.280> of<00:07:04.460> the<00:07:04.610> designs<00:07:04.879> out<00:07:05.210> there<00:07:05.270> so<00:07:05.930> what

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
to many of the designs out there so what

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.740 
to many of the designs out there so what
are<00:07:06.949> they<00:07:07.069> using<00:07:07.250> pistons<00:07:07.520> for<00:07:07.970> what<00:07:08.569> are<00:07:08.690> they

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 
are they using pistons for what are they

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.140 
are they using pistons for what are they
using<00:07:08.900> redstone<00:07:09.349> for<00:07:09.800> I<00:07:10.129> don't<00:07:10.849> have<00:07:10.940> a<00:07:11.000> clue

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
using redstone for I don't have a clue

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.249 
using redstone for I don't have a clue
anyway<00:07:11.930> that's<00:07:12.650> it<00:07:12.949> and<00:07:13.599> hope<00:07:14.599> you<00:07:14.810> enjoyed
