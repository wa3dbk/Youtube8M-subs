00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.799
 well followed barcelona sony proposes two 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.450
 range basis 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.240
 I would immediately start at the price because of it 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.189
 having a Sony phone in your pocket is enough 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.660
 in this case 129 euros then 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.529
 interesting the proposition of 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.500
 low end 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.420
 we have of e 4 and 4 2 that unites the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:34.809
 word is a dual sim 3g ee 4 and 4g 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.210
 because it is a lg phone they differ 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.799
 also for the size of the display 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.080
 you see 5 inches on one side 47 inches 

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:46.420
 on the other and we start from 2 to 145 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.909
 grams of weight therefore quite light 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.680
 an interesting feature is that of the 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.350
 interchangeable covers mind just do 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.949
 one person at the bottom opens two sims that 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.260
 expansion for the for sd from 8 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.420
 Gigabytes of integrated memory we challenge 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.909
 all for 5 megapixel rear 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.740
 the classic 2-megapixel front 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.630
 circular button that also on this 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.729
 basilia but does not abandon us here in place 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.469
 middle of the buttons for the volume above 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.320
 micro usb headphone jack and underneath 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:20.200
 the hole for the exit back here 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.729
 of the system speaker we unlock 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.609
 the display is a qh of 960 x 540 pixels 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.789
 see the experience while being on a 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:32.109
 range bar remains the same or nearly the same 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.899
 same as top of the range because 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:37.289
 sony interface remains unchanged 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.759
 including cover all those 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.700
 program settings for the 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.670
 multimedia then workman album walls 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.850
 and of playstation we go in the settings 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.909
 to see what processor and mounts open 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.520
 all system 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.740
 we started or android version 444 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.329
 kirk will hardly be updated 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.780
 android is my tex 65 82 1.3 ghz quad 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.649
 core 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.319
 we have a gigabyte of ram memory like 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.330
 you see it's still fluid it doesn't seem to me 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.330
 have particular imposition in which 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.120
 we don't have wifi though I have to 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.730
 say that at least in the home 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.610
 turn it turns really well we have the minis 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.519
 up as is tradition as is tradition 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.599
 sony is available in two colors 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.360
 black and white show the 4g here it is 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.829
 here we light 4g a display a little 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.319
 smaller but otherwise 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.760
 characteristics are always the same 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.680
 the interchangeable cover is always the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.870
 battery from the battery excuse the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.959
 5 megapixel camera behind from 2 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.989
 I didn't tell you one megapixel in front 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.709
 battery we have a 2,300 milian per hour 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.709
 on this 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.530
 on this 4g of course it's always 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.489
 present the possibility of the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.090
 stamina 444 stamina android version 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.180
 that the management system of 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.599
 Battery of the money you see here what you 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.590
 this is a little quick this 4g 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:13.919
 compared to the dual we have a tech menu 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.349
 67 32 1.5 gb quad core 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:19.440
 even here a gigabyte of ram memory 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.870
 always 8 gigabytes of integrated memory 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.849
 with the possibility of installing also 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.609
 here a micro sd 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.280
 these phones despite being basij 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.579
 memory range 129 euros have it anyway 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.889
 the sony experience also in the camera 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.959
 see the appropriate to add 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.190
 applications that can be downloaded 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.890
 from the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.900
 from the play store and all the various ones 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.560

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.560
 the rf really very loved above all 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.960
 by the youngest, in short, two phones 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.460
 which convince especially for the 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:02.900
 prestigious proposition 129 euros 133 71 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.900
