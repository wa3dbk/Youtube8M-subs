00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 a year ago this full frame 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.450
 SUV has undergone sang upgrade 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.679
 Yong Rexton 2 in the transmission test 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.380
 about a year ago yong rexton himself 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.389
 has undergone a small elevator new 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.949
 Optics new body parts 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.360
 as well as a slightly updated interior 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.369
 betrayed rexton fresh look interior 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.050
 on the one hand modern and on the other 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.600
 hand we recently tested the volume 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.040
 Aktion actor so here on his background he 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.680
 of course a little bit already 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.630
 ragnu is not archaic if there is definitely not from 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.059
 the future is amazing the fact that rexton 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.160
 being a class above acton as well 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.780
 perceptibly surpassing it in price did not get 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.820
 large abundance of options which is less 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.750
 fellow but charging the phone problems 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.120
 definitely will not occur 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.790
 as many as 3 cigarette lighter in this place 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.830
 but the most unusual of such decisions is not yet 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.549
 saw this cigarette lighter right here 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.900
 which allows you to include here 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.390
 DVR or radar detector and not 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.670
 have wires dangling in front of you 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.460
 instead of the driver itself is quite convenient 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.239
 I don't like these polished quasi 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.040
 wooden steering wheel inserts 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.440
 too big, which also confirms only 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.299
 its off-road assignment many options 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.690
 control displayed on the steering wheel in even 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.710
 for some reason, the levers of the buttons toggle 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.080
 gears in quasi mechanical mode 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.990
 transmission control just two modes 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.630
 everything includes all-wheel drive normal 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.880
 live gear and downgrades blown here 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.920
 where ships usually work with light 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.350
 4 h4n 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.390
 here are two buttons hill holder and 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.340
 disable traction control system 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.380
 and it works here as soon as you press 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.700
 immediately disconnected 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.750
 no bmw have to wait until he agrees 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.490
 technical rexton is real 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.590
 SUV management which is not 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.780
 requires no effort or skill all 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.850
 intuitively simple and understandable by the way 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.290
 already quite goes to base 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.340
 elegant footboard 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:04.040
 Well, he certainly big trunk 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.470
 Unfortunately nothing here does not open 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.019
 rises but a lot of comfortable pockets 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.510
 why does not rise does not open 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.310
 because there is no spare wheel here is the bottom 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.760
 the trunk is not available to us 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.629
 she surprised the mysterious button 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.940
 lock yes here so tick for what it 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.250
 for the one who hides in the trunk of pens 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.490
 but here for both right-handed and left-handed 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.850
 still here is an additional 3 such for 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.230
 guarantees 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.770
 it's time to find out how the rex behaves 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.770
 then on the road 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.410
 by the way power steering this hydra here 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.060
 hydra to another entirely than to assets but 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.190
 he is a bit like just 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.590
 traditional diesel suv lulu 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.660
 they are about the suspension after all they are cool 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.450
 doing here is the suspension leading so not even 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.520
 multi-link in our configuration yes 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.610
 us independent however he 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.500
 comfortable enough yes not enough 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.600
 learning to me seems very comfort even 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.080
 more comfortable than akteon yes but it is heavier 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.190
 because it is inert mass of course 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.959
 rexton suspension is so good 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.850
 balanced that riding on asphalt 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.440
 delivers only comfort we decided 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.620
 check whether positive 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.450
 emotions where the road ends trimming 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.120
 don't hear a suspension at all 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.550
 can you hear it really plastic squeaks 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.050
 and so silence is surprisingly very simple 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.140
 power steering 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.530
 how to become powerful all the time he steering almost 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.410
 in non informative very easy all the time 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.150
 moreover, but on it here on rush yurka 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.980
 like actin in principle 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.160
 thoughts did not arise even 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.300
 wishes measured machines such a 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.810
 How much does he weigh 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.370
 it seems about two tons even a little more 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.880
 at least in all inertness 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:07.020
 it feels like it's 2 102 100 to 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.540
 how guessed guessed did not guess it takes and 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.380
 weighed but all this is any kind of gullies 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.820
 basically normal here so as if 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.760
 starts starting to appreciate 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.410
 easy steering because not the slightest 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.000
 difficulties it causes, we do not 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.540
 saw the passport data on paper 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.710
 decided rudely of course to measure yourself and 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.680
 subjectively to us from harry it seemed that he 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.050
 must accelerate 13th 15 seconds 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.890
 spotted it turned out 11 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.930
 so here it is, hyper hasty 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.250
 which is 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.110
 subjectively experienced actually 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.110
 maybe illusory 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.780
 that text is real frame 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.280
 SUV for real money from him 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.930
 no impressive dynamics or 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.910
 stunning appearance and 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.860
 the interior looks a bit outdated but 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.900
 the real element of this car is on 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.250
 off road suspension is so comfortable 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.140
 that passenger they feel any 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.270
 uneven asphalt is even a chur 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.220
 easy causing discomfort on level 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.080
 road justifies itself when driving 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.550
 on the road with all this rexton 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.230
 deserves the title of one of the best 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.690
 SUVs of their price range 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.580
 base for rexton requests 1 million one hundred 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.140
 ninety nine thousand rubles what does 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.970
 its one of the cheapest frame 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.860
 SUVs cost provided 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.470
 us car in picking comfort 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.220
 plus is 1 million four hundred 19 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.930
 thousand rubles 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.760
 thank you for providing the test 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.980
 drive car official dealer 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.430
 I eat Krasnoyarsk auto center Kraz 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.430
 gas service
