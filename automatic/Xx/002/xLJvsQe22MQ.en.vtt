00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
cookies that have just come out of the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.590 
cookies that have just come out of the
oven<00:01:18.830> a<00:01:19.160> little<00:01:19.760> bit<00:01:19.970> Brown<00:01:20.150> there<00:01:20.330> but<00:01:20.450> that's

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
oven a little bit Brown there but that's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.720 
oven a little bit Brown there but that's
okay<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.140> then<00:01:21.440> here<00:01:21.650> are<00:01:21.710> my<00:01:21.770> new<00:01:21.950> ones<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.550> go

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
okay and then here are my new ones to go

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.760 
okay and then here are my new ones to go
in<00:01:22.910> okay<00:01:23.480> so<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.720> next<00:01:23.840> step<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.260> to<00:01:24.440> stick<00:01:24.650> it

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
in okay so the next step is to stick it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.220 
in okay so the next step is to stick it
together<00:01:24.920> now<00:01:25.810> usually<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:26.930> would<00:01:27.020> make

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
together now usually you would make

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.740 
together now usually you would make
royal<00:01:27.470> icing<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.250> then<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:28.790> would<00:01:28.970> pipe

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
royal icing and then you would pipe

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.470 
royal icing and then you would pipe
around<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:30.500> little<00:01:30.860> of<00:01:31.040> heart<00:01:31.250> put<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.270> next

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
around this little of heart put the next

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.040 
around this little of heart put the next
one<00:01:32.510> on<00:01:32.720> top<00:01:32.930> pipe<00:01:33.500> put<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.010> next<00:01:34.250> one<00:01:34.280> on<00:01:34.400> top

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
one on top pipe put the next one on top

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.690 
one on top pipe put the next one on top
but<00:01:36.050> I<00:01:36.350> can't<00:01:36.650> be<00:01:36.740> bothered<00:01:36.860> making<00:01:37.070> royal

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
but I can't be bothered making royal

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.330 
but I can't be bothered making royal
icing<00:01:37.850> I've<00:01:38.330> got<00:01:38.480> some<00:01:38.630> ganache<00:01:38.780> here<00:01:39.410> so<00:01:40.190> what

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.590 
icing I've got some ganache here so what
I've<00:01:40.460> just<00:01:40.490> done<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.750> just<00:01:41.990> put<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.290> ganache

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
and I'm just going to use that because

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.720 
and I'm just going to use that because
that<00:01:46.700> will<00:01:46.850> stick<00:01:47.150> pretty<00:01:47.420> well<00:01:51.280> ideally<00:01:52.280> you

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
that will stick pretty well ideally you
