reason why we wanted to show you this

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.999 
reason why we wanted to show you this
level<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.779> addition<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> being<00:00:31.500> something

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
level in addition to it being something

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.830 
level in addition to it being something
you<00:00:32.189> guys<00:00:32.309> you've<00:00:32.489> never<00:00:32.610> seen<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.270> hopefully

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
you guys you've never seen and hopefully

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.069 
you guys you've never seen and hopefully
we<00:00:34.050> think<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.380> very<00:00:34.680> impressive<00:00:36.079> graphically

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
we think is very impressive graphically

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.630 
we think is very impressive graphically
and<00:00:37.260> also<00:00:37.530> there's<00:00:37.739> material<00:00:38.280> things<00:00:38.460> are

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and also there's material things are

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.910 
and also there's material things are
happening<00:00:38.969> with<00:00:39.180> time<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.930> day<00:00:40.050> changes<00:00:40.620> can

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
happening with time of day changes can

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920 
happening with time of day changes can
happen<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.430> low<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.239> other<00:00:42.360> reason<00:00:42.570> why<00:00:42.809> we

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
happen is low the other reason why we

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.090 
happen is low the other reason why we
wanted<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> show<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.590> level<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:43.980> I'm

the<00:01:41.380> reason<00:01:41.770> why<00:01:41.890> we<00:01:42.070> really<00:01:42.430> wanted<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.729> the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
the reason why we really wanted to the

really shooting fireballs that's fine

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.800 
really shooting fireballs that's fine
that's<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.710> projectile<00:01:48.280> type<00:01:48.579> of<00:01:48.759> pain<00:01:48.939> but

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
that's a projectile type of pain but

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.139 
that's a projectile type of pain but
