00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
knife marks and we've used the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.530 
knife marks and we've used the
countertops<00:00:55.750> as<00:00:56.880> you<00:00:57.880> know<00:00:58.000> just<00:00:58.239> a<00:00:58.390> regular

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
countertops as you know just a regular

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.209 
countertops as you know just a regular
Formica<00:00:59.140> countertop<00:00:59.380> we<00:00:59.890> haven't<00:01:00.130> done

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
Formica countertop we haven't done

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.970 
Formica countertop we haven't done
anything<00:01:00.489> special<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:02.050> can<00:01:02.230> see<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.590> edges

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
anything special you can see the edges

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:12.449 
anything special you can see the edges
right<00:01:03.160> in<00:01:03.280> front<00:01:03.430> of<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.579> sink<00:01:09.539> so<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.950> think

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:12.459 
right in front of the sink so I think

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.489 
right in front of the sink so I think
the<00:01:12.759> countertop<00:01:13.240> transformations<00:01:14.170> have<00:01:14.350> done

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:14.499 
the countertop transformations have done

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:15.840 
the countertop transformations have done
a<00:01:14.530> really<00:01:14.799> good<00:01:14.950> job<00:01:15.009> I<00:01:15.280> think<00:01:15.549> they<00:01:15.789> were

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
a really good job I think they were

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.730 
a really good job I think they were
worth<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.119> money<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:16.749> I<00:01:17.649> would<00:01:17.799> do<00:01:17.979> it<00:01:18.130> again

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
hot pans and different things on here

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.330 
hot pans and different things on here
and<00:01:35.859> and<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.729> just<00:01:36.969> can't<00:01:37.270> see<00:01:38.139> it<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.950> edges

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
and and you just can't see it the edges

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.519 
and and you just can't see it the edges
have<00:01:39.459> held<00:01:39.700> up<00:01:39.909> real<00:01:40.179> well<00:01:40.359> that's<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.200> part<00:01:41.409> I

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:41.529 
have held up real well that's the part I

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:44.029 
have held up real well that's the part I
thought<00:01:41.770> was<00:01:41.920> going<00:01:42.069> to<00:01:42.189> maybe<00:01:42.639> be<00:01:42.909> a<00:01:42.939> problem

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
thought was going to maybe be a problem

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.899 
thought was going to maybe be a problem
but<00:01:45.039> it's<00:01:45.189> held<00:01:45.399> up<00:01:45.549> really<00:01:45.609> well<00:01:46.029> and<00:01:47.909> these

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
but it's held up really well and these

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.159 
but it's held up really well and these
countertops<00:01:49.450> get<00:01:49.749> used<00:01:50.049> a<00:01:50.229> lot<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.659> would

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:53.169 
countertops get used a lot so I would

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:55.080

say<00:01:53.319> that<00:01:53.529> this<00:01:53.679> rust-oleum<00:01:54.340> countertop

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090
