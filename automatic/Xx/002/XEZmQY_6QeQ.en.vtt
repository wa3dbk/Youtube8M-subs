00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:13.170
 crappy well all guys like you 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.710
 paul ii is that we are here with a new 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.920
 video I will show you one of the most houses 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.590
 small in minecraft that although precisely 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.350
 is very small it contains most 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.480
 part of the fundamental tools for 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.670
 a normal survival 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.380
 now I'll show you a little how the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.030
 what is composed and then I will move on to 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.370
 tutorial on how to build the though 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.820
 in the end it is nothing so complicated 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.879
 is a very normal home that as a base a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.059
 two for two blocks and as height is 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.870
 high two or three if we also count the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.670
 underground floor I put two doors here 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.860
 to avoid creating additional thickness 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.449
 and two wooden doors but you can put 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.079
 also in iron 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.300
 just stick a lever on it or 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.800
 however a button for April 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.470
 close here and you are inside the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.420
 home here is a trap door to avoid 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.549
 access to the mods from the alt but like vi 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.310
 I will explain later it will not serve I will explain 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.760
 after its usefulness 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.670
 we have a workbench in front of us 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.920
 we have an anvil on this side 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.360
 below we have a very useful ces that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.890
 it can be opened because the anvil is not 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.810
 regarded as the solid block 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.280
 we have a still here in the case 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.229
 we want to prepare some 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.540
 potions here a nice torch for 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.310
 allow you to get a nice one 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.950
 lighting as you can all see 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.460
 around otherwise sports fauners had i 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.900
 mob 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.820
 we have a table or of the enchanted and 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.220
 last but not least the bed 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.060
 we suffer no minimum damage 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.140
 we see that we are in fact modality 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.970
 survival we sleep we get up 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.509
 we sell knocked out of the house but 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.390
 however the damage we have for nothing 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.159
 and now I will show you how precisely this 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.990
 home desist during the night 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.909
 and I explain to you I was explaining to him that 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.429
 this time the here 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.380
 does not have the functionality of only 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.599
 keep out mobs that might arrive 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.330
 from above also that although as you see 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.769
 it is not possible to go upstairs here because 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.519
 they are all two blocks therefore neither 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.110
 zombie nor clipper nor merani skeletons 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.400
 because spiders take up more than one block 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.299
 only then they could not even 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.239
 enter from here precisely fail to ad 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.440
 enter its usefulness at home and 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.330
 place it here in such a way as to 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.970
 consider yourself closed because if it were 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.690
 open the creepers could jump into 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.030
 air 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.400
 if instead we close it it is as if we were 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.940
 within a species of barrier in 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.340
 whose clippers do not see us and in which 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.319
 skeletons can't hit us now 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.829
 we put in game mode 0 and the important thing is 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.450
 stay in this corner here and there 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.060
 to bend down in this way to pour mo 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.349
 invisible to any mob 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.760
 of course it would be advised to sleep 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.879
 inside our of our bed 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.260
 of course if there are mobs in the 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.340
 circumstances is not not possible 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.380
 to sleep 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.810
 the advice would be precisely that of o 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.239
 wait for the night here the problem that 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.540
 precisely being very small it is easy 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.519
 that the mobs see but if you are in fact 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.849
 push this corner towards the corner 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:27.690
 here left here we say so and press 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.819
 shift to chinar you will be sure to 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.459
 hundred percent no way you will see 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.109
 no one zombie will fall by not 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.919
 for vile balls here now have come 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.660
 because I opened the door but you can 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.630
 rest assured 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.060
 another case would be to open the hatch 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.090
 close it and move even further towards 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.530
 left so as to be at maximum 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.319
 invisible at most around now in the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.840
 creative mode to show you the 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.840
 construction of the house 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.090
 and here we are as you can see 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.150
 practically all our tools a 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.180
 part the torch can be 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.650
 contained within the eight spaces 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.509
 available so this is also a 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.820
 pretty good thing i'm in now 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:16.470
 creative but I repeat you fallen survival 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.889
 it really doesn't take anything you need 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.359
 only tools that and utensils 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.009
 what we have here 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.600
 let's start with digging up a 4x4 block 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:30.090
 within which we place the 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.630
 our beautiful net alongside the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.479
 bed 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.060
 we press the right button to place a 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.400
 friend and our chest our head 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.580
 we can shoot as main like 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.860
 so let's put it at least a little more 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.250
 cute facing the bed from above 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.729
 ces we press shift and press the key 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.759
 right to place the anvil we can 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.440
 put it straight wrong I prefer 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.479
 put the straight just to give a 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.270
 sense of continuity but eventually changes 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.490
 really little other step always 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.539
 on the friend this time we press 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.900
 shift and position the furnace also the 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:12.120
 furnace does not have a sense from which we must 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.069
 turn it then we turn it towards 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.680
 the bed to make it a little more 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.990
 cute always happening shift e 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.479
 positioning ourselves on our bed 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.940
 above the pillow to be exact too 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.340
 if in the end we can put it from this one 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.310
 part that makes no difference we place the 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.220
 working table working poor man cv come 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.780
 it is not called the last passages 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.160
 that earlier and shift because a 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.410
 press shift for those that don't 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.470
 know if we don't press shift it will open 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.759
 with the right button the furnace the evil the 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.670
 workbench if we take instead 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:47.740
 schiff positions us on the 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.930
 the object we want to place without 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.750
 make us too many stories 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.850
 then always pressing shift from 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.730
 high part not with the low one but that one 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.830
 high of our enchanting table 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.510
 Gione first right to place a 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.880
 slide that can be wood as can 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.190
 be of pity and so on and we have 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.560
 concluded this this part there 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.520
 it remains that to insert the doors to insert 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.470
 The doors 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.420
 we enter the house before a 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.280
 right click right key and we have 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.090
 concluded 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:22.950
 practically the walls we are left with 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.390
 take the wooden hatch and porcia 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.930
 enter inside the house presses 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:31.060
 shift close to the furnace or even to the 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.370
 working benz eo also no to the tav 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.020
 of the caster no apologies to the work in 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.760
 belgium to the furnace where you like best 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.030
 I put it next to the furnace e 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.160
 just place with the right 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.670
 last step that results anyway 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.170
 important and place the trap door is not there 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.690
 will not serve 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.940
 it will not be enough to place the trapdoor state 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.620
 careful square will be on this side here and 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.750
 not on other sides because otherwise not 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.390
 will work 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.570
 and here we have our beautiful 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:04.510
 very pure little house 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.970
 but despite being small every single one 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:10.570
 cube is used best and in 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:12.460
 really effective way I leave you with 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.340
 this version which is the one I have 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.230
 experimented that it works at 100 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.220
 percent for video you enjoyed 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:23.260
 left a nice one if you feel that 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.690
 this house can be effective given it 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.650
 between and everything and see you in the next 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.650
 nice video 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.030
 we
