Chad was right there kind of just in the
corner<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.150> think<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.900> looked<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> me<00:01:22.259> like

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
corner and I think it looked to me like

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
corner and I think it looked to me like
a<00:01:22.500> Stewart<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.310> Chad<00:01:23.790> wasn't<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.270> Stewart

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
a Stewart if Chad wasn't there Stewart

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.789 
a Stewart if Chad wasn't there Stewart
would<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.780> crashed<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.170> his<00:01:25.290> own<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.650> you

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
would have crashed on his own but you

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.960 
would have crashed on his own but you
know<00:01:25.920> Chad<00:01:26.159> was<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:26.909> of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
know Chad was there it just kind of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.249 
know Chad was there it just kind of
stopped<00:01:27.299> him<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.570> end<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.780> taking<00:01:27.810> them<00:01:28.140> both

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
stopped him and end up taking them both

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.050 
stopped him and end up taking them both
down<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.740> i<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.460> berm<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:29.970> was

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
down but i think that berm there was

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.010 
down but i think that berm there was
there<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.299> Stewart<00:01:30.630> would<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.840> been<00:01:30.930> in

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
there I think Stewart would have been in

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.999 
there I think Stewart would have been in
the<00:01:31.140> stands<00:01:31.409> man<00:01:31.710> he<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the stands man he would a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.649 
the stands man he would a
whiskey-throttled<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.880> there<00:01:33.090> yeah<00:01:33.360> yeah<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
whiskey-throttled up there yeah yeah it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.539 
whiskey-throttled up there yeah yeah it
was<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> crazy<00:01:34.049> move<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.770> know<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
was a crazy move but you know that's the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.740 
was a crazy move but you know that's the
way<00:01:35.640> Stewart<00:01:35.909> rise<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> he<00:01:36.390> said<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
way Stewart rise and he said that the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.120 
way Stewart rise and he said that the
