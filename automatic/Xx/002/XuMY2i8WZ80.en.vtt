question<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.140> think<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:16.430> very<00:02:16.700> difficult<00:02:17.000> to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
question I think it's very difficult to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.990 
question I think it's very difficult to
say<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.870> people<00:02:18.080> before<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.709> law<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.220> he's

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
say the people before the law and he's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.650 
say the people before the law and he's
gone

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:33.870 

this<00:02:25.320> was<00:02:25.530> how<00:02:25.680> his<00:02:25.980> innings<00:02:26.220> ended

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.920 

but<00:02:34.450> easily<00:02:34.750> cleared<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.500> rounder<00:02:36.930> that

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
but easily cleared the rounder that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:51.309 
but easily cleared the rounder that
brings<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.380> innings<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.860> close

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.660 

the<00:02:52.319> captain<00:02:52.709> should<00:02:52.860> be<00:02:52.980> attacking<00:02:53.459> from<00:02:53.580> the
