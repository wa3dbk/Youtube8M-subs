00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.450
 welcome to a new video on the day of 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.500
 Today I bring you my top 5 apps 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.680
 Photography 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.590
 the first one that I'm going to show you is 360 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.300
 panorama as its name tells us 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.080
 allows to take with the help of the gyroscope 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.700
 panoramic photos in 360 degrees if you do 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.619
 the photographs very carefully 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.350
 they can be perfect, even if 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.590
 you do fast or with bad lighting 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.059
 these do not go as well as expected 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.739
 after capturing the panorama you can 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.600
 save your photo in your album or 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.460
 share it on social networks in addition to 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.180
 that you can visualize it from different 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.330
 shapes 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.330
 d 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.470
 the next application that I will show you 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.180
 It is camera plus that allows us to take 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.070
 pictures I'm going to take the ones from the 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.290
 library to then edit the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.720
 you can make cuts add filters 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.610
 frames or labels this is the application 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.290
 more complete to edit photos that 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.079
 you can find 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.610
 the third place is for after focus a 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.650
 application that will give us the option of 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.100
 focus or make the focus effect more 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.770
 notorious in a photograph I spent it very 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.119
 well this and it works very simple what 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.770
 only thing you have to do is 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.229
 select what is the part you want 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.270
 focus and what is your background logically 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.150
 the more carefully you do it the better 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.430
 it will come out later you can modify the 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.550
 intensity of background blur 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.440
 and add filters in addition from the same 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.140
 You can share the photos to networks 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.149

 second place is diptych a very 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.560
 different from the others with this one you will be able 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.630
 merge several photos into one of a 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.340
 very peculiar way since they use 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.520
 quadrangular figures to join the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.320
 photos you can modify the frame and the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.509

 share photos the best of the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.830
 application is that you can take pictures 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.290

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.290
