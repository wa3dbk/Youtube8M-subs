macerated berries a few mint leaves

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.750 
macerated berries a few mint leaves
we'll<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.040> find<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.430> those

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.030 

we<00:01:58.760> go<00:01:59.140> stir<00:02:00.140> those<00:02:00.320> through<00:02:00.560> John<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.920> then

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
we go stir those through John and then
