00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
camera on a balloon is very tough so

camera on a balloon is very tough so
that<00:01:14.570> 11<00:01:15.470> million<00:01:15.650> dollars<00:01:16.040> won't<00:01:16.250> even<00:01:16.369> get

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
that 11 million dollars won't even get

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.580 
that 11 million dollars won't even get
the<00:01:16.610> job<00:01:16.820> done<00:01:16.850> apparently<00:01:17.840> it's<00:01:17.960> way<00:01:18.140> harder

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
the job done apparently it's way harder

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.550 
the job done apparently it's way harder

started not available they didn't know
origin<00:01:37.189> unknown<00:01:37.420> then<00:01:38.420> eventually<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:39.470> came

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
origin unknown then eventually it came

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.679 
origin unknown then eventually it came
out<00:01:39.829> with<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:40.009> 10,000<00:01:40.640> year<00:01:40.759> orbital<00:01:41.210> timeline

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
out with a 10,000 year orbital timeline

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.990 
out with a 10,000 year orbital timeline
I<00:01:41.900> asked<00:01:42.500> him<00:01:42.590> how<00:01:43.100> they<00:01:43.280> got<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:43.640> where<00:01:43.880> they

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
I asked him how they got this where they

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.399 
I asked him how they got this where they
got<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:44.329> but<00:01:44.540> they<00:01:44.630> never<00:01:44.810> gave<00:01:45.079> me<00:01:45.290> an

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
got this but they never gave me an

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.230 
got this but they never gave me an
answer<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:46.009> then<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.700> few<00:01:46.909> days<00:01:47.090> before

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
answer and then a few days before

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.200 
answer and then a few days before
perihelion<00:01:47.750> they<00:01:48.680> came<00:01:48.890> out<00:01:48.979> with<00:01:49.040> a<00:01:49.210> 400,000

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
perihelion they came out with a 400,000

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.260 
perihelion they came out with a 400,000
year<00:01:50.630> plus<00:01:51.020> orbital<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.189> then<00:01:52.579> within<00:01:52.759> 24

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
year plus orbital and then within 24

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.020 
year plus orbital and then within 24
hours<00:01:53.299> they<00:01:53.750> came<00:01:53.899> out<00:01:53.990> with<00:01:54.049> a<00:01:54.200> new<00:01:54.229> orbital

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
hours they came out with a new orbital

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.370 
hours they came out with a new orbital
580<00:01:57.369> 2666<00:01:58.369> your<00:01:59.210> orbital<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.020> then<00:02:00.229> they

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
580 2666 your orbital and then they

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.609 
580 2666 your orbital and then they
changed<00:02:00.409> it<00:02:00.890> again<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:01.729> then<00:02:01.850> at<00:02:02.030> conference

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
changed it again and then at conference

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.679 
changed it again and then at conference
some<00:02:03.619> dude<00:02:03.799> said<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.280> million<00:02:04.850> year<00:02:05.180> orbital

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
some dude said a million year orbital

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.120 
some dude said a million year orbital
tried<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.320> make<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.469> video<00:02:06.649> about<00:02:06.920> them

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
tried to make a video about them

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.770 
tried to make a video about them
changing<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.790> orbit<00:02:08.119> but<00:02:08.450> they<00:02:08.570> kept

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
changing you orbit but they kept

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.210 
changing you orbit but they kept
changing<00:02:09.049> in<00:02:09.350> orbit<00:02:09.649> well<00:02:09.829> I<00:02:09.860> was<00:02:09.979> trying<00:02:10.040> to

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
changing in orbit well I was trying to

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.590 
changing in orbit well I was trying to
make<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.519> video<00:02:10.670> about<00:02:10.850> them<00:02:11.030> changing<00:02:11.510> you

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
make the video about them changing you

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.050 
make the video about them changing you
orbit<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.500> then<00:02:12.680> Thanksgiving<00:02:13.430> came<00:02:13.700> first

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
orbit so then Thanksgiving came first

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.690 
orbit so then Thanksgiving came first
and<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:15.050> there<00:02:15.200> was<00:02:15.260> perihelion<00:02:15.620> they<00:02:16.520> had<00:02:16.670> a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
and then there was perihelion they had a

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.750 
and then there was perihelion they had a

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
where to set the cameras so there was a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.770 
where to set the cameras so there was a
big<00:02:31.439> hubbub<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.950> much<00:02:32.159> to<00:02:32.310> do<00:02:32.489> about<00:02:32.640> SEO<00:02:33.569> is

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
big hubbub and much to do about SEO is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.970 
big hubbub and much to do about SEO is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
close-ups of the Sun and so when Ison

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.759

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
so then because they didn't see it they

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.800 
so then because they didn't see it they
assumed<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.829> evaporated<00:02:59.489> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.819> Sun<00:03:00.120> they

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.259 
assumed it evaporated in the Sun they

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
look something has survived so that I

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.550 
look something has survived so that I
started<00:03:32.910> say<00:03:33.090> oh<00:03:33.120> yeah<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.750> nucleus<00:03:34.199> is<00:03:34.349> gone

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.259 
started say oh yeah the nucleus is gone
so<00:03:34.799> now<00:03:34.859> all<00:03:35.010> that's<00:03:35.340> left<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:35.940> debris

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
so now all that's left is the debris

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.930 
so now all that's left is the debris
field<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.440> tail<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:38.340> looks<00:03:38.639> like<00:03:38.699> they

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
field and the tail it looks like they

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.909

were<00:03:39.000> wrong<00:03:39.239> about<00:03:39.389> that<00:03:39.480> too<00:03:39.720> they're<00:03:40.620> guess

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
were wrong about that too they're guess

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.830 
were wrong about that too they're guess
that<00:03:41.129> it<00:03:41.190> was<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.310> headless<00:03:41.760> comment<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.750> I

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
that it was a headless comment and I

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.050 
that it was a headless comment and I
guess<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.379> headless<00:03:43.980> comet<00:03:44.400> it's<00:03:44.609> better<00:03:44.910> than

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
guess a headless comet it's better than

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.180 
guess a headless comet it's better than
a<00:03:45.120> headless<00:03:45.540> marriage<00:03:45.989> what<00:03:46.709> does<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:46.829> mean

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
a headless marriage what does that mean

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.119 
a headless marriage what does that mean
I<00:03:47.400> don't<00:03:47.639> know<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.910> never<00:03:48.030> married<00:03:48.510> before<00:03:49.129> okay

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129

that they pointed the cameras in the
wrong<00:05:29.640> direction<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.840> we<00:05:31.050> really<00:05:31.260> did<00:05:31.500> not<00:05:31.650> get

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
wrong direction so we really did not get

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.460 
wrong direction so we really did not get
any<00:05:32.070> type<00:05:32.400> of<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.640> look<00:05:32.990> accommodation<00:05:33.990> at<00:05:34.170> all
