the essence when you're growing grapes
for<00:00:15.240> wine<00:00:15.269> especially<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.470> Reds<00:00:16.680> you're<00:00:17.190> very

for wine especially for Reds you're very

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.120 
for wine especially for Reds you're very
much<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> edge<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.539> terms<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:19.050> too<00:00:19.949> much

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
much on the edge in terms of too much

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.010 
much on the edge in terms of too much
stress<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.730> too<00:00:20.910> little<00:00:21.090> stress<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
stress and too little stress and so the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.080 
stress and too little stress and so the
push<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> always<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:23.039> more<00:00:23.250> stressed<00:00:23.640> but

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
push is always to do more stressed but

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.060 
push is always to do more stressed but
if<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.420> weather<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.900> adverse<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.650> terms<00:00:25.920> that
