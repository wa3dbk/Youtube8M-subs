start from the button when you place

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.399 
start from the button when you place
this<00:01:30.090> case<00:01:32.150> because<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.420> much<00:01:33.630> easier<00:01:33.659> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
this case because it's much easier that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.820 
this case because it's much easier that
way

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.660 

all<00:01:40.370> right<00:01:41.170> now<00:01:42.170> as<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.530> can<00:01:42.740> see<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:43.340> case

all right now as you can see this case

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.490 
all right now as you can see this case
fits<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.450> galaxy<00:01:44.960> s6<00:01:45.320> really<00:01:46.100> will<00:01:47.230> it's<00:01:48.230> it's

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
fits the galaxy s6 really will it's it's

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.590 
fits the galaxy s6 really will it's it's
very<00:01:49.450> firmly<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:52.820> was<00:01:53.420> designed

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
very firmly and it was designed

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.950 
very firmly and it was designed
perfectly<00:01:54.080> for<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.800> galaxy<00:01:55.100> s6<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:56.600> can<00:01:56.780> see

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
perfectly for the galaxy s6 you can see

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.830 
perfectly for the galaxy s6 you can see
that<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.170> cutouts<00:01:57.650> for<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.600> charging<00:01:59.600> port

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
that the cutouts for the charging port

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.770 
that the cutouts for the charging port
and<00:02:00.260> audio<00:02:00.620> port<00:02:00.920> are<00:02:01.280> for<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.330> charging

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
and audio port are for the charging

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.580 
and audio port are for the charging
cable<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.530> audio<00:02:04.400> cable<00:02:04.820> are<00:02:05.230> perfect

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.350 

the<00:02:09.590> cut<00:02:09.800> off<00:02:09.830> for<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.310> camera<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.790> flash<00:02:11.090> are

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
the cut off for the camera and flash are

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.900 
the cut off for the camera and flash are
also<00:02:13.900> designed<00:02:14.900> were<00:02:15.860> designed<00:02:16.340> really<00:02:16.730> well

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
also designed were designed really well

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.140 
also designed were designed really well
but<00:02:17.860> as<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.040> can<00:02:19.190> see<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.580> camera<00:02:19.820> is<00:02:20.120> not

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
but as you can see the camera is not

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.770 
but as you can see the camera is not
placed<00:02:20.810> deep<00:02:21.500> enough<00:02:21.800> within<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.310> case<00:02:22.780> so

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
placed deep enough within the case so

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.120 
placed deep enough within the case so
that<00:02:24.140> means<00:02:24.440> over<00:02:25.160> time<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:27.350> will<00:02:27.380> see

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
that means over time you will see

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.000 
that means over time you will see
scratches<00:02:28.580> on<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.630> camera<00:02:30.050> because<00:02:30.530> it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
scratches on the camera because it

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.010 
scratches on the camera because it
touches<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.640> surface<00:02:31.940> when<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.480> face<00:02:32.750> your

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
touches the surface when you face your

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.250 
touches the surface when you face your
s6<00:02:33.709> on<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.010> back<00:02:34.360> which<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.930> real

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
s6 on the back which is a real

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.949 
s6 on the back which is a real
disadvantage<00:02:37.040> in<00:02:37.640> our<00:02:38.480> opinion<00:02:40.630> but<00:02:41.630> other

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
disadvantage in our opinion but other

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.350 
disadvantage in our opinion but other
than<00:02:42.260> this<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.800> case<00:02:43.130> provides<00:02:43.940> really

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
than this this case provides really

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.009 
than this this case provides really
great<00:02:45.080> protection<00:02:45.620> for<00:02:46.040> your<00:02:46.070> screen<00:02:46.959> as<00:02:47.959> you

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
great protection for your screen as you

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.520 
great protection for your screen as you
can<00:02:48.380> see<00:02:48.739> there<00:02:49.580> is<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.760> very<00:02:50.090> generous<00:02:50.840> raised

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
can see there is a very generous raised

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.720 
can see there is a very generous raised
lip<00:02:52.239> around<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.980> means<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.459> will<00:02:55.670> be
