special teams I feel that's a little too

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.330 
special teams I feel that's a little too
easy<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.659> other<00:01:36.810> than<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.110> man<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.860> enjoy

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
easy but other than that man I do enjoy

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.280 
easy but other than that man I do enjoy
the<00:01:38.700> new<00:01:38.850> punting<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> kick<00:01:39.960> returns

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the new punting and all the kick returns

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.249 
the new punting and all the kick returns
and<00:01:40.530> crap<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.689> they<00:01:43.049> did

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
and crap like that so you know they did

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.789 
and crap like that so you know they did
good<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> rest<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.520> now<00:01:45.680> going<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
good on the rest of that now going to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.160 
good on the rest of that now going to
the<00:01:46.890> offensive<00:01:47.310> side<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.850> ball<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.360> think

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the offensive side of the ball I think

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.620 
the offensive side of the ball I think
that<00:01:49.350> they<00:01:49.520> overpowered<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.000> run<00:01:51.299> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that they overpowered that run and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.170 
that they overpowered that run and
commit<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.799> way<00:01:53.220> too<00:01:53.280> much<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:54.060> if

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
commit like way too much like if

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.359 
commit like way too much like if
somebody<00:01:54.450> run<00:01:54.659> commits<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.770> they<00:01:56.130> guess

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
somebody run commits and they guess

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.389 
somebody run commits and they guess
right<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.100> probably

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
right but you know it's just probably

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.120 
right but you know it's just probably
gonna<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> negative<00:02:00.409> yardage<00:02:01.409> for<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
gonna be a negative yardage for you and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.550 
gonna be a negative yardage for you and
you<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.390> real<00:02:03.600> life<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:04.020> all<00:02:04.049> know<00:02:04.350> when

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
you know in real life we all know when

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.380 
you know in real life we all know when
somebody's<00:02:04.920> gonna<00:02:05.070> run<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> gut<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
somebody's gonna run up the gut but it

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.639 
somebody's gonna run up the gut but it
doesn't<00:02:06.719> mean<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.869> you're<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> stop

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
doesn't mean that you're going to stop

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.139 
doesn't mean that you're going to stop
him<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.009> backfield<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.879> know<00:02:09.000> one

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
him in the backfield you know one

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.609 
him in the backfield you know one
hundred<00:02:09.360> percent<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> time<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> think

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
hundred percent of the time so I think

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.690 
hundred percent of the time so I think
that<00:02:10.879> is<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.940> little<00:02:12.239> bit

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
that is a little bit

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.059 
that is a little bit
overpowered<00:02:13.330> first<00:02:13.840> off<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:14.950> know

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
overpowered first off and you know

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.199 
overpowered first off and you know
that's<00:02:15.250> going<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.489> hinder<00:02:15.670> your<00:02:15.849> often

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
that's going to hinder your often

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.449 
that's going to hinder your often

actually just gotten used to it and it's

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.360 
actually just gotten used to it and it's
actually<00:03:27.370> pretty<00:03:27.609> enjoyable<00:03:28.030> there<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:29.370> you

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
actually pretty enjoyable there so you

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.559 
actually pretty enjoyable there so you
know<00:03:30.489> I<00:03:30.519> don't<00:03:30.670> have<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.000> problem<00:03:31.269> with<00:03:31.450> that

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
know I don't have a problem with that

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.300 
know I don't have a problem with that
they're<00:03:31.989> now<00:03:32.170> moving<00:03:32.290> on<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.709> defensive

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
they're now moving on to the defensive

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.580 
they're now moving on to the defensive
side<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.670> ball<00:03:34.170> there<00:03:35.170> is<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.319> lot<00:03:35.530> of

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
side of the ball there is a lot of

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.069 
side of the ball there is a lot of
improvement<00:03:36.280> but<00:03:36.639> there<00:03:36.940> is<00:03:37.060> some<00:03:37.299> critical

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
improvement but there is some critical

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.340 
improvement but there is some critical
critical<00:03:38.680> flaws<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.810> really<00:03:40.810> hinder<00:03:41.200> the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
critical flaws that really hinder the

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.940 
critical flaws that really hinder the
game<00:03:41.620> um<00:03:42.480> one<00:03:43.480> of<00:03:43.630> them<00:03:43.780> being<00:03:43.959> obviously<00:03:44.680> that

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
game um one of them being obviously that

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.740 
game um one of them being obviously that
you<00:03:45.100> guys<00:03:45.250> can't<00:03:45.579> tackle<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.030> quarterback<00:03:46.540> on

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
you guys can't tackle the quarterback on

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.160 
you guys can't tackle the quarterback on
a<00:03:46.780> sack<00:03:48.180> but<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.329> other<00:03:49.510> thing<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:49.989> the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
a sack but the other thing is the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.940 
a sack but the other thing is the
compressed<00:03:50.709> sets<00:03:51.010> on<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.970> man<00:03:52.299> alignment<00:03:52.950> for

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
compressed sets on the man alignment for

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.080 
compressed sets on the man alignment for
some<00:03:54.160> reason<00:03:54.459> if<00:03:54.549> you're<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.790> compressed

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
some reason if you're in a compressed

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.449 
some reason if you're in a compressed
set<00:03:55.359> the<00:03:55.510> outside<00:03:55.959> corner<00:03:56.410> will<00:03:56.560> sit<00:03:56.799> like<00:03:57.280> a

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
set the outside corner will sit like a

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.059 
set the outside corner will sit like a
few<00:03:57.700> feet<00:03:58.299> or<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.599> yard<00:03:58.900> or<00:03:59.049> so<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.349> the<00:03:59.650> outside

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
few feet or a yard or so to the outside

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.440 
few feet or a yard or so to the outside
of<00:04:00.099> your<00:04:00.220> wide<00:04:00.430> receiver<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.000> won't<00:04:01.209> line<00:04:01.420> up

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
of your wide receiver and won't line up

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.440 
of your wide receiver and won't line up
directly<00:04:01.930> over<00:04:02.349> him<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:03.340> one<00:04:03.609> he<00:04:03.880> can't<00:04:04.150> jam

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
directly over him so one he can't jam

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.720 
directly over him so one he can't jam
them<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:04.870> secondly<00:04:05.440> this<00:04:05.980> causes<00:04:06.489> all<00:04:06.700> kinds

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
them and secondly this causes all kinds

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.849 
them and secondly this causes all kinds
of<00:04:07.299> you<00:04:07.599> know<00:04:07.630> problems<00:04:08.200> from<00:04:08.349> a<00:04:08.470> defender

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
of you know problems from a defender

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.620 
of you know problems from a defender
because<00:04:09.160> he's<00:04:09.280> takes<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.669> step<00:04:09.880> forward<00:04:09.910> and

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
because he's takes a step forward and

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.629 
because he's takes a step forward and
towards<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.349> wide<00:04:11.590> receiver<00:04:12.010> while<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.489> wide

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
towards the wide receiver while the wide

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.520 
towards the wide receiver while the wide
receivers<00:04:13.120> stepping<00:04:13.780> towards<00:04:14.079> him<00:04:14.319> and

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
receivers stepping towards him and

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.650 
receivers stepping towards him and
obviously<00:04:15.220> if<00:04:15.730> they're<00:04:15.910> going<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.209> opposite

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
obviously if they're going the opposite

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.060 
obviously if they're going the opposite
direction<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.289> wide<00:04:17.440> receivers<00:04:17.859> going<00:04:18.010> to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
direction the wide receivers going to

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.789 
direction the wide receivers going to
end<00:04:18.250> up<00:04:18.370> open<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:19.060> majority<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:19.989> time<00:04:20.289> so

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
end up open a majority of the time so

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.750 
end up open a majority of the time so
that<00:04:21.159> right<00:04:21.669> there<00:04:21.729> becomes<00:04:22.270> a

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
that right there becomes a

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.420 
that right there becomes a
the<00:04:23.720> Y<00:04:23.870> receiver<00:04:24.290> you<00:04:24.830> know<00:04:24.950> there's<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.220> lot<00:04:25.250> of

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
the Y receiver you know there's a lot of

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.310 
the Y receiver you know there's a lot of
ways<00:04:25.640> you<00:04:25.670> can<00:04:25.910> exploit<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.660> man<00:04:26.870> coverage

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
ways you can exploit the man coverage

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.000 
ways you can exploit the man coverage
using<00:04:27.800> that<00:04:28.450> but<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:30.050> know<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.620> right

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
using that but you know that that right

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.710 
using that but you know that that right
there<00:04:31.040> is<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.370> problem<00:04:31.670> within<00:04:31.940> itself<00:04:32.420> is<00:04:32.690> just

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
there is a problem within itself is just

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.770 
there is a problem within itself is just
that<00:04:33.140> man<00:04:33.530> alignment<00:04:34.220> on<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:35.210> other<00:04:35.390> thing

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
that man alignment on the other thing

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.330 
that man alignment on the other thing
defensively<00:04:36.470> I<00:04:36.950> guess<00:04:37.730> would<00:04:37.970> be<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.630> know

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
defensively I guess would be you know

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.550 
defensively I guess would be you know
the<00:04:40.340> ability<00:04:40.790> of<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.120> four-man<00:04:41.630> rush<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:42.290> you

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
the ability of the four-man rush and you

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.590 
the ability of the four-man rush and you
know<00:04:42.680> just<00:04:42.890> a<00:04:42.980> five-man<00:04:43.550> rush<00:04:43.850> like<00:04:44.120> without

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
know just a five-man rush like without

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.800 
know just a five-man rush like without
bringing<00:04:44.960> any<00:04:45.290> exotic<00:04:45.770> blitzes<00:04:46.190> it's

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
bringing any exotic blitzes it's

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.200 
bringing any exotic blitzes it's
extremely<00:04:47.810> difficult<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.410> get<00:04:48.590> coverage<00:04:49.210> not

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
extremely difficult to get coverage not

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.750 
extremely difficult to get coverage not
coverage<00:04:50.570> but<00:04:50.720> passed<00:04:51.020> pressure<00:04:51.730> again<00:04:52.730> I

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
coverage but passed pressure again I

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.500 
coverage but passed pressure again I
mean<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.540> defensive<00:04:54.380> lines<00:04:54.620> just<00:04:55.070> don't

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
mean the defensive lines just don't

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.450 
mean the defensive lines just don't
really<00:04:56.510> get<00:04:56.720> in<00:04:56.930> how<00:04:57.230> I<00:04:57.260> feel<00:04:57.650> they<00:04:57.830> should<00:04:57.860> i

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
really get in how I feel they should i

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.790 
really get in how I feel they should i
wish<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.880> offensive<00:04:59.300> i<00:04:59.780> think<00:05:00.710> they

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
wish the offensive i think they

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.870 
wish the offensive i think they
definitely<00:05:00.920> improved<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.460> offensive

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
definitely improved the offensive

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.940 
definitely improved the offensive
interaction<00:05:02.630> but<00:05:02.750> i<00:05:02.810> think<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:03.260> defensive

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
interaction but i think the defensive

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.370 
interaction but i think the defensive
interaction<00:05:04.580> with<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:05.200> offensive<00:05:06.200> line

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
interaction with the offensive line

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.370 
interaction with the offensive line
could<00:05:06.890> be<00:05:06.920> a<00:05:07.040> lot<00:05:07.400> better<00:05:07.870> but<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:09.110> know<00:05:09.140> again

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
could be a lot better but you know again

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.800 
could be a lot better but you know again
I<00:05:09.620> guess<00:05:10.190> that's<00:05:10.430> nitpicking<00:05:10.700> but<00:05:11.120> I<00:05:11.300> think<00:05:11.660> it

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
I guess that's nitpicking but I think it

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.570 
I guess that's nitpicking but I think it
does<00:05:11.960> affect<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.980> outcome<00:05:13.370> of<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.550> game

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
does affect the outcome of the game

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.450 
does affect the outcome of the game
quite<00:05:14.030> a<00:05:14.090> bit<00:05:14.710> now<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:15.800> next<00:05:15.890> thing<00:05:16.250> we'll

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
quite a bit now the next thing we'll

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.150 
quite a bit now the next thing we'll
talk<00:05:16.670> about<00:05:16.790> his<00:05:16.970> presentation<00:05:17.690> because<00:05:17.810> I<00:05:18.290> I

enjoy the presentation for the most part

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.680 
enjoy the presentation for the most part
but<00:05:21.620> there<00:05:21.950> is<00:05:22.160> you<00:05:22.730> know<00:05:22.760> this<00:05:23.060> lighting<00:05:23.480> the

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
but there is you know this lighting the

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.300 
but there is you know this lighting the
new<00:05:23.810> lighting<00:05:24.260> system<00:05:24.620> they<00:05:24.710> got<00:05:24.890> which<00:05:25.130> is

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
new lighting system they got which is

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.140 
new lighting system they got which is
cool<00:05:25.580> and<00:05:25.880> a<00:05:25.970> great<00:05:26.180> idea<00:05:26.630> but<00:05:27.620> I<00:05:27.920> think<00:05:28.640> it's<00:05:29.060> a

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
cool and a great idea but I think it's a

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.300 
cool and a great idea but I think it's a
little<00:05:29.360> bit<00:05:29.540> extreme<00:05:30.170> I'm<00:05:30.530> going<00:05:30.950> to<00:05:31.010> show<00:05:31.190> an

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
little bit extreme I'm going to show an

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.040 
little bit extreme I'm going to show an
example<00:05:31.610> at<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.000> end<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.240> this<00:05:32.330> video<00:05:32.510> of<00:05:32.870> this

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
example at the end of this video of this

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.870 
example at the end of this video of this
game<00:05:33.290> at<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.560> beginning<00:05:34.040> and<00:05:34.220> at<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.340> end<00:05:34.610> and

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
game at the beginning and at the end and

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.580 
game at the beginning and at the end and
remind<00:05:35.240> you<00:05:35.450> that<00:05:35.630> this<00:05:35.780> is<00:05:35.930> a<00:05:36.020> four-minute

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
remind you that this is a four-minute

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.640 
remind you that this is a four-minute
quarter<00:05:37.340> game<00:05:37.610> in<00:05:37.970> US<00:05:38.150> unless<00:05:38.510> they're<00:05:39.110> going

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
quarter game in US unless they're going

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.100 
quarter game in US unless they're going
off<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.950> assumption<00:05:40.400> that<00:05:40.430> you<00:05:41.180> know<00:05:41.330> this<00:05:42.080> is

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
off the assumption that you know this is

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.680 
off the assumption that you know this is
a<00:05:42.260> full<00:05:42.590> regulation<00:05:43.250> NCAA<00:05:43.700> game<00:05:43.940> on<00:05:44.120> Saturday

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
a full regulation NCAA game on Saturday

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.840 
a full regulation NCAA game on Saturday
then<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.380> know<00:05:45.500> that<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.980> timing<00:05:46.310> for<00:05:46.820> that

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
then you know that the timing for that

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.610 
then you know that the timing for that
they're<00:05:47.300> lighting<00:05:47.630> in<00:05:47.960> there<00:05:48.080> shading<00:05:48.500> is

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
they're lighting in there shading is

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.210 
they're lighting in there shading is
completely<00:05:49.250> off<00:05:49.750> also<00:05:50.750> with<00:05:50.960> that<00:05:51.200> I<00:05:51.380> find<00:05:52.070> it

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
completely off also with that I find it

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.750 
completely off also with that I find it
really<00:05:52.580> difficult<00:05:52.730> to<00:05:53.300> see<00:05:53.600> us<00:05:54.470> especially<00:05:55.370> in

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
really difficult to see us especially in

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.030 
really difficult to see us especially in
Virginia<00:05:56.120> Tech<00:05:56.330> Stadium<00:05:56.840> in<00:05:57.020> the<00:05:57.500> second<00:05:57.860> half
