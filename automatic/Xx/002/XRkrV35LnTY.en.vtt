 despite the defections of the cube i 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.460
 drive red could not get there 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.890
 Christmas season Untitled 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.350
 course of the no 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.990
 wali karzai so games to a product e 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.700
 developed the ifo challenges rivals from them 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.510
 new interpretation of the famous 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.550
 brand name 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.960
 before leaving you to the review vi 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.520
 I wanted to remember to register them at 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.350
 our channel the nightmare as well as of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.539
 follow one of Italy obviously on the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.710
 his website as well as how 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.710
 facebook and on life 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.810
 the central theme that integrates several 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.610
 are the estimates and pursuits with the 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.050
 police who in dozens of other titles 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.880
 similar have been the glue for 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.600
 through consistent to the limit of the code 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.880
 criminal 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.980
 this time, however, there is something new for the 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.989
 player I can do separate socials 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.090
 one as a fugitive and a conversion 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.280
 of the law you choose one or the other 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.660
 the other basic structure does not change 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.220
 or what was in chrome 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.470
 quite classic in which players 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.150
 they must take on numerous challenges for 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.580
 being able to unlock the smaller of the two e 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.110
 upgrades escaping the police 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.360
 taking refuge within them 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.190
 hiding in the guise of a cop 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.290
 of the road prescribes double fairings 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.120
 I like making life impossible 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.890
 fugitives stopping their raids a 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.690
 sound of ramming in coordination with 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.420
 of the m3 that can assist us 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.790
 in the prevention work of the film e 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.979
 talk refugees are generally races of 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.560
 speed with other pirates of the road and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.880
 escapes from clouds of bird 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.040
 superaccessoriate by policeman yes 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.290
 it's about tracking single fugitive TV 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.299
 or in groups trying to arrest them first 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.859
 that the competition reaches land 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.420
 coming early fight said 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.860
 peaceful in general 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.810
 it is not enough to conclude the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.220
 successful mission often indeed 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.650
 we must meet certain conditions 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.960
 before returning to the clear base the 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.610
 mission accomplished the first condition is 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.890
 that of the accumulation of script points 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.170
 they are the measure of our performance 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.729
 based on how much and we catch 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.289
 successfully executed and of some 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.210
 spectacular maneuver we have accomplished 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.950
 using the micro or using i 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.080
 gadget and used to sabotage the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.430
 opponent cars not just the game 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.740
 requires a precise number of 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.659
 ramming or even destruction a 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.459
 eye opponents are not lacking also 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.019
 completions of certain missions a 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.760
 time limit tracked for now 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.400
 approved that like many of the part is 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.989
 so that the gameplay is therefore a 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.940
 continuous reinterpretation of these 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.620
 things because they can be run on 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.330
 all roads of the court to fictitious 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.190
 of telepiÃ¹ where the game takes place 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.900
 successfully complete the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.850
 missions of the two careers has a double 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.650
 effect to access the cars 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.209
 present in the game and unlocking the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.100
 usable gadgets to get 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.380
 immediate benefits during the race 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.000
 the presence of gadgets and a confirmation 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.910
 of nature totally to ask you 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.859
 rivals using the cost of the cost is 60 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.540
 immediate and pleasant habitability 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.549
 even using the most powerful cars 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.750
 the icing on the gameplay cake is 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.880
 however represented by 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.890
 drive functionality in the menus of the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.600
 configuration we can in fact decide 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.950
 if you compete alone do not allow 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.390
 to the other players hands to enter 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.269
 in our session as 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.010
 fugitives or policemen in this case 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.959
 one of the users comes the causes of the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.519
 game on which a pa will appear 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.370
 also other human players that yes 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.500
 will mix at 21 and check 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.180
 the more us exponentially increasing the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.400
 fun you can get from 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.870
 game has unfortunately not all gold they 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.519
 what glitters in the sense that 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.349
 not watching phenomena and collisions 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.000
 perfectly calibrated render 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.280
 difficult to ram with precision 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.280
 opponent while slaloming between the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.930
 cars at 280 then in this order a 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.909
 the quality and gameplay in the 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.560
 most populated gaming sessions know 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.790
 really everything happens to 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.590
 reform 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.959
 we also need to report a couple of 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.060
 any design what a technical choice 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.190
 not very happy that rai la salda separates 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.900
 top of the corsistic genre let's start 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.579
 from the total lack of a plot from 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.590
 dealing with art between the conversion of 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.510
 two careers there are no protagonists in 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.709
 meat bones and all the cutscenes and are 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.269
 rather to us 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.700
 also away from back seeks to 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.349
 festivities the bottom of the gameplay though 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.239
 very mitigated by the desire to arrive 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.680
 to unlock super bowl and how to 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.349
 ferrari enzo with the lamborghini 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.760
 aventador of this aspect is balanced 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.409
 from a first - rate graphic design 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.269
 scenarios to say that I am beautiful 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.340
 also for the use of textures comes 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.019
 done thanks to environments that in the turn of 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.660
 a few miles spies not from the desert 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.130
 at the cliff cars are also a lot 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.200
 beautiful but the quantity of elements 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.239
 devastated by the runway that makes rai 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.489
 the result is really excellent 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.470
 the choice is however penalized overall 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.109
 of developers to limit everything to 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.060
 30 frames per second to even out 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.490
 the ethical codes to that of the consoles 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.840
 also the excel file while praising 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.639
 the intention to put everyone on 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.139
 the same plan does not reward those 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.430
 who spent to have a modern one 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.110
 gaming machine 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.910
 despite this we must recognize 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.860
 that rival satire perfectly 30 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.690
 frames also on a mid - range PC 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.400
 keeping the activities of the 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.949
 controller even in most situations 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.110
 chaotic all this remains of 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.940
 this beginning spi drivers a lot of in 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.590
 hilarious self contaminated minutes from 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.020
 multiplayer when it really works 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.970
 exhilarating high voltage 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.500
 the graph of the first order then tele 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.879
 to the equation a bit of courage and 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.500
 you will still get a game from 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.729
 absolutely recommend to all 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.729
 arcade racing lovers
