00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.954
I've said this before, I LOVE RAIN!

00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:12.141
The best scenario would be a Saturday or Sunday morning when you get to sleep and you wake up, look outside and it’s raining or even better thunderstorming.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.862
Then you just go right back to sleep

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:20.639
or today you just don't want to go out, you wanna stay in and play some video games or watch a movie and it’s raining outside.

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:23.046
It’s such a cozy feeling!

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:26.907
And this is also why you've got to have a stockpile of food in the house

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:31.280
because you don't want to be out driving around buying snacks and food when it’s pouring outside.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.149
I mean I love rain but only when I'm indoors.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:34.150

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.293
I don't really like checking out in the rain for things to eat.

00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:43.179
But anyway I do want to note that I like rain in the traditional sense as in raining water

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:51.505
but there have been reports from all around the world of more bizarre things falling from the sky so here are some of the weirdest.

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:54.890
WEIRD RAIN FROM AROUND THE WORLD

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:56.715
#1. Frogs

00:00:56.776 --> 00:01:03.272
The citizens of Naphlion, a city in southern Greece were surprised one morning in May of 1981

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:08.150
when they awoke to find not rain but small green frogs falling from the sky.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.299
Rained just a few hours and the each frog landed everywhere, in the trees, in the streets.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.203
The Greek Meteorological Institute said that the frogs were picked up by a strong wind.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:24.793
It must've been are really strong wind because the species of frogs was native to North Africa.

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:30.691
Also Minneapolis Minnesota was pelted with frogs and toads in July of 1901.

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:38.691
Here’s what the news reports said "When the storm was at its highest... there appeared as if descending directly from the sky a huge green mass.

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.911
Then followed a peculiar pattern, unlike that of rain or hail.

00:01:43.038 --> 00:01:49.524
When the storm abated the people found, three inches deep and covering an area of more than four blocks,

00:01:49.572 --> 00:01:56.449
a collection of a most striking variety of frogs... so thick in some places [that] travel was impossible."

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:04.883
Now see if the frogs were raining down into France or China then there wouldn't be really an issue because it just be like raining food for the locals.

00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:05.954
#2. Fish

00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:14.246
In an otherwise clear sky in Chilatchee, Alabama in 1956, a woman and her husband watched as a small dark cloud formed in the sky.

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:23.271
When it was overhead, the cloud released its contents which is included: rain and you know, catfish, bass, all of the fish were alive.

00:02:23.272 --> 00:02:26.216
The dark cloud then turned white, then dispersed.

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:33.736
And if you think maybe fish raining from the sky could have came from maybe a local body of water then check this next report out.

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:38.260
In the town of Lajamanu in Australia which sits on the edge of the Tanami Desert

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:42.781
hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest lake and even further from the coast.

00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:46.109
In 2010 locals reported fish falling from the sky.

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.626
Not only was it raining fish but these fish were reported to be alive when they hit the ground.

00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:56.714
That means that there was a lot of fish just, you know, swimming, you know, around in the sky.

00:02:56.715 --> 00:02:58.061
#3. Blood

00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:07.112
In 2008 residents of the small town of La Sierra Choco, Columbia claimed that blood actually rained down on their small community.

00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:13.834
When a researcher from another town tested a sample of the substance, it was indeed verified as blood.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:20.995
Also In 1890, Popular Science News reported that blood rained down on Messignadi, Calabria in Italy. Well, bird's blood.

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:27.933
It was speculated that the birds were somehow torn part by violent winds, although there were no such winds at the time.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.489
And no other parts of the bird came down - just the blood.

00:03:31.576 --> 00:03:32.926
#4. Meat

00:03:32.927 --> 00:03:41.480
On March 9th 1876, a shower of meat fell near the house of Allen Crouch, who lived near Olympian Springs, Kentucky.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.625
The meat which measured between two and four square inches covering a strip of ground about one hundred yards in length and fifty wide.

00:03:49.711 --> 00:03:54.718
The sky was perfectly clear at the time, and she said the meat fell like large snowflakes.

00:03:54.743 --> 00:04:00.538
Now let's say this did happen near you, let me ask you would you actually eat the meats?

00:04:00.538 --> 00:04:06.623
I hope not but in this case two people did and said it tasted like venison or mutton.

00:04:06.648 --> 00:04:11.109
After further medical examination by The Royal Microscopical Society of Great Britain,

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:19.464
it was determined that the meat was in fact lung tissue from either a horse or get this... a human infant.

00:04:19.465 --> 00:04:23.600
I mean that's a pretty big difference, right? Either horse meat or baby meat.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.083
I mean that is pretty disturbing.

00:04:25.084 --> 00:04:28.973
Can you imagine what's going through the minds of those two people who ate the meat?

00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:35.846
‘Hey yeah Jim, the meat you just ate, you know the one that you said tasted like mutton or venison,

00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:40.069
yeah we tested it and it could be horse meat

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:42.950
or human baby meat.

00:04:43.914 --> 00:04:45.363
#5. Golf Balls

00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:50.022
On September 1, 1969, golf lovers from Punta Gorda, Florida,

00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:57.603
probably thought they died and went to heaven as when they woke up and found dozens upon dozens of golf balls raining from the sky.

00:04:57.628 --> 00:05:00.461
Actually that might hurt. Golf balls are pretty hard.

00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:01.818
#6. Worm

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:09.033
On March 4th, 2001 at Galashiels Academy in the UK, when a soccer class was on the field in the midst of a game

00:05:09.057 --> 00:05:14.025
the students were suddenly pelted with dozens of earthworms that seemed to be raining from the sky.

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:16.695
No one really had an explanation for this occurrence.

00:05:16.695 --> 00:05:22.349
One teacher at the Academy thought it was a freaky weather thing but as it turns out it was a sunny clear day.

00:05:22.374 --> 00:05:28.851
Witnesses also noted that the students were far away from any building so there was no way that it could have been some practical joke.

00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:30.256
#7. Star Jelly

00:05:30.256 --> 00:05:33.597
In 2009, a jelly rain fell in Scotland.

00:05:33.598 --> 00:05:37.810
Scientists commissioned by National Geographic carried out tests,

00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:40.722
but they have so far failed to find any DNA in it.

00:05:40.722 --> 00:05:45.828
And if you don't know Star Jelly is a gelatinous substance that's found on grass and sometimes bridges.

00:05:45.853 --> 00:05:49.194
And some say it deposited on earth during meteor showers.

00:05:49.218 --> 00:05:52.067
Some say they are bird bombing. Others say they are moles.

00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:54.377
Basically we don't really know what the stuff really is.

00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:55.813
#8. Corn

00:05:55.813 --> 00:06:03.695
From about 1982 to 1986, kernels of corn have rained down on several houses in Evans, Colorado - tons of it.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:08.053
Oddly, there were no cornfields in the area that might account for the phenomenon.

00:06:08.078 --> 00:06:12.608
There're tons of other strange things that have fallen from the sky in addition to what I have mentioned.

00:06:12.608 --> 00:06:20.355
They include money, spiders, hermit crabs and even cows. Yeah like live, mu cows.

00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:24.331
Also there was a report last week and thank you Andria for telling me about this.

00:06:24.331 --> 00:06:31.500
2000 snow geese migrating from Mexico to their Alaska nesting grounds were found dead in eastern Idaho.

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:34.268
Scientists say basically they just fell from the sky.

00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:41.173
Officials believe that the deaths are consistent with Avian cholera which kills acute sufferers in as little as 6 hours.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.866
What I don't know is if the geese all fell under the sky at the same time because that would be crazy.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:53.980
Anyway the typical explanations for these odd weather patterns include tornadoes, water spout or strong whirlwind,

00:06:54.004 --> 00:07:05.337
basically these things may pick up the animals or fish or insects from a shallow body of water or land and carry them sometimes for hundreds of miles before dropping them somewhere in your backyard.

00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:11.377
This explanation has yet to be proven though and can't really accounts for all the document instances.

00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:16.586
Like personally I can’t imagine thousands of fish just floating around in the sky for hundreds of miles.

00:07:16.586 --> 00:07:23.227
I mean wouldn’t someone have spotted thousands of flying fish or fly worms or flying steaks.

00:07:23.227 --> 00:07:26.489
So personally I don't really buy the water spout or tornado theory.

00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:31.399
I mean I don't know what's causing this but personally I do believe that different dimensions do exist.

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:33.891
So maybe these things are from different dimensions.

00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:39.308
I mean for example maybe the Bermuda Triangle was like a dimensional gate from here to another dimension.

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:44.625
So maybe in other dimensions, there’re similar kinda things that caught back to us. I mean that be kinda funny, right?

00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:47.488
So we get fish and worms raining down on us.

00:07:47.513 --> 00:07:51.397
And maybe in the other dimension was falling from the sky is battleship.

00:07:51.397 --> 00:07:56.167
Alright guys let me hear your theories about was causing these weird weather phenomenon and again

00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:58.424
Thank you so much for watching. See you later.
