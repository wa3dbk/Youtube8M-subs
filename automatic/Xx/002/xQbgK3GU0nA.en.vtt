00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
very small amounts because I'm just

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.460 
very small amounts because I'm just
doing<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.280> demonstration<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.140> don't<00:02:10.200> want

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
doing a demonstration and I don't want

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.000 
doing a demonstration and I don't want
to<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.679> too<00:02:11.190> wasteful<00:02:12.020> so

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
to be too wasteful so

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.009 
to be too wasteful so
you<00:02:14.610> pretty<00:02:14.819> much<00:02:14.909> pour<00:02:15.299> some<00:02:15.569> garnish<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.170> I

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
you pretty much pour some garnish in I

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.589 
you pretty much pour some garnish in I
was<00:02:19.019> kind<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.620> lot<00:02:20.040> there<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.299> as<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.510> can

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
was kind of a lot there so as you can

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.259 
was kind of a lot there so as you can
see<00:02:21.659> it's<00:02:21.930> kind<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:22.349> really<00:02:22.650> thick<00:02:23.269> and

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
see it's kind of it's really thick and

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.869 
see it's kind of it's really thick and
this<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.599> something<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.260> didn't<00:02:26.220> realize<00:02:26.549> when

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
this is something I didn't realize when

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.440 
this is something I didn't realize when
I<00:02:26.909> made<00:02:27.120> my<00:02:27.150> other<00:02:27.450> varnish<00:02:27.870> video<00:02:28.640> now<00:02:29.640> I'm

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
I made my other varnish video now I'm

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.030 
I made my other varnish video now I'm
just<00:02:30.569> going<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.840> add<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.319> didn't<00:02:31.860> really

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
just going to add I didn't really

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.589 
just going to add I didn't really
measure<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.790> I'm<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.239> going<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.450> add<00:02:33.569> a

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
measure it so I'm just going to add a

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.839 
measure it so I'm just going to add a
little<00:02:33.959> bit<00:02:34.079> of<00:02:34.230> water<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.280> always<00:02:35.519> add

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
little bit of water you can always add

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.630 
little bit of water you can always add
more<00:02:36.409> so<00:02:37.409> as<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:37.829> can<00:02:37.920> see<00:02:37.980> added<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.430> little

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
more so as you can see added a little

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.430 
more so as you can see added a little
bit<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.790> water<00:02:38.940> there<00:02:39.209> just<00:02:39.420> kind<00:02:40.109> of<00:02:40.140> mix<00:02:40.379> them

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
bit of water there just kind of mix them

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.569 
bit of water there just kind of mix them
around<00:02:42.439> and<00:02:43.439> you<00:02:43.650> know<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.920> can<00:02:44.040> also<00:02:44.189> do<00:02:44.459> that

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
around and you know you can also do that

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.930 
around and you know you can also do that
with<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.909> brush<00:02:45.209> mix<00:02:45.720> them<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:46.159> so<00:02:47.159> there's<00:02:47.790> a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
with the brush mix them up so there's a

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.220 
with the brush mix them up so there's a
lot<00:02:48.150> more<00:02:48.180> fluid<00:02:48.840> now<00:02:50.569> if<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:51.780> need<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.109> be<00:02:52.200> a

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
lot more fluid now if you need to be a

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.960 
lot more fluid now if you need to be a
little<00:02:52.409> thicker<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.069> add<00:02:53.310> more<00:02:53.519> varnish

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
little thicker you can add more varnish

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.140 
little thicker you can add more varnish
etc<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.780> can<00:02:54.900> add<00:02:54.989> more<00:02:55.170> water<00:02:55.440> as<00:02:55.680> well<00:02:59.150> so

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
etc you can add more water as well so

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.479 
etc you can add more water as well so
there<00:03:00.329> you<00:03:00.420> go<00:03:00.599> so<00:03:03.680> for<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.769> first<00:03:05.010> coat<00:03:05.280> I

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
there you go so for the first coat I

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.640 
there you go so for the first coat I
kind<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.819> just<00:03:06.060> dip<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.900> brush<00:03:07.139> in<00:03:09.409> try<00:03:10.409> to<00:03:10.440> get

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
kind of just dip the brush in try to get

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.170 
kind of just dip the brush in try to get
some<00:03:10.829> good<00:03:10.859> coverage<00:03:13.639> now<00:03:14.639> when<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:14.909> first

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
some good coverage now when you first

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.819 
some good coverage now when you first
put<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.540> on<00:03:15.629> since<00:03:15.959> it's<00:03:16.109> watered<00:03:16.440> down<00:03:16.470> like

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
put it on since it's watered down like

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.000 
put it on since it's watered down like
this<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:18.690> don't<00:03:18.870> have<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.199> put<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.620> on<00:03:19.709> so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
this you don't have to put it on so

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.300 
this you don't have to put it on so
perfectly<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:20.760> can<00:03:20.790> go<00:03:21.060> like<00:03:22.010> crisscross<00:03:23.010> and

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
perfectly you can go like crisscross and

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.659 
perfectly you can go like crisscross and
such<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.650> point<00:03:26.010> here<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.310> get<00:03:26.549> an

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
such but the the point here is to get an

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:32.569 
such but the the point here is to get an
even<00:03:26.940> coverage<00:03:28.400> first<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.980> kind<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.280> do<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
even coverage first so kind of do the

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.400 
even coverage first so kind of do the
center<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.269> brush<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.840> out<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.319> the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
center and then brush it out to the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:42.069 
center and then brush it out to the
edges<00:03:36.889> may<00:03:37.889> be<00:03:37.949> a<00:03:38.040> little<00:03:38.280> hard<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.609> see<00:03:38.849> that

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.629 

I'll<00:03:43.079> hold<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.410> up<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:43.919> a<00:03:44.040> minute<00:03:44.190> once<00:03:44.519> I

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
I'll hold it up in just a minute once I

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:51.790 
I'll hold it up in just a minute once I
get<00:03:44.790> an<00:03:44.879> even<00:03:45.030> coverage

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.280 

so<00:03:52.370> once<00:03:52.550> you<00:03:52.670> get<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.880> painting<00:03:53.240> pretty<00:03:54.080> much

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
so once you get the painting pretty much

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.650 
so once you get the painting pretty much
covered<00:03:54.770> a<00:03:55.630> whole<00:03:56.630> surface<00:03:58.210> then<00:03:59.210> you<00:03:59.420> want<00:03:59.600> to

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
covered a whole surface then you want to

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.490 
covered a whole surface then you want to
smooth<00:03:59.900> out<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.140> strokes<00:04:04.900> okay<00:04:05.900> so<00:04:06.380> I<00:04:06.410> think

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
smooth out the strokes okay so I think

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.000 
smooth out the strokes okay so I think
I'm<00:04:06.860> pretty<00:04:06.890> much<00:04:07.340> there<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.900> as<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.770> can<00:04:12.830> see

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
I'm pretty much there so as you can see

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.620 
I'm pretty much there so as you can see
it's<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.250> lot<00:04:13.400> wet<00:04:13.700> now<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.150> strokes<00:04:14.480> are

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
it's a lot wet now and the strokes are

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.039 
it's a lot wet now and the strokes are
going<00:04:14.840> every<00:04:15.050> which<00:04:15.200> way<00:04:16.299> so<00:04:17.299> here's<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.810> part

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
going every which way so here's the part

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.620 
going every which way so here's the part
where<00:04:18.110> you<00:04:18.290> go<00:04:18.440> really<00:04:18.770> lightly<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.630> just

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
where you go really lightly and just

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:28.870 
where you go really lightly and just
pull<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:20.989> brush<00:04:21.290> across<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:27.850> overlap<00:04:28.850> a

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
pull the brush across and overlap a

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:42.740 
pull the brush across and overlap a
little<00:04:29.240> bit<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.720> last<00:04:29.870> stroke

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.160 

pretty<00:04:43.410> much<00:04:43.590> no<00:04:43.890> pressure<00:04:47.510> all<00:04:48.510> right<00:04:48.570> some

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
pretty much no pressure all right some

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.350 
pretty much no pressure all right some
buildup<00:04:49.500> on<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.800> edges<00:04:50.160> here<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.640> I<00:04:50.910> just<00:04:50.940> wipe

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
buildup on the edges here so I just wipe

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.910 
buildup on the edges here so I just wipe
off<00:04:51.540> some<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:52.020> buildup<00:04:54.590> try<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.650> get<00:04:55.830> the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
off some of the buildup try to get the

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.000 
off some of the buildup try to get the
edges<00:04:56.340> as<00:04:56.520> smooth<00:04:56.880> as<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.090> can<00:04:57.420> there<00:04:57.860> get<00:04:58.860> any

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010

don't be worried too much about I mean

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.290 
don't be worried too much about I mean

but<00:05:48.300> don't<00:05:48.449> be<00:05:48.599> too<00:05:48.840> worried<00:05:49.229> if<00:05:49.380> it's<00:05:49.530> a

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
but don't be too worried if it's a

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.400 
but don't be too worried if it's a
little<00:05:49.830> uneven<00:05:50.069> the<00:05:50.460> water<00:05:51.110> you<00:05:52.110> know<00:05:52.229> at

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
little uneven the water you know at

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.920 
little uneven the water you know at
first<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:52.949> can<00:05:53.069> look<00:05:53.190> a<00:05:53.340> little<00:05:53.370> weird<00:05:53.810> but<00:05:54.810> it

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
first it can look a little weird but it

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:55.850 
first it can look a little weird but it
eventually

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
eventually

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.129 
eventually
it<00:05:56.130> smoothes<00:05:56.639> itself<00:05:57.090> out<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.509> kind<00:05:57.720> of<00:05:57.780> evens

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
it smoothes itself out it kind of evens

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.749 
it smoothes itself out it kind of evens
it<00:05:58.289> out<00:05:59.930> so<00:06:00.930> what<00:06:01.080> I<00:06:01.110> usually<00:06:01.259> do<00:06:01.680> is<00:06:01.949> while

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
it out so what I usually do is while

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.089 
it out so what I usually do is while
that's<00:06:02.970> drawn<00:06:03.330> drying<00:06:03.900> I<00:06:04.139> usually<00:06:04.620> put<00:06:04.860> it<00:06:04.889> in

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
that's drawn drying I usually put it in

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.689 
that's drawn drying I usually put it in
the<00:06:05.220> UM<00:06:05.430> in<00:06:06.030> a<00:06:07.020> kitchen<00:06:07.199> cabinet<00:06:07.590> to<00:06:08.430> let<00:06:08.580> it

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
the UM in a kitchen cabinet to let it

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.749 
the UM in a kitchen cabinet to let it
dry<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.330> so<00:06:09.750> that<00:06:09.930> nothing<00:06:10.319> look<00:06:10.530> hair<00:06:11.520> or

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759

dry and so that nothing look hair or
dust<00:06:12.030> or<00:06:12.300> anything<00:06:12.449> won't<00:06:12.810> contaminate<00:06:13.349> it

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
dust or anything won't contaminate it

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.129 
dust or anything won't contaminate it
and<00:06:14.610> usually<00:06:14.970> in<00:06:15.090> a<00:06:15.150> few<00:06:15.389> hours<00:06:15.419> once<00:06:15.960> it's

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139
