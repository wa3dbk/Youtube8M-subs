first example you can see an ABB robot

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.240 
first example you can see an ABB robot
moving<00:03:28.300> five<00:03:28.569> parts<00:03:29.020> from<00:03:29.530> one<00:03:29.800> table<00:03:30.069> to

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.180 
grab and drop a part with the tool the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
robot will move the target selected

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.979 
robot will move the target selected
depending<00:03:39.430> on<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:39.940> active<00:03:40.330> reference<00:03:40.720> frame

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
depending on the active reference frame

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.430 
depending on the active reference frame
in<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:42.190> case<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:42.819> can<00:03:43.239> be<00:03:43.269> either<00:03:43.450> table<00:03:43.840> 1<00:03:44.200> or

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
in this case it can be either table 1 or

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.690 
in this case it can be either table 1 or
table<00:03:44.890> 2<00:03:45.959> finally<00:03:46.959> we<00:03:47.739> can<00:03:47.890> output<00:03:48.099> the<00:03:48.370> robot

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
table 2 finally we can output the robot

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.709
