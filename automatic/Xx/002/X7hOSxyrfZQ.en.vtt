00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:06.399 
hey guys it's Friday night has a snow

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:08.879 
hey guys it's Friday night has a snow
gun<00:00:06.609> all<00:00:06.790> here<00:00:07.000> running<00:00:07.240> for<00:00:07.709> probably<00:00:08.709> about

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
gun all here running for probably about

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.440 
gun all here running for probably about
three<00:00:09.250> hours<00:00:09.400> or<00:00:09.820> so<00:00:10.030> it's<00:00:10.929> pretty<00:00:11.320> chilly<00:00:11.559> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
three hours or so it's pretty chilly the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.810 
three hours or so it's pretty chilly the
current<00:00:13.450> Westfall<00:00:13.870> here<00:00:14.170> is<00:00:14.320> about<00:00:14.820> 22

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
current Westfall here is about 22

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.120 
current Westfall here is about 22
degrees<00:00:15.969> I<00:00:16.390> think<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.560> it's<00:00:17.680> still<00:00:17.890> kind<00:00:18.070> of

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
degrees I think so it's still kind of

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.279 
degrees I think so it's still kind of
marginal<00:00:18.670> snow<00:00:18.939> making<00:00:19.150> conditions<00:00:19.840> but<00:00:20.050> you

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
marginal snow making conditions but you

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.640 
marginal snow making conditions but you
must<00:00:20.529> be<00:00:20.650> working<00:00:20.830> pretty<00:00:21.250> well<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.689> I'll<00:00:23.380> back

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
must be working pretty well so I'll back

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.040 
must be working pretty well so I'll back
up<00:00:23.890> here<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:24.519> you<00:00:25.330> can<00:00:25.449> see<00:00:25.599> that<00:00:25.720> after<00:00:25.810> I've

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
up here and you can see that after I've

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.320 
up here and you can see that after I've
had<00:00:26.230> it<00:00:26.349> running<00:00:26.560> for<00:00:26.949> about<00:00:27.070> three<00:00:27.490> hours<00:00:27.519> and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
had it running for about three hours and

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.910 
had it running for about three hours and
a<00:00:28.449> couple<00:00:28.660> of<00:00:28.840> different<00:00:29.109> spots<00:00:29.320> in<00:00:29.529> the<00:00:29.619> yard

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
a couple of different spots in the yard

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.189 
a couple of different spots in the yard
I<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.929> some<00:00:32.559> pretty<00:00:32.739> good<00:00:32.860> results<00:00:33.160> here

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.360 

it's<00:00:38.570> shooting<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> plume<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.050> snow<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:41.339> no

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it's shooting the plume of snow with no

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.229 
it's shooting the plume of snow with no
wind<00:00:42.000> oh<00:00:42.269> it's<00:00:42.539> probably<00:00:42.719> about<00:00:43.760> 80<00:00:44.760> feet<00:00:45.180> in

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
wind oh it's probably about 80 feet in

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
wind oh it's probably about 80 feet in
the<00:00:45.449> yard<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.019> beyond<00:00:46.409> what<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.769> can<00:00:46.949> see

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the yard it's beyond what you can see

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.479 
the yard it's beyond what you can see
there<00:00:47.519> in<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:47.969> darkness<00:00:48.589> but<00:00:49.589> it<00:00:49.949> gets<00:00:50.280> all

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
there in the darkness but it gets all

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
there in the darkness but it gets all
the<00:00:50.609> way<00:00:50.729> over<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.420> next<00:00:51.780> grouping

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
the way over there to the next grouping

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.579 
the way over there to the next grouping
of<00:00:52.289> Christmas<00:00:52.679> lights<00:00:52.890> there<00:00:55.159> and<00:00:57.289> that<00:00:58.289> snow

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
of Christmas lights there and that snow

00:00:58.589 --> 00:00:59.719 
of Christmas lights there and that snow
you're<00:00:58.799> looking<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.219> right<00:00:59.369> there<00:00:59.549> it's

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
you're looking at right there it's

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.660 
you're looking at right there it's
probably<00:00:59.879> about<00:01:00.180> two<00:01:01.019> inches<00:01:01.379> deep<00:01:02.180> I've<00:01:03.180> been

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
probably about two inches deep I've been

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.240 
probably about two inches deep I've been
moving<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.229> ladder<00:01:07.229> with<00:01:07.590> snow<00:01:07.860> legs<00:01:08.130> they're

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
moving the ladder with snow legs they're

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.270 
moving the ladder with snow legs they're
probably<00:01:08.460> about<00:01:08.729> once<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.270> hour<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:14.159> air

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
probably about once an hour and the air

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.490 
probably about once an hour and the air
compressors<00:01:14.759> been<00:01:14.880> able<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> keep<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.479> well

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.920 

there's<00:01:22.010> a<00:01:22.180> little<00:01:23.180> bit<00:01:23.300> of<00:01:23.390> Dripping<00:01:23.720> on<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
there's a little bit of Dripping on the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:02:05.430 
there's a little bit of Dripping on the
snow<00:01:24.110> maker<00:01:24.320> but<00:01:24.590> it's<00:01:24.710> not<00:01:24.940> not<00:01:25.940> anything<00:01:26.210> bad

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.440 

I'm<00:02:05.980> pretty<00:02:06.220> happy<00:02:06.400> with<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.760> results<00:02:07.210> here

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
I'm pretty happy with the results here

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.120 
I'm pretty happy with the results here
if<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:08.020> look<00:02:08.110> at<00:02:08.260> my<00:02:08.380> other<00:02:08.530> video<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:11.130> replaced

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
if you look at my other video I replaced

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.580 
if you look at my other video I replaced
the<00:02:12.570> fall<00:02:13.570> valve<00:02:13.960> on<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.820> gun<00:02:16.060> with<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.590> easier

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the fall valve on the gun with a easier

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.910 
the fall valve on the gun with a easier
to<00:02:17.710> operate<00:02:18.360> gate<00:02:19.360> valve<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:20.110> was<00:02:20.500> finally<00:02:20.710> able

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
to operate gate valve I was finally able

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.550 
to operate gate valve I was finally able
to<00:02:21.040> find<00:02:21.340> one<00:02:21.490> in<00:02:21.580> quarter<00:02:21.910> inch<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.530> I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
to find one in quarter inch so I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.140 
to find one in quarter inch so I
replaced<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:27.130> seems<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.850> work

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
replaced that and it seems to work

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.199 
replaced that and it seems to work
pretty<00:02:28.570> well

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.470 

the<00:02:32.720> snow<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.200> pretty<00:02:33.500> dense<00:02:34.329> it's<00:02:35.329> been

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
the snow is pretty dense it's been

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.789 
the snow is pretty dense it's been
pretty<00:02:35.689> warm<00:02:35.959> here<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:36.650> all<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.849> natural<00:02:38.269> snow

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
pretty warm here so all the natural snow

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.360 
pretty warm here so all the natural snow
has<00:02:39.799> melted<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:41.629> last<00:02:42.230> snow<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.920> was<00:02:43.040> here

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
has melted the last snow that was here

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.420 
has melted the last snow that was here
was<00:02:43.519> actually<00:02:44.000> snow<00:02:44.299> that<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.569> made<00:02:45.430> probably

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
was actually snow that I made probably

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.140 
was actually snow that I made probably
about<00:02:46.670> two<00:02:46.970> weeks<00:02:47.209> ago<00:02:48.099> because<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.519> is<00:02:49.909> much

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
about two weeks ago because it is much

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.860 
about two weeks ago because it is much
more<00:02:50.390> dense<00:02:50.750> than<00:02:52.180> snow<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.359> falls<00:02:53.540> from<00:02:53.780> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
more dense than snow that falls from the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.160 
more dense than snow that falls from the
sky

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.050 

so<00:02:57.590> I'm<00:02:57.800> pretty<00:02:57.950> happy<00:02:58.069> with<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.610> results

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
so I'm pretty happy with the results

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.020 
so I'm pretty happy with the results
here

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.809 

so<00:03:04.030> it's<00:03:04.209> Saturday<00:03:04.659> morning<00:03:04.689> now<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.609> this<00:03:06.609> is

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
so it's Saturday morning now and this is

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.330 
so it's Saturday morning now and this is
the<00:03:07.030> result<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.719> three<00:03:08.560> hours<00:03:08.799> of<00:03:08.920> snow<00:03:09.129> making

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
the result of three hours of snow making

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.289 
the result of three hours of snow making
last<00:03:09.670> night<00:03:09.909> I<00:03:11.370> had<00:03:12.370> moved<00:03:12.579> the<00:03:12.700> snow<00:03:12.939> maker<00:03:13.269> a

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
last night I had moved the snow maker a

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.069 
last night I had moved the snow maker a
couple<00:03:13.659> times<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:15.250> cover<00:03:15.879> this<00:03:16.120> much<00:03:16.329> area<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
couple times to cover this much area the

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.440 
couple times to cover this much area the
the<00:03:20.079> main<00:03:20.519> plume<00:03:21.519> here<00:03:21.849> that<00:03:22.000> you're<00:03:22.120> looking

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
the main plume here that you're looking

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.369 
the main plume here that you're looking
at<00:03:22.629> is<00:03:23.010> 20<00:03:24.010> feet<00:03:24.189> wide<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:25.530> 50<00:03:26.530> feet<00:03:26.739> long<00:03:26.980> and

where<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.650> snow<00:03:35.859> maker<00:03:36.069> was<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:38.159> for<00:03:39.159> the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
where the snow maker was the for the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.159 
where the snow maker was the for the
leading<00:03:39.730> edge<00:03:39.909> of<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.239> here<00:03:40.540> right<00:03:40.959> where<00:03:41.079> the

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
leading edge of it here right where the

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.789 
leading edge of it here right where the
snow<00:03:41.379> maker<00:03:41.620> was<00:03:41.889> is<00:03:42.189> actually<00:03:42.669> ice<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.590> then

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
snow maker was is actually ice but then

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.089 
snow maker was is actually ice but then
the<00:03:45.519> snow<00:03:46.150> begins<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.750> couple<00:03:47.079> feet<00:03:47.319> into<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.829> I

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
the snow begins a couple feet into it I

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.759 
the snow begins a couple feet into it I
suppose<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:49.019> first<00:03:50.019> little<00:03:50.439> bit<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.620> water

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
suppose the first little bit of water

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.080 
suppose the first little bit of water
just<00:03:50.919> falls<00:03:51.340> from<00:03:51.669> the<00:03:51.730> snow<00:03:52.299> gun<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:54.760> golden

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
just falls from the snow gun the golden

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.159 
just falls from the snow gun the golden
retriever<00:03:55.540> she<00:03:55.599> loves<00:03:55.870> playing<00:03:56.169> in<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.409> snow

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
retriever she loves playing in the snow

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.089 
retriever she loves playing in the snow
so<00:03:59.169> anyway<00:03:59.409> that's<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.739> that's<00:04:00.669> my<00:04:00.819> result<00:04:01.209> of

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
so anyway that's the that's my result of

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:10.589 
so anyway that's the that's my result of
three<00:04:03.099> hours<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.669> snow<00:04:04.209> making<00:04:04.389> last<00:04:04.719> night<00:04:09.599> so

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
three hours of snow making last night so

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.010 
three hours of snow making last night so
good<00:04:10.989> luck<00:04:11.109> with<00:04:11.169> your<00:04:11.440> snow<00:04:11.650> making
