 whistles with the come on we go first that 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.230
 all to know how is the blow in the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.679
 low on the pace of the ride this blow is 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:25.380
 the single in the traditional blow 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:28.050
 class to sing we are going to welcome the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.689
 half of those in Asia those who 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.980
 are on the outside we are going to 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.980
 combine them with choosing half 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.190
 let's do the following exercise 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.430
 let's do three types of assis we're going to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.430
 start 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.450
 point 4 5 and 6 of the row of half 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.450
 inward 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.039
 yes 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.659
 is 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.420
 m 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.790
 This is 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.570
 one of the exercises we are going to start 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.230
 another exercise that is also very 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.320
 important 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.620
 an explicit one and it also helps a lot to 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.780
 that you can exercise your fingers and 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.780
 continue with the bass 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:41.489
 the same 4 5 and 6 but I do not know if not 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.489
 let's do the 6 34 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.760
 the seventh sixth 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.140
 out and the third of the arrival 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.140
 inside out 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.960
 there is another exercise that is simpler 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.560
 that this 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.420
 leave oppressed 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.130
 four days and leave oppressed 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.130
 the key out then 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.050
 m 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.050
 do not 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.900
 here 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.450
 our are the exercises for 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.690
 interlace the whistles and the lows in the 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.270
 pace of the ride the hit the basses is the 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.510
 classic traditional beat in rhythm of 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.510
 walk 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.190
 I hope so, yes 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.770
 until a next opportunity any 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.120
