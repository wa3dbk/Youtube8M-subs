00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
two together before the foundation you

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.480 
two together before the foundation you
have<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.850> use<00:00:55.170> concealer<00:00:56.170> whatever<00:00:57.070> you<00:00:57.280> need

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490

have to use concealer whatever you need
it<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.720> people<00:00:58.900> try<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.410> cover<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.190> thing

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
it and the people try to cover the thing

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.340 
it and the people try to cover the thing
with<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.790> foundation<00:01:01.510> but<00:01:01.690> it's<00:01:01.840> not<00:01:01.990> a<00:01:02.020> good

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
with the foundation but it's not a good

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.760 
with the foundation but it's not a good
idea

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
idea

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.520 
idea
it's<00:01:03.310> better<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.820> cover<00:01:04.089> with<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.629> concealer

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
it's better to cover with the concealer

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.190 
it's better to cover with the concealer
so<00:01:05.890> you<00:01:05.950> can<00:01:06.189> pick<00:01:06.460> anything<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.299> like<00:01:07.659> and

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
so you can pick anything you like and

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.350 
so you can pick anything you like and
then<00:01:08.439> you<00:01:08.470> cover<00:01:08.860> first<00:01:09.220> so<00:01:09.880> after<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
then you cover first so after the

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.840 
then you cover first so after the
concealer<00:01:10.840> we'll<00:01:11.170> put<00:01:11.409> this<00:01:11.620> way<00:01:11.950> with<00:01:12.700> the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
concealer we'll put this way with the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.920 
concealer we'll put this way with the
sponge<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:14.110> this<00:01:14.380> is<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.560> new<00:01:15.010> formula<00:01:15.970> it<00:01:16.240> shows

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
sponge so this is a new formula it shows

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.149
