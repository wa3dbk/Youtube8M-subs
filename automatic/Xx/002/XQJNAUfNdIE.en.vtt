yeah<00:00:00.359> I<00:00:00.630> mean<00:00:00.690> it<00:00:00.930> was<00:00:01.020> it<00:00:01.230> was<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.620> good<00:00:01.800> win<00:00:01.979> for

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010

yeah I mean it was it was a good win for
us<00:00:02.190> I<00:00:02.490> think<00:00:02.750> was<00:00:03.750> important<00:00:04.140> after<00:00:04.259> the

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
us I think was important after the

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.590 
us I think was important after the
international<00:00:04.890> break<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.450> to<00:00:06.450> get

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
international break to to get

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.020 
international break to to get
immediately<00:00:06.930> three<00:00:07.350> points<00:00:07.710> it's<00:00:08.610> never<00:00:08.790> easy

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
immediately three points it's never easy

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.759 
immediately three points it's never easy
coming<00:00:09.269> back<00:00:09.510> from<00:00:09.929> internationals<00:00:10.500> because

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
coming back from internationals because

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.919 
coming back from internationals because
of<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:10.980> shift<00:00:11.190> from<00:00:11.750> national<00:00:12.750> teams

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
objectives to quads objectives and it's

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.859 
objectives to quads objectives and it's
important<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.170> us<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.289> get<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.740> three<00:00:17.160> points

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
important for us to get the three points

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
other eventually of course many Natalie

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.349 
other eventually of course many Natalie
got<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.930> important<00:00:27.930> point<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.199> at<00:00:28.740> Anfield

got the important point that at Anfield

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.319 
got the important point that at Anfield
but<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:30.869> least<00:00:31.019> makes<00:00:31.769> us<00:00:31.949> recover<00:00:32.489> some<00:00:32.820> some

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
but at least makes us recover some some

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.020 
but at least makes us recover some some
points<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:34.770> closer<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> second

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
position at the moment and eventually

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.280 
position at the moment and eventually
try<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> three<00:00:39.750> points<00:00:39.930> out<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> the

queens park rangers game which is going
to<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.540> difficult<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.590> which<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.399> what

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to be difficult in which to see what

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.299 
to be difficult in which to see what
happens<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:44.969> many<00:00:45.750> admits<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:48.980> should<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.100> okay

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
happens in many admits it should be okay

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:01.130 
happens in many admits it should be okay
what<00:00:50.489> he<00:00:50.550> has<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.960> analyzed<00:00:59.809> yeah<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.079> think

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
what he has to be analyzed yeah I think

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.070 
what he has to be analyzed yeah I think
so<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:02.219> think<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.520> i<00:01:02.550> think<00:01:02.730> we'll<00:01:03.080> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
so I really think so i think we'll the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.140 
so I really think so i think we'll the
same<00:01:04.260> against<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.369> game<00:01:05.489> against<00:01:05.760> bolton

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
same against the the game against bolton

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.450 
same against the the game against bolton
it<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.360> important<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.780> us<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:08.310> make

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it was important for us to to make

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.060 
it was important for us to to make
everything<00:01:08.970> run<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:10.409> try<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> ball

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
everything run to try to get the ball

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.710 
everything run to try to get the ball
and<00:01:11.280> i<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.729> managed<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.270> i<00:01:12.540> think

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and i think we managed to do it i think

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.109 
and i think we managed to do it i think
what<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:14.220> they<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.760> appraised

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
what what if they can be appraised

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.200 
what what if they can be appraised
delays<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:15.960> manage<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.880> be<00:01:17.880> very<00:01:18.119> very

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
delays that we manage to be very very

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.330 
delays that we manage to be very very
patient<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.810> our<00:01:18.960> build<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.009> play<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
patient in our build up in and play a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.370 
patient in our build up in and play a
lot<00:01:20.549> from<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> back<00:01:21.060> tire<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.810> strikers

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
lot from the back tire in the strikers

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.050 
lot from the back tire in the strikers
of<00:01:22.560> Everton<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.189> bit<00:01:23.310> more<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
of Everton a little bit more and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.210 
of Everton a little bit more and
eventually<00:01:24.960> when<00:01:25.409> Everton<00:01:25.740> got<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> wall

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
eventually when Everton got the wall

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.800 
eventually when Everton got the wall
they<00:01:26.400> couldn't<00:01:26.640> respond<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> usual

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
they couldn't respond to to the usual

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.830 
they couldn't respond to to the usual
aggressiveness<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:30.570> mean

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
aggressiveness that they have and I mean

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.569 
aggressiveness that they have and I mean
of<00:01:30.930> course<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.320> us<00:01:31.409> also<00:01:31.650> decisive<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> get

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
of course for us also decisive to get

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.010 
of course for us also decisive to get
the<00:01:32.670> second<00:01:32.970> goal<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.240> before<00:01:33.329> half-time<00:01:33.689> is

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the second goal just before half-time is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.450 
the second goal just before half-time is
something<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.409> never<00:01:34.950> helps<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
something that never helps the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.899 
something that never helps the
opposition<00:01:36.060> manager<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.890> got<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
opposition manager but it got in and

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.480 
opposition manager but it got in and
after<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.960> three<00:01:40.170> engages<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
after we the three engages the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.679 
after we the three engages the
the<00:01:41.610> comfort<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.570> needed<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:47.450> yeah<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.659> I

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the comfort that we needed to yeah but I

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.389 
the comfort that we needed to yeah but I
think<00:01:48.899> it's<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.350> interrelated<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.130> this

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
think it's all interrelated with this

think it's all interrelated with this
colleagues<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.509> mean<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.979> think<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.880> I've

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090

squad is so immense and what we mean the
technical<00:02:01.350> staff<00:02:01.530> job<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.130> free<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
when they play with freedom of choice

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.669 
when they play with freedom of choice
they<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.390> express<00:02:09.899> themselves<00:02:09.989> with<00:02:10.530> each

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
they can express themselves with each

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.920 
they can express themselves with each
other<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:13.670> saw<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.730> spiked<00:02:15.090> with<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.660> precious

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
other I saw in spiked with the precious

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.500 
other I saw in spiked with the precious
may<00:02:16.799> I<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.340> fall<00:02:17.549> ball<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.970> arrive<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.330> both

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
may I but fall ball to arrive in both

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.330 
may I but fall ball to arrive in both
spaces<00:02:18.780> has<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.200> be<00:02:19.290> passed<00:02:19.530> by<00:02:19.709> somebody<00:02:20.130> very

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
spaces has to be passed by somebody very

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
spaces has to be passed by somebody very
so<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:22.019> think<00:02:22.290> all<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.310> team<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:24.120> team's

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
so I think all of the team the team's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.080 
so I think all of the team the team's
understanding<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.519> plays<00:02:26.519> individual

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
understanding of the plays individual

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.990 
understanding of the plays individual
talent<00:02:27.420> any<00:02:27.569> communities<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:29.069> what<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.880> have

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
talent any communities is what we have

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.729 
talent any communities is what we have
to<00:02:30.150> find<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:30.930> not<00:02:31.019> clear<00:02:31.290> enough<00:02:31.590> to

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
to find you it's not clear enough to

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.140 
to find you it's not clear enough to
fine-tune<00:02:32.130> individuals<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:32.940> find

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
fine-tune individuals we have to find

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.640 
fine-tune individuals we have to find
him<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.450> team<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.930> team<00:02:33.959> then<00:02:34.290> finds

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
him the team and the team then finds

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.590 
him the team and the team then finds
itself<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.040> little<00:02:35.130> bit<00:02:35.340> better<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.569> think

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
itself a little bit better and I think

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.570 
itself a little bit better and I think
this<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.380> mobility<00:02:37.650> from<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.340> front

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
this is this mobility from the front

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.309 
this is this mobility from the front
players<00:02:38.819> is<00:02:39.060> helping<00:02:39.390> us<00:02:39.480> getting<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:39.989> and

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
players is helping us getting in and

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.800 
players is helping us getting in and
getting<00:02:40.349> me<00:02:41.090> some<00:02:42.090> kind<00:02:42.269> of<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.480> predictability

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
getting me some kind of a predictability

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:51.140 
getting me some kind of a predictability
inning<00:02:46.310> no<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.340> mean<00:02:49.430> what<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.549> spoke<00:02:50.730> about<00:02:50.970> is

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
inning no I mean what you spoke about is

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.960 
inning no I mean what you spoke about is
that<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.590> fluency<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.310> amount<00:02:53.579> of<00:02:53.760> games

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
that the fluency in the amount of games

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.110 
that the fluency in the amount of games
that<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:54.329> have<00:02:54.480> now<00:02:54.720> delta<00:02:55.410> T<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.000> because<00:02:57.000> it

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
that we have now delta T and because it

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.360 
that we have now delta T and because it
in<00:02:57.269> play<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.510> more<00:02:57.780> often<00:02:58.079> and<00:02:58.650> gets<00:02:59.160> together

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
in play is more often and gets together

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.370 
in play is more often and gets together
more<00:02:59.700> often<00:02:59.880> in<00:03:00.120> which<00:03:00.570> situation<00:03:01.200> match

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
more often in which situation match

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.289 
more often in which situation match
situations<00:03:01.980> instead<00:03:02.609> of<00:03:02.910> just<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
situations instead of just in the

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.800 
situations instead of just in the
training<00:03:03.540> camp<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:05.190> there<00:03:06.000> any<00:03:06.420> opposite

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810

team<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.140> play<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.160> little<00:03:08.340> bit<00:03:08.519> better<00:03:08.640> at<00:03:08.970> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
team to play a little bit better at the

team to play a little bit better at the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
moment this is happening but eventually

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.799 
moment this is happening but eventually
you<00:03:10.829> can<00:03:10.950> collect<00:03:11.130> 22<00:03:11.880> bad<00:03:12.150> day<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.799> certain
