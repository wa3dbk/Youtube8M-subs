 It is full of sense of quality ぇ This is Mike which we searched for in macintosh correspondence This is the first 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.220
 Something was awful 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.020

 Here I am an outbreak 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.690
 Also Mac compatible wonder if that also corresponds to the absence windows 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:02.540
 Actually, before you buy this last morning, Mike 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:07.540
 When I saw it I bought it without knowing anything 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.260

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.860

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.490
 I'm taken by Futari it a built-in microphone of the personal computer 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.000
 Yoshi made to feel that again I wonder about time I think I'd rather this was also quit Chamaｰ 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 By buying a microphone that is not mac 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.710
 We bought this time high-quality sound usb before this 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.549
 In the feeling that it is better to have you actually listen as you explain with stupid back bending 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.320
 Will be 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.510
 Well then 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.930
 It is the person who is doing it with the built-in microphone first of all , the personal computer of the desktop 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.740
 I think that using has so Toka things behind also enter amazing 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.270
 This is the built-in microphone, which I always use the built-in microphone 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.340
 I'm in the back room microphone I bought this time 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.509

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.210

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:28.600
 Kedomo we have a guy gold if you look at value there it than recording Tteru in this microphone 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.440
 If you come to look at there 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.770
 I think you can see the difference if you compare it with other screws 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.950
 Well then we hope to see how many usb this win from the next time 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.240
