00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
shell smash and if you don't know what

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.180 
shell smash and if you don't know what
that<00:02:14.920> does<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.520> makes<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.540> whole<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:17.230> whole<00:02:17.290> bunch

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
that does it makes a whole a whole bunch

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.820 
that does it makes a whole a whole bunch
of<00:02:18.310> his<00:02:18.430> stats<00:02:18.700> just<00:02:19.060> raise<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.660> his<00:02:20.500> speed

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
of his stats just raise and his speed

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.860 
of his stats just raise and his speed
his<00:02:21.160> attack<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.880> special<00:02:22.180> attack<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.450> think<00:02:22.569> it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
his attack and special attack I think it

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.170 
his attack and special attack I think it
is<00:02:22.990> he<00:02:23.890> goes<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.220> rock<00:02:24.430> blast<00:02:24.760> now<00:02:24.970> which

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
is he goes for the rock blast now which

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.540 
is he goes for the rock blast now which
will<00:02:25.480> hit<00:02:25.690> five<00:02:26.110> times<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.830> row<00:02:26.860> because<00:02:27.430> if

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
will hit five times in a row because if

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.150 
will hit five times in a row because if
you<00:02:27.640> don't<00:02:27.730> know<00:02:27.940> this<00:02:28.090> guy<00:02:28.770> cloister<00:02:29.770> now<00:02:29.980> has

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
you don't know this guy cloister now has

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.920 
you don't know this guy cloister now has
an<00:02:30.310> ability<00:02:30.460> it<00:02:30.819> has<00:02:31.240> an<00:02:31.390> ability<00:02:31.569> that<00:02:31.900> makes

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
an ability it has an ability that makes

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.480 
an ability it has an ability that makes
it<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.350> whenever<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.710> use<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.920> move<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.370> it

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
it so whenever you use a move that it

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.980 
it so whenever you use a move that it
has<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.790> possibility<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.450> hit<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> bunch<00:02:34.870> of

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
has the possibility to hit a bunch of

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.350 
has the possibility to hit a bunch of
times<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.740> will<00:02:35.830> always<00:02:36.190> hit<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.550> max<00:02:37.120> amount

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
times it will always hit the max amount

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.750 
times it will always hit the max amount
of<00:02:37.510> times<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.440> that's<00:02:38.650> cool

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
of times so that's cool

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.880 
of times so that's cool
I<00:02:39.819> my<00:02:40.269> lantern<00:02:40.959> takes<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.409> like<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.560> fucking

and I predict the seed bomb or the focus
punch<00:03:01.329> she<00:03:01.569> does<00:03:01.720> go<00:03:01.900> for<00:03:02.079> the<00:03:02.140> seed<00:03:02.319> bomb<00:03:02.500> not

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
punch she does go for the seed bomb not

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.770 
punch she does go for the seed bomb not
very<00:03:03.340> effective<00:03:03.760> focused<00:03:04.239> punch<00:03:04.420> would<00:03:04.629> not

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
very effective focused punch would not

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.780 
very effective focused punch would not
have<00:03:04.900> been<00:03:05.049> either<00:03:05.230> because<00:03:05.590> I'm<00:03:05.709> I'm<00:03:06.400> poison

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
I thought for some reason he would

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.789 
I thought for some reason he would
switch<00:03:49.180> out<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.660> it's<00:03:49.810> not<00:03:49.930> very<00:03:50.139> effective<00:03:50.620> I

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
switch out and it's not very effective I

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.500 
switch out and it's not very effective I
do<00:03:51.069> get<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.400> flinch<00:03:51.669> though<00:03:51.910> which<00:03:52.180> was<00:03:52.329> just

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
do get the flinch though which was just

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.080 
do get the flinch though which was just
awesome<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.230> he<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.620> unable<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:54.040> move<00:03:54.250> now

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
awesome so he is unable to move now

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.580 
awesome so he is unable to move now
