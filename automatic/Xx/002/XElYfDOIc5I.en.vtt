00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
woke up too early probably shouldn't be

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.680 
woke up too early probably shouldn't be
playing<00:00:10.160> here<00:00:10.520> anyway

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690

starting<00:00:12.230> off<00:00:12.350> with<00:00:12.380> 96<00:00:13.160> again<00:00:13.460> probably<00:00:13.730> not

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
starting off with 96 again probably not

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.090 
starting off with 96 again probably not
the<00:00:14.210> most<00:00:14.420> sound<00:00:14.750> of<00:00:14.960> openings<00:00:15.410> it's<00:00:15.710> called<00:00:15.950> a

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
the most sound of openings it's called a

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.420 
the most sound of openings it's called a
nimzowitsch<00:00:17.030> is<00:00:17.300> defense<00:00:18.220> there's<00:00:19.220> also<00:00:19.310> a

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
nimzowitsch is defense there's also a

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.480 
nimzowitsch is defense there's also a
variation<00:00:19.820> of<00:00:20.150> nimzowitsch<00:00:20.540> is<00:00:20.900> defense<00:00:21.490> with

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
variation of nimzowitsch is defense with

variation of nimzowitsch is defense with
queen<00:00:22.700> pawns<00:00:22.970> opening<00:00:23.420> but<00:00:24.050> this<00:00:24.200> is<00:00:24.380> probably

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
queen pawns opening but this is probably

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:32.170 
queen pawns opening but this is probably
the<00:00:25.160> less<00:00:25.600> less<00:00:26.600> sound<00:00:26.930> one<00:00:27.200> so<00:00:30.850> even<00:00:31.850> wants<00:00:32.090> to

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
the less less sound one so even wants to

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.370 
the less less sound one so even wants to
go<00:00:32.270> ahead<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:32.480> get<00:00:32.570> rid<00:00:32.689> of<00:00:32.720> my<00:00:32.870> good<00:00:33.050> Bishop

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
now playing back to h5 would end up

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.750 
now playing back to h5 would end up
losing<00:00:35.780> losing<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:36.829> bishop<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:37.370> don't<00:00:37.610> want

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.970 
again cuz they're talking so you do you
just<00:02:50.840> speed<00:02:51.049> things<00:02:51.290> up<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.560> little<00:02:51.620> bit<00:02:53.980> okay

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
just speed things up a little bit okay

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.920 
just speed things up a little bit okay
hopefully<00:02:55.159> he'll<00:02:55.400> capture<00:02:55.760> with<00:02:55.909> the<00:02:56.000> rook<00:02:56.269> he

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
hopefully he'll capture with the rook he

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.199 
hopefully he'll capture with the rook he
didn't<00:02:57.400> he<00:02:58.400> would<00:02:58.519> have<00:02:58.609> gotten<00:02:58.849> a<00:02:59.030> nice

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
didn't he would have gotten a nice

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.899 
didn't he would have gotten a nice
little<00:02:59.450> fork<00:02:59.810> but<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:01.040> position<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.609> me<00:03:01.730> now

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
little fork but this position to me now

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:10.080 
little fork but this position to me now
seems<00:03:02.239> okay<00:03:07.329> I'm<00:03:08.329> gonna<00:03:08.510> get<00:03:08.659> another<00:03:08.870> pawn

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
seems okay I'm gonna get another pawn

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.670 
seems okay I'm gonna get another pawn
he's<00:03:11.090> gonna<00:03:11.239> get<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.599> Jeep<00:03:11.840> on<00:03:12.049> if<00:03:12.230> he<00:03:12.319> wants

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
he's gonna get the Jeep on if he wants

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.890 
he's gonna get the Jeep on if he wants
it<00:03:12.829> again<00:03:13.700> I'm<00:03:13.819> missing<00:03:14.180> all<00:03:14.269> kinds<00:03:14.329> of<00:03:14.690> stuff

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
it again I'm missing all kinds of stuff

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.550 
it again I'm missing all kinds of stuff
I<00:03:15.049> probably<00:03:15.260> should<00:03:15.530> have<00:03:15.560> just<00:03:15.650> played<00:03:20.560> maybe

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
I probably should have just played maybe

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.180 
I probably should have just played maybe
taking<00:03:21.950> on<00:03:22.040> h3<00:03:25.480> okay<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.510> don't<00:03:26.690> see<00:03:26.840> any

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
taking on h3 okay I don't see any

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.110 
taking on h3 okay I don't see any
threats<00:03:28.190> here<00:03:30.459> she's<00:03:31.459> gonna<00:03:31.579> capture<00:03:31.849> with

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
threats here she's gonna capture with

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.509 
threats here she's gonna capture with
the<00:03:32.209> rook<00:03:32.449> everything<00:03:32.989> should<00:03:33.230> stay<00:03:33.500> nice<00:03:34.489> and

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
the rook everything should stay nice and

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.900 
the rook everything should stay nice and
safe<00:03:34.940> now<00:03:35.599> this<00:03:35.810> looks<00:03:36.019> just<00:03:36.230> simply<00:03:36.500> over<00:03:39.910> you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
safe now this looks just simply over you

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.220 
safe now this looks just simply over you
can<00:03:41.060> take<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.299> rook<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.629> get<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.870> pawn

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
can take the rook and get the pawn

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.250 
can take the rook and get the pawn
that's<00:03:42.829> fine<00:03:43.040> I'll<00:03:43.340> probably<00:03:43.519> just<00:03:43.730> play<00:03:43.910> back

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
that's fine I'll probably just play back

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.740 
that's fine I'll probably just play back
blocking<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.349> rook

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.150 

so<00:03:52.410> just<00:03:52.560> gonna<00:03:52.710> maintain<00:03:52.950> my<00:03:55.040> perfect<00:03:56.040> this

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
so just gonna maintain my perfect this

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.360 
so just gonna maintain my perfect this
is<00:03:56.310> what<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.460> was<00:03:56.580> hoping<00:03:56.820> for<00:03:56.880> now<00:03:57.450> it's<00:03:57.600> over<00:03:57.750> I

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.650 

don't<00:04:02.370> know<00:04:02.430> why<00:04:02.580> people<00:04:02.610> don't<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.330> resign

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
don't know why people don't just resign

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:12.950 
don't know why people don't just resign
I<00:04:03.960> guess<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.200> don't<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.530> lot<00:04:04.740> of<00:04:04.770> time<00:04:11.960> but

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
I guess I don't have a lot of time but

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:24.350 
I guess I don't have a lot of time but
I've<00:04:13.110> got<00:04:13.260> enough<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:19.100> that'll<00:04:20.100> be<00:04:20.220> mate<00:04:23.360> all

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
I've got enough and that'll be mate all

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.260 
I've got enough and that'll be mate all
right<00:04:24.450> there<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.930> was<00:04:25.080> another<00:04:25.620> one<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.270> not

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
right there it was another one so not

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.880 
right there it was another one so not
too<00:04:27.450> bad<00:04:27.480> could<00:04:28.020> have<00:04:28.110> been<00:04:28.230> better

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
too bad could have been better

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.840 
too bad could have been better
could<00:04:29.250> have<00:04:29.340> been<00:04:29.460> worse<00:04:29.640> but<00:04:30.320> again<00:04:31.320> for<00:04:31.560> a

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
could have been worse but again for a

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.530 
could have been worse but again for a
sleepy<00:04:34.400> for<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.460> sleepy<00:04:35.850> guy<00:04:36.000> could<00:04:36.420> have<00:04:36.450> been

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
sleepy for a sleepy guy could have been

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.810 
sleepy for a sleepy guy could have been
worse
