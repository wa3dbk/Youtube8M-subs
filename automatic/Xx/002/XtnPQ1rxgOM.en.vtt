00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
but it's also gonna blend that concealer

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.759 
but it's also gonna blend that concealer
and<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:45.030> we<00:02:45.269> just<00:02:45.300> added<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.200> we<00:02:46.320> have<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:56.559 
and that we just added but we have to
have<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.640> concealer<00:02:48.209> added<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.750> first

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.649 

otherwise<00:02:57.379> it<00:02:57.560> would<00:02:57.650> just<00:02:57.680> stick<00:02:58.099> out<00:02:58.280> so

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
otherwise it would just stick out so

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.839 
otherwise it would just stick out so
that's<00:02:59.659> why<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.799> I'm<00:03:00.920> gonna<00:03:01.010> lightly<00:03:01.370> dust<00:03:01.730> me

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849
