this is my special daikon mix so this is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.230 
this is my special daikon mix so this is
a<00:01:12.869> very<00:01:13.200> easy<00:01:13.320> ferment<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
a very easy ferment it's really not the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.539 
a very easy ferment it's really not the

first that you may do but the first that
you<00:01:17.580> probably<00:01:18.000> would<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.840> sour<00:01:19.320> kraut

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you probably would do is sour kraut

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
fermentation but many of you may have

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.950 
fermentation but many of you may have
already<00:01:26.340> done<00:01:26.909> sauerkraut<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:27.840> be

anyway<00:02:18.470> now<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:18.860> we<00:02:19.099> see<00:02:19.310> what<00:02:20.180> we<00:02:20.330> need<00:02:20.540> and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
anyway now that we see what we need and

by the way the daikon that we'll be

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.330 
by the way the daikon that we'll be
using<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:23.270> use<00:02:23.510> around<00:02:23.930> between<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.860> pound<00:02:25.190> and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
using you use around between a pound and

a half to two pounds of daikon for this
recipe<00:02:28.220> now<00:02:29.000> before<00:02:29.540> we<00:02:29.750> actually<00:02:30.319> get<00:02:30.800> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
recipe now before we actually get to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.430 
recipe now before we actually get to
fermenting<00:02:31.810> there's<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.870> big<00:02:33.080> thing<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.290> we

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
fermenting there's a big thing that we

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.770 
fermenting there's a big thing that we
have<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.709> remember<00:02:34.100> what<00:02:34.730> we're<00:02:35.000> trying<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.600> do

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
have to remember what we're trying to do

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.780 
have to remember what we're trying to do
is<00:02:36.319> we're<00:02:36.590> trying<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:37.040> make<00:02:37.220> sure<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
is we're trying to make sure that the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.770 
is we're trying to make sure that the
lactobacilli<00:02:38.890> win<00:02:39.890> because<00:02:40.670> when<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:41.569> put

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
lactobacilli win because when we put

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.860 
lactobacilli win because when we put
this<00:02:41.900> all<00:02:42.080> together<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.910> mason<00:02:44.480> jar<00:02:44.690> and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
this all together in the mason jar and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.780 
this all together in the mason jar and
everything<00:02:45.260> there's<00:02:45.500> going<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.250> be<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.459> war

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
everything there's going to be a war

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.530 
everything there's going to be a war
going<00:02:47.209> on<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:47.720> going<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.080> be<00:02:48.260> basically

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
going on and it's going to be basically

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.020 
going on and it's going to be basically
lactobacilli<00:02:50.540> versus<00:02:51.230> other<00:02:51.560> bacteria<00:02:52.519> well

most<00:02:53.600> of<00:02:53.720> them<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:54.049> really<00:02:54.410> don't<00:02:54.790> want

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
most of them you really don't want

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.410 
most of them you really don't want
taking<00:02:56.180> over<00:02:56.660> either<00:02:56.840> they're<00:02:58.269> bacteria<00:02:59.269> that

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
taking over either they're bacteria that

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.259 
taking over either they're bacteria that
rot<00:02:59.720> stuff<00:03:00.140> or<00:03:00.470> they're<00:03:00.620> actually<00:03:01.269> bad

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
rot stuff or they're actually bad

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.930 
rot stuff or they're actually bad
bacteria<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:03.170> will<00:03:03.260> make<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.560> sick<00:03:03.860> as<00:03:04.700> well

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
bacteria that will make you sick as well

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.850 
bacteria that will make you sick as well
as<00:03:05.180> moles<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.750> moles<00:03:05.780> are<00:03:06.080> ever-present<00:03:06.319> no

as moles and moles are ever-present no

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.830 
as moles and moles are ever-present no
matter<00:03:07.040> where<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.430> are<00:03:07.459> you<00:03:08.180> don't<00:03:08.390> want<00:03:08.660> them

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
matter where you are you don't want them

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.870 
matter where you are you don't want them
to<00:03:08.959> have<00:03:09.140> any<00:03:09.319> part<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.739> this<00:03:09.830> process<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.819> you

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
to have any part of this process so you

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.940 
to have any part of this process so you
want<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.630> lactobacilli<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.500> win<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.830> that's

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
want the lactobacilli to win and that's

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.920 
want the lactobacilli to win and that's
what<00:03:13.100> we're<00:03:13.700> going<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.060> be<00:03:14.239> doing<00:03:14.390> is<00:03:14.630> we're

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
what we're going to be doing is we're

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.350 
what we're going to be doing is we're
going<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.290> be<00:03:15.470> making<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:16.310> field<00:03:16.700> that's<00:03:16.970> easy

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
going to be making the field that's easy

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.690 
going to be making the field that's easy
for<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.780> lack<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:17.989> beside<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.859> win<00:03:19.250> as

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
for the lack of beside to win as

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.580 
for the lack of beside to win as
possible<00:03:20.269> because<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.660> lactobacilli<00:03:21.380> win

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
possible because the lactobacilli win

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.759 
possible because the lactobacilli win
they<00:03:22.459> turn<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.940> starches<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.450> sugars<00:03:23.769> into

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
they turn the starches and sugars into

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.849 
they turn the starches and sugars into
mattock<00:03:25.700> acid<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:26.630> preserves<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.260> food<00:03:27.560> and

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
mattock acid that preserves the food and

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.710 
mattock acid that preserves the food and
it<00:03:27.950> turns<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.310> into<00:03:28.400> probiotics<00:03:29.209> if<00:03:29.540> that

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
it turns it into probiotics if that

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.180 
it turns it into probiotics if that
doesn't<00:03:30.170> work<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.500> don't<00:03:30.680> want<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:30.890> eat<00:03:31.010> it

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
doesn't work you don't want to eat it

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.750 
doesn't work you don't want to eat it
so<00:03:32.000> anyway<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:33.709> main<00:03:33.920> way<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.370> we're<00:03:34.519> going

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
so anyway the main way that we're going

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.599 
so anyway the main way that we're going
to<00:03:34.880> be<00:03:35.060> doing<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.720> in<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.470> few<00:03:36.680> things<00:03:36.920> first

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
to be doing is is in a few things first

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.300 
to be doing is is in a few things first
off<00:03:38.230> we'll<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.290> putting<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.650> good<00:03:39.799> deal<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.070> salt

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
off we'll be putting a good deal of salt

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.280 
off we'll be putting a good deal of salt
into<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.640> pride<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.120> salt<00:03:41.390> holds<00:03:41.900> down<00:03:42.079> the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
into the pride the salt holds down the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.640 
into the pride the salt holds down the
bad<00:03:42.440> bacteria<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.450> lactobacilli<00:03:44.450> can<00:03:44.930> do<00:03:45.230> in

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
bad bacteria and lactobacilli can do in

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.949 
bad bacteria and lactobacilli can do in
a<00:03:45.769> salt<00:03:46.750> area<00:03:49.030> will<00:03:50.030> also<00:03:50.090> be<00:03:50.299> doing<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.690> in<00:03:50.810> a

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
a salt area will also be doing it in a

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.750 
a salt area will also be doing it in a
mason<00:03:51.140> jar<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.650> mason<00:03:51.950> jar<00:03:52.160> make<00:03:52.370> sure<00:03:52.549> that

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
mason jar the mason jar make sure that

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.210 
mason jar the mason jar make sure that
this<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:53.120> an<00:03:53.269> anaerobic<00:03:53.959> process<00:03:54.709> like<00:03:55.190> a

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
this is an anaerobic process like a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.970 
this is an anaerobic process like a
facility<00:03:55.790> can<00:03:56.269> easily<00:03:56.720> deal<00:03:56.989> in<00:03:57.230> anaerobic

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
facility can easily deal in anaerobic

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.160 
facility can easily deal in anaerobic
which<00:03:58.100> means<00:03:58.340> there's<00:03:58.519> no<00:03:58.880> air<00:03:59.150> where's<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.930> lot

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
which means there's no air where's a lot

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.170 
which means there's no air where's a lot
of<00:04:00.260> other<00:04:00.410> bacteria<00:04:00.650> need<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.519> air<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.030> that

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
of other bacteria need the air so that

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.590 
of other bacteria need the air so that
they<00:04:02.359> can<00:04:02.569> do<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.440> good<00:04:03.829> job<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:04.390> propagating<00:04:05.390> we

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
they can do a good job of propagating we

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.030 
they can do a good job of propagating we
don't<00:04:05.810> want<00:04:06.019> them<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.290> propagate<00:04:06.829> so

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
don't want them to propagate so

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.349 
don't want them to propagate so
therefore<00:04:07.910> we<00:04:08.480> want<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.870> be<00:04:08.959> anaerobic<00:04:10.359> in

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
therefore we want it to be anaerobic in

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.539 
therefore we want it to be anaerobic in
addition<00:04:11.810> what<00:04:12.709> we'll<00:04:12.889> be<00:04:13.040> doing<00:04:13.190> is<00:04:13.430> we'll

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
addition what we'll be doing is we'll

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.539 
addition what we'll be doing is we'll
actually<00:04:13.760> be<00:04:14.000> mashing<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:15.230> product<00:04:15.859> some<00:04:16.100> to

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
actually be mashing the product some to

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.400 
actually be mashing the product some to
make<00:04:16.729> it<00:04:16.880> easier<00:04:17.209> for<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.660> lactobacilli<00:04:18.289> to

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
make it easier for the lactobacilli to

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.020 
make it easier for the lactobacilli to
get<00:04:18.620> in<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:18.979> start<00:04:19.190> eating<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:19.669> and<00:04:19.850> therefore

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
get in and start eating it and therefore

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.310 
get in and start eating it and therefore
start<00:04:20.510> making<00:04:21.109> the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
start making the

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.310 
start making the
de<00:04:21.560> casa<00:04:22.160> once<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.270> lactic<00:04:23.630> acid<00:04:24.050> starts

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
de casa once the lactic acid starts

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.680 
de casa once the lactic acid starts
being<00:04:24.530> made<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.700> there's<00:04:25.940> enough<00:04:26.210> of<00:04:26.330> it<00:04:26.450> to

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
being made and there's enough of it to

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.410 
being made and there's enough of it to
make<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.650> fairly<00:04:27.920> acidic<00:04:28.310> it'll<00:04:29.150> kill

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
make it a fairly acidic it'll kill

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.240 
make it a fairly acidic it'll kill
everything<00:04:29.870> else<00:04:30.170> you<00:04:30.620> don't<00:04:30.740> have<00:04:30.890> to<00:04:31.010> worry

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
everything else you don't have to worry

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.480 
everything else you don't have to worry
about<00:04:31.430> that<00:04:31.790> but<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:32.750> need<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.470> have<00:04:34.250> that

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
about that but you need to have that

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.660 
about that but you need to have that
whole<00:04:34.760> thing<00:04:35.060> start<00:04:35.540> and<00:04:35.780> therefore<00:04:36.670> that's

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
whole thing start and therefore that's

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.500 
whole thing start and therefore that's
everything<00:04:38.510> that<00:04:38.660> we're<00:04:38.810> shooting<00:04:39.440> for<00:04:39.650> so

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
everything that we're shooting for so

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.550 
everything that we're shooting for so
let's<00:04:41.510> get<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.050> actual<00:04:42.310> fermentation

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
let's get to the actual fermentation

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.690 
let's get to the actual fermentation
this<00:04:45.640> is<00:04:46.640> a<00:04:46.700> daikon<00:04:47.680> basically<00:04:48.680> it's<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.310> giant

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
this is a daikon basically it's a giant

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.970 
this is a daikon basically it's a giant
radish<00:04:50.290> when<00:04:51.290> it<00:04:51.380> comes<00:04:51.530> out<00:04:51.680> of<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.800> ground

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
radish when it comes out of the ground

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.890 
radish when it comes out of the ground
it's<00:04:52.100> about<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:52.490> long<00:04:52.820> this<00:04:53.210> is<00:04:53.390> simply<00:04:53.720> just

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
it's about this long this is simply just

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.390 
it's about this long this is simply just
a<00:04:53.960> piece<00:04:54.140> of<00:04:54.170> it<00:04:54.440> sometimes<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:54.890> can<00:04:55.010> find<00:04:55.280> it

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
a piece of it sometimes you can find it

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.100 
a piece of it sometimes you can find it
in<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:55.580> store<00:04:55.850> and<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.060> looks<00:04:56.240> like<00:04:56.390> a<00:04:56.420> kind<00:04:57.050> of

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
in the store and it looks like a kind of

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.040 
in the store and it looks like a kind of
like<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.290> giant<00:04:57.650> white<00:04:58.220> sword<00:04:58.730> right<00:04:59.660> now<00:04:59.780> we've

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
like a giant white sword right now we've

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.290 
like a giant white sword right now we've
just<00:05:00.080> got<00:05:00.320> a<00:05:00.440> piece<00:05:00.740> of<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:01.100> but<00:05:01.250> it<00:05:01.640> tastes

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
just got a piece of it but it tastes

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.540 
just got a piece of it but it tastes
good<00:05:02.450> you<00:05:02.600> may<00:05:02.750> have<00:05:02.900> seen<00:05:03.890> this<00:05:04.010> before<00:05:04.070> a<00:05:04.460> lot

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
good you may have seen this before a lot

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.000 
good you may have seen this before a lot
of<00:05:04.940> Japanese<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:05.990> Chinese<00:05:06.020> restaurants<00:05:06.290> they

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
of Japanese and Chinese restaurants they

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.360 
of Japanese and Chinese restaurants they
turn<00:05:07.580> into<00:05:07.790> almost<00:05:08.120> like<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.360> cellophane

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
turn into almost like the cellophane

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.730 
turn into almost like the cellophane
thing<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.550> you<00:05:10.670> eat<00:05:10.700> alongside<00:05:11.500> sushi<00:05:12.500> or

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
thing that you eat alongside sushi or

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.680 
thing that you eat alongside sushi or
whatever<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.400> meal<00:05:13.640> is<00:05:13.850> but<00:05:14.360> here<00:05:14.570> we're

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
whatever the meal is but here we're

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.210 
whatever the meal is but here we're
going<00:05:14.810> to<00:05:14.870> turn<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:15.230> into<00:05:15.320> a<00:05:15.470> really<00:05:15.860> really

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
going to turn it into a really really

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.200 
going to turn it into a really really
really<00:05:16.520> tasty<00:05:16.880> dish<00:05:17.270> what<00:05:17.900> I'm<00:05:18.050> using<00:05:18.350> here<00:05:18.920> is

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
really tasty dish what I'm using here is

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.300 
really tasty dish what I'm using here is
called<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.270> mandolin<00:05:20.810> knife<00:05:21.020> it's<00:05:22.010> just

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
called the mandolin knife it's just

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.400 
called the mandolin knife it's just
basically<00:05:22.640> a<00:05:22.760> blade<00:05:23.090> and<00:05:23.330> a<00:05:23.420> board<00:05:23.750> you<00:05:24.260> can

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
basically a blade and a board you can

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.020 
basically a blade and a board you can
also<00:05:24.560> do<00:05:24.830> this<00:05:24.950> with<00:05:25.160> a<00:05:25.190> nut<00:05:25.400> with<00:05:25.640> a<00:05:25.670> regular

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
also do this with a nut with a regular

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.510 
also do this with a nut with a regular
knife<00:05:26.180> but<00:05:26.420> a<00:05:26.450> mandolin<00:05:26.930> takes<00:05:27.230> no<00:05:27.740> time<00:05:28.040> so

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
knife but a mandolin takes no time so

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.030 
knife but a mandolin takes no time so
basically<00:05:28.850> all<00:05:28.970> we<00:05:29.240> do<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:30.530> just<00:05:30.770> run<00:05:31.010> the

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
basically all we do you just run the

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:38.920 
basically all we do you just run the
daikon<00:05:36.670> but<00:05:37.670> what<00:05:37.850> size<00:05:38.150> do<00:05:38.450> you<00:05:38.570> want<00:05:38.690> the

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
daikon but what size do you want the

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.860 
daikon but what size do you want the
pieces<00:05:39.320> to<00:05:39.620> be<00:05:40.450> can<00:05:41.450> you<00:05:41.510> pick<00:05:41.630> up<00:05:41.750> that

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
pieces to be can you pick up that

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.380 
pieces to be can you pick up that
thickness<00:05:42.170> there<00:05:42.880> that's<00:05:43.880> what<00:05:44.090> about<00:05:44.270> the

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
thickness there that's what about the

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.490 
thickness there that's what about the
thickness<00:05:44.660> of<00:05:44.990> maybe<00:05:45.290> a<00:05:45.500> quarter<00:05:46.780> so<00:05:47.780> you

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
thickness of maybe a quarter so you

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.750 
thickness of maybe a quarter so you
don't<00:05:48.650> want<00:05:48.800> you<00:05:49.070> don't<00:05:49.130> really<00:05:49.310> want<00:05:49.550> any

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
don't want you don't really want any

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.320 
don't want you don't really want any
thinner<00:05:50.090> than<00:05:50.330> that<00:05:50.540> and<00:05:51.940> you<00:05:52.940> can<00:05:53.090> make<00:05:53.210> it

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
thinner than that and you can make it

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.740 
thinner than that and you can make it
thicker<00:05:53.770> okay<00:05:55.630> so<00:05:57.970> we<00:05:58.970> keep<00:05:59.150> slicing<00:05:59.660> the

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
thicker okay so we keep slicing the

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.310 
thicker okay so we keep slicing the
daikon<00:06:00.200> until<00:06:01.540> we've<00:06:02.540> gotten<00:06:02.900> like<00:06:03.020> I<00:06:03.110> said

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
daikon until we've gotten like I said

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.720 
daikon until we've gotten like I said
about<00:06:03.530> a<00:06:03.590> pound<00:06:04.180> to<00:06:05.180> a<00:06:05.720> pound<00:06:06.050> and<00:06:06.290> a<00:06:06.350> half<00:06:06.730> two

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
about a pound to a pound and a half two

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.480 
about a pound to a pound and a half two
pounds<00:06:08.180> somewhere<00:06:08.540> in<00:06:08.690> there<00:06:08.900> what<00:06:09.680> we<00:06:09.830> want

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
pounds somewhere in there what we want

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.060 
pounds somewhere in there what we want
to<00:06:10.580> do<00:06:10.760> now<00:06:11.030> that<00:06:11.060> we've<00:06:11.450> got<00:06:11.770> daikon<00:06:12.770> all

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
to do now that we've got daikon all

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.720 
to do now that we've got daikon all
sliced<00:06:13.370> up<00:06:13.580> into<00:06:13.850> medallions<00:06:14.470> is<00:06:15.730> julienne

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
sliced up into medallions is julienne

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.140 
sliced up into medallions is julienne
which<00:06:17.270> is<00:06:17.480> really<00:06:17.840> easy<00:06:17.870> since<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:19.150> main

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
which is really easy since the main

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.670 
which is really easy since the main
balloon<00:06:20.450> is<00:06:20.570> done<00:06:20.720> most<00:06:20.960> of<00:06:21.080> the<00:06:21.170> work<00:06:21.350> for<00:06:21.380> us

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
balloon is done most of the work for us

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.170 
balloon is done most of the work for us
and<00:06:21.950> making<00:06:22.100> it<00:06:22.310> into<00:06:22.460> the<00:06:22.580> medallions

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
and making it into the medallions

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.720 
and making it into the medallions
basically<00:06:23.960> I<00:06:24.020> just<00:06:24.260> take<00:06:24.470> a<00:06:24.500> knife<00:06:24.740> I<00:06:25.040> take<00:06:25.700> a

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
basically I just take a knife I take a

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.549 
basically I just take a knife I take a
pile<00:06:26.000> of<00:06:26.150> the<00:06:26.330> daikon<00:06:26.750> and<00:06:28.240> then<00:06:29.240> I

00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:29.559 
pile of the daikon and then I

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:34.679 
pile of the daikon and then I
damn<00:06:31.379> okay<00:06:32.639> now<00:06:33.639> that<00:06:33.879> we've<00:06:34.029> got<00:06:34.059> all<00:06:34.629> our

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:34.689 
damn okay now that we've got all our

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:38.339 
damn okay now that we've got all our
dicot<00:06:35.379> into<00:06:35.709> our<00:06:35.799> Bowl<00:06:36.539> hmm<00:06:37.539> doesn't<00:06:38.169> look

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349 
dicot into our Bowl hmm doesn't look

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:40.109 
dicot into our Bowl hmm doesn't look
like<00:06:38.679> much<00:06:38.889> right<00:06:38.949> now<00:06:39.219> a<00:06:39.429> boy<00:06:39.879> who's<00:06:40.089> not

00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:40.119 
like much right now a boy who's not

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.259 
like much right now a boy who's not
going<00:06:40.449> to<00:06:40.539> get<00:06:40.689> tasty<00:06:41.819> the<00:06:42.819> next<00:06:43.089> thing<00:06:43.239> that

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:43.269 
going to get tasty the next thing that

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.419 
going to get tasty the next thing that
we<00:06:43.539> want<00:06:43.809> to<00:06:43.869> do<00:06:44.079> is<00:06:44.439> we<00:06:44.619> want<00:06:44.799> to<00:06:44.859> add<00:06:45.009> the<00:06:45.159> salt

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:45.429 
we want to do is we want to add the salt

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:51.659 
we want to do is we want to add the salt
to<00:06:45.519> it<00:06:47.339> what<00:06:48.339> salt<00:06:48.759> does<00:06:50.219> from<00:06:51.219> a<00:06:51.249> fermentation

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
to it what salt does from a fermentation

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.179 
to it what salt does from a fermentation
standpoint<00:06:52.539> is<00:06:52.719> it<00:06:53.019> holds<00:06:53.349> down<00:06:53.499> the<00:06:54.009> bacteria

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:54.189 
standpoint is it holds down the bacteria

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:58.339 
standpoint is it holds down the bacteria
that<00:06:54.579> you<00:06:54.819> do<00:06:55.179> not<00:06:55.479> want<00:06:56.399> here<00:06:57.399> in<00:06:57.789> the<00:06:57.879> ferment

00:06:58.339 --> 00:06:58.349 
that you do not want here in the ferment

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:01.829 
that you do not want here in the ferment
however<00:06:59.549> what<00:07:00.549> it<00:07:00.639> also<00:07:00.819> does<00:07:01.179> if<00:07:01.389> you<00:07:01.479> added

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:01.839 
however what it also does if you added

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.619 
however what it also does if you added
early<00:07:02.259> into<00:07:02.399> the<00:07:03.399> cutting<00:07:03.639> whether<00:07:04.209> this<00:07:04.479> is

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:04.629 
early into the cutting whether this is

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:06.839 
early into the cutting whether this is
for<00:07:04.899> making<00:07:05.169> the<00:07:05.289> icon<00:07:05.769> or<00:07:06.159> sauerkraut<00:07:06.699> or

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:06.849 
for making the icon or sauerkraut or

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:09.389 
for making the icon or sauerkraut or
really<00:07:07.149> any<00:07:07.689> ferment<00:07:08.199> that<00:07:08.259> you<00:07:08.499> want<00:07:08.889> to<00:07:09.129> mash

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:09.399 
really any ferment that you want to mash

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:11.939 
really any ferment that you want to mash
just<00:07:09.999> a<00:07:10.119> little<00:07:10.329> bit<00:07:10.509> it<00:07:11.049> leaches<00:07:11.379> the<00:07:11.679> water

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:11.949 
just a little bit it leaches the water

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:13.199 
just a little bit it leaches the water
out<00:07:12.219> and<00:07:12.369> it<00:07:12.519> makes<00:07:12.669> the<00:07:12.849> mashing

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:13.209 
out and it makes the mashing

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:15.419 
out and it makes the mashing
tremendously<00:07:13.719> easier<00:07:14.159> generally<00:07:15.159> speaking

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:15.429 
tremendously easier generally speaking

00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:20.219 
tremendously easier generally speaking
it<00:07:15.759> takes<00:07:16.529> around<00:07:17.529> at<00:07:18.029> least<00:07:19.029> 10<00:07:19.359> minutes<00:07:19.389> to

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:20.229 
it takes around at least 10 minutes to

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:24.689 
it takes around at least 10 minutes to
get<00:07:20.409> some<00:07:20.619> good<00:07:20.999> water<00:07:21.999> out<00:07:22.299> of<00:07:22.509> it<00:07:22.629> however<00:07:23.699> is

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:24.699 
get some good water out of it however is

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:26.699 
get some good water out of it however is
a<00:07:24.789> really<00:07:25.389> really<00:07:25.629> really<00:07:25.899> important<00:07:26.499> step

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:26.709 
a really really really important step

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:28.529 
a really really really important step
because<00:07:27.009> otherwise<00:07:27.299> you're<00:07:28.299> going<00:07:28.389> to<00:07:28.479> be

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:28.539 
because otherwise you're going to be

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:30.479 
because otherwise you're going to be
using<00:07:28.629> a<00:07:28.809> lot<00:07:29.019> of<00:07:29.049> energy<00:07:29.259> to<00:07:29.739> beat<00:07:29.919> the<00:07:30.069> daikon

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:30.489 
using a lot of energy to beat the daikon

00:07:30.489 --> 00:07:32.399 
using a lot of energy to beat the daikon
and<00:07:30.519> it's<00:07:30.789> going<00:07:30.879> to<00:07:30.939> take<00:07:31.149> quite<00:07:31.719> a<00:07:31.989> while<00:07:32.079> for

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:32.409 
and it's going to take quite a while for

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:35.159 
and it's going to take quite a while for
you<00:07:32.529> to<00:07:32.619> do<00:07:32.739> this<00:07:32.889> so<00:07:33.129> basically<00:07:33.279> for<00:07:33.989> one<00:07:34.989> to

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:35.169 
you to do this so basically for one to

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:40.850 
you to do this so basically for one to
two<00:07:35.379> mason<00:07:36.129> jars<00:07:36.369> I<00:07:38.699> use<00:07:39.699> about<00:07:39.849> a<00:07:39.999> teaspoon<00:07:40.209> of

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 
two mason jars I use about a teaspoon of

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:50.339 
two mason jars I use about a teaspoon of
Celtic<00:07:41.860> sea<00:07:42.009> salt<00:07:44.279> just<00:07:45.279> put<00:07:45.519> it<00:07:45.610> on<00:07:45.699> there<00:07:49.349> mix

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:50.349 
Celtic sea salt just put it on there mix

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:55.979 
Celtic sea salt just put it on there mix
it<00:07:50.529> all<00:07:50.649> up<00:07:54.179> and<00:07:55.179> we're<00:07:55.360> going<00:07:55.479> to<00:07:55.509> wait<00:07:55.689> and

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:55.989 
it all up and we're going to wait and

00:07:55.989 --> 00:08:00.299 
it all up and we're going to wait and
we'll<00:07:56.169> be<00:07:56.259> back<00:07:56.499> to<00:07:56.709> you<00:07:56.860> in<00:07:57.039> about<00:07:57.219> 10<00:07:57.849> minutes
