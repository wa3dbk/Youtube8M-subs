big bruiser fast girl average guy setup

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.370 
big bruiser fast girl average guy setup
so<00:02:30.590> in<00:02:30.890> both<00:02:31.069> concept<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.030> execution<00:02:32.380> it's

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
so in both concept and execution it's

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.760 
so in both concept and execution it's
all<00:02:33.620> pretty<00:02:33.890> vapid<00:02:34.720> so<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.930> gameplay<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.709> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
all pretty vapid so the gameplay and the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.710 
all pretty vapid so the gameplay and the
premise<00:02:37.370> aren't<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.760> most<00:02:37.910> original<00:02:38.480> things

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
premise aren't the most original things

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.930 
premise aren't the most original things
in<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.959> world<00:02:39.170> but<00:02:39.410> Trinity<00:02:39.860> does<00:02:40.190> provide<00:02:40.730> an

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
in the world but Trinity does provide an

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.630 
in the world but Trinity does provide an
impressive<00:02:41.599> amount<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:42.110> sheer<00:02:42.530> content<00:02:43.190> there

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
impressive amount of sheer content there

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.699 
impressive amount of sheer content there
are<00:02:43.730> lots<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.209> missions<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:44.690> take<00:02:44.989> on<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.349> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
are lots of missions to take on and the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.290 
are lots of missions to take on and the
best<00:02:45.950> thing<00:02:46.160> about<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.520> game<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:46.970> way<00:02:47.180> it

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
best thing about the game is the way it

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.380 
best thing about the game is the way it
implements<00:02:47.870> some<00:02:48.110> light<00:02:48.830> RPG<00:02:49.610> elements<00:02:50.150> into

its otherwise boring structure you can

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
whole lot of fun and you'll have no idea

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.629 
whole lot of fun and you'll have no idea
why<00:03:22.840> now<00:03:23.840> fortunately<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.829> game<00:03:25.040> isn't<00:03:25.430> very

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
why now fortunately the game isn't very

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.940 
why now fortunately the game isn't very
good-looking<00:03:26.060> either<00:03:26.719> Trinity<00:03:27.560> uses<00:03:27.920> a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
good-looking either Trinity uses a

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.949 
good-looking either Trinity uses a
parchment<00:03:28.579> filter<00:03:28.939> which<00:03:29.299> you've<00:03:29.510> seen<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:29.870> a

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
parchment filter which you've seen in a

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.259 
parchment filter which you've seen in a
lot<00:03:30.079> of<00:03:30.139> other<00:03:30.349> games<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.010> it's<00:03:31.250> cool<00:03:31.639> but

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
lot of other games and it's cool but

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.149 
lot of other games and it's cool but
it's<00:03:32.389> a<00:03:32.480> little<00:03:32.750> heavy-handed<00:03:33.109> at<00:03:33.620> times<00:03:33.859> I

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
it's a little heavy-handed at times I

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.520 
it's a little heavy-handed at times I
guess<00:03:34.579> that's<00:03:34.819> their<00:03:35.299> way<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.510> obscuring<00:03:36.379> the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
guess that's their way of obscuring the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.069 
guess that's their way of obscuring the
games<00:03:36.709> otherwise<00:03:37.250> dull<00:03:37.700> graphics<00:03:38.299> there's<00:03:38.870> no

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
voice acting for that matter this is

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.699 
voice acting for that matter this is
terrible<00:03:44.540> how<00:03:45.349> should<00:03:45.680> we<00:03:45.799> proceed

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.399 

now<00:03:49.129> this<00:03:49.280> isn't<00:03:49.819> a<00:03:49.939> great<00:03:50.239> game<00:03:50.599> and<00:03:50.930> and

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
now this isn't a great game and and

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:52.960 
now this isn't a great game and and
frankly<00:03:51.709> it's<00:03:52.069> not<00:03:52.220> even<00:03:52.459> a<00:03:52.519> very<00:03:52.609> good<00:03:52.730> one

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
frankly it's not even a very good one

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.030 
frankly it's not even a very good one
