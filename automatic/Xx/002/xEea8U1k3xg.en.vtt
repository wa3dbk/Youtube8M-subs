by telling you a little bit about the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.670 
by telling you a little bit about the
map<00:00:19.710> countdown<00:00:20.310> countdown<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.689> asymmetrical

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
map countdown countdown is asymmetrical

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.830 
map countdown countdown is asymmetrical
map<00:00:22.890> which<00:00:23.340> means<00:00:23.640> if<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.970> were<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.359> place<00:00:24.630> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
map which means if you were to place a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.050 
map which means if you were to place a
mirror<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.680> draw<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> line<00:00:26.279> right<00:00:26.670> down<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
mirror or draw a line right down the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.240 
mirror or draw a line right down the
middle<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> map<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.349> would<00:00:28.470> be<00:00:28.590> identical

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
middle of the map it would be identical

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.640 
middle of the map it would be identical
on<00:00:29.429> both<00:00:29.699> sides<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.539> line<00:00:30.929> or<00:00:31.199> both<00:00:31.410> sides

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
on both sides of that line or both sides

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.680 
on both sides of that line or both sides
of<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> mirror<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> exact<00:00:33.300> same<00:00:33.329> on

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
of the mirror so it's the exact same on

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.650 
of the mirror so it's the exact same on
either<00:00:33.840> side<00:00:35.059> some<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> maps<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.630> halo

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
either side some of the maps in halo

either side some of the maps in halo
reach<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.790> symmetrical<00:00:38.790> maps<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.390> one

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
reach are symmetrical maps like this one

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270 
reach are symmetrical maps like this one
and<00:00:39.840> others<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.800> need<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.100> know

and others are not you need to know
which<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.559> can

countdown consists of multiple levels I

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.610 
countdown consists of multiple levels I
think<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.600> there's<00:00:51.750> three<00:00:52.079> levels<00:00:52.469> on

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
think that there's three levels on

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
think that there's three levels on
countdown<00:00:53.039> there's<00:00:53.550> several<00:00:53.850> walkways

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
countdown there's several walkways

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.529 
countdown there's several walkways
passageways<00:00:55.590> lifts<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.430> connect<00:00:57.210> all<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
passageways lifts that connect all the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.479 
passageways lifts that connect all the
different<00:00:57.870> levels<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:59.070> kind<00:00:59.309> of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
different levels it can be kind of

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.700 
different levels it can be kind of
complicated<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.170> know<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.590> way

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
complicated if you do not know your way

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.709 
complicated if you do not know your way
around<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.789> may<00:01:03.000> want<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.300> take<00:01:03.449> some<00:01:03.690> time

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.839 
okay so what that means is if a player
had<00:03:52.910> completely<00:03:53.540> full<00:03:53.989> health<00:03:54.459> one<00:03:55.459> Malay

had completely full health one Malay
attack<00:03:56.239> would<00:03:56.720> reduce<00:03:57.049> their<00:03:57.109> shields<00:03:57.829> the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040

attack would reduce their shields the
second<00:03:58.489> malay<00:03:58.760> attack<00:03:59.090> would<00:03:59.329> finish<00:03:59.540> them

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
second malay attack would finish them

second malay attack would finish them
off<00:04:00.019> okay<00:04:00.829> now<00:04:01.760> if<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.690> players<00:04:03.019> health<00:04:03.470> has

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
meaning that their shields are already

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.569 
meaning that their shields are already
down<00:04:08.139> then<00:04:09.139> a<00:04:09.169> single<00:04:09.680> male<00:04:09.829> attack<00:04:10.250> will
