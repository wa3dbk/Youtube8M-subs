so<00:00:00.570> you<00:00:00.630> have<00:00:01.170> electric<00:00:02.159> unicycle<00:00:02.490> like<00:00:03.030> Ariel

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
so you have electric unicycle like Ariel

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.910 
so you have electric unicycle like Ariel
like<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.929> have<00:00:04.259> feeling

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
like I have feeling

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.369 
like I have feeling
notice<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:05.910> my<00:00:06.330> area<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.810> actually<00:00:06.990> standing

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
notice that my area is actually standing

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.709 
notice that my area is actually standing
on<00:00:07.770> its<00:00:07.980> own<00:00:08.160> without<00:00:08.400> leaning<00:00:08.910> against<00:00:09.540> the

for you to use next is to install wheel
onto<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:52.129> unicycle

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
onto the unicycle

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.869 
onto the unicycle
I<00:00:53.539> discovered<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.899> air<00:00:55.350> plate<00:00:55.800> steel<00:00:56.190> metal

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
I discovered this air plate steel metal

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.090 
I discovered this air plate steel metal
where<00:00:57.840> there's<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.230> three<00:00:58.469> holes<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.890> each

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
where there's like three holes on each

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
where there's like three holes on each
side<00:01:00.079> installed<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> idea<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
side installed will and the idea is to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.980 
side installed will and the idea is to
put<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.799> between<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.450> trolley<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> bar

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
put in between the trolley and the bar

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.760 
put in between the trolley and the bar
and<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> discovered<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.200> way<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.740> I

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and will so I discovered a way that I

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.660 
and will so I discovered a way that I
can't<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> drill<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.760> holes<00:01:12.600> into<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
can't you drill the holes into the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.030 
can't you drill the holes into the
handlebar<00:01:14.869> using<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.960> pencil<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.920> achieve

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
handlebar using a pencil you can achieve

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.010 
handlebar using a pencil you can achieve
mark<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.880> place<00:01:18.119> where<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> need<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
mark out the place where you need to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.230 
mark out the place where you need to
drill<00:01:19.380> make<00:01:20.189> sure<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.400> pull<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.939> handle

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
drill make sure you pull out the handle

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
drill make sure you pull out the handle
bar<00:01:21.390> before<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.780> start<00:01:22.020> drooling<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
bar before you start drooling so that

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
bar before you start drooling so that
you<00:01:23.610> will<00:01:23.670> not<00:01:24.000> drill<00:01:24.390> into<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> second<00:01:25.229> layer

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you will not drill into the second layer

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.950 
you will not drill into the second layer
of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.950> handlebar<00:01:26.430> which<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.360> need<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.720> pull

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
of the handlebar which you need to pull

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.310 
of the handlebar which you need to pull
it<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:30.030> only<00:01:30.210> downside<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it out so the only downside of this is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.980 
it out so the only downside of this is
when<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> push<00:01:32.369> down<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.790> handle<00:01:33.420> bar<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.840> may

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
when you push down the handle bar it may

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.050 
when you push down the handle bar it may
not<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> way<00:01:34.710> down<00:01:35.189> but<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
not go all the way down but it is a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.249 
not go all the way down but it is a
necessary<00:01:36.750> sacrifice<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:38.540> knot<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.689> screw

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
necessary sacrifice a knot and screw

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.069 
necessary sacrifice a knot and screw
initially<00:01:40.950> put<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> screw<00:01:41.579> from<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> inside

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
initially put a screw from the inside

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.639 
initially put a screw from the inside
out<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:45.450> put<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> nut

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
out so that you can actually put a nut

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.710 
out so that you can actually put a nut
and<00:01:46.799> washer<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> outside<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.329> faster

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
and washer on the outside the faster

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.399 
and washer on the outside the faster
need<00:01:48.869> make<00:01:49.409> sure<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.710> fasten<00:01:50.189> two<00:01:51.110> screw<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
need make sure you fasten two screw and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.780 
need make sure you fasten two screw and
knots<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.000> L<00:01:54.240> plate<00:01:55.020> metal<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:56.579> be

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
knots so that the L plate metal can be

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.920 
knots so that the L plate metal can be
fastened<00:01:57.270> properly<00:01:57.509> without<00:01:58.290> moving<00:01:58.950> about

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
fastened properly without moving about

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.020 
fastened properly without moving about
efforts<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.079> put<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.680> single<00:02:02.100> layer<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
efforts I put one single layer of the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.569 
efforts I put one single layer of the
air<00:02:03.240> pit<00:02:03.659> metal<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.799> realized<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.460> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
air pit metal but I realized it's a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.119 
air pit metal but I realized it's a
little<00:02:05.880> bit<00:02:06.000> flimsy<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.439> will<00:02:07.829> like

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
little bit flimsy because it will like

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.869 
little bit flimsy because it will like
wobbly<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.310> not<00:02:11.430> very<00:02:11.670> stable

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
wobbly and and so it's not very stable

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.190 
wobbly and and so it's not very stable
so<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> put

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
so I put

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.040 
so I put
to<00:02:13.590> layer<00:02:13.830> later<00:02:14.489> three<00:02:15.030> layers<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.780> elf

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
to layer later three layers of the elf

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.680 
to layer later three layers of the elf
late<00:02:16.860> metal<00:02:17.400> now<00:02:18.000> you're<00:02:18.239> actually<00:02:18.420> looking

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
late metal now you're actually looking

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.369 
late metal now you're actually looking
at<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.080> very<00:02:19.290> unstable<00:02:20.540> single<00:02:21.540> layer<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.019> the

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
at a very unstable single layer of the

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.009 
at a very unstable single layer of the
airplane<00:02:22.890> metal<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.030> does<00:02:24.269> not<00:02:24.660> look<00:02:24.959> very

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
airplane metal so it does not look very

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.199 
airplane metal so it does not look very
stable<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.280> once<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.640> put<00:02:26.849> three

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
stable but if you once you put three

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.540 
stable but if you once you put three
layers<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.900> metal<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:29.010> such<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.340> very

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
layers of the metal in such a very

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.089 
layers of the metal in such a very
stable<00:02:29.910> now<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:30.959> stand<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.380> its<00:02:31.440> own<00:02:31.769> but

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
stable now it can stand on its own but

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.750 
stable now it can stand on its own but
with<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.700> little<00:02:32.970> slight<00:02:33.420> pushes<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.200> be<00:02:34.760> like

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
with a little slight pushes to be like

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.300 
with a little slight pushes to be like
fall<00:02:36.660> down<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:37.019> its<00:02:37.230> sites<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:38.010> very

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
fall down on its sites but it's very

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.490 
fall down on its sites but it's very
very<00:02:38.670> stable<00:02:38.940> after<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.480> put<00:02:39.690> three<00:02:40.319> layers

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
very stable after you put three layers

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.030 
very stable after you put three layers
of<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.069> elf<00:02:41.310> metal<00:02:42.060> bits<00:02:42.739> comparing<00:02:43.739> to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
of the elf metal bits comparing to

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.970 
of the elf metal bits comparing to
drilling<00:02:44.879> hosted<00:02:45.330> casing<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> much

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
drilling hosted casing this is a much

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.360 
drilling hosted casing this is a much
less<00:02:47.880> intrusive<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.530> air<00:02:49.739> wheel<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.340> you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
less intrusive to the air wheel so you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.539 
less intrusive to the air wheel so you
can<00:02:50.489> treat<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.940> meant<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.540> without

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
can treat this meant to it without

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.390 
can treat this meant to it without
affecting<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.670> casing<00:02:54.239> itself<00:02:54.890> at<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.160> dance

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
affecting the casing itself at the dance

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.670 
affecting the casing itself at the dance
that<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:56.730> need<00:02:57.000> trolley<00:02:57.750> handlebar<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.410> order

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
that you need trolley handlebar in order

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.339 
that you need trolley handlebar in order
to<00:02:58.829> install<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.370> 10<00:02:59.900> but<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.200> a

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
to install this 10 but it is a

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.509 
to install this 10 but it is a
definitely<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:02.010> much<00:03:02.250> user<00:03:03.739> friendly<00:03:04.739> stand

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
definitely a much user friendly stand

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.210 
definitely a much user friendly stand
that<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:05.940> can<00:03:06.209> t<00:03:06.420> use<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.750> anywhere<00:03:07.530> just
