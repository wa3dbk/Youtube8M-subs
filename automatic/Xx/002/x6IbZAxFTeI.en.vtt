00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.270
 guys girls or all I am Cordovan 

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.460
 unleashed and this is minecraft does 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.030
 very much but a lot when I left 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.440
 finally the 1.8 and before the diet 1.8 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.269
 I announced that from minecraft all 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.009
 that you have premium account you could 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.110
 change the name of agreement 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.200
 there were people like for example a boy 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.210
 It was called Albert Gamer 777, it's worth 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.950
 many times I said please 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.050
 change my name please because 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.670
 well I put this name at the beginning 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.400
 when I bought the account but now I 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.750
 like to change it for a different one 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.010
 that can happen I in my case has not 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.690
 happened in agreement although I already tell you 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.940
 that in my case it would be final to change the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.090
 name because my name has 15 digits 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.220
 it is the maximum allowed by moyano 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.470
 in the names what does that mean that the 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.090
 plugins allow 14 buildings that's why 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.610
 many times when I play a server 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.130
 my skin is not seen because the plugin like 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.500
 just caught 14 digits with laces 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.830
 treaty 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.239
 there it is worth it happens that it looks for a 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.710
 skin with that name in minecraft 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.450
 training does not find it and it puts me 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.850
 steve then everyone now you 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.920
 of your steve steve, that's why 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.870
 lenses but name change I like them 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.460
 the Untied enjoy but from 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.960
 now your visa to be able to change those that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.310
 you are premium your name 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.799
 quietly in minecraft worth 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.450
 in non-premium beings I miss a 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.610
 little bit with the theme this is worth it 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.070
 ask for the best range of agreement if 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.509
 you have for example a moderator rank 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.549
 a lawyer rank and you change the name 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.560
 you have to return to give the range is not valid 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.210
 change to that, but on the servers 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.679
 premium if you are moderator of a 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.229
 premium server and you change the name 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.799
 your range of agreement in the 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.479
 server 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.119
 that catches it inside the servers 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.320
 premium according to what you know 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.490
 how do you do this right now 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.890
 I'm seeing is some images of me 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.619
 server ship returns the typical no 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.640
 but how is it really good you have 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.159
 quirosa 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.340
 minecraft point of agreement www minecraft 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.799
 punto net the visas you see, you are going to 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.130
 the profile part click where you put 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:02.929
 the first link you register and where you put 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.759
 a profile name james you give that sainz jr 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.470
 It's also going to change. Englishmen change 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.690
 English is very bad but at least 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.640
 I know some words and you're going to 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.170
 change and voila change your name and 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.030
 is transaban new name according 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.290
 which means that in non- premium locations 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.549
 you would have to register again 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.650
 again agree but you can 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.819
 change your names how many 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.189
 Sometimes you can change 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.810
 I have no idea it's a mystery but I 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.480

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.829
