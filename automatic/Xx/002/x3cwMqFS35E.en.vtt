kickstand the kickstand the bike has a

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.500 
kickstand the kickstand the bike has a
heart<00:02:26.980> lean<00:02:27.220> see<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:27.849> on<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.030> kickstand<00:02:28.390> by

heart lean see it's on the kickstand by

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.839 
heart lean see it's on the kickstand by
itself<00:02:28.780> without<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.260> rock<00:02:29.560> or<00:02:29.799> anything<00:02:29.920> has<00:02:30.790> a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
heart like it leans really steep so I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.110 
heart like it leans really steep so I
guess<00:02:35.620> people<00:02:35.890> put<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.160> rock<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.640> or<00:02:36.940> make

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
guess people put the rock on it or make

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.650 
guess people put the rock on it or make
it<00:02:37.150> stand<00:02:38.019> up<00:02:38.200> straighter<00:02:39.060> okay<00:02:40.060> now<00:02:40.209> back<00:02:40.450> to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
it stand up straighter okay now back to

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.839 
it stand up straighter okay now back to
what<00:02:40.780> was<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.440> saying<00:02:41.709> about<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.459> shipping

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
what was I saying about the shipping

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.000 
what was I saying about the shipping
stuff<00:02:43.629> and<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.900> reasons<00:02:44.379> not<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.620> ship<00:02:44.890> it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
stuff and the reasons not to ship it

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.589 
stuff and the reasons not to ship it
back<00:02:45.040> probably<00:02:45.400> because<00:02:46.120> they<00:02:46.239> will<00:02:46.390> probably

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
back probably because they will probably

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.539 
back probably because they will probably
make<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.870> pay<00:02:47.379> for<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.799> shipping<00:02:48.069> back<00:02:48.340> which

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
make you pay for the shipping back which

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.630 
make you pay for the shipping back which

might<00:03:12.790> drop<00:03:13.510> your<00:03:13.720> bike<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.799> it's<00:03:14.920> gonna<00:03:15.040> get

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
might drop your bike so it's gonna get

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.099 
might drop your bike so it's gonna get
messed<00:03:15.400> up<00:03:15.579> anyway<00:03:15.879> and<00:03:16.299> this<00:03:16.750> stuff<00:03:17.019> was

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
messed up anyway and this stuff was

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.870 
messed up anyway and this stuff was
barely<00:03:17.680> noticeable<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.220> wasn't<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.730> man

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
barely noticeable so I wasn't the man

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.629 
barely noticeable so I wasn't the man
spending<00:03:22.419> $300<00:03:23.139> oh<00:03:23.349> and<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.099> handlebar<00:03:24.489> thing

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
spending $300 oh and the handlebar thing

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.819 
spending $300 oh and the handlebar thing
I'll<00:03:24.790> take<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.120> off<00:03:25.269> because<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.709> was

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
I'll take that off because it was

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.229 
I'll take that off because it was
scratched<00:03:27.160> up<00:03:27.340> real<00:03:27.579> bad<00:03:27.760> from<00:03:28.000> chipping

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
scratched up real bad from chipping

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.059 
scratched up real bad from chipping
because<00:03:28.690> they<00:03:28.780> wrap<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.019> wire<00:03:29.349> around<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.950> I

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
because they wrap a wire around it I

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.870 
because they wrap a wire around it I
guess<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.430> keep<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.940> bike<00:03:31.060> steady<00:03:32.549> now

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
guess to keep the bike steady now

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.729 
guess to keep the bike steady now
it's<00:03:34.389> a<00:03:34.419> pretty<00:03:34.630> decent<00:03:34.989> bike<00:03:35.139> I've<00:03:35.380> gotten<00:03:35.680> it

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
it's a pretty decent bike I've gotten it

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.449 
it's a pretty decent bike I've gotten it
up<00:03:35.919> to<00:03:36.099> about<00:03:36.870> 45<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.200> far<00:03:38.440> but<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:39.099> know<00:03:39.220> I

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
up to about 45 so far but you know I

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.000 
up to about 45 so far but you know I
don't<00:03:40.120> have<00:03:40.209> anywhere<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.599> even<00:03:41.380> try<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.680> test

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
don't have anywhere to even try to test

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:50.210 
don't have anywhere to even try to test
them<00:03:42.190> expeed<00:03:43.410> dual<00:03:44.410> disc<00:03:44.769> brakes<00:03:47.130> oil<00:03:48.130> I<00:03:48.540> had<00:03:49.540> I

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
them expeed dual disc brakes oil I had I

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.069 
them expeed dual disc brakes oil I had I
put<00:03:51.220> more<00:03:51.489> oil<00:03:51.849> in<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.269> because<00:03:52.599> I<00:03:52.690> thought<00:03:52.900> the

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
put more oil in it because I thought the

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.390 
put more oil in it because I thought the
oil<00:03:53.260> was<00:03:53.530> empty<00:03:54.180> wrong<00:03:55.180> they<00:03:55.930> had<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.620> guess<00:03:57.010> I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
oil was empty wrong they had I guess I

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.069 
oil was empty wrong they had I guess I
don't<00:03:57.669> know<00:03:57.790> if<00:03:57.849> they<00:03:57.940> put<00:03:57.970> braking<00:03:58.480> oil<00:03:58.810> or

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
don't know if they put braking oil or

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.170 
don't know if they put braking oil or
either<00:03:59.799> way<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.190> was<00:04:00.280> too<00:04:00.430> much<00:04:00.579> oil<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:00.940> there

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
either way it was too much oil in there

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.170 
either way it was too much oil in there
oil<00:04:01.329> pressure<00:04:01.540> went<00:04:01.930> out<00:04:02.169> the<00:04:02.379> roof<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:03.370> over

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
oil pressure went out the roof and over

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.220 
oil pressure went out the roof and over
here<00:04:04.569> yeah

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
here yeah

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.830 
here yeah
I'm<00:04:05.829> pulling<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.220> clutch<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.540> say<00:04:07.720> that

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
I'm pulling the clutch and you say that

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.119 
I'm pulling the clutch and you say that
thing<00:04:08.019> that<00:04:08.169> moves<00:04:08.379> when<00:04:08.799> I<00:04:08.829> pulled<00:04:09.099> the

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 
thing that moves when I pulled the

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.460 
thing that moves when I pulled the
clutch<00:04:09.370> or<00:04:10.060> y'all<00:04:10.299> was<00:04:10.510> shooting<00:04:10.959> out<00:04:11.169> that

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
clutch or y'all was shooting out that

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.349 
clutch or y'all was shooting out that
like<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.829> was<00:04:11.949> just<00:04:12.069> my<00:04:12.459> god<00:04:12.730> let<00:04:13.060> me<00:04:13.180> out<00:04:13.329> of

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
like it was just my god let me out of

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.529 
like it was just my god let me out of
here<00:04:13.629> so<00:04:14.530> after<00:04:15.459> looking<00:04:15.910> on<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.209> internet<00:04:16.510> I

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
here so after looking on the internet I

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.029 
here so after looking on the internet I
realized<00:04:17.079> that<00:04:17.229> my<00:04:17.349> oil<00:04:17.470> pressure<00:04:17.799> was<00:04:18.010> high

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
realized that my oil pressure was high

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.779 
realized that my oil pressure was high
and<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:18.699> there<00:04:19.389> was<00:04:19.539> already<00:04:19.810> oil<00:04:20.349> in<00:04:20.979> the

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
and that there was already oil in the

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.730 
and that there was already oil in the
bike<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.570> put<00:04:22.840> another<00:04:23.140> court<00:04:23.530> in<00:04:23.680> there

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
bike and I put another court in there

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.629 
bike and I put another court in there
I<00:04:25.770> changed<00:04:26.699> oil<00:04:27.680> because<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.800> had<00:04:29.009> to<00:04:29.250> otherwise

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
I changed oil because I had to otherwise

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.689 
I changed oil because I had to otherwise
it<00:04:29.849> would<00:04:29.940> have<00:04:30.030> just<00:04:30.180> kept<00:04:30.479> shooting<00:04:30.750> oil<00:04:31.199> out

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
it would have just kept shooting oil out

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.680 
it would have just kept shooting oil out
and<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.879> oil<00:04:33.090> thing<00:04:33.539> is<00:04:34.819> the<00:04:35.819> oil<00:04:36.060> screw<00:04:36.389> or

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
and the oil thing is the oil screw or

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.680 
and the oil thing is the oil screw or
whatever<00:04:37.500> is<00:04:37.650> under<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.039> bike<00:04:38.360> it's<00:04:39.360> kind<00:04:39.599> of

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
whatever is under the bike it's kind of

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.909 
whatever is under the bike it's kind of
at<00:04:39.870> an<00:04:40.020> angle<00:04:41.990> so<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.020> changed<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.560> oil

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
at an angle so I changed the oil

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.379 
at an angle so I changed the oil
I'll<00:04:44.099> put<00:04:44.639> 10<00:04:44.909> W<00:04:45.330> 40<00:04:45.750> in<00:04:45.870> there<00:04:46.050> four-stroke

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
I'll put 10 W 40 in there four-stroke

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.320 
I'll put 10 W 40 in there four-stroke
non-synthetic<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:49.340> don't<00:04:50.340> really<00:04:50.879> know<00:04:51.090> if<00:04:51.210> I

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
non-synthetic I don't really know if I

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.770 
non-synthetic I don't really know if I
should<00:04:51.569> have<00:04:51.599> put<00:04:51.990> it<00:04:52.220> synthetic<00:04:53.220> or<00:04:53.430> not<00:04:54.419> but

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
should have put it synthetic or not but

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.629 
should have put it synthetic or not but
either<00:04:54.990> way<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.470> put<00:04:55.740> non-synthetic<00:04:56.159> just

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
either way I put non-synthetic just

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.950 
either way I put non-synthetic just
regular<00:04:56.940> oil<00:04:57.289> for<00:04:58.289> a<00:04:58.319> motorcycle<00:04:59.960> things

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
regular oil for a motorcycle things

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.270 
regular oil for a motorcycle things
that's<00:05:01.259> good<00:05:01.409> about<00:05:01.620> this<00:05:01.770> bike<00:05:01.949> if<00:05:02.099> you're<00:05:02.219> a

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
that's good about this bike if you're a

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.980 
that's good about this bike if you're a
beginner<00:05:02.610> it's<00:05:03.360> not<00:05:03.509> a<00:05:03.539> lot<00:05:03.719> of<00:05:03.810> maintenance

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
beginner it's not a lot of maintenance

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.270 
beginner it's not a lot of maintenance
it<00:05:04.440> doesn't<00:05:04.740> have<00:05:04.830> a<00:05:04.860> filter<00:05:07.699> clutch<00:05:08.699> fluid

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
it doesn't have a filter clutch fluid

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.180 
it doesn't have a filter clutch fluid
liquid<00:05:11.280> coolant<00:05:12.469> because<00:05:13.469> it's<00:05:13.650> forced<00:05:13.979> air

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.219 
liquid coolant because it's forced air
cooled<00:05:14.490> which<00:05:14.789> means<00:05:15.030> it<00:05:15.539> cools<00:05:15.780> down<00:05:15.870> by<00:05:16.169> you

cooled which means it cools down by you

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.959 
cooled which means it cools down by you

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.590 
check the air pressure if you can I
didn't<00:07:10.430> because<00:07:10.870> my<00:07:11.870> other<00:07:11.990> resources<00:07:12.560> too

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:13.600

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
but you know they're fine and that's

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:30.430 
but you know they're fine and that's
about<00:07:25.790> all<00:07:26.090> I<00:07:26.120> can<00:07:26.300> tell<00:07:26.720> you<00:07:26.930> I<00:07:29.110> have<00:07:30.110> a<00:07:30.200> video

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 
about all I can tell you I have a video

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.850 
about all I can tell you I have a video
of<00:07:30.590> it<00:07:30.710> riding<00:07:31.400> and<00:07:31.550> me<00:07:32.090> on<00:07:32.270> it<00:07:32.420> too<00:07:32.600> and<00:07:33.560> I<00:07:33.650> put

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
of it riding and me on it too and I put

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
of it riding and me on it too and I put
the<00:07:34.010> camera<00:07:34.490> in<00:07:34.580> my<00:07:34.610> helmet<00:07:35.090> and<00:07:35.330> showed<00:07:36.880> how

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:37.880 
the camera in my helmet and showed how

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.780 
the camera in my helmet and showed how
it<00:07:37.910> sounds<00:07:38.330> when<00:07:38.420> it<00:07:38.570> shifts<00:07:38.750> and<00:07:38.960> stuff<00:07:39.200> but<00:07:39.410> I

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:39.790 
it sounds when it shifts and stuff but I

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.800 
it sounds when it shifts and stuff but I
think<00:07:40.790> I<00:07:40.850> need<00:07:41.000> to<00:07:41.090> make<00:07:41.240> a<00:07:41.270> new<00:07:41.420> one<00:07:41.540> because

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.810 
think I need to make a new one because

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.260 
think I need to make a new one because
it<00:07:41.930> was<00:07:42.020> a<00:07:42.050> little<00:07:42.290> off<00:07:42.680> so<00:07:43.160> I<00:07:43.430> won't<00:07:44.150> be

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.270 
it was a little off so I won't be

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.630 
it was a little off so I won't be
getting<00:07:44.390> that<00:07:44.540> now<00:07:44.810> I<00:07:48.310> think<00:07:49.310> that's<00:07:49.460> all<00:07:49.610> I

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:49.640 
getting that now I think that's all I

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.380 
getting that now I think that's all I
have<00:07:49.700> to<00:07:49.880> say<00:07:49.910> okay<00:07:50.900> thank<00:07:51.170> you<00:07:51.230> guys
