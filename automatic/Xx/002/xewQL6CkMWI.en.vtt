00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
welcome back settling here today I want

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.949 
welcome back settling here today I want
to<00:00:03.120> show<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.330> something<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.659> did<00:00:03.840> with

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
to show you something I did with

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.019 
to show you something I did with
redstone<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.670> something<00:00:05.940> you've

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
redstone and this is something you've

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.519 
redstone and this is something you've
probably<00:00:06.180> seen<00:00:06.420> before<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.899> idea<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.230> you

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
probably seen before the idea is you

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.470 
probably seen before the idea is you
have<00:00:07.560> another<00:00:08.309> portal<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.970> through<00:00:09.269> it<00:00:09.389> you

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
have another portal and through it you

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.759 
have another portal and through it you
can<00:00:09.630> see<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.900> section<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.290> nether<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.679> you

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
can see the section of nether that you

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.919 
can see the section of nether that you
would<00:00:10.889> teleport<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.490> if<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.420> went<00:00:12.599> through<00:00:12.750> it

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
would teleport to if you went through it

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.620 
would teleport to if you went through it
and<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> outside<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.250> overworld

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
and on the outside it's overworld

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.760 
and on the outside it's overworld
what<00:00:15.900> I've<00:00:15.990> done<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.379> bit<00:00:16.500> different

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
what I've done is a little bit different

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.410 
what I've done is a little bit different
though<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.640> actually<00:00:17.880> updates

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
though because this one actually updates

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.269 
though because this one actually updates
as<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.900> move<00:00:19.050> around<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.770> can<00:00:19.920> see<00:00:20.100> it

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
as you move around so you can see it

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.450 
as you move around so you can see it
looks<00:00:20.609> like<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.300> nether<00:00:21.539> through<00:00:21.990> here

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
looks like just the nether through here

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.730 
looks like just the nether through here
but<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.760> area<00:00:24.330> around<00:00:24.480> here<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:25.380> see<00:00:25.590> it

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
but the area around here you can see it

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
but the area around here you can see it
just<00:00:26.039> looks<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:27.510> looks<00:00:27.660> like

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
just looks like just looks like

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.359 
just looks like just looks like
overworld<00:00:28.260> when<00:00:28.560> I'm<00:00:28.680> looking<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.279> from

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
overworld when I'm looking at it from

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.730 
overworld when I'm looking at it from
over<00:00:29.550> here<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> kind<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.349> peek<00:00:31.529> back

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
over here but when I kind of peek back

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.810 
over here but when I kind of peek back
through<00:00:32.390> it<00:00:33.390> looks<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.690> nether<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
through it looks like nether and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.680 
through it looks like nether and
obviously<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.000> perfect<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.570> see

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
obviously it's not perfect you can see

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.160 
obviously it's not perfect you can see
it<00:00:36.780> glitching<00:00:37.079> from<00:00:37.230> time<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.469> time<00:00:37.500> okay<00:00:38.250> yeah

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
it glitching from time to time okay yeah

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.350 
it glitching from time to time okay yeah
but<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.559> does<00:00:40.739> work<00:00:40.950> okay<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.700> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.149> stand

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
but it does work okay and if you stand

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.560 
but it does work okay and if you stand
still<00:00:42.540> usually<00:00:43.230> it'll<00:00:43.579> it'll<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:45.059> okay<00:00:45.329> it's

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
still usually it'll it'll be okay it's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.540 
still usually it'll it'll be okay it's
just<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:46.020> little<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.469> laggy<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.980> update<00:00:47.340> as<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
just a little bit laggy to update as you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850 
just a little bit laggy to update as you
move<00:00:47.820> around<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.930> why<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.170> shifting<00:00:49.620> as

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
move around and it's why I'm shifting as

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.520 
move around and it's why I'm shifting as
I<00:00:49.980> move<00:00:50.129> around<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
I move around but a so you can see if I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.160 
I move around but a so you can see if I
back<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.309> see<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> tree<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
back up I can see the tree here but if I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.260 
back up I can see the tree here but if I
come<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.440> closer<00:00:56.840> it's<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.109> another<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
come up closer it's just another and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.220 
come up closer it's just another and
yeah<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.629> move<00:01:00.750> around<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.050> bit

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
yeah so if I move around a little bit

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.689 
yeah so if I move around a little bit
faster<00:01:01.559> you'll<00:01:01.680> able<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> lot<00:01:02.430> more<00:01:02.460> of

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
faster you'll able to see a lot more of

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.479 
faster you'll able to see a lot more of
the<00:01:02.850> glitchyness<00:01:03.769> it<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.040> wasn't<00:01:05.339> possible

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the glitchyness it just wasn't possible

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.550 
the glitchyness it just wasn't possible
to<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> redstone<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> update<00:01:07.320> fast

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
to get the redstone to update fast

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.039 
to get the redstone to update fast
enough<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.010> order<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> make<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.610> seamless

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
enough in order to make it seamless

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.420 
enough in order to make it seamless
unfortunately<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.920> still<00:01:11.040> pretty<00:01:11.250> good

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
unfortunately but it's still pretty good

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
unfortunately but it's still pretty good
and<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.030> stand<00:01:12.240> still<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:13.080> looks<00:01:13.260> really

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and if you stand still it looks really

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.670 
and if you stand still it looks really
good<00:01:13.710> usually<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:15.060> usually<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.659> looks<00:01:15.869> usually

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
good usually it usually it looks usually

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.960 
good usually it usually it looks usually
you<00:01:16.770> don't<00:01:16.860> see<00:01:17.040> any<00:01:17.189> over<00:01:17.430> world<00:01:17.640> through<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you don't see any over world through the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.070 
you don't see any over world through the
portal<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> don't<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.630> any<00:01:18.750> other<00:01:18.900> outside

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
portal you don't see any other outside

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.749 
portal you don't see any other outside
the<00:01:19.350> portal<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.920> you're<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.280> standing<00:01:20.400> still

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the portal if you're just standing still

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
the portal if you're just standing still
well<00:01:21.509> sometimes<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.049> glitchyness<00:01:22.500> like

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
well sometimes you get glitchyness like

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.490 
well sometimes you get glitchyness like
this<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.150> ahead<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.450> look<00:01:25.170> through<00:01:25.350> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
this if I go ahead and look through it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.219 
this if I go ahead and look through it
like<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.390> hop<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> air<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.080> will

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
like this and hop up in the air you will

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.690 
like this and hop up in the air you will
to<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.409> what's<00:01:28.650> happening<00:01:29.070> basically<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
to see what's happening basically the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.929 
to see what's happening basically the
game<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.270> calculating<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> cone<00:01:31.409> of

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
game is calculating the cone of

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.010 
game is calculating the cone of
visibility<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.509> player<00:01:33.689> should<00:01:33.930> be

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
visibility that the player should be

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.810 
visibility that the player should be
able<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.200> see<00:01:34.409> through<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> portal<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.369> it's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
able to see through the portal and it's

able see the different cone of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.100 
able see the different cone of
visibility<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.880> naturally<00:01:54.810> updates

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
visibility and it just naturally updates

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.709 
visibility and it just naturally updates
that<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.530> move<00:01:55.680> around<00:01:55.850> every<00:01:56.850> spot<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that as I move around every spot on the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.569 
that as I move around every spot on the
ground<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:58.259> has<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> different<00:01:58.680> cone<00:01:59.250> that's

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
ground here has a different cone that's

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.039 
ground here has a different cone that's
been<00:01:59.850> pre<00:02:00.060> calculated<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.430> come<00:02:02.430> over<00:02:02.549> here

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
been pre calculated and come over here

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.719 
been pre calculated and come over here
and<00:02:04.049> see<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> cone<00:02:04.530> now<00:02:05.219> here's<00:02:05.490> all<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and see the cone now here's all the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.969 
and see the cone now here's all the
command<00:02:06.030> blocks<00:02:06.240> there's<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.320> row<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.920> each

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
command blocks there's a row for each

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.499 
command blocks there's a row for each
possible<00:02:08.670> spot<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> could<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.360> standing

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
possible spot that I could be standing

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.900 
possible spot that I could be standing
on<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> ground

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
on the ground

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.790 
on the ground
so<00:02:11.120> this<00:02:11.750> isn't<00:02:11.900> really<00:02:12.170> feasible<00:02:12.320> for<00:02:12.710> a

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
so this isn't really feasible for a

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.040 
so this isn't really feasible for a
large<00:02:13.010> area<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.610> plus<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.660> fact<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.930> have

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
large area that plus the fact you have

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.440 
large area that plus the fact you have
to<00:02:15.110> clone<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.500> lot<00:02:15.650> more<00:02:15.800> blocks<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:17.060> larger

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
to clone in a lot more blocks the larger

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.730 
to clone in a lot more blocks the larger
the<00:02:17.540> area<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.870> want<00:02:17.960> to<00:02:18.140> accomplish<00:02:18.410> this

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
the area you want to accomplish this

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.790 
the area you want to accomplish this
with<00:02:18.950> but<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.700> think<00:02:19.910> as<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.510> prototype<00:02:20.960> or<00:02:21.290> kind

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
with but I think as a prototype or kind

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.050 
with but I think as a prototype or kind
of<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.920> proof-of-concept<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.760> works<00:02:22.970> pretty

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
of a proof-of-concept this works pretty

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.250 
of a proof-of-concept this works pretty
well<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:24.490> just<00:02:25.490> kind<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:26.210> neat<00:02:26.600> concept<00:02:26.810> I

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
well and I just kind of a neat concept I

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.190 
well and I just kind of a neat concept I
hadn't<00:02:27.710> seen<00:02:27.860> anywhere<00:02:28.270> or<00:02:29.270> expands<00:02:30.080> on<00:02:30.170> a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
hadn't seen anywhere or expands on a

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.320 
hadn't seen anywhere or expands on a
concept<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.710> have<00:02:30.890> seen<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.120> want<00:02:32.270> to

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
concept I have seen and so I want to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.630 
concept I have seen and so I want to
share<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.740> yeah<00:02:33.740> that's<00:02:33.890> about<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.340> thanks<00:02:34.520> for

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
share it yeah that's about it thanks for

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.700 
share it yeah that's about it thanks for
watching
