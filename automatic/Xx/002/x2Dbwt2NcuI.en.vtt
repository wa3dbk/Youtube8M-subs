 download the files that would be the 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.770
 part 1 of this installation that would be 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.390

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.780
 that you accept, you are also going to 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.840
 start installing 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.210
 after that installation 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.950
 this kind what 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.550
 from that installation you are going to 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.110
 binary 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.710
 this folder they put copy 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.059
 go to wide local disk equipment

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.790
 I can here you can stick it would stay in the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.220
 binary folder 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.930
 and so I'm going to replace everything 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.630
 and then the second part will be 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.250
 of the installation this I already did have 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.490

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.250
 here I would be ready and you when 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.750
 They are playing before when played 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.170
 improve like three minutes and it gets better 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.170
 of the game 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.650
 they are going to download this file 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:22.010
 archive copy 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.010
 again seek the obligation of the game 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.739
 If I am going to replace, I will replace 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.230
 Gaia could already work for him 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.170
 online game what I'm going to do is 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.709
 occupy 1 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.390
 an account estimates that almost a quota that 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.620
 I have it as abandoned because I do not know if 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.620
 they will reach the account when playing 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.930
 on-line 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.610
 but what they have to do is not leave 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.220
 the game orchards and play a game or 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.970
 two after they do not bring albÃ¡n good 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.970
 after the game they have to open it with 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.970
 administrator 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.700

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.849

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.360
 let mental game there cross the leo 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:19.360
 they cross their fingers not crossing without 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.740
 I would raise the game 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.630
 here as they come we are going to film I do not know here 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.640
 and jump the start of the normal game 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.500
 for these regions 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.510
 one can select I think you're 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.240
 two are the ones that have less ping like this 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.569
 that one enters 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.450
 and now the music of spotify 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.889
 there is looking, we hope that we 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.889
 count some party 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.840
