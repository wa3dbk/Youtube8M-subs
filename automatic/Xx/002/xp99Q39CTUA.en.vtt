a necessary evil for him he goes there
at<00:00:39.090> least<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.660> couple<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.989> times<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.410> year<00:00:40.680> and

at least a couple of times a year and
and<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.790> think<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.180> great<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.600> him<00:00:42.690> because

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and I think it's great for him because

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.160 
and I think it's great for him because
it's<00:00:43.410> an<00:00:43.530> escape<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.250> him<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> the

closing<00:04:59.300> speed<00:04:59.720> at<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.960> end<00:05:00.169> yeah<00:05:00.889> I<00:05:00.919> mean<00:05:01.220> I

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
closing speed at the end yeah I mean I

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.850 
closing speed at the end yeah I mean I
think<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:02.060> don't<00:05:02.930> think<00:05:03.229> I<00:05:03.289> was<00:05:03.410> out<00:05:03.530> too<00:05:03.680> fast

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
think I don't think I was out too fast

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.770 
think I don't think I was out too fast
and<00:05:04.669> I<00:05:04.789> think<00:05:04.970> that's<00:05:05.120> something<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.450> I

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
and I think that's something that I

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.490 
and I think that's something that I
needed<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.830> be<00:05:06.979> so<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:08.240> felt<00:05:08.930> good<00:05:08.990> coming<00:05:09.200> back

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
needed to be so I felt good coming back

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.629 
needed to be so I felt good coming back
and<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:09.740> felt<00:05:09.889> like<00:05:10.039> I<00:05:10.130> couldn't<00:05:10.370> really<00:05:10.490> get

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
and it felt like I couldn't really get

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.460 
and it felt like I couldn't really get
into<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:11.000> first<00:05:11.180> 5000<00:05:11.600> can<00:05:11.870> you<00:05:11.960> see<00:05:12.139> Park
