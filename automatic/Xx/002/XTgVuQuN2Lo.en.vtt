00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.700
 johannis tÃ¤ter with a new and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.010
 Although this time title marx and see you soon 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.019
 again economically the comments 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.059
 flame so and so often do not exist 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.070
 water and bushes 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.310
 so it's an important strategic 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.710
 the source of the springs I now too 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.119
 The empire did not build with them 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.750
 on spengler so they only know the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.779
 approximate coordinates have back there 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.210
 built a small tent camp resp 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.700
 camp to gather their troops 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 To rest you when you are from one 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.610
 sudden attack of the rebels 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.860
 surprised and yes this base is too 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.899
 near an oasis she is on 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.280
 north so in their blunt where the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.789
 flow flows so watch me introduce 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.149
 that you are flowing down and this 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:01.260
 here and there because of something because of 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.699
 8 forget it will exist 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.710
 it is only time for the rebels 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.049
 just these imperial troops spotted 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.790
 and this attack is under the leadership 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:15.960
 by han solo yes I have sex 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.740
 traditional torso given from the thing 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.189
 So the body from the slate one 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.479
 was approached in the cabinet but was 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.250
 it has nothing to say it has nothing to do with it 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.259
 the cabinet history to the game 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.360
 between four and five until him 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.250
 just warm and hearty shirt 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.720
 actually train it 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.720
 understanding understanding yes understanding 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:52.530
 no matter understanding yes so ag well then 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.939
 here this snowflutter from courage of the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.939
 want to use 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:14.580
 the atsv alien from techno somebody 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:17.610
 self built ap rtr a version here 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.650
 the trade now the couple yes so we 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.650
 are two minutes now I want now 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.230
 no one not so long videos yet 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.110
 we also see the ground here 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.760
 pretty much we coated and 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.710
 I decide the whole thing here 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.860
 built a setup with the river 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.100
 all also saved as real stones 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.990
 took and the cool sayings 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:53.760
 As you can see, sand this sand 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:55.590
 several fetched that ok well there i have 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.650
 but now you like it already 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.770
 is actually well so I always have 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.170
 just a little bit the bigger ones 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.940
 can be adhered to the plates can 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.290
 I love it so much detail here and 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.380
 I think that is pretty good 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:15.690
 succeeded and yes next top team without 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.250
 water of course the so-called base 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.739
 when at some point one comes again 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.000
 that will probably happen to me 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.250
 actually have the river now only 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.150
 not built because of the story or so 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:32.340
 but also had on the catwalk and 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.530
 had been there on the river and then there 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.200
 it was terrible because that is where 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.930
 maybe driving there would have to be 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.769
 actually also give a flow so 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.650
 doing here in the have the moisture or 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.269
 and there I have just such a flow 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.190
 currently built very cool 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.720
 I think I'm doing really well now 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.900
 we have this is way I want 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.060
 say goodbye 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.590
 yes, as you have also seen 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.560
 I might have started looking 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:10.400
 although the first are tests and hd 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.510
 it is not there either 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.120
 and I ask you honestly 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.239
 goal in storyboard water happen like 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.040
 that happen on what planets or 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:27.780
 Here it was easy than me 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.780
 and yes the water people's tooth
