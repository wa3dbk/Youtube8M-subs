 love and 18 wheels with the bank of the planet 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.440
 who put here that is 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.660
 Initially, the task was to deliver 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.400
 budget system replacing states acoustics 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:06.170
 with minimal let's say 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:08.030
 interventions yes there in in this car 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 used components from this series 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.460
 series of the very first 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.180
 which manufacturers are white 2001 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.890
 accordingly, we are talking about him 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.890
 I'll tell you in more detail how she 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.009
 acoustics series are used 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.000
 patented two-layer paper 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.890
 diffuser here and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.009
 which lets you hear smooth

 saturated bass focus mid-tones 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.909
 Neodymium magnet provides smooth and 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.210
 accurate high frequency reproduction 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.950
 soft framing around the diffuser 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.500
 providing accurate sound transmission 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.509
 pictures of component models use 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.069
 liter of pure silk for crystal 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.720
 exact reproduction in h 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.119
 This type is used in expensive 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.399
 home systems you get finished 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.229
 professional high five his small 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.229
 mounting depth fits practically in 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.119
 any car 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.490
 Well, this stick seems to be all clear 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.490
 now let's see what we put there 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.020
 12 with remote control series with paper cone 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:23.900
 four plus four at 300 watts 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:27.700
 two amplifiers 1 as a 400 series . 1 and 4

 100.4 respectively acoustics vienna 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.209
 also here we used protective 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.950
 grill from our company partners yes 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.950
 forgive which 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.610
 well let's listen
