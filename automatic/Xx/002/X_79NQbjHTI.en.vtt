00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
boeing 717 there and what what's

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760 
boeing 717 there and what what's
interesting<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.930> reached<00:00:37.260> its

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
interesting is that it reached its

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.130 
interesting is that it reached its
distance<00:00:38.460> between<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:39.270> aircraft<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
distance between this aircraft and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
distance between this aircraft and
boeing<00:00:40.559> 77<00:00:41.190> was<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:41.640> point<00:00:41.670> between<00:00:42.180> three

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
boeing 77 was at one point between three

boeing 77 was at one point between three
to<00:00:42.570> five<00:00:42.600> kilometers<00:00:43.160> now<00:00:44.160> what's<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
to five kilometers now what's the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.700 
to five kilometers now what's the
question<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.390> springs<00:00:45.719> up<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.320> why

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
question that springs up here is why

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.130 
question that springs up here is why
deploy<00:00:47.250> military<00:00:47.520> jets<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.390> close<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
deploy military jets so close to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.049 
deploy military jets so close to
passenger<00:00:49.710> planes<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.610> we're<00:00:50.760> not<00:00:50.850> only

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
passenger planes because we're not only

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.610 
passenger planes because we're not only
talking<00:00:51.270> about<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> malaysian<00:00:52.230> boeing'

there<00:00:52.800> were<00:00:52.860> other<00:00:53.070> planes<00:00:53.430> flying<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
there were other planes flying over that

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.959 
there were other planes flying over that
area<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.870> well<00:00:55.050> why<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.530> reveal<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.010> because

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
area as well why not reveal it because

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.340 
area as well why not reveal it because
since<00:00:57.300> considering<00:00:57.899> everything<00:00:58.140> that's

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
since considering everything that's

characteristic of military aircraft
what's<00:01:32.310> also<00:01:32.490> interesting<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.450> that

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
what's also interesting is that

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.960 
what's also interesting is that
Ukraine's<00:01:34.140> radar<00:01:34.619> activity<00:01:35.280> seemed<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.820> have

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
Ukraine's radar activity seemed to have

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969 
Ukraine's radar activity seemed to have
peak<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.869> day<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.470> crash<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
peak on the day of the crash and

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.859 
peak on the day of the crash and
actually<00:01:38.250> satellite<00:01:38.970> pictures<00:01:39.390> show<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
actually satellite pictures show that

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.050 
actually satellite pictures show that
from<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.439> 14th<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.159> July<00:01:41.579> Ukraine's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
from the 14th of July Ukraine's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060 
from the 14th of July Ukraine's
anti-aircraft<00:01:42.630> missiles<00:01:43.320> were<00:01:43.500> being<00:01:43.710> moved

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
anti-aircraft missiles were being moved

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.429 
anti-aircraft missiles were being moved
towards<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.509> east<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.290> country

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
towards the the east of the country

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.830 
towards the the east of the country
which<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.950> interesting<00:01:47.250> again<00:01:47.670> why<00:01:48.000> because

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
which is interesting again why because

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.440 
which is interesting again why because
Kiev<00:01:49.470> authorities<00:01:49.649> had<00:01:50.579> said<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:51.000> until<00:01:51.119> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
Kiev authorities had said up until that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.350 
Kiev authorities had said up until that
point<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:52.649> anti-government<00:01:53.460> forces<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
point that anti-government forces in the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.840 
point that anti-government forces in the

that<00:02:25.629> you<00:02:26.170> as<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.349> space<00:02:26.890> satellites<00:02:27.430> were

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
that you as a space satellites were

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.640 
that you as a space satellites were
actually<00:02:27.879> monitoring<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.569> very<00:02:28.629> same<00:02:29.140> area

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
actually monitoring that very same area

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.979 
actually monitoring that very same area
surrounding<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.430> plane<00:02:30.849> as<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.599> second

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
surrounding the plane as that second

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.960 
surrounding the plane as that second
aircraft<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.829> they<00:02:32.860> should<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.549> pictures

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
aircraft so they should have pictures

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.850 
aircraft so they should have pictures
and<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:34.209> they<00:02:34.329> do<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.840> them<00:02:35.079> then<00:02:35.470> why<00:02:35.680> not

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
and if they do have them then why not

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.530 
and if they do have them then why not
show<00:02:36.159> them<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:36.700> evidence<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.360> they're

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
show them and this evidence that they're

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.720 
show them and this evidence that they're
saying<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:37.959> they<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.379> why<00:02:38.829> not<00:02:39.069> show<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.579> to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
saying that they have why not show it to

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.550 
saying that they have why not show it to
the<00:02:39.849> world<00:02:39.879> so<00:02:40.150> they<00:02:40.360> can<00:02:40.510> analyze<00:02:40.780> these

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
the world so they can analyze these

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.550 
the world so they can analyze these
pictures<00:02:42.099> as<00:02:42.370> well<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:44.110> was<00:02:44.230> our<00:02:44.349> teeth

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
pictures as well that was our teeth

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.579
