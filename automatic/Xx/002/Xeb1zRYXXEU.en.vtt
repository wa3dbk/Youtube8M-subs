this<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:13.069> I'm<00:02:13.400> kind<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.790> going<00:02:13.970> around<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
this so I'm kind of going around the

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.809 
this so I'm kind of going around the
head<00:02:14.900> leaving<00:02:15.290> about<00:02:15.380> an<00:02:15.650> inch<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:16.190> space<00:02:16.550> and

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
head leaving about an inch of space and

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.240 
head leaving about an inch of space and
for<00:02:17.420> those<00:02:17.540> Clos<00:02:17.900> curvy<00:02:18.349> parts<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:18.950> made<00:02:19.220> a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
for those Clos curvy parts I made a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.280 
for those Clos curvy parts I made a
little<00:02:19.580> cut<00:02:19.940> like<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:20.569> it's<00:02:20.690> easier<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.110> me

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
little cut like so so it's easier for me

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.460 
little cut like so so it's easier for me
to<00:02:21.380> glue<00:02:21.849> to<00:02:22.849> make<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.300> little<00:02:23.510> fringe<00:02:23.989> or<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
to glue to make the little fringe or the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.890 
to glue to make the little fringe or the
bangs<00:02:24.769> for<00:02:25.010> joy<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.519> just<00:02:25.940> basically<00:02:26.150> cut

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
bangs for joy I just basically cut

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.890 
bangs for joy I just basically cut
triangles<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.849> afterwards<00:02:29.300> I'm<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:29.720> going

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
triangles and afterwards I'm just going

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:39.230 
triangles and afterwards I'm just going
to<00:02:30.170> apply<00:02:30.530> some<00:02:30.620> glue<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.459> attach<00:02:31.730> her<00:02:32.420> hair

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.590 

take<00:02:39.990> another<00:02:40.350> strip<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.980> blue<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.700> I'm<00:02:42.090> going

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
take another strip of blue and I'm going

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.220 
take another strip of blue and I'm going
to<00:02:42.630> cut<00:02:43.470> triangle<00:02:44.100> like<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:47.900> cut<00:02:48.900> out<00:02:48.930> this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
to cut triangle like so cut out this

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.810 
to cut triangle like so cut out this
little<00:02:49.530> shape<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.160> don't<00:02:50.310> even<00:02:50.370> know<00:02:50.520> what<00:02:50.670> you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
little shape I don't even know what you

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.180 
little shape I don't even know what you
call<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:51.630> basically<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:52.920> stuck<00:02:53.160> it

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
call this but basically I just stuck it

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.250 
call this but basically I just stuck it
on<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.730> right<00:02:53.910> side<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.330> her<00:02:54.450> head<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.960> to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
on the right side of her head and to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.110 
on the right side of her head and to
finish<00:02:55.530> everything<00:02:55.800> off<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.340> added<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.910> bigger

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
finish everything off I added a bigger

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.450 
finish everything off I added a bigger
piece<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.750> fell<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.440> back<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.220> made

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
piece of fell on the back and I made

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.040 
piece of fell on the back and I made
more<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.760> these<00:02:59.940> little<00:03:00.150> triangles<00:03:00.510> to

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
more of these little triangles to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.200 
more of these little triangles to
represent<00:03:01.620> her<00:03:01.740> hair<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.490> yes<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.850> know<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.000> did

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
represent her hair and yes I know I did

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.030 
represent her hair and yes I know I did
a<00:03:03.270> pretty<00:03:03.450> bad<00:03:03.690> job<00:03:03.900> for<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.320> back<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:04.830> I

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
a pretty bad job for the back but I

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.320 
a pretty bad job for the back but I
wasn't<00:03:05.340> going<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.610> give<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:05.820> out<00:03:06.000> anyway<00:03:06.300> so

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
wasn't going to give this out anyway so

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.710 
wasn't going to give this out anyway so
I<00:03:06.750> mean<00:03:06.960> I<00:03:07.080> guess<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:07.470> fine<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:09.060> make<00:03:09.090> anger

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
I mean I guess it's fine to make anger

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.120 
I mean I guess it's fine to make anger
all<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.170> need<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.620> two<00:03:11.280> pieces<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.910> square<00:03:13.130> now

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
all you need is two pieces of square now

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.670 
all you need is two pieces of square now
I<00:03:14.160> also<00:03:14.520> added<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.090> details<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.720> his<00:03:15.990> eyes<00:03:16.320> and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:28.220 
I also added the details of his eyes and
his<00:03:17.520> lips<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.270> well

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.290 

I'm<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:29.040> going<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.280> attach<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.879> two<00:03:30.060> pieces

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
I'm just going to attach the two pieces

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.020 
I'm just going to attach the two pieces
together<00:03:30.629> but<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.200> left<00:03:31.530> one<00:03:31.800> side<00:03:32.040> open<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:33.000> I

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
together but I left one side open so I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.300 
together but I left one side open so I
can<00:03:33.120> flip<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.569> inside<00:03:34.140> out<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:34.530> then<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.069> can

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
can flip this inside out and then I can

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.350 
can flip this inside out and then I can
stop<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.790> later<00:03:36.000> with<00:03:36.450> stuffing<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:38.360> flute

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
stop it later with stuffing I flute

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.970 
stop it later with stuffing I flute
everything<00:03:39.750> together<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.650> basic

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
everything together and this is basic

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.100 
everything together and this is basic
complete<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.909> make<00:03:41.940> sadness<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.659> very<00:03:42.870> similar

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
complete to make sadness is very similar

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.360 
complete to make sadness is very similar
to<00:03:43.440> joy<00:03:43.769> you'll<00:03:44.310> need<00:03:44.519> two<00:03:44.700> pieces<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.120> oval

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.699 

add<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:51.090> little<00:03:51.269> details<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:52.019> her<00:03:52.230> glasses

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
her eyes and her lips for her eyes I

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.559 
her eyes and her lips for her eyes I
just<00:03:55.170> chose<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.799> darker<00:03:56.220> shade<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.519> blue

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.940 

so<00:04:00.569> after<00:04:00.900> gluing<00:04:01.200> all<00:04:01.379> her<00:04:01.500> features

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
so after gluing all her features

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.369 
so after gluing all her features
together<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.640> took<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.269> other<00:04:03.420> piece<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:04.049> felt

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
together I took the other piece of felt

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.009 
together I took the other piece of felt
and<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:05.069> again<00:04:05.670> glued<00:04:06.060> them<00:04:06.269> together<00:04:06.480> after

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
and I again glued them together after

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.770 
and I again glued them together after
flipping<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.890> inside<00:04:08.250> out<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.609> just<00:04:09.180> went<00:04:09.690> ahead

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
flipping it inside out I just went ahead

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.360 
flipping it inside out I just went ahead
and<00:04:10.170> again<00:04:10.709> stuffed<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:12.230> her<00:04:13.230> hair<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.709> added<00:04:14.280> a

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
and again stuffed it her hair I added a

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.520 
and again stuffed it her hair I added a
strip<00:04:14.790> of<00:04:14.970> blue<00:04:15.299> first<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.989> didn't<00:04:16.229> really<00:04:16.289> like

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
strip of blue first I didn't really like

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.890 
strip of blue first I didn't really like
how<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.889> went<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.489> add<00:04:17.639> another<00:04:18.150> piece<00:04:18.660> of

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
how it went so I add another piece of

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.009 
how it went so I add another piece of
felt<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:20.039> was<00:04:20.430> parting<00:04:21.090> on<00:04:21.269> her<00:04:21.690> right<00:04:21.989> side

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
felt that was parting on her right side

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.920 
felt that was parting on her right side
she<00:04:22.800> has<00:04:23.010> pretty<00:04:23.280> straight<00:04:23.820> hair<00:04:24.090> so<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.479> just

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
she has pretty straight hair so I just

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.689 
she has pretty straight hair so I just
gave<00:04:25.110> her<00:04:25.229> pretty<00:04:25.650> much<00:04:25.710> straight<00:04:26.280> hair<00:04:26.490> I

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
gave her pretty much straight hair I

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.790 
gave her pretty much straight hair I
took<00:04:27.180> two<00:04:27.330> pieces<00:04:27.539> and<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.110> just<00:04:28.380> glued<00:04:28.620> them

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800
