00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
Pie if you could let pink because I

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
Pie if you could let pink because I
don't<00:06:12.290> know<00:06:12.380> it<00:06:12.560> wasn't<00:06:12.710> a<00:06:12.890> color<00:06:13.130> or

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
don't know it wasn't a color or

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.890 
don't know it wasn't a color or
something<00:06:13.520> then<00:06:14.240> what<00:06:14.510> would<00:06:14.630> be<00:06:14.660> your

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
something then what would be your

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.140 
something then what would be your
favorite<00:06:15.290> color<00:06:15.500> done<00:06:15.740> by<00:06:16.370> the<00:06:16.430> way<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.820> like

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
favorite color done by the way I like

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.780 
favorite color done by the way I like
pink<00:06:17.390> and<00:06:17.630> it<00:06:17.840> would<00:06:17.930> be<00:06:18.050> hard<00:06:18.230> to<00:06:18.350> decide<00:06:18.680> um<00:06:19.220> I

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
pink and it would be hard to decide um I

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.050 
pink and it would be hard to decide um I
guess<00:06:20.210> my<00:06:20.240> favorite<00:06:20.840> color<00:06:21.050> would<00:06:21.230> be<00:06:21.350> blue

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
guess my favorite color would be blue

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.010 
guess my favorite color would be blue
because<00:06:23.060> that's<00:06:23.210> my<00:06:23.360> eye<00:06:23.390> color

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020

um but should I be more concerned in

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.540 
um but should I be more concerned in
