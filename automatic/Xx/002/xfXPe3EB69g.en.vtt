00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.259
 the one that waves another Saturday here with you 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.450
 this is really wrong there and I hope that 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.269
 they are super super super good and today in 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.889
 this video I bring you some like 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.739
 first impression of the rooms 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.840
 productive the first one is going to be the 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:21.420
 makeup 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.520
 infallible mate de l'orÃ©al paris la 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.340
 truth is recommended and ximo because 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.000
 really be really if it's mate and you 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.279
 leaves everything if the skin is smooth and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 I feel you do not need like the powder 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.880
 and so it's not nothing more than his villain 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.760
 iii but if you are a pro but your 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.910
 against is that good to me I do not know if 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.489
 some is that they already use it, you have 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.670
 to be putting it on you like how to put 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.190
 your 33 points here and start doing it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.570
 here after three dots here but if 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.690
 you do it like that if you put them on 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.360
 all in the face and you go through this part in 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.280
 this part of acs like then when 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.369
 you try to do this it's already like 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.740
 there is the yellow spot or so I do not know I do not 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.509
 like to think is how to apply it and everything 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.759
 that really works super super 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.340
 well and the duration is really anime 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.430
 it lasts all day and apart you look 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.400
 how it lives and crime truth is how 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.680
 and so your skin leaves you interested 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.950
 pretty 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.590
 good and the second product is this 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.530
 lipstick that is called 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:36.909
 then the s from the mate book 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:40.360
 the truth I do not know I do not know what you say but no 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.400
 I know if that 's the color and I'm 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.700
 I bring you now impossible, you seem like a 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.090
 barbie here and I really love me 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.610
 love the pigmentation everything as well as 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.270
 hard and all that I love I love me 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.520
 love and well recommended and there is a 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.180
 little expensive, there are some costs 66 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.890
 Weights, but well, yes, for what 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.080
 is and all that is what lasts all that to 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.320
 me the truth I loved it 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.080
 and then finally this make-up remover 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.030
 for that reason and for eyes what it does is that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.430
 because when you put on makeup you put on 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.520
 Then they put it on and three marias super 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.920
 super fast and at the same time if you leave it and 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.660
 what it does is like for them to grow 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.970
 then your eyelashes can only happen 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.200
 then at bedtime and then in the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.970
 similarity of what you leave there in the eyes 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.400
 all night and it really has 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.890
 worked already I'm running out and in 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.220
 true or in a paper do you 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.950
 just like that and with that it helps you 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.920
 both eyes then if it has lasted me already 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.510
 about four months and then this was 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.260
