maybe<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.570> should<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.780> bled<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.049> earlier

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
maybe we should have bled it earlier

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.510 
maybe we should have bled it earlier
further<00:01:42.290> I'm<00:01:43.290> likely<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.159> would<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.430> got

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
further I'm likely they would have got

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.030 
further I'm likely they would have got
past<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.149> had<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.299> choice<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
past if you had the choice of the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.440 
past if you had the choice of the
pathing<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> we<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.700> play<00:01:50.880> all<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.119> think

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
pathing it so we just play all I think

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.410 
pathing it so we just play all I think
creatures<00:01:51.930> because<00:01:52.140> he's<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.409> seven<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.420> it's

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
creatures because he's on seven and it's

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.789 
creatures because he's on seven and it's
worth<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> risk<00:01:54.720> really<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> mean<00:01:55.470> he<00:01:55.649> might

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
worth the risk really I mean he might

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.100 
worth the risk really I mean he might
have<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.280> sweeper<00:01:57.119> which<00:01:57.329> would<00:01:57.630> leave<00:01:57.810> his<00:01:57.960> in

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
have a sweeper which would leave his in

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.340 
have a sweeper which would leave his in
a<00:01:58.170> bad<00:01:58.320> position<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:59.070> he's<00:01:59.960> dead<00:02:00.960> next<00:02:01.200> turn

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
a bad position but he's dead next turn

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.160 
a bad position but he's dead next turn
to<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.280> I'm<00:02:03.180> keeping<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:03.659> squadron<00:02:03.930> hawk

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
