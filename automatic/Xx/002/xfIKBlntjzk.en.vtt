where<00:03:32.840> i<00:03:32.900> get<00:03:33.110> into<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.380> lesson<00:03:33.770> and<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.010> just

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
where i get into the lesson and I just

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.680 
where i get into the lesson and I just
feel<00:03:34.340> like<00:03:34.370> doing<00:03:34.730> work<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.120> I<00:03:35.150> just<00:03:35.330> drill

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
feel like doing work and I just drill

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.090 
feel like doing work and I just drill
through<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:35.990> work<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.290> know<00:03:36.410> 20<00:03:36.830> minutes

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
through the work you know 20 minutes

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.260 
through the work you know 20 minutes
I've<00:03:37.220> done<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.490> work<00:03:37.640> for<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.880> whole<00:03:38.000> lesson

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
I've done the work for the whole lesson

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.480 
I've done the work for the whole lesson
and<00:03:38.630> then<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:39.290> kind<00:03:39.530> of<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.710> can<00:03:39.890> get<00:03:40.040> away<00:03:40.160> with

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
and then I kind of I can get away with

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.040 
and then I kind of I can get away with
not<00:03:40.640> doing<00:03:40.700> anything<00:03:41.120> whereas<00:03:41.690> if<00:03:41.720> I've<00:03:41.930> not

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
not doing anything whereas if I've not

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.540 
not doing anything whereas if I've not
done<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.290> work<00:03:42.410> first<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.890> obviously<00:03:43.280> I

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
done the work first and obviously I

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.060 
done the work first and obviously I
can't<00:03:44.540> get<00:03:44.660> away<00:03:44.750> with<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.020> but<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.620> often<00:03:45.800> find

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
can't get away with it but I often find

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.210 
can't get away with it but I often find
it<00:03:46.280> most<00:03:46.730> of<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.060> work<00:03:47.240> that<00:03:47.570> sets<00:03:48.020> and<00:03:48.980> stuff

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
it most of the work that sets and stuff

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.950 
it most of the work that sets and stuff
you<00:03:49.340> can<00:03:49.460> get<00:03:49.670> done<00:03:49.850> in<00:03:49.910> much<00:03:50.240> less<00:03:50.540> time<00:03:50.840> than

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
you can get done in much less time than

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.090 
you can get done in much less time than
you<00:03:51.080> actually<00:03:51.230> get<00:03:51.500> given<00:03:51.770> because<00:03:51.890> there's

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
you actually get given because there's

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.130 
you actually get given because there's
no<00:03:52.190> incentive<00:03:52.490> to<00:03:52.730> do<00:03:52.940> it<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.840> know<00:03:53.930> it's<00:03:54.080> like

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
no incentive to do it you know it's like

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.540 
no incentive to do it you know it's like
if<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.380> don't<00:03:54.560> do<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.800> work<00:03:54.980> oh<00:03:55.220> well<00:03:55.400> it's

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
if you don't do the work oh well it's

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.730 
if you don't do the work oh well it's
your<00:03:55.670> problem<00:03:55.880> kind<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.810> thing<00:03:57.020> but<00:03:57.470> as<00:03:57.590> I

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
your problem kind of thing but as I

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.870 
your problem kind of thing but as I
think<00:03:57.920> there<00:03:58.070> should<00:03:58.220> be<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.370> bit<00:03:58.730> more

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
think there should be a bit more

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.720 
think there should be a bit more
incentive<00:03:59.480> but<00:04:00.290> anyway<00:04:00.560> that's<00:04:00.680> just<00:04:00.920> my<00:04:01.100> two

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
incentive but anyway that's just my two

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.030 
incentive but anyway that's just my two
