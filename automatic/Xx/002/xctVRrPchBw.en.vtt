though I just like I said I don't I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.950 
though I just like I said I don't I
don't<00:00:42.480> think<00:00:42.690> I've<00:00:43.399> really<00:00:44.420> been<00:00:45.420> able<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.690> sit

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
don't think I've really been able to sit

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.770 
don't think I've really been able to sit
down<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> realize<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.539> exactly<00:00:48.539> what

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
down and realize just exactly what

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.119 
down and realize just exactly what
happened<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.079> me<00:00:49.200> last<00:00:49.289> night<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.800> mean<00:00:50.010> you

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
happened to me last night you mean you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.979 
happened to me last night you mean you
might<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.460> 50<00:00:50.760> miles<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> her<00:00:51.510> West<00:00:51.809> Palm

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
might be 50 miles out of her West Palm

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.689 
might be 50 miles out of her West Palm
Beach<00:00:52.079> before<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.649> finally<00:00:52.920> hits<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.399> think

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
Beach before it finally hits you I think

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.240 
Beach before it finally hits you I think
so<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.660> John<00:00:55.500> recently<00:00:56.039> graduated

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
so I think so John recently graduated

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.330 
so I think so John recently graduated
from<00:00:56.910> Florida<00:00:57.239> Atlantic<00:00:57.800> University<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:59.309> a

former United States Marine because

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.460 
former United States Marine because
exercise<00:01:05.729> physiology<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.630> such<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> new<00:01:07.110> field

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
exercise physiology is such a new field

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
exercise physiology is such a new field
you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.820> any<00:01:08.970> direction<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
you can really go in any direction you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.230 
you can really go in any direction you
want<00:01:09.780> health<00:01:10.200> related<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.060> haven't

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
want health related and I just haven't

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.000 
want health related and I just haven't
narrowed<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.750> down<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.830> would

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
narrowed it down so what I would

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.620 
narrowed it down so what I would
particularly<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:15.450> I'm

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
particularly like to do right now I'm

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.550 
particularly like to do right now I'm
working<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> human<00:01:16.439> performance

during the course of these experiments

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.359 
during the course of these experiments
and<00:01:20.790> tests<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.780> ever<00:01:21.900> think<00:01:22.259> I'm<00:01:23.100> sure<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and tests do you ever think I'm sure you

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.649 
and tests do you ever think I'm sure you
do<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.790> mean<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.240> there<00:01:24.360> anything<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
do it but I mean is there anything you

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.390 
do it but I mean is there anything you
can<00:01:24.840> use<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.530> terms<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.009> your<00:01:26.100> own<00:01:26.250> body

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
building some of the things that you're

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.069

and<00:01:33.329> steps<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.689> way<00:01:33.869> oh<00:01:34.079> yes<00:01:34.610> it's<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and steps this way oh yes it's just the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.289 
and steps this way oh yes it's just the
idea<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.659> how<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> burn<00:01:37.170> fat<00:01:37.700> long<00:01:38.700> duration

short<00:01:39.630> low<00:01:40.140> intensity<00:01:40.740> whereas<00:01:41.640> well<00:01:42.509> they

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
short low intensity whereas well they

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.240 
short low intensity whereas well they
see<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> time<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.439> gyms<00:01:43.710> where<00:01:43.950> people

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
see it all the time in gyms where people

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.859 
see it all the time in gyms where people
will<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> Stairmaster<00:01:44.909> they'll

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
will get on the Stairmaster they'll

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.780 
will get on the Stairmaster they'll
shoot<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> top<00:01:46.740> level<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.310> they'll

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
shoot it up to the top level and they'll

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.550 
shoot it up to the top level and they'll
go<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.180> 15<00:01:48.509> minutes<00:01:48.869> until<00:01:49.020> they're<00:01:49.290> pooped

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
go for 15 minutes until they're pooped

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.020 
go for 15 minutes until they're pooped
and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:49.860> they're<00:01:49.979> done<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.399> they<00:01:50.790> think

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and then they're done and they think

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.010 
and then they're done and they think
that<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.240> had<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> great<00:01:51.689> workout

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that they have had a great workout

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.450 
that they have had a great workout
because<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.470> calories<00:01:52.920> say<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.340> they've

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
calories all you're burning so if you go

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.880 
calories all you're burning so if you go
