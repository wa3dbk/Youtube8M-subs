comes<00:02:03.450> down<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> skill<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> player<00:02:04.350> so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
comes down to the skill of the player so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.050 
comes down to the skill of the player so
again<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> skilled<00:02:05.640> player<00:02:05.850> that's

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
again as a skilled player that's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.730 
again as a skilled player that's
something<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.479> absolutely<00:02:06.689> love<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.500> see

something that I absolutely love to see

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.010 
something that I absolutely love to see

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
shots in on a sniper and then they can

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.890 
shots in on a sniper and then they can
somehow<00:02:15.459> quickscope<00:02:16.090> me<00:02:16.239> through<00:02:16.450> all<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.629> it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
somehow quickscope me through all of it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.180 
somehow quickscope me through all of it
that's<00:02:17.080> one<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.440> most<00:02:17.560> annoying<00:02:17.800> things

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
that's one of the most annoying things

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.190 
that's one of the most annoying things
ever<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.760> now<00:02:18.849> on<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.599> quick<00:02:19.870> scoping

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
ever and now on to the quick scoping

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.630 
ever and now on to the quick scoping
topic<00:02:20.620> because<00:02:20.739> that's<00:02:20.980> another<00:02:21.310> one<00:02:21.610> that

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
topic because that's another one that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.580 
topic because that's another one that
was<00:02:21.879> discussed<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.540> one<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:22.989> actually

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
was discussed and one that is actually

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.619 
was discussed and one that is actually
making<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:24.069> large<00:02:24.489> amount<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.060> waves<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.569> the

making a large amount of waves in the

making a large amount of waves in the
community<00:02:25.989> Kandra<00:02:26.680> pretty<00:02:26.709> much<00:02:27.010> hinted<00:02:27.310> at

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
community Kandra pretty much hinted at

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.009 
community Kandra pretty much hinted at
that<00:02:27.489> quick<00:02:28.000> scoping<00:02:28.360> wouldn't<00:02:28.690> be<00:02:28.840> in

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
that quick scoping wouldn't be in

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.750 
that quick scoping wouldn't be in
advanced<00:02:29.440> warfare<00:02:29.800> now<00:02:30.040> how<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.400> going

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
advanced warfare now how is that going

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.339 
advanced warfare now how is that going
to<00:02:30.849> be<00:02:30.880> happening<00:02:31.390> if<00:02:31.599> there's<00:02:31.870> no<00:02:32.080> quick

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
to be happening if there's no quick

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.020 
to be happening if there's no quick
scoping<00:02:32.769> and<00:02:32.920> how<00:02:33.130> do<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.340> even<00:02:33.489> limit<00:02:33.880> that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
scoping and how do you even limit that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.240 
scoping and how do you even limit that
well<00:02:34.750> attachments<00:02:35.470> are<00:02:35.560> going<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.830> be<00:02:35.920> class

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
well attachments are going to be class

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.339 
well attachments are going to be class
specific<00:02:37.000> similar<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.510> what<00:02:37.660> previous<00:02:38.170> games

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
specific similar to what previous games

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.800 
specific similar to what previous games
tried<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.980> do<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.120> actually<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.569> all

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
tried to do this is actually going all

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.839 
tried to do this is actually going all
out<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.470> actually<00:02:41.650> limiting<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.430> lot<00:02:42.730> of

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
out and actually limiting a lot of

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.270 
out and actually limiting a lot of
classes<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:44.049> example<00:02:44.319> Kandra<00:02:44.830> Gabe<00:02:45.069> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
classes so the example Kandra Gabe and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.710 
classes so the example Kandra Gabe and
this<00:02:45.400> interview<00:02:45.610> was<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.060> assault<00:02:46.360> rifle

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
this interview was the assault rifle

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.210 
this interview was the assault rifle
saying<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.110> quick<00:02:47.319> draw<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.680> an<00:02:47.799> important

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
saying that quick draw is an important

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.670 
saying that quick draw is an important
part<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.549> that<00:02:49.030> gameplay<00:02:49.569> style<00:02:49.959> quick-draw

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
part of that gameplay style quick-draw

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.410 
part of that gameplay style quick-draw
is<00:02:50.739> going<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.950> be<00:02:51.040> able<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.579> placed<00:02:51.940> on<00:02:52.180> an

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
is going to be able to be placed on an

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.509 
is going to be able to be placed on an
assault<00:02:52.750> rifle<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.590> won't<00:02:53.890> be<00:02:53.980> there<00:02:54.310> and

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
assault rifle but it won't be there and

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.880 
assault rifle but it won't be there and
sniping<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.780> sniper<00:02:56.049> rifles<00:02:56.500> won't<00:02:56.769> be

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
sniping so the sniper rifles won't be

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.890 
sniping so the sniper rifles won't be
able<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.310> have<00:02:57.519> quick-draw<00:02:58.090> attached<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.780> them

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
able to have quick-draw attached to them

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.059 
able to have quick-draw attached to them
if<00:02:59.079> you're<00:02:59.170> doing<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.410> math<00:02:59.590> here<00:02:59.829> that

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
if you're doing the math here that

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.380 
if you're doing the math here that
increases<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.730> amount<00:03:00.819> of<00:03:00.970> time<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.209> it

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
increases the amount of time that it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.410 
increases the amount of time that it
takes<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.870> scope<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.440> which<00:03:03.069> essentially<00:03:03.849> will

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
takes to scope in which essentially will

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.569 
takes to scope in which essentially will
delete<00:03:04.780> quickscoping<00:03:05.470> from<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:05.950> play<00:03:06.130> styles

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
delete quickscoping from the play styles

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.670 
delete quickscoping from the play styles
now<00:03:06.849> from<00:03:07.180> watching<00:03:07.599> gameplay<00:03:08.019> firsthand<00:03:08.410> and

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
now from watching gameplay firsthand and

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.050 
now from watching gameplay firsthand and
having<00:03:08.950> people<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.370> played<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.790> sell

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
having people that have played it sell

having people that have played it sell
me<00:03:10.209> this<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.599> wouldn't<00:03:11.200> get<00:03:11.319> too<00:03:11.380> worried

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
me this I wouldn't get too worried

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.830 
me this I wouldn't get too worried
because<00:03:12.040> quickscoping<00:03:12.880> still<00:03:13.180> seems<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.690> be<00:03:13.810> a

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840

because quickscoping still seems to be a
thing<00:03:14.260> might<00:03:14.950> be<00:03:15.130> a<00:03:15.160> little<00:03:15.310> bit<00:03:15.489> harder<00:03:15.819> it's

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
thing might be a little bit harder it's

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.330 
thing might be a little bit harder it's
probably<00:03:16.480> gonna<00:03:16.599> be<00:03:16.690> in<00:03:16.870> between<00:03:17.019> say<00:03:17.680> black

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
probably gonna be in between say black

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.509 
probably gonna be in between say black
ops<00:03:18.639> 2<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.180> black<00:03:19.630> ops<00:03:19.959> 1<00:03:20.109> where<00:03:20.980> black<00:03:21.190> ops<00:03:21.430> 1

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
ops 2 and black ops 1 where black ops 1

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.460 
ops 2 and black ops 1 where black ops 1
it<00:03:21.880> was<00:03:21.970> almost<00:03:22.269> impossible<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:23.290> get<00:03:23.410> a

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
it was almost impossible to get a

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.979 
it was almost impossible to get a
legitimate<00:03:24.250> quickscope<00:03:24.730> off<00:03:25.000> then<00:03:25.540> black<00:03:25.780> ops

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
legitimate quickscope off then black ops

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.569 
legitimate quickscope off then black ops
2<00:03:26.200> depending<00:03:26.440> on<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.709> weapon<00:03:26.859> and<00:03:27.100> attachment

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
2 depending on the weapon and attachment

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.309 
2 depending on the weapon and attachment
you<00:03:27.639> can<00:03:27.670> get<00:03:27.940> some<00:03:28.150> really<00:03:28.480> quick<00:03:28.810> stuff<00:03:29.109> off

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
you can get some really quick stuff off

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.349 
you can get some really quick stuff off
so<00:03:29.889> my<00:03:30.100> guess<00:03:30.160> is<00:03:30.340> it's<00:03:30.459> going<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.819> be<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> little

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
so my guess is it's going to be a little

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.120 
so my guess is it's going to be a little
bit<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.660> between<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.590> that's<00:03:32.859> a<00:03:32.980> nice

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
bit in between that and that's a nice

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.860 
bit in between that and that's a nice
balance<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.639> my<00:03:33.670> opinion<00:03:34.090> because<00:03:34.329> black<00:03:34.630> ops

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
balance in my opinion because black ops

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.840 
balance in my opinion because black ops
1<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.440> was<00:03:35.560> almost<00:03:35.680> impossible<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.370> extremely

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
1 it was almost impossible is extremely

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.420 
1 it was almost impossible is extremely
hard<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.720> quickscope<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.410> then<00:03:38.769> black<00:03:38.980> ops<00:03:39.250> 2

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
hard to quickscope and then black ops 2

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.910 
hard to quickscope and then black ops 2
is<00:03:39.579> pretty<00:03:40.120> easy<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:41.049> think<00:03:41.620> it's<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.769> nice

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
is pretty easy so I think it's a nice

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.470 
is pretty easy so I think it's a nice
balance<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.760> like<00:03:42.970> what<00:03:43.150> they're<00:03:43.299> going

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
balance and I like what they're going

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.780 
balance and I like what they're going
for<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:43.930> terms<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.440> actual<00:03:44.680> weapon<00:03:45.370> balance

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
for in terms of actual weapon balance

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.360 
for in terms of actual weapon balance
overall<00:03:46.389> giving<00:03:47.079> everybody<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.739> fair<00:03:48.069> chance

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
overall giving everybody a fair chance

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.099 
overall giving everybody a fair chance
and<00:03:48.639> leaving<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.000> up<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.329> skill<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:49.900> that's

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
and leaving it up to skill so that's

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.449 
and leaving it up to skill so that's
