00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello connected friends welcome to a 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.500
 new video here to your mayor channel in 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.900
 this occasion we are going to do afterwards and 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.230
 tutorial about minecraft sometimes 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.529
 we spend hours looking for some 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.080
 specific language in our world already 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.259
 be that we create a trap of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.289
 witches or anything 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.810
 we want to do in a specific biome 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.420
 and we can not find it and we are encouraged 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.400
 looking for it and we go around and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.550
 round and round and never we 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.710
 we found for that there is a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.710
 solution there is a program called 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.050
 this program that you can 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.940
 find this link that is 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.809
 leaving not doing that is looking 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.500
 a 23 chinese wallpaper in this minecraft 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.829
 forum punto net which is a page that already 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.009
 we all know where we download 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.100
 resources for us to improve in 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.950
 our fried minecraft 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:18.009
 all the issues of the video game 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:22.310
 is an exe point is for windows 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.470
 is for mac and this for linux 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.750
 this time, I am you 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.070
 using windows so just 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.009
 we execute the program and we 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:38.840
 Automatically we Czech vehicles 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.409
 the folder where from the folder 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.939
 profiles where we have our profiles 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:49.710
 our what I am using 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:52.710
 the 1.7 point 5 because yes 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.140
 then we go to files in new us 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.240
 we go to fran fine art for years that in 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.280
 this case we can look for the funds that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.509
 we have installed in our our 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.240
 point dot micros or we can put 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.190
 some specific seed in this 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.500
 case I will enter the world of vih of 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.690
 just open and we see that it starts 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.080
 fully signed absolutely signed 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.610
 showing us the location of for example 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.840
 villas tickets villas perdÃ³n les 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.560
 pound point where we left the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.600
 strong 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.360
 do not 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.640
 for all the villas the villas in this 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.380
 case for example I want to look for a 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.920
 witch trap 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.200
 we see that there are tell us which and they give us 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:47.100
 the coordinate in this case is in the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.100
 coordinate minus four thousand 864 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.090
 and at 2.304 there 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.400
 Well, we only have to walk and 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.459
 walk the walk until you find him 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.010
 until you find now that in the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.860
 exact location but as I am 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.600
 on a server where I have 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.150
 this 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:22.260
 in the power of administration we said 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:26.860
 that was 4,864 I put 70 in a 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:30.480
 coordinate and simply because that's how I 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:36.690
 it is requested by the system and in the coordinate 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.690
 2.304 we give pp and we hope to fall here 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.610
 and Carlos, well, we are exactly in the 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.180
 that would be in the witch trap 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.180
 but what 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.540
 maybe like minecraft 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.760
 we are already in the witch's rag and there 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.180
 she is a wretch waiting for us 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.180
 kill me 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.570
 so there's nothing left but to come 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.570
 to be your witch trap 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.730
 lightest of people 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.580
 leave me is 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.580
 my arrows fixed 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.949
 and show Wedding syndrome 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.500
 a heart but that quick and easy 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:37.719
 simple we find our our 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.469
 exact locations in our world of 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:44.590
 minecraft this works with the 1.7 point 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:49.960
 9 the most current me because I'm in 1 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:53.919
 point 7.5 since the server this me what 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.870
 demand will be at 1.7 point 5 but so 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.350
 easy to find us 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.129
 exact coordinates of some more good 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.219
 or entity 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.409
 specifically so nothing possible and the 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:09.839
 video was useful so leave me a 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:12.449
 light share it with your friends 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:14.129
