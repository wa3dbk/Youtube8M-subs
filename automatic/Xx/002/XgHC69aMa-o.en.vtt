00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.300
 hello, sometimes you ask yourself which one 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.039
 meaning in the experiences of your life 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.869
 I wonder, especially then 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.650
 if it does not work out again 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.529
 I wish that to see that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.960
 Moments where I ask myself what is this for 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 to be good 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 For example, the other day I breathed 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.700
 seminar planned at the one 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.600
 difficulty after another 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.160
 I turned up and asked 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.440
 what does life want to tell me? 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.950
 the whole thing ended with me doing that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.200
 Just had to cancel the seminar 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.969
 a few days later an invitation 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.100
 to be able to accept such a big one 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.309
 Congress in which I give a lecture 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.260
 will hold 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.010
 life is constantly confronting us 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.549
 with adversities like in my example 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.510
 but also with bigger annoyances or 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.420
 hurt the deep wounds 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.049
 leave his traumatic 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.450
 experiences in childhood or 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.880
 annoyances with our partner the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.729
 chance us in such moments as victims 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.299
 Of course, feeling great is great 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.250
 At the same time there is the need 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.210
 being able to deal with it differently 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.909
 own life as joyful and 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.950
 to experience successfully take it now 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.630
 Please take a moment and remember 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.780
 a really painful one 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.820
 event an experience for you 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.329
 rather avoided at that time 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.329
 had 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.359
 and if you look at it from now on 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.340
 Looking back, it may be that you 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.109
 determine 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.210
 that's what she ultimately served 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.579
 event 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.489
 it made me stronger it has her 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:13.989
 new paths shown or another 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.400
 positive experiences of this kind causes 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.230
 the possibility you have that yes 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.390
 It can be very big and big 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.430
 that's the most people so as 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.880
 in hindsight, on our own 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.890
 then we can see it 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.140
 served us in one or 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.250
 other wise 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.310
 It's for a reason 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.900
 done 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.810
 this basic assumption attacks the tapping 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.870
 method and thus goes one step 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.900
 but a very radical one 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.530
 step because we say everything in 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.450
 Everything happens to us in our lives 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.709
 What happens in our life happens 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.709
 for a reason 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.060
 how would it be assumed that everything 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.510
 what happens in his life makes sense 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.510
 makes 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.690
 It takes courage and openness 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.200
 to argue with this thought 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.510
 befriend 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.710
 but luckily you do not have to 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.310
 believe that just try it 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.570
 and apply a worksheet or the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.510
 cd to use 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.960
 is completely enough and it is real 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.780
 amazing what effect then possible 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.420
 is if we let ours on the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.840
 Sign of life to respect ours 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.430
 inner voice belongs to give and 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.370
 our lives from a new perspective 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.260
 consider 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.530
 then our life always unfolds 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.820
 more in accordance with what 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.890
 our soul is for this life 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.750
 and if we have the 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.020
 willingness to apply also in 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.990
 painful experiences a chance too 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.980
 growth and healing is then seen 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.900
 a fundamental change possible 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.690
 We see life as a way of life 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.480
 we consciously go and shape ours 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.720
 live intentionally and in harmony with 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.590
 our innermost I wish you much 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.590
 enjoy it
