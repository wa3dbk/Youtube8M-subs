00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.579
 3 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.610
 and these good kids are imosi and 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.590
 today I hope to teach to make a trap 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.450
 for zombies 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.770
 you only need us a villager is worth 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.869
 you do not know how to get them in 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.449
 survival simply put a 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.220
 villager dragged towards the 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.279
 trolley and you could move it towards 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.890
 where would you like the first thing you're going to 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.509
 choose a site I for example I'm going to 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.760
 put the villager here 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.850
 and so that it does not escape I'm going to put 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.020
 here this well a quartz slabs 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.140
 you can put whatever you want 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.350
 I'm going to put the villager here and now 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.920
 simply around this villager 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.410
 we have to count two blocks 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.460
 of on each side and break these two 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.989
 blocks 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.989
 there would be a thing like that 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.730
 and now I am in survival 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.340
 you can download everything you want to 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.520
 kill them and put put hoppers since the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.590
 1.2 s will be able to trade with meat from 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:19.280
 zombie I good now as I'm not going to 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:23.220
 kill I'm just going to remove all this 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.570
 also the rock time to fall 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.659
 so I remove this here 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.670
 and the only thing that would be left is to put 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.920
 trap doors 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.070
 on all sides of this square that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.729
 we have done 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.490
 in those on these sides of the cube in the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.600
 that the villager is also there 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.330
 put trapdoors so it would fill 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.770
 all this here of trapdoors and then 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.860
 the only thing that would be would be to lower them like this 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.350
 the zombie will think that where is the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.020
 trapdoor there is a block go for the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.690
 villager and it will fall this I think it's going to 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.100
 be quite useful in 1.8 since as 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.910
 I said before it's going to be able to trade 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.840
 with the rotten meat then now 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.840
 we went down all this 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.010
 and look what happens if I put a lot 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.069
 zombies I'm going to put 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.390
 so you can see 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.110
 and as you see they go for the villager 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.900
 look at the joker 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.230
 it's worth as you are seeing they are going towards the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.320
 villager and they usually fall there are some that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.140
 they do not fall but well we 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.630
 we help and you're alone in caisse all 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.470
 as you are already seeing 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.940
 so this has been all for today I hope 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.180
 that you liked and until the next 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.180
 video
