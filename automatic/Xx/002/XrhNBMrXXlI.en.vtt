00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
okay this is a frequently asked question

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.010 
okay this is a frequently asked question
I<00:00:04.170> get<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.920> lot<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.370> questions<00:00:05.549> about<00:00:06.480> how<00:00:06.990> to

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
I get a lot of questions about how to

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.919 
I get a lot of questions about how to
make<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.710> natural<00:00:08.280> trumpet<00:00:09.000> out<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.210> PVC<00:00:09.360> for

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
make a natural trumpet out of PVC for

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.020 
make a natural trumpet out of PVC for
demonstrations<00:00:10.590> like<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.250> two<00:00:11.429> video<00:00:11.730> clips

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
demonstrations like the two video clips

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.799 
demonstrations like the two video clips
and<00:00:12.210> my<00:00:12.660> youtube<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.290> my<00:00:14.240> Nick<00:00:15.240> draws<00:00:15.450> up<00:00:15.660> that

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
and my youtube and my Nick draws up that

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.439 
and my youtube and my Nick draws up that
calm<00:00:16.049> site<00:00:16.550> for<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.609> physics<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.000> rats<00:00:18.240> ants

calm site for the physics of rats ants
where<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.660> do<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.810> demonstration<00:00:19.080> using<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.859> PVC

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
where I do a demonstration using a PVC

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.509 
where I do a demonstration using a PVC
natural<00:00:21.300> trumpet<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.769> little<00:00:22.980> clip

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
natural trumpet so in this little clip

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.060 
natural trumpet so in this little clip
I'm<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> measure<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.439> Tang<00:00:25.650> and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
I'm just going to measure the Tang and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.410 
I'm just going to measure the Tang and
show<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.340> how<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.519> put<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.760> together<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.240> think

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
show you how to put it together I think

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.259 
show you how to put it together I think
that's<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.869> easiest<00:00:27.900> way<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.269> if

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
that's the easiest way to do it and if

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.609 
that's the easiest way to do it and if
you<00:00:30.390> don't<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> measurements<00:00:31.500> right

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
you don't get the measurements right

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.010 
you don't get the measurements right
away<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.830> fast<00:00:32.759> forward<00:00:33.149> rewind<00:00:33.300> whatever

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
away just fast forward rewind whatever

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.240 
away just fast forward rewind whatever
just<00:00:34.350> keep<00:00:34.469> listening<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.100> write<00:00:35.219> it

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
just keep listening to it and write it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.340 
just keep listening to it and write it
all<00:00:35.430> down<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:36.210> fairly<00:00:36.390> simple<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.230> you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
all down it's fairly simple and if you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.450 
all down it's fairly simple and if you
see<00:00:37.530> how<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.010> me<00:00:38.129> put<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.370> together

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
see how if you see me put it together

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.930 
see how if you see me put it together
this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.329> not<00:00:39.510> hard<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.809> make<00:00:39.960> okay<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.760> is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
this is not hard to make okay so this is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.020 
this is not hard to make okay so this is
how<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> make<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.660> PVC<00:00:43.340> natural<00:00:44.340> trumpet<00:00:44.820> I

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
how to make a PVC natural trumpet I

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.470 
how to make a PVC natural trumpet I
based<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.079> structure<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.270> replica<00:00:48.270> this

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
based the structure on this replica this

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.660 
based the structure on this replica this
is<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.780> natural<00:00:49.500> sea<00:00:49.680> trumpet<00:00:50.129> supposed<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
is this natural sea trumpet supposed to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.010 
is this natural sea trumpet supposed to
represent<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.300> an<00:00:51.840> old<00:00:52.140> baroque<00:00:52.530> sea<00:00:53.010> trumpet

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
represent a an old baroque sea trumpet

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.450 
represent a an old baroque sea trumpet
and<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> fairly<00:00:55.620> inexpensive<00:00:55.770> thing

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and this is a fairly inexpensive thing

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
and this is a fairly inexpensive thing
it's<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.539> Myna<00:00:58.500> landlubber<00:00:59.480> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
it's just it's a Myna landlubber and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's just it's a Myna landlubber and
it's<00:01:00.660> an<00:01:00.750> Edward<00:01:01.050> tire<00:01:01.320> model<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> sea

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it's an Edward tire model but it's a sea

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.700 
it's an Edward tire model but it's a sea
sea<00:01:03.120> trumpet<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> took<00:01:04.019> some<00:01:04.290> measurements

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
sea trumpet so I took some measurements

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.630 
sea trumpet so I took some measurements
off<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.760> contrive<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.869> out<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> PVC

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
off of this to contrive one out of PVC

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.460 
off of this to contrive one out of PVC
okay<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.510> let<00:01:09.900> me<00:01:09.930> start<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.260> these<00:01:10.409> two

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
okay so let me start with these two

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.570 
okay so let me start with these two
tubing's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
tubing's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.300 
tubing's
tubes<00:01:12.390> right<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.799> half<00:01:14.040> inch

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
tubes right here this is one half inch

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.120 
tubes right here this is one half inch
inner<00:01:14.549> diameter<00:01:14.939> PVC<00:01:15.560> piping<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:16.920> any

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
inner diameter PVC piping by any

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.249 
inner diameter PVC piping by any
hardware<00:01:17.430> store<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> inner<00:01:18.509> diameter<00:01:18.810> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
hardware store but the inner diameter is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.899 
hardware store but the inner diameter is
a<00:01:19.320> half<00:01:19.560> inch<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> outer<00:01:20.250> gram<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
a half inch not the outer gram or the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.030 
a half inch not the outer gram or the
Internet<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.799> check<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.189> inside

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
Internet so if I just check this inside

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.890 
Internet so if I just check this inside
yep<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:27.170> half<00:01:28.170> an<00:01:28.350> inch<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:29.100> maybe<00:01:29.400> even

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
yep it's half an inch or maybe even

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.940 
yep it's half an inch or maybe even
that's<00:01:30.900> half<00:01:31.110> inch<00:01:31.290> inner<00:01:31.500> diameter<00:01:31.710> okay<00:01:33.950> one

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that's half inch inner diameter okay one

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.640 
that's half inch inner diameter okay one
length<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.310> pipe<00:01:35.460> oh<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:36.000> these<00:01:36.090> two<00:01:36.270> pipes

length of pipe oh I have these two pipes

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.130 
length of pipe oh I have these two pipes
duct-taped<00:01:37.650> together<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:39.240> inform<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> basic

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
duct-taped together to inform the basic

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.859 
duct-taped together to inform the basic
structure<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.619> horn<00:01:40.829> sort<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.579> this

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
structure of a horn sort of like this

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.030

about nine centimeters approximately all

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.550 
about nine centimeters approximately all
right<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.190> those<00:03:44.370> are<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.640> lengths<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:46.320> you

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
right so those are the lengths and you

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.580 
right so those are the lengths and you
can<00:03:46.710> force<00:03:47.600> rewind<00:03:48.600> fast-forward<00:03:49.140> whatever

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
can force rewind fast-forward whatever

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.930 
can force rewind fast-forward whatever
you<00:03:49.710> need<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:49.890> do<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.310> double-check<00:03:50.610> those

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
you need to do to double-check those

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.910 
you need to do to double-check those
numbers<00:03:51.360> if<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.140> go<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.320> write<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.740> down

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
numbers if you go to write this down

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.170 
numbers if you go to write this down
yourself<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.610> then<00:03:54.330> have<00:03:54.710> four<00:03:55.710> right<00:03:56.670> angle

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
yourself I then have four right angle

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.990 
yourself I then have four right angle
elbow<00:03:57.630> joints<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.950> are<00:03:59.130> made<00:03:59.430> for<00:03:59.610> one<00:03:59.790> half

inch<00:04:00.180> inner<00:04:00.450> diameter<00:04:00.660> PVC<00:04:01.020> and<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.250> stick

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
inch inner diameter PVC and I just stick

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.240 
inch inner diameter PVC and I just stick
them<00:04:02.640> on<00:04:02.820> either<00:04:03.030> side<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.920> short<00:04:05.610> tubes

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
them on either side of the short tubes

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.100 
them on either side of the short tubes
it<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.400> friction<00:04:08.640> fit<00:04:08.910> just<00:04:09.150> kind<00:04:09.330> of<00:04:09.360> squeeze

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
it is friction fit just kind of squeeze

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.449 
it is friction fit just kind of squeeze
them<00:04:10.290> on<00:04:10.380> there<00:04:10.590> they'll<00:04:10.739> hold<00:04:10.920> pretty<00:04:11.190> snug

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
them on there they'll hold pretty snug

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.729 
them on there they'll hold pretty snug
just<00:04:11.610> with<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.120> friction<00:04:12.900> between<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.200> PVC

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
just with the friction between the PVC

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.970 
just with the friction between the PVC
joints<00:04:14.390> then<00:04:15.390> what<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.570> do<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:16.109> stick<00:04:16.829> this

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
joints then what I do is I stick this

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:24.590 
joints then what I do is I stick this
stuff<00:04:17.600> under<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:20.239> bottom<00:04:21.239> tube<00:04:23.090> and<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.330> make<00:04:24.570> a

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
stuff under the bottom tube and I make a

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.430 
stuff under the bottom tube and I make a
trumpet<00:04:24.960> out<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.350> put<00:04:25.650> this<00:04:26.430> on<00:04:26.700> here<00:04:27.030> and

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
trumpet out of it put this on here and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.750 
trumpet out of it put this on here and
this<00:04:28.440> part<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.830> stick<00:04:29.190> on<00:04:29.340> this<00:04:29.490> end<00:04:31.760> squeeze

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
this part and stick on this end squeeze

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.940 
this part and stick on this end squeeze
it<00:04:32.880> all<00:04:33.000> together<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.870> they<00:04:34.200> have<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.470> basic

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
it all together and they have the basic

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.120 
it all together and they have the basic
tube<00:04:35.490> for<00:04:35.820> trumpet<00:04:36.290> now<00:04:37.290> it's<00:04:37.530> real<00:04:37.770> hard<00:04:37.979> to

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
tube for trumpet now it's real hard to

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.790 
tube for trumpet now it's real hard to
play<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.700> half<00:04:39.570> inch<00:04:39.780> tubing<00:04:40.169> like<00:04:40.229> that<00:04:40.620> on

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
play a half inch tubing like that on

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.610 
play a half inch tubing like that on
your<00:04:41.250> lips<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.360> bought<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.840> hose<00:04:43.080> fitting

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
your lips so I bought a hose fitting

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.740 
your lips so I bought a hose fitting
this<00:04:43.919> is<00:04:44.100> for<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.310> garden<00:04:44.669> hose<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.090> it's<00:04:45.630> got

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
this is for a garden hose and it's got

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.630 
this is for a garden hose and it's got
the<00:04:45.870> rubber<00:04:46.050> seal<00:04:46.620> or<00:04:46.800> grommet<00:04:47.160> on<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.370> inside

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
the rubber seal or grommet on the inside

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.700 
the rubber seal or grommet on the inside
of<00:04:47.669> it<00:04:47.820> left<00:04:48.120> there<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.540> I<00:04:49.140> just<00:04:49.380> take<00:04:49.530> this

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
of it left there and I just take this

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.310 
of it left there and I just take this
and<00:04:50.010> stick<00:04:50.700> that<00:04:50.880> onto<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.419> end<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.140> tube

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
and stick that onto the end of the tube

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:00.110 
and stick that onto the end of the tube
here<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.590> then<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:52.890> can<00:04:53.040> play<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:58.970> okay<00:04:59.970> of

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
here and then I can play it okay of

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.760 
here and then I can play it okay of
course<00:05:00.330> it's<00:05:00.510> squirrely<00:05:00.930> we'll<00:05:01.380> watch<00:05:01.560> the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
course it's squirrely we'll watch the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.500 
course it's squirrely we'll watch the
video<00:05:01.890> on<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.430> physics<00:05:02.760> of<00:05:02.820> trumpet<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.360> you

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
video on the physics of trumpet and you

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.300 
video on the physics of trumpet and you
can<00:05:03.660> see<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:04.020> how<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.560> actual<00:05:04.890> overtone

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
can see that how the actual overtone

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.230 
can see that how the actual overtone
series<00:05:05.520> works<00:05:06.290> by<00:05:07.290> leaving<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:08.090> grommet<00:05:09.090> in

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
series works by leaving the grommet in

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.300 
series works by leaving the grommet in
there<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:09.960> sealer<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.650> holds<00:05:11.040> on<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.250> a

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
there the sealer it holds on to a

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.700 
there the sealer it holds on to a
trumpet<00:05:11.640> mouthpiece<00:05:11.790> rather<00:05:12.450> nicely<00:05:12.780> I<00:05:13.200> can

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
trumpet mouthpiece rather nicely I can

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:21.749 
trumpet mouthpiece rather nicely I can
put<00:05:14.640> this<00:05:14.729> in<00:05:14.880> here

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.219 

and<00:05:22.759> of<00:05:22.819> course<00:05:23.029> the<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.270> overtones<00:05:23.900> work<00:05:24.110> a

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
and of course the the overtones work a

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.640 
and of course the the overtones work a
little<00:05:24.529> bit<00:05:24.620> better<00:05:24.830> I<00:05:26.139> can<00:05:27.139> make<00:05:27.319> a<00:05:27.349> bell

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
little bit better I can make a bell

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:47.799 
little bit better I can make a bell
let's<00:05:28.009> take<00:05:28.219> a<00:05:28.249> bell<00:05:28.460> on<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.699> end<00:05:28.849> of<00:05:28.939> it<00:05:46.779> okay

so again go watch the video on how the

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.510 
so again go watch the video on how the
trumpets<00:05:51.469> work<00:05:51.650> out<00:05:51.860> I<00:05:52.039> do<00:05:52.159> the<00:05:52.249> full

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439 
demonstration but this is how you make

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:56.589 
demonstration but this is how you make
it<00:05:54.589> and<00:05:54.800> it's<00:05:54.949> a<00:05:55.069> fairly<00:05:55.339> workable<00:05:55.909> natural
