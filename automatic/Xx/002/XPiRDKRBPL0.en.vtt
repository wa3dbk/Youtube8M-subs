to do is put a block right above this
torch<00:02:44.100> I'm<00:02:45.090> going<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.300> come<00:02:45.420> out<00:02:45.570> three<00:02:45.870> blocks

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
torch I'm going to come out three blocks

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.900 
torch I'm going to come out three blocks

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
make sure you put that block above that

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.720 
make sure you put that block above that
torch<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.590> then<00:02:49.920> put<00:02:50.070> three<00:02:50.280> redstone<00:02:50.610> dust

to<00:02:54.150> come<00:02:54.300> down<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.510> block<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.050> then<00:02:55.230> up<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.500> block

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
to come down a block and then up a block

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.050 
to come down a block and then up a block
like<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.130> put<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> redstone<00:02:56.460> dust<00:02:56.700> here

just put two sticky pistons like this
and<00:03:01.860> then<00:03:02.370> two<00:03:02.550> blocks<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.180> front<00:03:03.240> of<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.960> like

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
and then two blocks in front of it like

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.840 
and then two blocks in front of it like
so<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.410> that's<00:03:04.710> it<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.980> are<00:03:05.010> completely<00:03:05.700> done

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
so and that's it you are completely done

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.880 
so and that's it you are completely done
so<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.330> throw<00:03:06.660> an<00:03:06.750> item<00:03:06.930> into<00:03:07.350> my<00:03:07.500> champion

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
so I throw an item into my champion

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.300 
so I throw an item into my champion
table<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:09.750> opens<00:03:10.050> up<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.470> then<00:03:10.680> obviously<00:03:10.890> we

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
table it opens up and then obviously we

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.380 
table it opens up and then obviously we
fall<00:03:11.550> down<00:03:11.580> right<00:03:11.880> here<00:03:11.970> we<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.210> put<00:03:12.300> another

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
fall down right here we can put another

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.880 
fall down right here we can put another
block<00:03:12.690> right<00:03:12.900> here<00:03:12.960> as<00:03:13.260> another<00:03:13.530> stepping

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
block right here as another stepping

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.170 
block right here as another stepping
stone<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.400> we're<00:03:14.550> going<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.700> come<00:03:14.850> down<00:03:14.880> here

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
stone so we're going to come down here

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.570 
stone so we're going to come down here
go<00:03:15.330> pop<00:03:15.570> pop<00:03:15.870> pop<00:03:16.500> down<00:03:16.740> into<00:03:16.920> our<00:03:16.950> secret<00:03:17.220> area

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
go pop pop pop down into our secret area

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.250 
go pop pop pop down into our secret area
and<00:03:17.760> then<00:03:18.090> obviously<00:03:18.540> close<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.960> up<00:03:19.050> from

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
and then obviously close it up from

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.410 
and then obviously close it up from
behind<00:03:19.560> us<00:03:19.710> like<00:03:19.920> this<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:21.000> then<00:03:21.120> we've<00:03:21.240> come
