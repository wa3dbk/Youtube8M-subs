Perini<00:00:42.960> will<00:00:43.530> tell<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.300> it's<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.629> design<00:00:46.050> has

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
Perini will tell you it's the design has

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.590 
Perini will tell you it's the design has
to<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.710> pure<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.129> powerfully<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to be pure and powerfully you know that

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
to be pure and powerfully you know that
we<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.930> our<00:00:49.200> own<00:00:49.829> agenda<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:51.239> cars<00:00:52.199> always

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
we have our own agenda the cars always

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.049 
we have our own agenda the cars always
have<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.039> recognizable

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
have to be recognizable

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.750 
have to be recognizable
the<00:00:54.510> cars<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.860> idea<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.460> form

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the cars have to have the idea of form

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.849 
the cars have to have the idea of form
follows<00:00:57.090> function<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.440> our

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
follows function and we have our

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.069 
follows function and we have our
inspiration<00:00:59.640> which<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.969> coming<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
inspiration which is coming from the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.090 
inspiration which is coming from the
Aeronautics<00:01:02.010> industry<00:01:02.840> but<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.799> also

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
Aeronautics industry but here it's also

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.910 
Aeronautics industry but here it's also
part<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.510> design<00:01:06.900> language<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.770> will

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
part of the design language and you will

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.330 
part of the design language and you will
see<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> later<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.580> are<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.420> sharp<00:01:09.720> edges

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
see it later on are the sharp edges

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.429 
see it later on are the sharp edges
which<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.820> combination<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:13.049> only<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.939> a

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
which is a combination not only of a

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.890 
which is a combination not only of a
puristic<00:01:16.439> design<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.280> also<00:01:17.390> cutting<00:01:18.390> edge

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
puristic design but also cutting edge

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
puristic design but also cutting edge
technology<00:01:19.799> which<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.640> coming<00:01:20.880> from<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
technology which is coming from the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:02:11.790 
technology which is coming from the
aluminum
