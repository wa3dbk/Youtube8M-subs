00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.850 
have apps and a calendar and a picture
and<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:09.270> not<00:01:09.479> even<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.080> customize<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and it's not even just customize it so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
and it's not even just customize it so
much<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.159> which<00:01:11.460> there's<00:01:12.119> probably<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
much more which there's probably a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.080 
much more which there's probably a
million<00:01:12.869> other<00:01:13.200> good<00:01:13.500> reasons<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.610> galaxy

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
million other good reasons for a galaxy

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.490 
million other good reasons for a galaxy
rather<00:01:15.330> than<00:01:15.600> iPhone<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.320> just

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
rather than iPhone but that's just

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
rather than iPhone but that's just
what's<00:01:17.009> jumping<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.460> at<00:01:17.610> me<00:01:17.640> right<00:01:17.759> now<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
what's jumping out at me right now and I

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.780 
what's jumping out at me right now and I
did<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.840> an<00:01:18.960> iPhone<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> year<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.610> just

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
did have an iPhone for a year and I just

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.130 
did have an iPhone for a year and I just
love<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.150> galaxies<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.900> won't<00:01:22.020> go

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
love the galaxies and I just won't go

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.649 
love the galaxies and I just won't go
back<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.619> only<00:01:22.830> downfall<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.939> Apple

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
back the only downfall is is that Apple

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
back the only downfall is is that Apple
definitely<00:01:25.020> has<00:01:25.140> more<00:01:25.470> apps<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.009> better<00:01:26.490> apps

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
definitely has more apps and better apps

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.149 
definitely has more apps and better apps
that<00:01:27.540> Android<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:28.829> sucks<00:01:29.040> when

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that Android and it really sucks when

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.069 
that Android and it really sucks when
you<00:01:29.220> hear<00:01:29.460> about<00:01:29.520> an<00:01:29.700> app<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.630> can't

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480

and then the rest is kind of

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.650 
and then the rest is kind of
self-explanatory<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:12.060> reason<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.480> like

self-explanatory the reason that I like
galaxies<00:03:13.260> over<00:03:13.530> iPhones<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.610> because<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.750> can

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
galaxies over iPhones is because you can

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.410 
galaxies over iPhones is because you can
scroll<00:03:16.590> through<00:03:17.549> this<00:03:17.730> way<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.180> doesn't

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
scroll through this way and it doesn't

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.410 
scroll through this way and it doesn't
need<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.170> eat<00:03:19.350> just<00:03:19.890> apps<00:03:20.220> like<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.239> one<00:03:21.390> I

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
need to eat just apps like this one I

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.600 
need to eat just apps like this one I
personally<00:03:21.840> set<00:03:22.320> up<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.560> put<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
personally set up I put it so that the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.009 
personally set up I put it so that the
time<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.970> there<00:03:24.090> but<00:03:24.480> mostly<00:03:24.720> because<00:03:24.840> they

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
time is there but mostly because they

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.180 
time is there but mostly because they
weren't<00:03:25.230> at<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.380> weather<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.920> was<00:03:26.010> just

Android

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.150 
Android
I<00:05:30.389> think<00:05:30.810> Android<00:05:31.169> at<00:05:31.470> least<00:05:31.680> comes<00:05:31.860> with<00:05:31.979> all

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
I think Android at least comes with all

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.520 
I think Android at least comes with all
the<00:05:32.280> galaxies<00:05:32.669> and<00:05:32.849> it<00:05:32.940> just<00:05:33.120> it<00:05:33.810> knows<00:05:34.200> how

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
the galaxies and it just it knows how

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.409 
the galaxies and it just it knows how
many<00:05:34.680> steps<00:05:34.950> I've<00:05:35.099> taken<00:05:35.130> today<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.760> I<00:05:35.789> didn't

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
many steps I've taken today and I didn't

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.680 
many steps I've taken today and I didn't
tell<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.660> to<00:05:36.900> like<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.229> other<00:05:37.380> day<00:05:37.620> it<00:05:37.860> told<00:05:38.130> me

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.510

my<00:05:39.690> goals<00:05:39.930> I<00:05:40.260> went<00:05:40.710> for<00:05:40.860> a<00:05:40.889> long<00:05:41.010> walk<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.460> I

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
my goals I went for a long walk and I

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.830 
my goals I went for a long walk and I
just<00:05:41.700> started<00:05:41.910> beeping<00:05:42.240> at<00:05:42.330> me<00:05:42.360> that<00:05:42.599> I<00:05:42.630> had

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
just started beeping at me that I had

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.240 
just started beeping at me that I had
achieved<00:05:42.960> my<00:05:43.349> goal<00:05:43.530> when<00:05:43.620> I<00:05:43.740> was<00:05:43.860> like<00:05:44.039> what

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
achieved my goal when I was like what

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.589 
achieved my goal when I was like what
the<00:05:44.370> heck<00:05:44.550> I<00:05:44.669> didn't<00:05:44.910> even<00:05:45.030> know<00:05:45.180> I<00:05:45.210> told<00:05:45.450> her

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
the heck I didn't even know I told her

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:46.360 
the heck I didn't even know I told her
to<00:05:45.690> do<00:05:45.810> that

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
to do that

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.290 
to do that
apparently<00:05:47.370> there's<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.610> Fitness<00:05:47.940> watch<00:05:47.970> you

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
apparently there's a Fitness watch you

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.180 
apparently there's a Fitness watch you
can<00:05:48.450> have<00:05:48.660> again

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
can have again

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.840 
can have again
for<00:05:50.000> this<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:50.570> it<00:05:51.250> tracks<00:05:52.250> everything<00:05:52.700> like

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
for this and it tracks everything like

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.310 
for this and it tracks everything like
heart<00:05:53.120> read<00:05:53.240> and<00:05:53.330> everything<00:05:53.630> so<00:05:53.780> it's<00:05:54.110> better

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
heart read and everything so it's better

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.770 
heart read and everything so it's better
more<00:05:54.800> accurate<00:05:55.220> but<00:05:55.490> I<00:05:55.790> thought<00:05:56.420> this<00:05:56.600> was

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
more accurate but I thought this was

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.380 
more accurate but I thought this was
really<00:05:56.810> neat<00:05:57.200> and<00:05:57.650> then<00:05:58.310> I<00:05:58.760> think<00:05:59.180> that's

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
really neat and then I think that's

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.290 
really neat and then I think that's
about<00:05:59.660> it<00:05:59.900> for<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.800> ABS<00:06:00.980> the<00:06:01.940> thing<00:06:02.150> that<00:06:02.270> I

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
about it for the ABS the thing that I

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.150 
about it for the ABS the thing that I
really<00:06:02.720> like<00:06:03.170> most<00:06:03.380> I<00:06:03.650> should<00:06:03.890> have<00:06:03.980> showed

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
really like most I should have showed

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.910 
really like most I should have showed
