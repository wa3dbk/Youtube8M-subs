00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hansa rostock wants in the third league 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.339
 a stay and fight on Friday succeeded 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.470
 victory 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.450
 namely four to three but then yesterday 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.370
 again a big setback in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.620
 Babelsberg was simply not successful 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.859
 It was already the sixteenth season 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.350
 defeat for hansa it exists 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.600
 it can not go on like that 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.850
 after 1 2 in babelsberg hansa staggers 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.230
 Rostock continues to descend yes 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.090
 we knew from the beginning that the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.140
 situation is threatening we have ourselves 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.170
 which gives you a bit of air 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.189
 we wanted to gild something here today 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.010
 wanted to have another three points here 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.940
 We wanted to get a cushion 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.820
 reconnect the middle of it 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.640
 threatening that we would not laugh 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.800
 feel it is surely clear of sv 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.070
 babelsberg in the dark jerseys has 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.780
 the first good possibility of the lot 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.920
 kevin müller in the hansa gate with strong 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.199
 parade after ten minutes hansa rostock 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.420
 wants to refine the three points from aachen 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.670
 Johann Platz after this babelsberger 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.629
 gift with a chance to leadership too 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.900
 imprecise good 2000 rostock trailer 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.110
 then see weekend lehmanns much space 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.760
 has to the front 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.100
 and it simply tried the guidance 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.600
 not undeserved because hansa in total 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.190
 comes up with the better play equipment 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.190
 Babelsberg is also fighting against relegation 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.420
 or babelsberg meets müller 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.820
 the 1 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.830
 marc fascher remains calm his 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.270
 team even after the equalization too 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.670
 naive on the defensive 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.170
 the 44 minute one again 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.390
 standard situation again 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.290
 Goal one to two of the residue 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.330
 on hansa at the half time the second 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.530
 half eleven meters for babelsberg royals 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.810
 Start there and miss the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.460
 preliminary decision 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.540
 thereafter unteachable in rostocker 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.330
 block for a few minutes 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.130
 be interrupting böller 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.660
 detonated bengalos torched that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.940
 Nachspiel is likely to make the club expensive too 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.770
 arrive in the square succeed only 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.630
 the team develops ideas that little 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.930
 only remarkable scene remains this 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.710
 Just before the end of the game will be today 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.100
 Wanted to win two 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.959
 the standard googles get themselves 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.709
 not enough chances played around this 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.959
 to turn things around 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.700
 There is a lot to discuss a lot 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.200
 time is not already on saturday 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.470
 hansa is at home borussia 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.470
 dortmund 2 and now there are after
