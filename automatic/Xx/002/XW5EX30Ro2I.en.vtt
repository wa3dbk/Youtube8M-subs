00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.330
 well I'll show you the installation 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.470
 what we have done to the bike to be able to 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.470
 connect the new battery 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.540
 from here we have cut the positive 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.620
 original of the motorbike 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.620
 here you can see it 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:25.960
 and those given the session wg cable 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.970
 as it is negative we have done the same 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.970
 there's only left over 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.170
 we have already soldered to the connector 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.750
 OK 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.040
 you have to have the battery of an seated 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.040
 and ready to put it 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.660
 out there add the connected by the 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.489
 balanced 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.640
 and you can see the difference 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.640
 size 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.880
 we have the problem when placing the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.440
 battery the motorcycle that being much more 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.440
 small because it will be very helguera 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:18.260
 here we have a cushion of a chair of my 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.260
 very important gutted room 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.240
 ok so let's kill the foam 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.100
 and one 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.940
 in the background 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.540
 we give the battery 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.510
 the two little sides 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.859
 and the one above 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.579
 Well, it would be something like that the idea of 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.439
 all ways to get a foam a 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.019
 little more dense and that are not so 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.500
 flexible so that a little more is left 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.500
 little better 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.030
 and well let's connect it 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.430
 ready 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.439
 Well, we have it connected 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.069
 let's put the run on just in case 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.069
 that something now 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.780
 and ready to start 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.180
 canyon test so you do not say 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.900
 then with these batteries you can only 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.900
 start base 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.640
 ah 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.490
 I think it's fine, not really 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.080
 I think we can continue giving it and 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.410
 giving you that you are not going to spend so 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.510
 quickly 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.860
 finally friends as you can see 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.860
 it works like fucking mother
