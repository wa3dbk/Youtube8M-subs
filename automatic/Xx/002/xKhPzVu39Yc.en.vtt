00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.600
 paralysis we saved our photo 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.130
 with recently purchased offices as 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.080
 seemed like quite a lot 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.000
 where it would be interesting to watch the video 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.480
 on like a pretty weird someone 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.839
 topic 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.220
 today we will talk about it 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.130
 This week I started a new training 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.990
 semester and I thought it was about time 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.820
 tell it to some office 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 who accompanies me study time 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.359
 not only so let's get started 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.980
 the office in my life plays pretty 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.300
 important role however strange it is 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.199
 sounded because i use it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.450
 constantly 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.190
 if I am on something to highlight the office 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.469
 if I need something to highlight the office 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.629
 she just stands always helmut next to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.980
 me is 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.379
 the immediate environment creates some kind 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.140
 pleasant pleasing atmosphere but so i 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.200
 I carefully select everything that I use in 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.360
 terms of colors in terms of brands which is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.010
 produces and so on the base set 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.629
 if I may say so 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.059
 I use usually fits here in this 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.730
 funny orange mugs in which 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.890
 there are bookmarks old candy all sorts 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.539
 highlighters and now I'm gradually 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.970
 tell you what is all the same here 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.110
 is like this 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.220
 basic set if you bring it closer 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.229
 a real discovery for me was 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.960
 that sold the markers in the letter e di 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.820
 I love everything, in principle, they are sold 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.170
 one set of 4 these permanent markers 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.159

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.560

 also so on conditionally I have pain 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.140

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.270

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.649

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.869
 paragraph here in this is manifested my 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.610
 clerical maniac is the only one

 Hanoi in the shop where they were sold 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.909
 various language things and lanterns were not 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.680
 and honestly the closest kei at all 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.250

 whether it is theater not any literature 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.849
 only literature, in principle, I love everything 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.159
 set aside because it immediately rushes 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.689

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.699

 Text selectors and viewers are even 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.989
 in cups and toothbrushes in the bathroom 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:29.569
 that sounds very strange when I do it 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.729
 I say but there is always a spare at home 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.010

 they are some kind of hard paper 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.229
