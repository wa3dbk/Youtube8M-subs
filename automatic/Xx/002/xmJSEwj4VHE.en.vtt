everyone has got a short little video

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.040 
everyone has got a short little video
for<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:04.770> today<00:00:04.920> I'm<00:00:05.600> on<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.890> minecart<00:00:08.030> station

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
for you today I'm on a minecart station

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.470 
for you today I'm on a minecart station
dispenser<00:00:10.050> thing<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.880> built<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.030> over<00:00:12.240> there

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
dispenser thing I built one over there

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.419 
dispenser thing I built one over there
but<00:00:12.960> I'm<00:00:13.049> just<00:00:13.139> going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.410> show<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.679> how<00:00:14.400> to

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
but I'm just going to show you how to

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.340 
but I'm just going to show you how to
build<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.790> over<00:00:15.000> here

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
build it over here

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.310 
build it over here
so<00:00:16.350> as<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.859> point<00:00:17.130> one<00:00:17.720> fence<00:00:18.720> gates<00:00:19.050> are

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
so as of one point one fence gates are

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.800 
so as of one point one fence gates are
now<00:00:19.470> controllable<00:00:20.300> by<00:00:21.300> redstone<00:00:21.539> power<00:00:23.810> right

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
now controllable by redstone power right

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.310 
now controllable by redstone power right
here<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.920> put<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> torch<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:27.180> put<00:00:27.599> wire

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
here you put a torch you can put wire

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.760 
here you put a torch you can put wire
mesh<00:00:28.949> torch<00:00:31.279> button<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.290> also<00:00:34.440> send

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
mesh torch button you can also send

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:43.369 
mesh torch button you can also send
power<00:00:35.360> through<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.630> block<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
power through a block and that is the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
power through a block and that is the
one<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:44.040> using<00:00:44.399> today<00:00:44.550> for

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
one we are going to be using today for

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.610 
one we are going to be using today for
this<00:00:45.600> video

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.020 

there<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.710> go<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> first<00:00:52.230> off<00:00:52.969> we're<00:00:53.969> gonna

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
there we go so first off we're gonna

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.510 
there we go so first off we're gonna
build<00:00:54.300> our<00:00:54.539> column<00:00:55.020> which<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> minecarts

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
build our column which the minecarts

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.930 
build our column which the minecarts
will<00:00:56.670> go<00:00:56.789> in<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.039> build<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.579> high<00:01:02.789> as

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
will go in you can build this as high as

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.460 
will go in you can build this as high as
you<00:01:03.120> want<00:01:03.329> I'm<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> build<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
you want I'm just going to build it to

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.570 
you want I'm just going to build it to
hold<00:01:05.090> maybe<00:01:06.090> four<00:01:06.420> carts<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
hold maybe four carts just for the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:30.770 
hold maybe four carts just for the
purpose<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.030> video

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.640 

so<00:01:31.350> I'm<00:01:31.440> just<00:01:31.590> looping<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.400> around<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.210> then

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
so I'm just looping this around and then

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.440 
so I'm just looping this around and then
we're<00:01:34.650> gonna<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:34.890> back<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.310> well<00:01:36.000> first<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.360> all

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
we're gonna go back up well first of all

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.980 
we're gonna go back up well first of all
we<00:01:36.600> should<00:01:36.720> put<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.870> fence<00:01:37.170> gate<00:01:37.640> block<00:01:38.870> put<00:01:39.870> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
we should put a fence gate block put the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.110 
we should put a fence gate block put the
fence<00:01:40.170> gate<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:43.550> so<00:01:44.550> then<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.970> have

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
fence gate there so then you can have

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.390 
fence gate there so then you can have
this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.600> where<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.229> will<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.470> out<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.190> wherever

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
this is where it will go out to wherever

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.010 
this is where it will go out to wherever
you<00:01:47.640> want<00:01:50.030> actually<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.479> need<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.660> do<00:01:51.810> is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you want actually what we need to do is

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.460 
you want actually what we need to do is
we<00:01:52.140> need<00:01:52.260> to<00:01:52.320> put<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:53.420> up<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.690> block<00:01:54.900> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
we need to put this up up one block and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.370 
we need to put this up up one block and
then<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.710> need<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> detect<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.520> rail<00:01:57.380> actually

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
then we need to detect a rail actually

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.070 
then we need to detect a rail actually
you<00:01:58.440> know<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:58.650> we'll<00:01:58.770> put<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.010> up<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.340> I<00:02:03.080> don't

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
you know what we'll put it up to I don't

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.389 
you know what we'll put it up to I don't
put<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.770> torch<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.759> there<00:02:06.210> get<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.630> powered<00:02:07.399> and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
put a torch for there get it powered and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.500 
put a torch for there get it powered and
we'll<00:02:08.580> put<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.910> detector<00:02:09.509> rail<00:02:10.160> right<00:02:11.160> here

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
we'll put a detector rail right here

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.040 
we'll put a detector rail right here
block<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.739> we<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:13.980> place<00:02:14.160> our<00:02:14.310> fence<00:02:14.550> gate

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
block so we can place our fence gate

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.430 
block so we can place our fence gate
move<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:17.510> guess<00:02:18.510> we'll<00:02:18.690> use<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> powered

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
move that I guess we'll use of a powered

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:29.030 
move that I guess we'll use of a powered
rail<00:02:22.130> get<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.370> going<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.680> we<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.830> end

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
rail get that going and then we can end

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.020 
rail get that going and then we can end
it<00:02:29.450> here<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.980> would<00:02:32.160> be<00:02:32.340> where<00:02:32.850> you

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
it here and this would be where you

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.210 
it here and this would be where you
would<00:02:33.209> want<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.600> go<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.650> your<00:02:34.680> base<00:02:34.920> or

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
would want it to go to your base or

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.620 
would want it to go to your base or
whatever<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.730> want<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.239> minecart

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
whatever you want to have the minecart

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.940 
whatever you want to have the minecart
go<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:38.220> now<00:02:38.310> we're<00:02:38.430> gonna<00:02:38.549> build<00:02:38.760> up<00:02:39.950> four

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
go so now we're gonna build up four

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.880 
go so now we're gonna build up four
blocks<00:02:41.190> for<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.580> video

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
blocks for this video

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.320 
blocks for this video
build<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.070> SS<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.760> build<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.090> as<00:02:45.180> high<00:02:45.299> as

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
build the SS you can build it as high as

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.910 
build the SS you can build it as high as
you<00:02:45.480> want<00:02:45.570> you'll<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:45.989> just<00:02:46.080> more<00:02:46.380> minecarts

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you want you'll have just more minecarts

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.820 
you want you'll have just more minecarts
then

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.750 

the<00:02:54.310> front<00:02:54.730> here<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.330> like<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.810> use<00:02:56.100> glass<00:02:57.100> so

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
the front here I like to use glass so

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.200 
the front here I like to use glass so
actually<00:02:58.120> we're<00:02:58.270> going<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.450> go<00:02:58.570> ahead<00:02:59.040> and<00:03:00.210> do

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
actually we're going to go ahead and do

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.870 
actually we're going to go ahead and do
that<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.040> all<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.310> fence<00:03:03.490> gates<00:03:03.760> you

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
that and this is all the fence gates you

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:17.330 
that and this is all the fence gates you
only<00:03:04.030> need<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:09.150> there<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.270> go

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.309 

okay<00:03:17.850> we're<00:03:18.030> gonna<00:03:18.120> build<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.420> little<00:03:18.450> ramp<00:03:18.840> up

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:39.250 

up<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.099> here<00:03:30.889> move<00:03:31.889> this<00:03:32.099> around

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:55.460 

and<00:03:40.260> have<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.950> stow<00:03:41.220> up

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:05.130 

I<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:56.160> this<00:03:56.340> go<00:03:56.580> up

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.000 

and<00:04:05.830> there<00:04:06.190> we<00:04:06.310> go<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.840> if<00:04:08.200> we<00:04:08.380> don't<00:04:08.620> want<00:04:08.920> a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
and there we go so if we don't want a

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.530 
and there we go so if we don't want a
cart<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.580> we<00:04:09.700> accidentally<00:04:10.150> press<00:04:10.360> the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
cart and we accidentally press the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.410 
cart and we accidentally press the
button<00:04:10.810> for<00:04:10.840> some<00:04:11.350> reason<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:12.250> will<00:04:12.400> go<00:04:12.550> what

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
button for some reason it will go what

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.610 
button for some reason it will go what
we're<00:04:13.540> gonna<00:04:13.630> put<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.840> lever<00:04:14.050> actually<00:04:14.500> we'll

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
we're gonna put a lever actually we'll

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.170 
we're gonna put a lever actually we'll
do<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.800> now<00:04:14.980> put<00:04:15.610> a<00:04:15.640> lever<00:04:15.850> there<00:04:17.310> this<00:04:18.310> is

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.570 

when<00:04:22.180> it's<00:04:22.330> powered<00:04:22.980> if<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.190> cart<00:04:24.430> will

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
when it's powered if the cart will

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.430 
when it's powered if the cart will
return<00:04:24.910> back<00:04:25.210> into<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.480> stack<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.140> when<00:04:26.320> it's

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
return back into the stack and when it's

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.390 
return back into the stack and when it's
off<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:28.300> cart<00:04:28.540> will<00:04:28.690> go<00:04:28.810> up<00:04:29.050> here<00:04:29.160> and<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.310> will

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
off the cart will go up here and it will

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.390 
off the cart will go up here and it will
actually<00:04:30.460> sit<00:04:31.300> right<00:04:31.690> here<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.290> as<00:04:33.070> soon<00:04:33.280> as

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
actually sit right here and as soon as

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.860 
actually sit right here and as soon as
you<00:04:33.520> hop<00:04:33.700> in<00:04:33.880> because<00:04:34.240> fence<00:04:34.540> gates<00:04:34.750> are

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
you hop in because fence gates are

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.890 
you hop in because fence gates are
powered<00:04:35.050> by<00:04:35.140> redstone<00:04:35.350> this<00:04:35.980> is<00:04:36.130> redstone

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
powered by redstone this is redstone

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.470 
powered by redstone this is redstone
when<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:37.960> hop<00:04:38.110> in<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.320> minecart<00:04:38.710> you'll<00:04:38.890> go

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
when you hop in the minecart you'll go

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.850 
when you hop in the minecart you'll go
so<00:04:40.480> it's<00:04:40.660> not<00:04:40.780> like<00:04:41.020> when<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.320> have<00:04:41.470> dispensed

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
so it's not like when you have dispensed

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.350 
so it's not like when you have dispensed
a<00:04:41.980> cart<00:04:42.190> it<00:04:42.310> will<00:04:42.400> just<00:04:42.550> automatically<00:04:43.000> go<00:04:43.180> and

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
a cart it will just automatically go and

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.900 
a cart it will just automatically go and
you'll<00:04:43.450> miss<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:44.040> will<00:04:45.040> always<00:04:45.280> wait<00:04:45.640> for<00:04:45.669> you

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
you'll miss it will always wait for you

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.710 
you'll miss it will always wait for you
at<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.300> fence<00:04:46.600> gate<00:04:46.810> here<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:48.480> this<00:04:49.480> fence

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
at the fence gate here and this fence

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.870 
at the fence gate here and this fence
gate<00:04:49.960> holds<00:04:50.350> them<00:04:50.500> up<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:51.250> we're<00:04:51.580> gonna<00:04:51.669> make

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
gate holds them up and we're gonna make

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.250 
gate holds them up and we're gonna make
a<00:04:51.910> monostable<00:04:52.300> circuit<00:04:54.900> what<00:04:55.900> am<00:04:55.990> i<00:04:56.020> doing

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
a monostable circuit what am i doing

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.390 
a monostable circuit what am i doing
right<00:04:56.590> there<00:04:57.690> so<00:04:58.690> button<00:04:59.560> block<00:05:00.220> torch<00:05:01.260> block

be right back okay I am back and that

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.350 
be right back okay I am back and that
it's<00:05:19.120> not<00:05:19.300> powering<00:05:19.750> that<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.500> we<00:05:20.710> need<00:05:21.360> this

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
it's not powering that and we need this

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.290 
it's not powering that and we need this
to<00:05:22.419> be<00:05:22.750> powered<00:05:23.410> there<00:05:23.560> we<00:05:23.650> go

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
to be powered there we go

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.780 
to be powered there we go
these<00:05:25.300> ones<00:05:28.380> okay<00:05:29.380> we<00:05:30.250> don't<00:05:30.340> want<00:05:30.520> that<00:05:30.610> one

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
these ones okay we don't want that one

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.340 
these ones okay we don't want that one
powered<00:05:31.120> just<00:05:31.210> for<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:31.510> video<00:05:31.660> cuz<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.229> it'll

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
powered just for the video cuz so it'll

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.690 
powered just for the video cuz so it'll
stop<00:05:32.590> it<00:05:34.470> so<00:05:35.470> there<00:05:35.620> we<00:05:35.770> go<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:36.160> just<00:05:36.190> move<00:05:36.550> this

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
stop it so there we go I just move this

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.100 
stop it so there we go I just move this
over<00:05:36.880> a<00:05:37.060> bit<00:05:37.210> so<00:05:37.330> we<00:05:37.390> could<00:05:37.540> complete<00:05:37.900> them

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
over a bit so we could complete them

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.320 
over a bit so we could complete them
honestly<00:05:38.470> I<00:05:38.500> will<00:05:38.590> circuit<00:05:38.919> so<00:05:39.729> as<00:05:40.060> I<00:05:40.180> said

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
honestly I will circuit so as I said

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.500 
honestly I will circuit so as I said
before<00:05:40.479> you<00:05:40.720> have<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.900> button<00:05:41.200> torch<00:05:41.740> block

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
before you have the button torch block

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.540 
before you have the button torch block
redstone<00:05:43.510> dust<00:05:43.690> on<00:05:43.990> these<00:05:44.290> two<00:05:44.620> another<00:05:45.190> torch

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
redstone dust on these two another torch

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.130 
redstone dust on these two another torch
here<00:05:45.970> on<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.050> end<00:05:47.200> and<00:05:47.530> a<00:05:48.100> repeater<00:05:49.140> that's

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
here on the end and a repeater that's

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.640 
here on the end and a repeater that's
pointing<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:50.770> way<00:05:50.979> set<00:05:51.520> to<00:05:51.870> three<00:05:52.870> so<00:05:53.200> it<00:05:53.380> by

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
pointing that way set to three so it by

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.540 
pointing that way set to three so it by
default<00:05:54.040> set<00:05:54.310> one<00:05:54.550> two<00:05:55.330> three<00:05:56.400> so<00:05:57.400> you<00:05:57.460> just

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
default set one two three so you just

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.600 
default set one two three so you just
right-click<00:05:58.270> it<00:05:58.540> twice<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:59.190> then<00:06:00.190> we're

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
right-click it twice and then we're

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.900 
right-click it twice and then we're
going<00:06:00.760> on<00:06:01.560> point<00:06:02.560> it<00:06:02.650> into<00:06:02.979> this<00:06:03.100> block<00:06:03.460> here

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
going on point it into this block here

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.850 
going on point it into this block here
because<00:06:04.240> power<00:06:04.990> as<00:06:05.380> I<00:06:05.500> showed<00:06:05.650> you<00:06:05.710> at<00:06:05.830> the

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
because power as I showed you at the

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.350 
because power as I showed you at the
beginning<00:06:06.010> of<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.430> video<00:06:06.520> will<00:06:06.850> pass<00:06:07.060> through

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
beginning of the video will pass through

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.080 
beginning of the video will pass through
a<00:06:07.450> block<00:06:07.979> into<00:06:08.979> the<00:06:09.010> fence<00:06:09.190> gate<00:06:09.400> so<00:06:09.910> that's

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
a block into the fence gate so that's

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.630 
a block into the fence gate so that's
what<00:06:10.240> we're<00:06:10.360> gonna<00:06:10.479> use<00:06:10.570> for<00:06:10.870> this<00:06:11.490> build<00:06:12.490> out

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
what we're gonna use for this build out

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.540 
what we're gonna use for this build out
to<00:06:13.380> put<00:06:14.380> a<00:06:14.410> repeater<00:06:14.710> and<00:06:15.450> there<00:06:16.450> we<00:06:16.570> go

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
to put a repeater and there we go

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.249 
to put a repeater and there we go
so<00:06:19.550> before<00:06:19.939> I<00:06:20.210> want<00:06:20.539> to<00:06:20.629> show<00:06:20.749> you<00:06:20.840> how<00:06:20.990> long<00:06:21.229> a

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 
so before I want to show you how long a

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.179 
so before I want to show you how long a
fence<00:06:21.559> gate<00:06:21.770> would<00:06:21.919> stay<00:06:22.129> open<00:06:23.830> we<00:06:24.830> don't<00:06:24.949> want

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:25.189 
fence gate would stay open we don't want

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:26.619 
fence gate would stay open we don't want
it<00:06:25.279> to<00:06:25.400> be<00:06:25.490> that<00:06:25.610> long<00:06:25.819> we<00:06:25.969> want<00:06:26.089> the<00:06:26.270> shortest

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:26.629 
it to be that long we want the shortest

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.429 
it to be that long we want the shortest
pulse<00:06:26.870> possible<00:06:27.469> which<00:06:27.740> is<00:06:27.770> a<00:06:27.919> one<00:06:28.249> tick<00:06:29.439> so

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:30.439 
pulse possible which is a one tick so

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.439 
pulse possible which is a one tick so
you<00:06:30.650> see<00:06:30.770> how<00:06:30.860> much<00:06:30.979> quicker<00:06:31.189> that<00:06:31.309> is<00:06:31.639> that

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
you see how much quicker that is that

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.209 
you see how much quicker that is that
will<00:06:32.599> let<00:06:32.839> one<00:06:32.870> minecart<00:06:33.680> through<00:06:33.949> without

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
will let one minecart through without

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:38.860 
will let one minecart through without
all<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:34.580> rest<00:06:34.759> dropping<00:06:37.449> which<00:06:38.449> is<00:06:38.599> what<00:06:38.749> we

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
all the rest dropping which is what we

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.149 
all the rest dropping which is what we
want<00:06:39.080> we<00:06:39.139> don't<00:06:39.289> want<00:06:39.529> them<00:06:39.650> all<00:06:39.770> falling

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
want we don't want them all falling

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.070 
want we don't want them all falling
through<00:06:40.309> at<00:06:40.370> the<00:06:40.430> same<00:06:40.639> time<00:06:40.879> so<00:06:41.839> now<00:06:41.990> that

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
through at the same time so now that

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.939 
through at the same time so now that
we've<00:06:42.259> got<00:06:42.409> that<00:06:42.559> done<00:06:42.800> um<00:06:44.800> it's<00:06:45.800> actually

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
we've got that done um it's actually

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:47.769 
we've got that done um it's actually
pretty<00:06:46.639> much<00:06:46.849> it<00:06:47.059> so<00:06:47.089> we'll<00:06:47.419> just<00:06:47.449> go<00:06:47.659> ahead

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:47.779 
pretty much it so we'll just go ahead

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:54.689 
pretty much it so we'll just go ahead
and<00:06:47.960> get<00:06:48.050> a<00:06:48.080> minecart<00:06:52.539> easy<00:06:53.539> to<00:06:53.659> find<00:06:53.839> it<00:06:54.020> and

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:54.699 
and get a minecart easy to find it and

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:57.010 
and get a minecart easy to find it and
this<00:06:55.699> will<00:06:55.819> only<00:06:55.909> hold<00:06:56.120> for<00:06:56.509> but<00:06:56.749> as<00:06:56.839> I<00:06:56.960> said

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
this will only hold for but as I said

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.890 
this will only hold for but as I said
before<00:06:57.469> you<00:06:58.069> can<00:06:58.219> have<00:06:58.400> it<00:06:58.520> 100<00:06:59.479> block<00:06:59.689> side

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
before you can have it 100 block side

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.809 
before you can have it 100 block side
well<00:07:00.110> not<00:07:00.259> a<00:07:00.289> hundred<00:07:00.529> but<00:07:00.830> you're<00:07:01.580> gonna<00:07:01.669> have

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819 
well not a hundred but you're gonna have

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.200 
well not a hundred but you're gonna have
as<00:07:01.939> high<00:07:02.060> as<00:07:02.150> you<00:07:02.240> want<00:07:03.699> so<00:07:04.699> it's<00:07:04.849> fairly<00:07:05.060> easy

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
as high as you want so it's fairly easy

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.129 
as high as you want so it's fairly easy
to<00:07:05.419> load<00:07:05.659> you<00:07:05.839> just<00:07:06.069> put<00:07:07.069> them<00:07:07.159> in<00:07:07.870> there<00:07:08.870> we<00:07:08.990> go

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
to load you just put them in there we go

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:15.100 
to load you just put them in there we go
and<00:07:10.899> we<00:07:11.899> will<00:07:12.050> take<00:07:12.229> one<00:07:12.909> and<00:07:13.909> you<00:07:14.810> know<00:07:14.930> we

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
and we will take one and you know we

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.070 
and we will take one and you know we
won't<00:07:15.259> because<00:07:15.710> it's<00:07:15.860> set<00:07:16.039> to<00:07:16.159> return<00:07:17.080> well

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
won't because it's set to return well

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.559 
won't because it's set to return well
actually<00:07:19.149> here<00:07:20.149> you<00:07:20.360> can<00:07:20.659> see<00:07:20.809> how<00:07:21.020> it<00:07:21.169> returns

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:22.569 
actually here you can see how it returns

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.420 
actually here you can see how it returns
goes<00:07:23.569> around<00:07:24.020> the<00:07:24.199> track<00:07:24.469> up<00:07:24.770> all<00:07:25.219> the<00:07:25.310> way

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
goes around the track up all the way

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.279 
goes around the track up all the way
back<00:07:25.610> and<00:07:25.969> back<00:07:26.539> into<00:07:26.719> the<00:07:26.779> stack<00:07:27.110> of

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:27.289 
back and back into the stack of

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:29.379 
back and back into the stack of
minecarts<00:07:27.710> and<00:07:28.639> we'll<00:07:28.879> flip<00:07:29.029> the<00:07:29.180> switch

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389 
minecarts and we'll flip the switch

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:34.659 
minecarts and we'll flip the switch
turns<00:07:29.960> the<00:07:30.139> track<00:07:32.649> it<00:07:33.649> will<00:07:33.770> go<00:07:33.889> up<00:07:34.069> here<00:07:34.490> and

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:34.669 
turns the track it will go up here and

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.850 
turns the track it will go up here and
it<00:07:35.060> will<00:07:35.209> wait<00:07:35.389> for<00:07:35.599> us<00:07:35.719> and<00:07:36.110> then<00:07:36.349> we<00:07:36.499> go<00:07:36.680> on

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.860 
it will wait for us and then we go on

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:44.879 
it will wait for us and then we go on
and<00:07:37.159> it<00:07:37.459> stops<00:07:38.080> because<00:07:39.080> we<00:07:39.199> want<00:07:39.409> it<00:07:39.439> to<00:07:43.089> so

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:44.889 
and it stops because we want it to so

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:47.679 
and it stops because we want it to so
yeah<00:07:45.889> that's<00:07:46.159> it<00:07:46.339> for<00:07:46.610> this<00:07:46.969> video<00:07:47.149> hopefully

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:47.689 
yeah that's it for this video hopefully

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:50.079 
yeah that's it for this video hopefully
you<00:07:47.899> found<00:07:48.110> it<00:07:48.319> useful<00:07:48.499> for<00:07:49.219> a<00:07:49.759> minecart

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:50.089
