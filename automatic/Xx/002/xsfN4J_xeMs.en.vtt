bleach<00:02:42.030> or<00:02:42.239> enough<00:02:42.359> it'll<00:02:42.569> work<00:02:42.689> but<00:02:43.290> it's

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
bleach or enough it'll work but it's

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.520 
bleach or enough it'll work but it's
like<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.920> lacy<00:02:44.459> top<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.599> has<00:02:46.379> these
