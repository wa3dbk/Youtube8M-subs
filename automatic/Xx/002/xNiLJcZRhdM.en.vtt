first<00:00:36.390> half<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:37.469> didn't<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:37.770> move<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.030 
first half we didn't really move the
ball<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.809> let<00:00:39.989> our<00:00:40.110> offense<00:00:40.649> dictate<00:00:41.010> our

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
ball and we let our offense dictate our

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.990 
ball and we let our offense dictate our
defense<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.469> like<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.559> said<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:44.550> played<00:00:44.760> poorly

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
defense and like I said we played poorly

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
defense and like I said we played poorly
in<00:00:45.120> office<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:46.469> didn't<00:00:46.649> do

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
in office in so we really didn't do

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
in office in so we really didn't do
anything<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.129> defense<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.579> which<00:00:47.820> hurt<00:00:48.300> us

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
anything on the defense in which hurt us

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.750 
anything on the defense in which hurt us
and<00:00:48.660> let<00:00:48.989> them<00:00:49.140> get<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.469> great<00:00:49.649> lead<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and let them get it a great lead you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.029 
and let them get it a great lead you
know<00:00:50.879> became<00:00:51.719> too<00:00:51.899> much<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.289> overcome<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
