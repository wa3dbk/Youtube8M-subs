00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 hello my dear and warm 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.460
 Welcome to my channel 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.350
 Today I want to talk to you about the topic 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.179
 speak 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.160
 and there I will be first for the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.230
 Newcomers multimedia explain what that means 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.519
 team is mobile and then will 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.619
 I then my personal forecast 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.560
 So imagine which players of mine 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.439
 in the opinion of this year were the best 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.750
 well what is the team if you are the animal 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.539
 comparable to the team of the week so 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.400
 with the in-game players every week 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.439
 appear and based on real 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.210
 player performances, however, not in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.420
 view of the week but on the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.860
 all year long in contrast to e 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.050
 to the team of the week the players of the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.210
 Timothy does not judge himself but judges 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.520
 After the balloon d'or the balloon 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.770
 d'or is an event at the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.489
 captains trainers and journalists 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.890
 the whole world 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.350
 the eleven of the year the players of the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.020
 year or the player of the year and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.610
 choose the gate of the year 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.140
 that means there will be players for 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.289
 special achievements or 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.570
 excellent and that decided there 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.110
 or chosen team of the year will be on 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.110
 ultimate team transfer and the cards 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.810
 the player of the year looks blue 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.280
 So completely blue and are mostly and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.950
 five or six values ​​in total 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 So that means a big one 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.240
 upgrade compared to the team of the week 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.979
 there are usually one to two values 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.840
 increased and what in you then too 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.280
 more popular and the whole thing will be like that 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.150
 follow in the first week 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.780
 release of the timo at the balloon d'or 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.759
 You can go to her in the form of the week 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.619
 Daubert and the defenders of the team 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.540
 you can pull in the second week 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.280
 then pull the midfielder and in 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.840
 the third week the offensive players 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.759
 So the storms and the wing players 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.500
 and in the fourth week you can then 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.720
 Pull again the complete t mobile 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.030
 Of course, many people want to be there 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.640
 hopefully try one of these 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.920
 to draw players and open there as well 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.719
 Occasionally one or the other pack 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.700
 and that's why there are so many 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.159
 players in the market or very many 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 objects and then there is the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.790
 chance one or two bargains 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.890
 but then come to think 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.050
 I still have a separate trading video 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.819
 But that was it first for explanation 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.989
 to the term timo 4 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.640
 and then they are coming too 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.440
 points 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.540
 in which position the players are playing 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.920
 the institutes have to come play her 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.600
 actually not a big role, however 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.480
 there are a few small specifications so 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.980
 There is a goalkeeper four defenders 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.440
 while inside and two fullbacks 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.760
 three midfielders and three strikers 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.010
 and that's why I have the here too 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.320
 4 3 3 formation in which I then took 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.760
 Here the player a folder in I trust 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.170
 I decided for manual new because 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.450
 he among other things for the few 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.220
 was responsible for bavaria 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.050
 and many may be upset 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.810
 will decide out for new ones because 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.550
 he was so successful with bavaria in the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.600
 I have the first defensive position 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.030
 then thiago silva 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.440
 who was pretty good at psg and did 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.580
 a very consistent performance 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.590
 actually had already last year 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.790
 but this year will have to come 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.430
 hopefully be there 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.620
 just like sergio ramos was pretty 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.850
 good at real madrid and if you have this 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.320
 Both names are easy to oettingen 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.090
 directly in world class defenders and 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.950
 so I think that the two 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.720
 maybe still be there 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.030
 dante come but I think that 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.580
 both run a bit harder then in 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.230
 the left defense alaba i think 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.270
 times the farmer come in the next 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.890
 big competition because of that 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.060
 that he was so strong in the left 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.459
 there may still be defense 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.080
 filipe luis or holly alba but alaba 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.270
 just achieved a bit more 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.770
 with bavaria in the right defense 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.360
 I have philipp lame 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.760
 he is one of the strongest players in the world 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.730
 Bundesliga and is currently in top form 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.670
 just like ribéry and ribéry was too 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.620
 already europe footballer of the year 2013 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.670
 and if he comes into the team of the year 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.890
 actually no more question 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.410
 at most , the question arises whether he 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.940
 now even world footballer will be 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.230
 we have as a second midfielder 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.000
 Bastian Schweinsteiger 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.670
 the key player of the midfield 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.709
 Actors from FC Bayern now many players 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.660
 from bavaria in this team but that 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.080
 is also clear her leg has the triple 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.459
 won 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.350
 that is why it is very justified 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.360
 I think then we have at the 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.709
 was also one of the best players of this 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.690
 year I think that became now 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.600
 best player of the premier league 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.700
 chosen so the last season and as 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.370
 left wing here or in the storm I say 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.140
 We'll have Ronaldo that's too 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.880
 yes, no question if he is here 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.900
 come in messi ronaldo 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.200
 We will definitely be back 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.850
 be there and the question then stop 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.220
 only if he is now world footballer here 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.970
 whether messi becomes world footballer or whether 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.530
 Ribery 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.320
 world soccer player, I think this is 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.150
 now in this more specific selection or 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.520
 this smaller selection came 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.020
 who is now from the world football and 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.940
 then we have ibrahimovic 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.980
 he has it in my opinion very 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.410
 deserves and that is just one 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.540
 world-class player shoots incredible 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.460
 Gates from volley to fallback 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.530
 everything is there and that's why I hope 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.610
 that through this spectacular gate or 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.250
 by its conspicuousness the 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.890
 Journalists trainers and captains him 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.420
 then in the system will choose another 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.190
 players who were very strong this year 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.810
 or where it is difficult for me like 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.030
 not to be part of this team 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.570
 are for example of percy torres 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.500
 iniesta 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.850
 these players spontaneously come to mind 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.160
 and that is really just a forecast 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.140
 So now this is not the team which 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.150
 will come in any case but that 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.520
 is really only a guess and therefore 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.510
 I wish you too yours 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.190
 own opinion in the comments 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.980
 Write and what about her team now 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.240
 you hold or which player 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.050
 instead would exhibit so 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.430
 you maybe dante in the 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.530
 defense or you would do 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.370
 So do not put ibrahimovic up 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.919
 please write this in the comments 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.570
 that would really interest me what 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.280
 you even think of and if you are 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.419
 further information to the team , not even yes 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.440
 then you can miss one 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.120
 like to subscribe to 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.950
 so that the e-mail becomes personal as well 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.180
 help a lot and that 's it 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.560
 Actually it's already done today 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.560
 good people and see you next time
