he has a fantastic idea that there were
initiates<00:05:22.530> great<00:05:23.530> priests<00:05:24.130> who<00:05:24.280> were<00:05:24.310> ships

captains and that although some of those
humble<00:05:28.810> seamen<00:05:29.320> didn't<00:05:29.620> know<00:05:29.770> all<00:05:30.220> the

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
humble seamen didn't know all the

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.730 
humble seamen didn't know all the
secrets<00:05:31.030> these<00:05:31.720> priests<00:05:32.289> were<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.470> first

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
secrets these priests were the first

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.400 
secrets these priests were the first
people<00:05:33.100> who<00:05:33.250> knew<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.789> world<00:05:33.970> was<00:05:34.240> round

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
people who knew that the world was round

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.810 
people who knew that the world was round
and<00:05:35.940> that<00:05:37.890> that<00:05:38.890> gives<00:05:38.919> one<00:05:39.340> an<00:05:39.460> entirely

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
and that that gives one an entirely

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.690 
and that that gives one an entirely
different<00:05:39.970> theology<00:05:40.930> you<00:05:41.560> see<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:42.400> if<00:05:42.580> you

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
different theology you see and if you

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.409 
different theology you see and if you
believe<00:05:42.970> that<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.270> world<00:05:43.390> is<00:05:43.600> flat<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:48.419> so

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
believe that the world is flat and so

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.120 
believe that the world is flat and so
from<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.610> priests<00:05:51.610> of<00:05:51.789> the<00:05:51.880> ocean<00:05:53.130> the

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
from the priests of the ocean the

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.690 
from the priests of the ocean the
Landsman<00:05:54.580> learned<00:05:55.169> how<00:05:56.169> to<00:05:56.200> use<00:05:57.150> cranes

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
Landsman learned how to use cranes

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.010 
Landsman learned how to use cranes
blocks<00:06:00.700> and<00:06:01.000> tackles<00:06:01.650> how<00:06:02.650> to<00:06:02.710> build<00:06:03.389> how<00:06:04.389> what

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
blocks and tackles how to build how what

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.370 
blocks and tackles how to build how what
a<00:06:05.050> good<00:06:05.590> house<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:06.220> overturned<00:06:06.669> ship<00:06:06.970> made

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
a good house and overturned ship made

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.740 
a good house and overturned ship made
and<00:06:08.380> so<00:06:08.560> to<00:06:08.620> this<00:06:08.830> day<00:06:08.889> a<00:06:09.510> cathedral<00:06:10.510> has<00:06:10.720> a

temples so fuller goes on to say now if

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.200 
temples so fuller goes on to say now if
you're<00:06:26.380> a<00:06:26.440> good<00:06:26.710> architect<00:06:27.250> as<00:06:27.639> the<00:06:27.850> ancient

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
you're a good architect as the ancient

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.540 
you're a good architect as the ancient
architects<00:06:28.720> learned<00:06:28.990> from<00:06:29.229> the<00:06:29.320> ocean<00:06:29.680> first

thing you should do when you get through
architectural<00:06:32.470> school<00:06:32.740> is<00:06:32.979> go<00:06:33.160> and<00:06:33.370> work<00:06:33.550> in

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
architectural school is go and work in

architectural school is go and work in
an<00:06:33.789> airplane<00:06:34.090> factory<00:06:34.919> and<00:06:37.140> understand<00:06:38.140> the

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
an airplane factory and understand the

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.970 
an airplane factory and understand the
beautiful<00:06:40.190> thing<00:06:40.460> that<00:06:41.000> man<00:06:41.270> has<00:06:41.510> made<00:06:41.800> in<00:06:42.800> a

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
beautiful thing that man has made in a

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.450 
beautiful thing that man has made in a
fine<00:06:43.430> fine<00:06:43.910> airplane<00:06:44.450> you<00:06:45.139> see<00:06:45.169> which<00:06:46.070> is<00:06:46.280> as

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
fine fine airplane you see which is as

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.720 
fine fine airplane you see which is as
great<00:06:47.120> as<00:06:47.300> a<00:06:47.330> bird<00:06:47.630> in<00:06:47.900> its<00:06:48.050> own<00:06:48.200> way

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
great as a bird in its own way

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.890 
great as a bird in its own way
because<00:06:49.730> that's<00:06:49.970> the<00:06:50.210> architecture<00:06:50.870> of

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
because that's the architecture of

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.840 
because that's the architecture of
insecurity<00:06:51.680> and<00:06:53.860> that<00:06:54.860> really<00:06:55.310> lives<00:06:55.580> with

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
insecurity and that really lives with

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.630 
insecurity and that really lives with
insecurity<00:06:58.630> well
