00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 cool thought about the time until the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.070
 bundesliga starts again and above all 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 then also the ttz opening 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.289
 what are you doing? 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.990
 starts to bridge and the ttc 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.169

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.780
 you will get to know all of this 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.870
 will explain it to you and find it 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.230
 the whole city ​​with 16 teams that are 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.350
 the 16 teams in the final table 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.990
 the real bundesliga season from place 1 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.610
 to be placed 16 that is it 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.530
 are paderborn and freiburg as 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.470
 relegated no longer there 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.020
 So we start from the beginning 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.490
 Eight finals just shown with 16 teams 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.680
 Well the 16 teams must of course 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.309
 somehow be split up and that's why 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.580
 we found the following one here 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.800
 from a draw tool 16 teams 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.260
 we want to do a ko-round and 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.750
 All 16 teams were in the ballpark 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.630
 and when I generate it down below 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.450
 press will build us a tournament yes 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.360
 randomly drawn and because of that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.880
 or this will then draw 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.950
 the tournament tree is finally filled 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.600
 I'll just do it now 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.030
 you know, here are all team names that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.979
 it is clear that I am going to schedule 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.360
 I can draw and you can draw on it 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.850
 start moving back I will do that now 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.340
 and then we see how the parts in the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.060
 So, eightfinal looks are going to start 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.250
 I'm curious how you go flitze shit 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.400
 which teams in the eighth finals to each other 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:57.860
 meet and I start the 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:02:00.600
 draw with just one click right now so 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.549
 augsburg against leverkusen hamburg older 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.220
 and so on, you see that the whole 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.409
 we will change now and in that 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.289
 tournament when packing with the match attax 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.480
 logos allow for a better picture 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.880
 give it off so it looks nice 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.730
 put that down now that's it 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.380
 officially the official eighth-final 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.890
 tournament why these games will be 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.380
 give 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.180
 so now so the procedure how is that 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.290
 whole city tie the eighth-finals are 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.470
 yes eight games 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.240
 we will meet the eighth-finals 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.090
 four days in part so four days 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.670
 every day two parts of this 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.650
 eighth-final tree 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.240
 that means that the eighth-final round 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.340
 It will take four days after that 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.370
 give new draw for the quarter-finals 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.770
 then the further semi-final game 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.690
 third place is explained by 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.940
 even again and again is drawn 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.580
 that explains also automatically find 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.740
 Final will be on two days 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.480
 split the semifinal find one 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.880
 day instead of final and play for third place 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.900
 on the same day 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.750
 Of course, you always will 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.520
 informs about the new draw over 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.930
 the current game about the 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.100
 results because you have the videos 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.620
 then yes, watch the whole thing 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.960
 of course at the ttc köpenick tippspiel 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.330
 that is the basis map again 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.210
 attracted a gate tells the full card 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.540
 10 2 goals and the better cards so 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:25.400
 Match winner or better counts for three goals 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.500
 So that's it and of course 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.600
 There will also be a scorers list 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.150

 displayed next to it and so on 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.390
 See who at the end of the scorer 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.190
 becomes 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.140
 now I just have to consider briefly whether 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.330
 I told everything else but me 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.709
 believe yes the principle should now everyone 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.870
 have become clear 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.060
