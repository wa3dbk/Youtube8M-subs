00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
dollars I don't get those I just get

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.139 
dollars I don't get those I just get
these<00:00:36.300> 50<00:00:36.690> cent<00:00:36.930> ones<00:00:37.340> because<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.640> don't<00:00:38.969> think

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
these 50 cent ones because I don't think

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.470 
these 50 cent ones because I don't think
it<00:00:39.270> makes<00:00:39.420> sense<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.840> pay<00:00:40.340> five<00:00:41.340> dollars<00:00:41.480> when

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
it makes sense to pay five dollars when

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.470 
it makes sense to pay five dollars when
that's<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:44.100> three<00:00:44.520> dollars<00:00:44.850> more<00:00:45.059> than<00:00:45.270> what

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that's like three dollars more than what

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.740 
that's like three dollars more than what
your<00:00:45.780> average<00:00:46.289> any<00:00:47.070> hand<00:00:47.309> sanitizer<00:00:47.399> costs<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
your average any hand sanitizer costs so

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660 
your average any hand sanitizer costs so
I<00:00:49.050> don't<00:00:49.440> think<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:49.770> worth<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.430> just

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
I don't think it's worth it so I just

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.869 
I don't think it's worth it so I just
get<00:00:50.850> these<00:00:51.030> 50<00:00:51.480> cent<00:00:51.690> runs<00:00:53.809> okay<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:56.219> first<00:00:56.550> I'm
