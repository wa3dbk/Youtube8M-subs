00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.500
 the mind 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.719
 Hi, I'm going to prepare a recipe that 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.150
 I 'm sure you'll love some skewers 

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:12.759
 morunos with yakisoba noodles for this 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.200
 recipe we need a packet of noodles 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.730
 magic yakisoba played may and cumin 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.300
 cayenne chilli lamb meat 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.450
 sliced sugar sherry vinegar and juice 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.070
 of lemon to start I'll prepare the 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.789
 maceration of meat 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.780
 we put a little cumin 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.190
 a chilli pepper to keep us from 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.590
 it is smoother what we can do 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.390
 is to remove a little bit the seeds that 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.770
 he has inside 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.770
 we go down a little bit 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.339
 we put a little bit of sherry vinegar 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:59.010
 to sugar that will give us a sweet touch 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.470
 and exotic also lemon juice 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.050
 the magic game around 50 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.760
 milliliters that would be 4 tablespoons now 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.440
 we add the lamb meat that already 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.860
 we have chopped it, we polished it 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:16.119
 little bit of the fat part and you have to 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.920
 use the most tender part for example 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.080
 the leg of lamb we ask the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.060
 butcher that we debone and what 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.170
 let's marinate 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.080
 a few minutes 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.260
 they spent the 30 minutes or so we go 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.990
 to make the skewers 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.910
 skewering every bit of the lamb and 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.130
 One thing you can also do is go 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.620
 interspersing some vegetables like 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.159
 pepper onion 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.289
 and so on until all the meat is finished 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.810
 to make recipes we have heated 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.310
 previously a pan and if you are at 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.069
 outdoors you know what can be done 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.640
 also a barbecue first we put a 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.640
 trickle of oil 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.150
 and the famous afternoon I'm going to do two that 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.300
 it would be a reaction and then another trick 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.210
 is that we have reserved the juice of the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.430
 maceration and from time to time we go 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.950
 adding a little here to the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.470
 protests and salt we are not going to put 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.410
 because magical fire will no longer be provided 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.410
 that out we removed the skewers 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.470
 I'm going to prepare the first ones because only 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.560
 I'm going to heat a quarter of a liter of 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.560
 Water 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:42.150
 we open the package inside 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.150
 contains two sachets one is the sauce 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.510
 the sauce will bring us a touch 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.849
 Oriental 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.750
 what is the grace of these videos 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:58.200
 below the content of this 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.310
 about carrying the vegetables that he will give us 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.310
 also aroma 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.980
 and then when it starts to boil 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.780
 the water we add the noodles 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.269
 the total time according to the instructions 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.269
 of the package are 4 minutes 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.850
 or we are moving so that little by little 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.840
 go undoing 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.840
 6 little by little 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.330
 when those 4 minutes pass, what 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.480
 we have to see is that it has been 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.480
 absorbed all the juice it contains 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.280
 we have ready the noodles and we are going to 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.300
 plating 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.790
 to 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.319
 i 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.409
 A) Yes 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.719
 now we put the skewers and you see 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:54.709
 what an attractive dish to enjoy 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:57.769
 with friends with an oriental touch and 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:02.520
 exotic that I 'm sure you'll love it 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:05.670
 a little more final pepper comparo 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.500
 and we would have ready this safe plate 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.540
 that you will love it and remember that a 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.960
 liking with life is enjoying other 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.960
 cultures 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.510
 two
