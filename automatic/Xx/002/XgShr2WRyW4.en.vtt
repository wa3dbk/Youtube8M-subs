 he is constantly haunted by tragedy and he 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.550
 They were behind to go crazy to it 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.330

 themselves be authors of further fate in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.850
 this post-apocalyptic world 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.990
 cool now let's go gameplay in the open 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.720
 the world behind which 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.400
 avalange so famous you always so 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.820

 that she was like a living tell 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:42.930
 more about wasteland yes it is a harsh place 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:47.010
 and he fills his canister with water 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.489
 one of the remaining water sources in 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.379
 the wastelands have just powder left 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:59.070
 their labor find but allies throw and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:01.800
 dimensional will be able to help in the search I hope he 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.110
 let it through the filter as it will 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.659
 he has to do disgusting 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.189
 things here we jump into the car she 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.040
 is one of the key elements 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.570
 games and tell me how you approached the battles on 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:20.340
 cars yes this is one of the most interesting 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.340
 moments of the game we started with how u 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.890
 max take away his car he lost her 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.650
 in a battle with guys stratus and then y 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.900
 Max took literally everything 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.000
 the journey is to create such 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.560
 cars that allow max emissions 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.720
 quiet plains and there find peace by 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.689
 the road has some companions like 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.090
 so to speak garbage wasteland mechanic 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.710
 fanatic who is to all engine 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.790
 machines and other mechanics 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:56.280
 relate like flint and he finds himself 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.950
 assistants and eventually builds its 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.680
 fighting machine for its wasteland quality 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.140
 depends on the choices you made from 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.360
 your way and game style therefore 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.550
 your creation will be different from mine 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.640
 you can even compare them play 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.640
 online 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.380
 can choose something heavy sides 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.150
 in front 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.690
 but for this you will need special 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.280
 wheels and a powerful engine 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.030
 since such a machine needs a big 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.880
 power 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.680
 weakness is such a machine 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.460
 agility you can get stuck and you 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.130
 disassemble the lighter car, I chose 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.230
 good suspension it allows not good 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.780
 pass these hills and stony places 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.370
 so your masterpiece will be created 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.370
 only according to your preference 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.410
 I understood , we see a small batch and I 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.080
 I know that in the world of mad max 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.270
 very few bullets and working weapons 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.370
 will occur over the place of the car you 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:20.160
 see one of the stratus people was 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:23.130
 zagarpunyu in this haze we will see 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.360
 a lot of weapons will be mostly rough 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.820
 harpoon type batch 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.440
 he can pierce the armor kill in the department 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.920
 or get into lobovuhu 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:49.680
 and also to tear off wheels it will be similar 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:54.390
 on the rocket launcher and of course the cult 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:58.050
 otter shoe with another 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.910
 what a crazy max without a shot and we 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.550
 started from scratch and tried to add 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.660
 the maximum of what we love movies 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.020
 Mad Max 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.830
 while respecting the style of the wasteland for example 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.830
 same possession boundaries 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:30.389
 see the attacker jumped with his 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:37.770
 cars on our and generally do not care shit 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:40.800
 they or not and what do you do if 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.620
 fuck you got on the car here you 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.350
 option to knock it off from another but still possible 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.479
 shmulnut with usa oak throw off his hit 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.139
 grin or stone it all depends on 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.479
 terrain 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.910
 have seen when the enemy climbed on your car 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.300
 your friend found and hid behind 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.729
 and now he is again exactly if you 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.139
 stop then immediately begin repairing your 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:09.840
 I would have a car in real life for my mazda 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:14.970
 would prevent such exactly tell more 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.190
 modifications they now and then should not 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.350
 be serious as the battle goes on here 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.120
 not for life but for death 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.639
 but sooner or later it will be necessary to go out 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.539
 out of the car is not interested whether the mixes 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.990
 face to face and 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:34.830
 or for example boss battles or here 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:37.020
 just max against all of course there 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.599
 there is a main storyline which 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.000
 balanced website quests you can 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.650
 cross with anyone you can catch 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.650
 someone and fill the scoreboard 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.260
 sounds fun 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:55.710
 litter enough but as an outlet we 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.690
 We present the world of studies since 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.440
 perimeter and often kept by all sorts 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.990
 sixes 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.970
 we hope that small spy games 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.479
 with observation through binoculars you will also 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.090
 liking track escort destroy in 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.430
 sick sheep from the flock follow who you are 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.550
 you can attack and who you will not 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.550
 teeth 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.060
 what I like if you kill the carrier in 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.440
 left car she will remain whole sit down 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.260
 behind the wheel and head to your camp 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:36.790
 there will be an alarm because the car 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:39.940
 there will be an unidentified interesting about this 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.950
 I have never heard yet 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.420
 camp can you open the door and you 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:51.310
 you can barely face anything 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:53.640
 the suspect guards are very 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.640
 cool
