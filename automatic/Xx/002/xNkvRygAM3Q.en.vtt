important<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.750> math<00:04:41.930> controllers<00:04:42.440> but<00:04:42.620> I

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
important the math controllers but I

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.719 
important the math controllers but I
think<00:04:42.889> the<00:04:43.009> bigger<00:04:43.190> part<00:04:43.430> of<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.610> map

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
think the bigger part of the map

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.430 
think the bigger part of the map
controls<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.539> towers<00:04:44.750> about<00:04:45.169> early<00:04:45.410> i

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
controls that the towers about early i

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.540 
controls that the towers about early i
don't<00:04:45.680> feel<00:04:45.800> like<00:04:45.860> tech<00:04:46.099> isn't<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.400> was

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
don't feel like tech isn't it was

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.400 
don't feel like tech isn't it was
necessary<00:04:47.030> to<00:04:47.120> claim<00:04:47.389> those<00:04:47.599> yeah<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.289> it

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
necessary to claim those yeah and it

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.710 
necessary to claim those yeah and it
just<00:04:48.590> they<00:04:49.250> they<00:04:49.729> map<00:04:49.910> control<00:04:50.240> very<00:04:50.449> well<00:04:50.599> I

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
just they they map control very well I

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.749 
just they they map control very well I
still<00:04:50.900> think<00:04:50.960> most<00:04:51.710> important<00:04:52.069> part<00:04:52.280> of<00:04:52.430> the

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
still think most important part of the

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.400 
still think most important part of the
secret<00:04:53.060> strategy<00:04:53.630> we've<00:04:53.780> seen<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:54.020> twice<00:04:54.169> or<00:04:54.380> 3

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
secret strategy we've seen it twice or 3

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:04.730 
secret strategy we've seen it twice or 3
times<00:04:54.590> now<00:04:54.860> Chen<00:04:55.759> shadow<00:04:56.360> fiend<00:04:56.599> is
