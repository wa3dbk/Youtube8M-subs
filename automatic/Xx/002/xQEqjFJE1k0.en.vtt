00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.740 
capsule and if you slide it all the way
over<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.680> three<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.610> actually<00:01:44.759> 2p<00:01:45.659> have

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
over to three you can actually 2p have

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.420 
over to three you can actually 2p have
two<00:01:45.960> people<00:01:46.140> speaking<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.890> once<00:01:47.009> rather

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
two people speaking to it at once rather

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.490 
two people speaking to it at once rather
than<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.939> one<00:01:48.149> person<00:01:48.200> mm-hmm<00:01:49.200> which<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
than just one person mm-hmm which it

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.840 
than just one person mm-hmm which it
which<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.890> nice<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.340> able<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
which is nice to be able to have that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.760 
which is nice to be able to have that
all<00:01:51.240> built<00:01:51.479> into<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.869> microphone<00:01:52.380> because

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
all built into one microphone because

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.010 
all built into one microphone because
you<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.310> often<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.880> with<00:01:54.420> with

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
you don't often see that with with

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.539 
you don't often see that with with
professional-grade<00:01:55.530> microphones<00:01:56.159> or<00:01:56.310> even

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
professional-grade microphones or even

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
professional-grade microphones or even
on<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.939> consumer<00:01:57.210> level<00:01:57.509> ones<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.530> you

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
on the consumer level ones so like you

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.870 
on the consumer level ones so like you
just<00:01:58.829> said<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.040> basically<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.490> plug<00:01:59.790> it

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
just said you basically just plug it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.310 
just said you basically just plug it
into<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> back<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.509> microphone<00:02:00.930> here<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
into the back of a microphone here and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.550 
into the back of a microphone here and
then<00:02:01.409> plug<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.799> into<00:02:02.009> your<00:02:02.189> USB<00:02:03.290> port<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.500> your

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
then plug it into your USB port on your

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.219 
then plug it into your USB port on your
computer<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.880> converts<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> signal

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
computer and it it converts the signal

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.809 
computer and it it converts the signal
right<00:02:07.770> into<00:02:08.069> your<00:02:08.190> computer<00:02:08.520> into<00:02:08.640> your

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
right into your computer into your

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.510 
right into your computer into your
software<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.629> doing<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.899> digital

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
software so it's doing that digital

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.809 
software so it's doing that digital
signal

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
signal

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.670 
signal
version<00:02:12.090> quite<00:02:12.689> easily<00:02:12.870> quite<00:02:13.230> quickly<00:02:13.499> and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
version quite easily quite quickly and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.500 
version quite easily quite quickly and
you're<00:02:14.430> maintaining<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.299> quality

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
you're maintaining all of that quality

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.879 
you're maintaining all of that quality
so<00:02:15.840> whatever<00:02:16.109> you're<00:02:16.290> using<00:02:16.319> whether<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:16.829> a

podcasting<00:02:23.249> software<00:02:23.639> to<00:02:23.700> capture<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.090> it

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
podcasting software to capture it it

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.449 
podcasting software to capture it it
just<00:02:24.420> works<00:02:24.780> natively<00:02:25.019> as<00:02:25.499> a<00:02:25.530> USB<00:02:25.980> mic<00:02:26.159> in<00:02:26.340> your

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
just works natively as a USB mic in your

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.800 
just works natively as a USB mic in your
computer<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.120> difference<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.629> you're

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
computer the difference is you're

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.690 
computer the difference is you're
talking<00:02:28.200> into<00:02:28.409> a<00:02:28.469> high-end<00:02:28.620> unit<00:02:29.099> one<00:02:29.459> thing<00:02:29.609> I
