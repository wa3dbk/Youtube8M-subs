00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.160 

it's<00:00:55.120> really<00:00:55.329> just<00:00:55.539> so<00:00:55.659> you<00:00:55.749> can<00:00:55.870> see<00:00:55.989> what<00:00:56.109> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
but never if you work out what it is he

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.580 
but never if you work out what it is he
says<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.540> don't<00:01:09.780> matter

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.960 

that<00:01:58.940> doesn't<00:01:59.150> really<00:02:00.310> excuse<00:02:01.310> my<00:02:01.520> pitiful

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970
