00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello everyone welcome to this new 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.559
 video tutorial for the chess blog 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.349
 dotcom master set in today's video 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:12.370
 let's talk about a principle a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.830
 mathematical law 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.980
 in reference to multiplications and 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.610
 which says that the order of the factors does not 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.520
 alter the product 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.740
 if you already know how to multiply good this 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.740
 that comes to say that two by four 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.680
 8 is the same as saying 4 x 2 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.390
 8 is normally ie gives equal to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.160
 0 2 x 4 that would be 22 more 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.560
 two 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 there are eight that four times two that would be 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.440
 four plus four 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.379
 as well 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.420
 although chess and mathematics 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.650
 they have quite a relationship 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.920
 in this case in chess that law 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.710
 does not exist 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.370
 let's explain them in chess the order 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.370
 of the factors 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.070
 here will be played 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.090
 If they alter the product, the 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.530
 result 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.960
 that is, it is not the same to move first 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.659
 one piece and then another for example the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.109
 horse and then the bishop to move 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.759
 first the bishop and then the horse 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:27.250
 because we have to take into account 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.800
 the order of our plays 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.070
 let's see some positions so that 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.860
 more clear 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.729
 in this first position they play white 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.729
 and win 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.330
 if we consider everything we have 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.520
 talked about forcing plays in thousands 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.259
 previous 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.270
 we know of the companies in check the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.920
 changes direct threats 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.380
 for example in this position there is a 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.780
 very clear idea and there is a piece that calls 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.530
 the attention or two we could say that 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.740
 it would be in the king 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.570
 and the lady because they have hardly game 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.800
 with which we played that we could 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.510
 occur would be to finally make 6 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.300
 agree in such a way that we leave the 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:17.030
 King buried and the next move 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.430
 would be horse 6 checkmate 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.430
 but if we do here 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.220
 bishop h 6 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.069
 in agreement 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.609
 I could play f5 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.220
 and when we played horse efe six 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:38.300
 they would make kings of seven 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.400
 in such a way that it would be detrimental 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.740
 but if we think about these moves changing 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.750
 the order we go back 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.870
 and instead of playing first arrows 6 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.470
 let's do every 16 checks 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.620
 we would see that after king f 8 as the only 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.870
 action h 6 would be check 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.330
 The idea is the same 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.269
 but in one functional order and in the other 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.970
 in the null factors alters the product 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.610
 in chess 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.240
 let's see another position for us to go 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.240
 being clear 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.260
 in this second position normally 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.180
 they play white 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.480
 we thought a little bit to see what it is that 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.120
 it draws our attention 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.790
 and we are putting a little bit of material 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.510
 and we are buying less but the attack 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.060
 it's pretty clear 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.599
 and it 's towards the king who is in the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.100
 box 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.440
 8 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.780
 we have bent towers 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.930
 thinking about forcing plays an idea 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.100
 could be bullied we threaten 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.850
 directly a mate mate for a 7 check 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.160
 mate or tower by a 7 but what happens 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.860
 after tower to 2 which is a play 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.780
 important if it is a direct faith but not 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.100
 be more forcible that is the check is not 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.340
 would play lady by one or tower to see 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.340
 one 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.080
 we have the idea clear 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.080
 we want to give more of someone else 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.260
 let's think about changing the order in 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.030
 time to do first tower two and then 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.000
 of seven 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.360
 let's think about the seven 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.290
 king for lady an induction tower all 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.290
 hacking are covered and tower by four 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.510
 again in the plays alters the 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.760
 result 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.550
 and let's see a third position already for 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.320
 Let it be clear that this 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.870
 this mathematical bug until the and 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.330
 mathematics that refers to the 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.630
 multiplications and that chess does not 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.630
 fulfill 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:00.080
 well in this third example 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.080
 with the almost winning the mind 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.040
 things that strikes us about this 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.800
 position 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.760
 over all the kingdom is very 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.650
 centralized the black king 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.320
 of the white pieces the evening-night 1 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.979
 we really would not like to have the 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.979
 who plays right now 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.770
 here 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.920
 something simple taking advantage of the 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.650
 king's situation the end we look at the 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.650
 lady are all in the same column 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:42.540
 at the end how we could embrace 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:45.170
 simple doing horse c5 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.170
 plus 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.970
 the lady threatens and threatens 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:57.349
 so successful threatened at least one 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.349
 it suits me but in this situation 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.500
 Black could play me in dance 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.720
 defending the lady because he withdrew her and 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.760
 defending the bishop because from that 8 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.970
 to telling him at last that they could play 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.300
 Tower 1 maybe you will try to look 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.190
 around here but the residence 17 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.689
 we would discover the tower and everything 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:22.129
 I would be defended 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.129
 we return to the initial position 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.900
 and let's think about changing the order we 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.270
 will help with less in the film and then 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.040
 to do the first about 5 and then 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.350
 with less in bishop 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.350
 let's think about making ladies by bishop 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.240
 for the king for ladies knights and five 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.129
 and let's look 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.159
 the lady of the king 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:51.419
 and we'll eat the fairy quietly 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:51.419
 getting a piece of advantage 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.809
 two 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.020
 OK 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.570
 so that it is clear in chess is 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.419
 very important to think well in order of 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:08.919
 the plays is not the same do first 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.919
 one play and then the other 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:15.370
 that the other way around we can win the game 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:19.660
 we can lose it depending if we choose 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:23.170
 the correct order the idea is the same 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.000
 but the order of the plays is going to be what 

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:28.450
 to mark the result of the game 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.190
 Remember in chess the order of 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:34.790
 factors alters the product 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.790
 see you soon
