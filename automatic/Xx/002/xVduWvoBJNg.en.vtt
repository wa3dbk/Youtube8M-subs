00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.500
 Well, we are thinking about 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.339
 nation to make for in addition to the year more 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.639
 they are also tenth anniversary of terra id go 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.800
 like wanting to do something very 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.320
 a very important goal 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.669
 We saw in October 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.939
 the anniversary of the radio broadcast in formats was celebrated 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.909
 news of two shows in relationships and 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:27.669
 and we said then 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.339
 cruise jets or death yes luis instead of the radio 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.670
 internet and so it was Jesus jesus caldera I think that whoever will have had many 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.830
 projects per hundred 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.110
 of contents and of d 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.890
 those related to very large movie music 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.410
 but the truth is that when it comes to paying tribute as a means of 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.860
 communication 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.880
 possibly 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880
 this desire more sensitive than more repercussion 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.410
 left as the agency called them 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.409
 with a beautiful phrase for us that is 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.420
 we have a challenge 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.390
 only that more can motivate us not 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.610
 and good for the agency told us the iris project we thought it was beautiful 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.020
 From the beginning 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.070
 from point of view of production that you that are the two products very good because 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.460
 from then on, we work hand in hand with the postal agency 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.420
 it's really a special project that is to say it's a production 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.770
 that does not involve a big shoot 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.850
 without delivery many shoots 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.160
 Many shoots involve p 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.130
 e a very peculiar stance implies a 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.750
 a discipline discretion also very peculiar mut involves being 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.160
 the color reflections 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
 very awake 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.970
 the director together with the advances in the other guy that approaching them we 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.220
 we owe everyone against all 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.189
 percent 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.430
 everything was not very easy and now I realize what to do 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.200
 without spaces and has around him 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.459
 a team of people who help him at all times had agreed Internet users 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.589
 trying to unveil 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.539
 the secret is not, and besides, throughout the filming you find yourself with 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:14.669
 a lot of people 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.959
 what are you proposing to them, he hears neptune who helped to do this 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.109
 to distrust the discretion of the helicopter pilot in so many people 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.970
 that had to do with this story proclaimed sepulveda 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.620
 the doubt of if he is going to know how to keep secret what all the flying birds have done 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.709
 secret we have been very careful 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.659
 percent of whom from whom all the time was seen 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.919
 that was an action 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.159
 that was real but that could also be fictitious we did not want 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.329
 prove who that is a truth towards then 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.339
 the danger is capable from the first day we are comfortable with that 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:57.539
 it is more was what we were looking for the humor you can do it of all the things of 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:58.879
 UFOs 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.699
 our highest respect 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.849
 for our readers 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.870
 that maybe we have led them to confusion 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:12.359
 between the train the news of the berd acts next to abas that then according to karen 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.319
 on terra news and is 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.749
 I invite you to re-read everything 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.079
 and I hope that by re-reading it 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.400
 and to see the conclusion to enjoy the mood of depends antÃ³n just happen so 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.870
 well like us that to hold up I get very good vibes 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.760
 I take a lot of laughter and it's mostly the film, the people who are 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.319
 watching videos
