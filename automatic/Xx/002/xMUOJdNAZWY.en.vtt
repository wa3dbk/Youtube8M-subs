00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 Come we come make us the church targeted 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.350
 but now I get it I get 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.350
 did not get not come 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.010
 the people rather bizarre is cordial 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.680
 Welcome to another war 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.670
 challenger did not come back for a long time 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.980
 I just want to be like going in here 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.500
 red rain and then gamble 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.110
 quick challenge is today 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.430
 I'm still doing it now 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.619
 certainly already in the title I read 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.790
 allowed in the round 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.559
 quick service games do not sprint this 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.360
 means I only have to go again 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.739
 a hard challenge is love people 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.850
 she is definitely hard so i am there 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.350
 now do not just sprint on 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 Let's go if for example now 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.559
 The box is just running into the center 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.449
 and I do not and I can generally 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.059
 do not fight so well because that has 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.420
 Sprint a very big advantage then 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.850
 but I do my best 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.680
 and I try the challenge here too 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.309
 I always do it that way I do 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 really everything on the first try 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.670
 So far, all attempts are high and if I 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.930
 At the first try, create a load 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.049
 I just hold up a round like that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.020
 you know I do it always this I 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.340
 guess that's all about it and yes 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.210
 I did it all back then 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.680
 quite a struggle made at that time 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 and yes, now I had to feel like it again 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 to make more warships and me 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.650
 just can not run after that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.130
 you have to know 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.360
 if another comes now or something and so 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.330
 has me switch to the arc eib 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.520
 then at least in the disadvantage no 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.560
 chance so i have to get away from here now i 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.150
 First of all a bit of rain 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.870
 but is not as smart as I go 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.850
 had better back off because okay okay 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.770
 come after us directly okay okay 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.230
 okay that's actually the problem 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.180
 I'm fine, I'm fine with it 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.250
 but here I can not jump 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.460
 I thought something next to maybe he sees 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.460
 not me 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.560
 and of course I can with the 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.299
 Done consciously in stent you 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.859
 away ok ok ok boss zetsche 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.909
 if you still have a challenge for me 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.950
 have or so I already have 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.209
 which brought then just write me 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.560
 times in the comments and then will too 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.360
 your capital shows the change 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560
 agents themselves because i stop 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.549
 for a long time, crash challenge knows more 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.540
 and that's why I have 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.489
 me then was one myself 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.099
 thought up and for the next quick 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:30.690
 change you can then just join in 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:32.760
 or so people you just have 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.440
 no chance if you did not sprint 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.209
 That's a mega hard challenge 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.410
 that's a mega yes I would say 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.920
 we just go to the next round 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.900
 right now are on the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.620
 map and yes I do not think sprint 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.360
 Dear people, yes, I always have 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.489
 the change is in the comments and me 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.349
 then try to pass in rounds 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.030
 and this is so in this series I 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.010
 quite time then brought then have 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.599
 I had a break with the challenges 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.829
 I continued at some point 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.630
 because I was upset again or did I 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.920
 again somehow no challenges merkel 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.989
 Now I'm curious but not so 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.989
 Bad had no advantage or so 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.380
 and I took a short break again 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.940
 and now we have once again 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.220
 not then started again and thought 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.560
 that amazon back and forth and now have 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.079
 But I finally want to be here again 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.010
 on such a challenge and yes for more 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.900
 like I just said mine 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.010
 Write comments and then you will 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.220
 also appear because your 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.190
 challenge take a very nice angel 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.540
 now only one sword is missing 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.599
 maybe ten euros a box unfortunately 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.349
 not the same opponent comes that is 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.450
 mega watts 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:45.150
 if we just do not have no no 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:48.389
 find sword I must say shortly 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.130
 So clearly I have to look like it with the 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.450
 gamescom blog looks like this is in 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.090
 Processing in any case already 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.560
 starting with the cutting problem 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.700
 just did not have to finish now 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.359

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.680

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.220

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.240
 we can not fetch anyone because we 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.610

 old megane as people mega it 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.530
 maybe we can make it even in the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.390
 second round now in the second try 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.300
 but it is it will even know 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:07.970
 ok , many people are still alive 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:10.040

 Good luck here if I win 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.600
 i passed u 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.680
 I can still remember the last one 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.330
 challenge i think that was it 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.860
 the last without landlords you know how 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.810
 much that was better said yes I may 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.100
 Do not open any gestures and I have mine 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.660
 When talking about the topic in the video and 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.220
 I'll never do that again because it's distracting 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.770
 one from or I in the midst of 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.080
 deepest public then just things 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.970
 and this and that and there I have the 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.660
 won round or winter round I say 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.770
 still young and has passed then 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.390
 high and have to eat it afterwards 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.860
 noticed what your shit is actually 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.630
 because that is definitely the case 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:50.110
 What you do not do should also be one 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.110
 1 1 0 1 of the 1 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.650
 and we are not allowed to sprint 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.719
 but we are allowed to eat gold apples 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.449
 tnt use 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.490
 and who wants to fight the rococo of the sword 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.879
 that should be possible abo level 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.650
 old jayjay we have the quick change 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:20.650

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.879
