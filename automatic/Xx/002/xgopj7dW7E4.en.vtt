00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.630
 How to customize the layout to your requirements 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.910
 I would like to be able to adapt to them now 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.070
 demonstrate 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.930
 starting once with the filmstrip 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.600
 because here in the film strip you can see yes 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.630
 all photos from the currently saved 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.400
 book him now 16 photos and serves 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.369
 number of once in this case or 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.880
 Two shows how many times the picture is used 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.519
 has been 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.689
 and here you can see ok at the end 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.039
 I now have these two pictures 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.320
 no longer in use 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.519
 but I would have anyway yes 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.980
 and how do I get the now purely because 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:39.320
 just drag and drop and that 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.570
 I would like to have this picture here now 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.950
 I just put this in and this one 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.500
 picture beside it 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.510
 yes and now I am now closing 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
 a page off for the last picture 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.850
 and I just feel a new page 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.579
 1 how can I do that now and that 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.469
 here at pages with the field I can 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.480
 I want to say this page here 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.670
 Add and it will be easy 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.980
 when I added but now a 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.509
 I can now have another layout 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.330
 click for example from my 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.039
 select this layout or 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.990
 I could also down here 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.119
 change in this page as well 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.039
 dialog box come in and I say in 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.349
 In this case, I would like to have the picture 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.580
 and now i can see this photo easily 

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.140
 thereon 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.510
 if I have time numbers now 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.260
 I would like to be here directly on pages 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.990
 click numbers 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.240
 you can see how lightroom automatically 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.430
 part numbers fits when I 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.810
 change page number in position 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.780
 I would like to say okay upper corner 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.930
 bottom corner at the top of the center 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.770
 side or bottom and can do it so directly 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.810
 to adjust 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.360
 I'll leave that at the bottom now 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.610
 Corner are here in the lower area 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.979
 yes, if I have one more in the middle 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.050
 to insert page eg here 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.420
 then of course it is easy for them too 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.300
 First, I change the page layout 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.729
 in a big page and now I want to 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.260
 because behind insert pages and there can 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.180
 I now with a right click as well 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.160
 You can see and work now 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.540
 various default options and 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.790
 setting options 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.830
 I just want a page here 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.080
 Add and get the same now 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.910
 layout again on this right 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.600
 side and the rest is down 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.730
 pushed further 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.010
 I add a second page in mine 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.830
 which I say here okay to add 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.030
 maybe a lesson and now get it 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.460
 I have a blank page here 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.170
 if I insert a picture up there now 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.270
 I just want to drag it again 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.520
 and drop this picture gentleman move in 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.620
 and if I have a picture on this page 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.370
 the leather must first be inserted 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.320
 or adapt 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.170
 I'm doing this over here now 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.290
 button and say I take this now 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.550
 layout aims it so pure 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.680
 So you can see it is very very simple 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.410
 to adapt the individual pages 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.320
 if I exchange a picture here now 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.050
 I can just take it and enter 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.070
 second layout frame should go in to it 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.140
 Will be replaced 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.480
 the same way in the other direction 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.160
 if I adjust the position of wild 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.900
 I do not need to drag that far 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.280
 but only a certain 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.069
 something ahead 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.450
 and in this picture you can see that okay 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.740
 is a portrait picture there I can 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.980
 do not change that much anymore 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.610
 So before to milk and shared the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.200
 cutout 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.980
 Now I ask, also serves as another 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.040
 little bigger one 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.650
 yes so I like it quite well ok 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.370
 and if I delete a page it works 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.549
 of course, too 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.200
 I create a blank page before 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.849
 have the empty page to delete here 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.280
 this page just a right click 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.260
 on it and I say now remove page 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.030
 if I have an overview of mine now 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.670
 I want to have a book here 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.440
 view change in the miniatures 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.099
 and i can do the miniatures here once 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.769
 reduced 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.569
 now i have a better survey i 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.680
 Of course, the control panels can be left 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.420
 and hide on the right 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.120
 so that the overviews are better 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.370
 of course I can do so more 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.400
 for example, add blank pages and 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.620
 start with a white page at the beginning 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.200
 then I have the white page here and 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.060
 the legate starts now from here which 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.650
 There are other possibilities of view 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.239
 I'll click once on this page 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.760
 I can now print the sheet 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.829
 Show the left the right side 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.109
 at the same time I can also directly 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.570
 switch to the single page view 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.699
 and then, of course, in the lower one 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.139
 area on the tool bar through the 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.410
 click through different pages 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.060
 make changes position adjust 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.960
 maybe a little further 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:41.389
 lonely and so my book really like that 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:43.070
 Do not want to customize that now 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.520
 I see that I have the book very fast 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.520
 customized
