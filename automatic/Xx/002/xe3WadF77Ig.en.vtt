00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
more bottom into it not quite as bright

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.520 
more bottom into it not quite as bright
and<00:05:11.110> bitey<00:05:11.470> as<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:13.180> number<00:05:13.539> one<00:05:13.780> of<00:05:14.289> course

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
and bitey as the number one of course

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.700 
and bitey as the number one of course
with<00:05:14.889> the<00:05:15.009> knobs<00:05:15.479> tough<00:05:16.479> to<00:05:16.599> dial<00:05:16.840> up<00:05:16.990> exactly

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.309 
with the knobs tough to dial up exactly
the<00:05:17.830> same<00:05:18.120> there's<00:05:19.120> no<00:05:19.360> telling<00:05:19.780> maybe<00:05:20.229> I

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
the same there's no telling maybe I

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.960 
the same there's no telling maybe I
could<00:05:20.530> have<00:05:20.620> gotten<00:05:20.919> one<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.250> sound<00:05:21.490> like<00:05:21.699> too

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
could have gotten one to sound like too

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.059 
could have gotten one to sound like too
but<00:05:22.780> I<00:05:22.810> think<00:05:22.990> they've<00:05:23.289> changed<00:05:23.530> up<00:05:23.800> enough

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
but I think they've changed up enough

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.460 
but I think they've changed up enough
that<00:05:24.250> maybe<00:05:24.430> they'll<00:05:24.810> not<00:05:25.810> catch<00:05:26.050> quite<00:05:26.349> as

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
that maybe they'll not catch quite as

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.740 
that maybe they'll not catch quite as
much<00:05:26.620> flak<00:05:27.539> maybe<00:05:28.539> not<00:05:28.840> who<00:05:29.199> knows<00:05:29.259> dr.<00:05:30.220> z<00:05:30.750> SG
