00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:16.480
 Energy and electricity essential to our lives 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:16.480
 Electricity is transformed into heat light power etc. and is used in various situations 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:27.090
 What kind of mechanism is there? 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:32.060
 In addition, what should I take care in order to use energy safely ? 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.060
 Let's learn about familiar electronic products as an example 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.840
 Let's disassemble the fire 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:46.490
 Then there were such parts 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:52.450
 I I've been made to generate heat through the use of electrical resistance against the electric current here 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.450
 He says things that works this way and the heating element 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.660
 What is the structure of fluorescent lights 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:09.320
 There are two electrodes in the glass tube of the fluorescent lamp 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.320
 Discharge occurs between individual electrodes when current flows 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:21.659
 The gas packed in a can contains mercury , and the electrons ejected by the discharge are mercury 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:26.040
 When it hits the source, ultraviolet rays are generated 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:32.120
 The motor There are various types to other 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.120
 Induction motors are used for washing machines and fans 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.960
 Simple in structure and suitable for keeping moving for a long time 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:49.640
 For parts that require precise operation such as a disk drive reader 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.640
 Stepper motor may be used 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:03.740
 It means that electricity leaks out of the circuit when the electrical device breaks down or gets wet . 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.740
 A related accident occurs when you touch the leaked equipment 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.149
 Relationships can be life-threatening 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.149
 It is a very dangerous accident 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:22.800
 In particular, it is an electrical device that can easily get wet with water, such as a washing machine . 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:32.300
 Water has the property of conducting electricity 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:32.300
 The circuit insulated with a key across the line will also conduct electricity when the hair is wet with water . 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:46.530
 The fuse is a part that breaks the circuit to prevent an accident and works when an excessive current flows 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.530
 With current fuse 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.819
 Work when ambient temperature gets too high 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.819
 There is a thermal fuse 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:05.660
 Some fuses can be replaced by themselves, but in this case , the fuse is blown out 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.660
 It is necessary to confirm 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:21.020
 If you read the instruction manual carefully and maintain daily maintenance, you can bring out the original performance of the electrical equipment 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.990
 You can prevent a lot of accidents 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.990
 Let's keep right check and maintenance in mind
