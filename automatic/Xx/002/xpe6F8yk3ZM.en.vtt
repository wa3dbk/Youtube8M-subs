00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.020
 you have seen the snowfall that has fallen on 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.060
 madrid gives me that those above know very 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.770
 well what teams are congratulations 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.550
 meringues oinez bar del canal and this is 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.550
 to today's fix today 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.430
 we love pirate songs and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.590
 go through the one and all the buccaneers 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.150
 who try to board our ship but 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.029
 what we really like very much 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.529
 much are the black flags or if by 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.689
 that the rumor of the next glass without 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.550
 Christians has put wind in stern to 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.830
 All sail according to the latest leaks 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.470
 the next stop on the adventures of 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.000
 these murderers is the Caribbean Sea with 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.370
 a pirate adventure that drinks 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.410
 directly from the asÃ­n creep 3 and their 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.420
 missions aboard a ship the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.430
 details are scarce although it is said that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.710
 the protagonist will be connor's grandfather 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.170
 edward everything points to the unknowns 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.659
 will be resolved next Monday, the 4th of 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.449
 March maybe here in ig in Spain ' 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.309
 Stay tuned, it seems that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.620
 nathan drake has become an easy boy 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.229
 even if they have neither money nor fame, 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.049
 with any there are sony sony sony that goes 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.100
 to be the following a card game 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.440
 sony has announced that the mode 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.570
 multiplayer of uncharted 3 becomes 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.790
 in free to play available for download 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.409
 in playstation store of course I do not know 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.450
 it's about a full version of this 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.729
 modality but that is limited up 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.560
 snow on the 15th of the character moment at the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.420
 that we will stop leveling 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.759
 from here it will be necessary to drop pasta 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.409
 to continue improving though there will not be 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.960
 limitations in time if we decide 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.649
 do not loosen the grain and if we stay with 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.780
 want more 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.520
 by propping up some more money we can 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.649
 unlock the rest of contents of 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020
 uncharted 3 campaign cooperative modes 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.720
 pack of maps or the ability to play 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.399
 to the split screen what is said who does not know 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.890
 together with nathan is because they do not want 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.170
 go all of her we already knew that king man 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.579
 legends had a delay what was not 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.070
 we knew is that it seems that 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.840
 pregnant so if those from ubisoft 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.670
 they assure that there is no harm that good 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.220
 come 'the executive director of the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.470
 company has wanted to appease again 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.330
 the anger of wil fans and ensures that 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.640
 the extra time is going to be proportional to 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.280
 the quality of the game that you crave 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.959
 be the best of this console also be 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.119
 they are shuffling the features 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.540
 Social new heads and new options 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.400
 you are satisfied with these statements for 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.049
 calm the waters remember that in April 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.810
 we can enjoy a challenge mode 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.400
 online totally free in the eshop 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.440
 although the one that seems not to be very 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.480
 happy with so much delay is the mythical 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.700
 Designer Miguel Angel although the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.650
 company has denied it is rumored that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.209
 abandon ubisoft as it launches 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430
 game in September we will continue 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.920
 informing of the soap opera the question 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.410
 classic for linking heres of play or 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.940
 xbox charges a lot more meaning to 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.209
 When measuring what works best 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.739
 especially talking about crisis 3 all 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.810
 we know that when graphic engines 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.970
 is the thing the dilemma is to see who the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.800
 has bigger that's how those in 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.540
 Credit ex have been responsible for eating 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.970
 the ear to all without stopping with his cry 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.590
 engine 3 even assured that no 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.049
 game of the new generation could 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.459
 Overcome your crazy stress as yet not 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.709
 we know if it's true or not 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.930
 affirmation in ign has given us to do 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.170
 a comparison of the graphics between pc 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.060
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 obviously 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.920
 the pc is out of the game for reasons 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.560
 that are obvious to me never better said 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.660
 but what do you think who wins the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.400
 battle in the field of consoles not 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.720
 forget to leave a comment 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.190
 solines barriocanal and this has been your 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.930
 today's daily fix remember that you can 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.160
 see them all at any time in ign 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.319
 Spain and on YouTube 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.849
 and remember that if you want to get a 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.950
 everyone just have to reserve the tom 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.569
 raider in the game stores and put the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.599
 code on marca.com 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.120
 good luck my name is gretel and this is 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.439
 my brother Hansel with our work is 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.439
 more the witches and yours 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.680
 we have been pulling a little bit with the 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.569
 bow and practicing and it seems that the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.609
 things are not as easy as in hansel 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.349
 and gretel so we've had a 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.469
 expert who explains how it is done 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.819
 well the superior advantage that the 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.920
 pulley arc with respect to the arcs 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.109
 is its power we can be using 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.049
 much more power than with another type of 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.239
 bow because the pulleys will help us 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.829
 during the entire shot we do not have 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.079
 that we can do a lot of strength 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.310
 more time tensing and pointing the 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.539
 advantage that we also have in arc of 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.570
 pulleys is that we throw with viewers of 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.380
 increases with telescopic and with levels 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.660
 to see if the length really is 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.789
 vertical in the latest evolution of the shot 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.680
 with bow is keeps evolving every day 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.440
 and does not have any kind of brake on 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.169
 question of techniques neither of nor of 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.300
 legalities when using it 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.060
 we also have a trigger that 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.130
 we can use the same as an equal 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.440
 with rifle so that when we are 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.080
 targeted we will simply fire and 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.250
 we will release the arrow 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.250
 look at everything that moves 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.280
 if something I have learned in this work with 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.280
 the fans and gretel hunters of light
