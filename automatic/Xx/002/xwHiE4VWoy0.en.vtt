00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.710
 banzer march 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.430
 20 tons of relatively light armored he 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.910
 should be primarily against transfer 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.670
 weapons machine guns provide protection 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.950
 The ba thought quickly and quietly in the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.590
 to drive opponents into arming 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.410
 has a 20 millimeter cannon and that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.280
 plan g what you see up here 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.210
 Armament exclusively for 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.700
 self-defense 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.190
 he did not have a fight order that she did it 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.840
 I'm just trying to find out 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.510
 to come out of a situation- 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.650
 by firing at the enemy when 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.510
 hold it down or dazzle and with the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.490
 Mist agent litter you fired 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.110
 and take precedence over this fog 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.440
 try to get away 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.620
 a special feature the fox has to 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.900
 are his possibilities he can both 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.600
 the two front two axes 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.940
 steer together or the rear 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.640
 two axes or all four axes 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.040
 together the rear two axes 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.140
 He steers then if the backwards more expensive 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.240
 sitting in the back and exactly the same 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.550
 The facility has a bicycle on the front again 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.710
 the vehicle takes over that means he can 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.140
 forward and backward equal most 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.580
 drive the same speed and is in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.560
 a forest path, for example, turns upside down 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.690
 an opponent does not not apply yes 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.450
 Great contact but was able 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.220
 really on the spot back that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.140
 to hand over the bike and just as fast 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.140
 to get out of the situation 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.760
 then choose to drive was he was 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.770
 buoyant until the introduction of the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.480
 thermal imaging devices as we come right 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.239
 in addition he had 2 vs radios and he 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.099
 had hair vrf is the normal one 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.390
 Talk to a range of about 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:18.780
 40 kilometers and hair is a funk that 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.970
 Signals is sent to the stratosphere 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.849
 go back and go back upstairs 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.920
 go with hair radio high frequency point 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.580
 one is capable of being around the world 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.730
 spark 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.220
 So well over the 40 kilometer of 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.900
 that is when we go up to 100 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.790
 kilometer invaded the forest 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.080
 Why we are able to do this week 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.340
 to report back 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.340
 to report the educational results 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.140
 Now we turn on the engine and 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.670
 start by turning the tower where you can 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.690
 to make clear how quickly times so 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:59.370
 and turn 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:02.010
 how fast he could observe he was 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.570
 buoyant for it had to enter the front 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.900
 putting up a swallow 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.030
 that does not mean that the water is over 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.650
 in the book in the driver's compartment 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.920
 penetrates when you drive the water into it 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.630
 and while I 'm on and behind 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.520
 effect you see the propeller with those 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.250
 the commander then the vehicle 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.670
 contributed with the introduction of living with 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.860
 bild gerÃ¤tes but for hartz iv out 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.990
 with introduction we would be with device 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.390
 but that was so necessary that 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.770
 Thermal image reaches approximately minus 200 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.770
 to cool down 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.440
 the mechanism for that was so hard that 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.840
 the lynx was burdened on one side and 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.790
 the buoyancy as we just 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.769
 have just lost with 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.080
 additional equipment was then maximum 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.010
 really we will be using it now the 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.110
 driving forwards and backwards 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.540
 he will move forward in the 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.130
 drive in turn hammer and then 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.269
 take the reverse drive and 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.260
 backwards out of this situation 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.260
 drive out 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.250
 quarterly pressed assume though thomas 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.699
 the fabric is about as he would 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.440
 next to him you can not look it anymore 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.180
 he would fire this fog out and 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.620
 so he would be the enemy's view 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.000
 withdraw and bring to safety 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.069
 we'll take him forward from and now 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.380
 will steer with the two-axle steering 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:43.160
 that is with the larger turning circle around 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.490
 to make clear what is possible 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.490
 drive slowlier 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.289
 Now only the banks think in a relaxed way 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.610
 reacts the 42nd 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.810
 the depression then has a turning circle 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.620
 of twelve liters of what that is not 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.449
 much more than a normal car 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.300
 he can then act as the quickest routes 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.590
 even if you have the space and contact 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.979
 forward out of the situation again 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.979
 drive out
