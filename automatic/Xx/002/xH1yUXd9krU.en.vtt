you<00:00:23.730> over<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.300> introduce<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.930> plain

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
you over here and introduce you to plain

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.160 
you over here and introduce you to plain
Dexter<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.310> plain<00:00:26.760> Poindexter<00:00:27.480> huh<00:00:27.750> right

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
Dexter or plain Poindexter huh right

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.990 
Dexter or plain Poindexter huh right
this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:30.779> world's<00:00:31.320> fastest<00:00:32.160> industrial

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
this is the world's fastest industrial

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.380 
this is the world's fastest industrial
robot<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.320> accelerate<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:35.250> 10<00:00:35.640> G's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
robot it can accelerate at 10 G's

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.810 
robot it can accelerate at 10 G's
that<00:00:37.050> means<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.800> end<00:00:38.070> effector<00:00:38.550> will<00:00:38.670> go

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that means this end effector will go

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.840 
that means this end effector will go
from<00:00:39.059> zero<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> 280<00:00:40.410> miles<00:00:40.680> an<00:00:40.950> hour<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
from zero to 280 miles an hour in a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.830 
from zero to 280 miles an hour in a
second<00:00:42.500> this<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.710> not<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> toy<00:00:44.280> yeah<00:00:44.820> yeah<00:00:45.300> no<00:00:45.539> no

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
second this is not a toy yeah yeah no no

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
second this is not a toy yeah yeah no no
we're<00:00:46.170> not<00:00:46.200> actually<00:00:46.530> doing<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.160> -<00:00:47.460> no<00:00:47.579> we're

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
we're not actually doing that - no we're

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.090 
we're not actually doing that - no we're
not<00:00:48.030> doing<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.329> today<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.829> we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
not doing that today this is we have we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.360 
not doing that today this is we have we
have<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:53.070> wimpy

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
have you know like like really wimpy

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.580 
have you know like like really wimpy
power<00:00:53.760> supplies<00:00:54.270> attached<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.140> thing<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
power supplies attached on this thing it

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.979 
power supplies attached on this thing it
has<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.550> know<00:00:56.579> high<00:00:57.210> coefficient<00:00:57.510> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
has a you know high coefficient of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.779 
has a you know high coefficient of
lethality<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.170> had<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.620> careful<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
lethality so we had to be careful at the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.649 
lethality so we had to be careful at the
show<00:01:04.010> right<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:05.909> we're<00:01:06.060> doing<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.450> we're

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
show right so what we're doing is we're

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.060 
show right so what we're doing is we're
going<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.840> draw<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.049> picture<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.650> took<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.010> view

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
going to draw the picture we took a view

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.260 
going to draw the picture we took a view
on<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.310> show<00:01:08.580> floor<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.030> you've<00:01:09.119> probably

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
on the show floor and you've probably

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.840 
on the show floor and you've probably
all<00:01:09.570> saw<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:10.460> we<00:01:11.460> did<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:11.820> of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
all saw it out there we did a lot of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
all saw it out there we did a lot of
pictures<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.600> running<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.080> half<00:01:13.650> speed

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
pictures it's running about half speed

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.770 
pictures it's running about half speed
now<00:01:14.930> it's<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.470> made<00:01:16.650> by<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> BB<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.340> Sweden

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.359 

and<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> couple<00:01:24.960> things<00:01:25.080> about<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:26.900> we<00:01:27.900> do

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
and so a couple things about this we do

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.950 
and so a couple things about this we do
this<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.579> kind<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.030> world's<00:01:30.360> first<00:01:30.570> here

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
this is kind of a world's first here

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
this is kind of a world's first here
this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.340> first<00:01:33.920> Java<00:01:34.920> powered

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
this is the first Java powered

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.510 
this is the first Java powered
industrial<00:01:35.700> robot<00:01:36.500> right<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.100> say<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
industrial robot right so as I say that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.350 
industrial robot right so as I say that
actually<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.619> Java<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.070> actually<00:01:41.520> swinging

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
actually so so Java is actually swinging

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.990 
actually so so Java is actually swinging
the<00:01:42.509> voltage<00:01:42.840> levels<00:01:43.310> that's<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.939> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the voltage levels that's right this is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.789 
the voltage levels that's right this is
actually<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.720> folks<00:01:46.350> at<00:01:46.530> Lund<00:01:46.710> University

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
actually the folks at Lund University

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.840 
actually the folks at Lund University
who<00:01:47.490> helped<00:01:47.970> us<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.329> lot<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.610> did<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> lot

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
who helped us a lot with this did a lot

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.160 
who helped us a lot with this did a lot
of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> work<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.600> actually<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
of the work this is actually the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.929 
of the work this is actually the
feedback<00:01:52.649> control<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.549> are<00:01:53.700> actually

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
feedback control so we are actually

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.539 
feedback control so we are actually
reading<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.960> position<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.680> these<00:01:55.829> motors<00:01:56.340> up

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
reading the position of these motors up

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.870 
reading the position of these motors up
here<00:01:56.820> every<00:01:57.630> millisecond<00:01:58.759> giving<00:01:59.759> them

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
here every millisecond giving them

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.690 
here every millisecond giving them
commands<00:02:00.540> computing<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> next<00:02:01.740> position<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
commands computing the next position a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.480 
commands computing the next position a
thousand<00:02:03.509> times<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.899> second<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.189> can't

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
thousand times a second and you can't

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
thousand times a second and you can't
miss<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.180> miss<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.990> thing<00:02:07.229> will<00:02:07.380> hurt

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
miss if you miss this thing will hurt

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.770 
miss if you miss this thing will hurt
itself<00:02:07.979> it'll<00:02:08.700> hurt<00:02:08.819> James<00:02:09.179> it'll<00:02:09.509> hurt<00:02:09.629> me

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
itself it'll hurt James it'll hurt me

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.660 
itself it'll hurt James it'll hurt me
you<00:02:09.869> will<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.170> carbon-fiber<00:02:10.860> all<00:02:11.129> over<00:02:11.430> them

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
you will have carbon-fiber all over them

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.320 
you will have carbon-fiber all over them
this<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.840> really<00:02:14.230> serious<00:02:14.680> stuff<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.250> it's<00:02:16.210> an

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
this is really serious stuff and it's an

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.350 
this is really serious stuff and it's an
mo<00:02:16.600> college<00:02:17.020> right<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.590> it's<00:02:17.710> not<00:02:17.890> trivial

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
mo college right and it's not trivial

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.150 
mo college right and it's not trivial
computation<00:02:19.360> right<00:02:19.570> because<00:02:19.930> oh<00:02:20.080> because<00:02:20.620> I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
computation right because oh because I

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.890 
computation right because oh because I
mean<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.460> is<00:02:21.640> not<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:22.330> know<00:02:22.390> if<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.570> look<00:02:22.750> at

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
mean this is not you know if you look at

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.140 
mean this is not you know if you look at
the<00:02:23.020> geometry<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.710> this<00:02:23.890> thing<00:02:24.130> it's<00:02:24.760> not<00:02:24.940> like

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the geometry of this thing it's not like

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.240 
the geometry of this thing it's not like
an<00:02:25.330> elbow<00:02:25.510> elbow<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.320> shoulder<00:02:26.380> right<00:02:27.010> it's

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
an elbow elbow and shoulder right it's

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.760 
an elbow elbow and shoulder right it's
it's<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:27.910> this<00:02:28.150> weird<00:02:28.630> sort<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.410> set<00:02:29.590> of

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
it's it's this weird sort of set of

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.850 
it's it's this weird sort of set of
intersecting<00:02:30.640> triangles<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:32.440> work

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
intersecting triangles that work

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.490 
intersecting triangles that work
together<00:02:33.070> in<00:02:33.430> strange<00:02:33.730> ways<00:02:33.820> right<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.840> you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
together in strange ways right and you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.020 
together in strange ways right and you
know<00:02:35.620> what<00:02:35.740> you<00:02:35.830> have<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.130> do<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.400> make<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.610> you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
know what you have to do to make a you

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.460 
know what you have to do to make a you
know<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.360> know<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.480> straight<00:02:37.930> line<00:02:38.170> is

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
know you know a straight line is

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.440 
know you know a straight line is
probably<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.130> hardest<00:02:39.580> thing<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.880> do<00:02:40.210> with

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
probably the hardest thing to do with

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.330 
probably the hardest thing to do with
this<00:02:40.600> thing<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:41.410> called<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.770> parallel

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
this thing it's called the parallel

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.580 
this thing it's called the parallel
there's<00:02:42.670> your<00:02:42.820> picture<00:02:43.210> yeah<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.410> called

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
there's your picture yeah it's called

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.700 
there's your picture yeah it's called
the<00:02:44.680> parallel<00:02:45.010> robot<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:46.200> it's<00:02:47.200> sort<00:02:47.650> of

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
the parallel robot and it's sort of

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.310 
the parallel robot and it's sort of
state-of-the-art<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.910> industrial<00:02:49.690> robotics

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
state-of-the-art in industrial robotics

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.840 
state-of-the-art in industrial robotics
it's<00:02:50.590> it's<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:50.860> production<00:02:51.160> robot<00:02:51.670> it's

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
it's it's a production robot it's

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.850 
it's it's a production robot it's
working<00:02:52.210> all<00:02:52.330> over<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.660> world<00:02:52.860> moving

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
chocolates and croissant

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.980

around<00:02:56.350> at<00:02:56.800> really<00:02:57.160> high<00:02:57.400> speeds<00:02:57.820> yeah<00:02:58.690> if<00:02:58.870> you

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
around at really high speeds yeah if you

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.450 
around at really high speeds yeah if you
ever<00:02:59.020> get<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.470> see<00:02:59.620> one<00:02:59.770> of<00:02:59.890> these<00:02:59.980> things<00:03:00.250> in

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
ever get to see one of these things in

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.150 
ever get to see one of these things in
like<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.670> koala<00:03:01.480> Factory<00:03:01.990> it's<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.650> actually

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
like a koala Factory it's it's actually

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.890 
like a koala Factory it's it's actually
pretty<00:03:03.520> amazing<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.480> course<00:03:04.720> on

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
pretty amazing that the course on

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.540 
pretty amazing that the course on
survive<00:03:07.650> they're<00:03:08.650> accelerating<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
survive they're accelerating the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.760 
survive they're accelerating the
croissant<00:03:10.000> at<00:03:10.180> 10<00:03:10.540> G's<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.170> they<00:03:11.260> don't<00:03:11.500> fall

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
croissant at 10 G's and they don't fall

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.430 
croissant at 10 G's and they don't fall
apart<00:03:11.920> right<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:16.090> one<00:03:16.840> thing<00:03:17.020> I'd<00:03:17.140> like<00:03:17.260> to

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
apart right and one thing I'd like to

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.770 
apart right and one thing I'd like to
point<00:03:17.590> out<00:03:17.740> this<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.700> controller<00:03:19.330> that

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
point out this is this controller that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.370 
point out this is this controller that
we<00:03:19.900> built<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.530> real<00:03:20.830> time<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.640> running<00:03:22.030> on

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
we built in real time is running on

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.570 
we built in real time is running on

kind<00:03:32.800> of<00:03:32.920> right<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.580> normally<00:03:34.030> when<00:03:34.150> I've

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
kind of right so so normally when I've

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.600 
kind of right so so normally when I've
seen<00:03:34.570> controllers<00:03:35.170> for<00:03:35.410> for<00:03:36.310> things<00:03:36.520> like

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
seen controllers for for things like

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.700 
seen controllers for for things like
this<00:03:36.880> they're<00:03:37.210> you<00:03:37.840> know<00:03:37.900> about<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.290> size<00:03:38.500> of

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
this they're you know about the size of

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.820 
this they're you know about the size of
a<00:03:38.800> refrigerator<00:03:39.480> it's<00:03:40.480> it's<00:03:41.020> it's<00:03:41.380> it's

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
a refrigerator it's it's it's it's

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.070 
a refrigerator it's it's it's it's
mostly<00:03:42.070> these<00:03:42.520> these<00:03:43.240> architectures<00:03:43.900> that

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
mostly these these architectures that

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.930 
mostly these these architectures that
are<00:03:44.170> like<00:03:44.350> 20<00:03:44.740> years<00:03:44.950> old<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.400> they're<00:03:45.580> still

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
are like 20 years old that they're still

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.020 
are like 20 years old that they're still
building<00:03:46.570> right<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:48.250> we<00:03:48.370> have<00:03:48.490> another<00:03:48.760> demo

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
building right so we have another demo

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.900 
building right so we have another demo
here<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.720> really<00:03:50.500> wanted<00:03:50.740> to<00:03:50.830> use<00:03:51.040> my<00:03:51.250> hand<00:03:51.580> but

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
here I really wanted to use my hand but

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.700 
here I really wanted to use my hand but
the<00:03:52.030> lawyers<00:03:52.360> wouldn't<00:03:52.600> let<00:03:52.720> me<00:03:53.050> so<00:03:53.530> gonna

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
the lawyers wouldn't let me so gonna

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.860 
the lawyers wouldn't let me so gonna
play<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:53.950> version<00:03:54.190> of<00:03:54.430> mumbly<00:03:54.820> peg<00:03:54.850> so<00:03:55.450> mumbly

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
play a version of mumbly peg so mumbly

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.900 
play a version of mumbly peg so mumbly
peg<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.500> you<00:03:56.890> know<00:03:56.920> it's<00:03:57.310> it's<00:03:57.550> it's<00:03:57.700> the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
peg is the you know it's it's it's the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.940 
peg is the you know it's it's it's the
