when<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.429> refer<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.090> okay<00:01:21.630> now<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.560> has

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
when we refer to it okay now this has

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.639 
when we refer to it okay now this has
quite<00:01:23.039> a<00:01:23.070> long<00:01:23.579> history<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.299> oil<00:01:24.689> yes<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.530> was

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
quite a long history in oil yes it was

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.039 
quite a long history in oil yes it was
first<00:01:25.890> used<00:01:26.070> back<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> 1940s<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
first used back in the 1940s as a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.099 
first used back in the 1940s as a

corrosion inhibitor to fight lead copper

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.919 
corrosion inhibitor to fight lead copper
corrosion<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.700> found<00:01:32.999> that<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.780> also

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
corrosion but they found that it also

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.550 
corrosion but they found that it also
was<00:01:34.229> effective<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.799> an<00:01:34.920> a/d<00:01:35.039> wear<00:01:35.369> agent<00:01:35.909> so

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
was effective as an a/d wear agent so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.529 
was effective as an a/d wear agent so
back<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> late<00:01:38.429> 50s<00:01:38.700> they<00:01:39.179> started

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
back in the late 50s they started

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.480 
back in the late 50s they started
increasing<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.200> level<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.679> it<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.429> were

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
increasing the level of it so they were

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.489 
increasing the level of it so they were
about<00:01:41.789> 300<00:01:42.600> parts<00:01:42.899> per<00:01:42.990> million<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
about 300 parts per million of

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.739 
about 300 parts per million of

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:45.749 
phosphorus back in the late 50s to help

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.200 
phosphorus back in the late 50s to help
protect<00:01:45.929> against<00:01:46.439> wear<00:01:46.679> and<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.640> engines<00:01:48.060> got

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
protect against wear and as engines got

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.840 
protect against wear and as engines got
more<00:01:49.109> powerful<00:01:49.499> with<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.460> smaller

more powerful with a smaller

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.029 
more powerful with a smaller
displacement<00:01:51.149> more<00:01:52.020> stress<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.619> engine

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
displacement more stress in the engine

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.969 
displacement more stress in the engine
the<00:01:53.639> levels<00:01:54.030> went<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.200> by<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.679> time

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the levels went up so that by the time

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.450 
the levels went up so that by the time
we<00:01:56.009> got<00:01:56.249> to<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.579> 80s<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.780> were<00:01:57.899> looking<00:01:58.259> at

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
we got to the 80s we were looking at

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
we got to the 80s we were looking at
1200<00:01:59.460> 1400<00:01:59.969> parts<00:02:00.479> per<00:02:00.630> million<00:02:00.840> okay<00:02:01.380> but

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
1200 1400 parts per million okay but

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.200 
1200 1400 parts per million okay but
then<00:02:01.770> there<00:02:02.069> came<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.249> point<00:02:02.520> where<00:02:02.759> he<00:02:02.850> started

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
then there came a point where he started

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.359 
then there came a point where he started
to<00:02:03.329> cut<00:02:03.479> back<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.929> it<00:02:04.049> primarily<00:02:04.590> because<00:02:04.859> of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
to cut back on it primarily because of

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.419 
to cut back on it primarily because of
catalytic<00:02:06.149> converters<00:02:06.719> yes<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.740> phosphorus

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
catalytic converters yes the phosphorus

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.140 
catalytic converters yes the phosphorus
in<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.750> zinc<00:02:09.959> death<00:02:10.170> io<00:02:10.350> phosphate

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
in the the zinc death io phosphate

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.210 
in the the zinc death io phosphate
unfortunately<00:02:12.150> performs<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.140> phosphate<00:02:13.890> Coast

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220

coating<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.840> catalytic

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
coating in the in the catalytic

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.110 
coating in the in the catalytic
converter<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.430> reduces<00:02:17.940> the

efficiency<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.320> catalyst<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.520> we've<00:02:21.090> had

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
efficiency of the catalyst so we've had

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.700 
efficiency of the catalyst so we've had
to<00:02:21.420> cut<00:02:21.990> back<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.620> level<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.160> use

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
to cut back on the level that we use

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.400 
to cut back on the level that we use
how<00:02:23.890> much<00:02:24.130> well<00:02:25.150> baguette<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:25.720> first<00:02:26.110> started

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
how much well baguette we first started

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.070 
how much well baguette we first started
in<00:02:26.470> 92<00:02:26.830> where<00:02:27.370> we<00:02:27.490> went<00:02:27.670> down<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.150> 1,200<00:02:28.930> parts

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
in 92 where we went down to 1,200 parts

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.680 
in 92 where we went down to 1,200 parts
per<00:02:29.350> million<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:30.160> we<00:02:30.580> gradually<00:02:31.090> cut<00:02:31.450> down

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
per million and we gradually cut down

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.140 
per million and we gradually cut down
even<00:02:32.140> from<00:02:32.350> there<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:32.860> now<00:02:33.220> we're<00:02:33.490> at<00:02:33.610> 800

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
even from there so that now we're at 800

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.660 
even from there so that now we're at 800
parts<00:02:34.390> per<00:02:34.480> million<00:02:34.750> maximum<00:02:35.470> okay<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:36.430> that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
parts per million maximum okay is that

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.960 
parts per million maximum okay is that
really<00:02:37.060> an<00:02:37.180> issue<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:38.530> really<00:02:39.160> isn't<00:02:39.430> for<00:02:39.850> the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
really an issue it really isn't for the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.750 
really an issue it really isn't for the
vast<00:02:40.240> majority<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.990> vehicles<00:02:41.680> we've<00:02:42.490> done<00:02:42.730> a

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
vast majority of vehicles we've done a

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.910 
vast majority of vehicles we've done a
lot<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.210> work<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.660> show<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.140> at<00:02:44.380> these<00:02:44.620> levels

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
lot of work to show that at these levels

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.770 
lot of work to show that at these levels
you're<00:02:45.310> still<00:02:45.550> getting<00:02:45.670> good<00:02:46.030> solid<00:02:46.570> and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
you're still getting good solid and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.010 
you're still getting good solid and
ywhere<00:02:47.250> protection<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:49.060> one<00:02:49.360> area<00:02:49.690> where

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
ywhere protection the one area where

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.110 
ywhere protection the one area where
people<00:02:50.230> do<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.830> concern<00:02:51.310> are<00:02:51.610> with<00:02:51.850> flat

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
people do have concern are with flat

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.870 
people do have concern are with flat
tappet<00:02:52.420> engines<00:02:53.020> okay<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:53.950> if<00:02:54.460> somebody<00:02:54.490> has

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
tappet engines okay so if somebody has

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.590 
tappet engines okay so if somebody has
an<00:02:55.180> older<00:02:55.450> engine<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.340> problem<00:02:57.610> or<00:02:58.030> can

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
an older engine is it a problem or can

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.870 
an older engine is it a problem or can
they<00:02:58.750> buy<00:02:58.960> a<00:02:58.990> special<00:02:59.380> oil<00:02:59.740> that<00:03:00.010> has<00:03:00.220> more

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
they buy a special oil that has more

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.750 
they buy a special oil that has more
zinc<00:03:01.390> in<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.690> well<00:03:02.020> it's<00:03:02.530> not<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.920> problem<00:03:03.580> once

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
zinc in it well it's not a problem once

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.760 
zinc in it well it's not a problem once
the<00:03:03.970> engines<00:03:04.360> broken<00:03:04.600> in<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.170> big<00:03:05.350> issue<00:03:05.590> is

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
the engines broken in the big issue is

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.650 
the engines broken in the big issue is
when<00:03:06.070> they<00:03:06.220> break<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.670> engine<00:03:06.820> in<00:03:07.180> so<00:03:07.420> if

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
when they break the engine in so if

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.810 
when they break the engine in so if
they're<00:03:08.020> rebuilding<00:03:08.680> an<00:03:08.770> older<00:03:09.100> engine<00:03:09.280> they

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
they're rebuilding an older engine they

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.550 
they're rebuilding an older engine they
really<00:03:10.150> need<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.840> use<00:03:10.990> something<00:03:11.290> like<00:03:11.440> a

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
really need to use something like a

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.500 
really need to use something like a
racing<00:03:12.100> oil<00:03:12.340> where<00:03:12.670> there's<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.940> higher<00:03:13.210> level

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
racing oil where there's a higher level

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.260 
racing oil where there's a higher level
of<00:03:13.810> phosphorus<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.740> it<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.250> racing<00:03:15.670> oils<00:03:16.000> that

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
of phosphorus in it and racing oils that

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.840 
of phosphorus in it and racing oils that
they<00:03:16.390> can<00:03:16.600> still<00:03:16.900> be<00:03:17.080> at<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.590> 1200<00:03:18.370> parts<00:03:18.670> per

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
they can still be at the 1200 parts per

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.730 
they can still be at the 1200 parts per
million<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.300> get<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.780> good<00:03:20.020> break<00:03:20.260> in<00:03:20.470> on<00:03:20.590> the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
million and get a good break in on the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.980 
million and get a good break in on the
oil<00:03:20.890> on<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.460> engine<00:03:21.790> after<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.600> they're

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
oil on the engine after that they're

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.780 
oil on the engine after that they're
fine<00:03:23.230> at<00:03:23.410> running<00:03:23.650> at<00:03:23.740> the<00:03:23.860> 8th<00:03:23.950> ok<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.490> it's<00:03:24.700> a

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
fine at running at the 8th ok so it's a

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.640 
fine at running at the 8th ok so it's a
problem<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.540> isn't<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.930> problem<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.560> if

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
problem but it isn't a problem and if

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.860 
problem but it isn't a problem and if
they're<00:03:26.800> really<00:03:26.950> concerned<00:03:27.490> by<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.090> racing<00:03:28.630> oil

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
they're really concerned by a racing oil

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.720 
they're really concerned by a racing oil
and<00:03:29.200> everything's<00:03:29.830> covered<00:03:30.100> that's<00:03:30.430> right
