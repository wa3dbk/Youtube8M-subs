unveiled it is touted to be
significantly<00:00:20.460> more<00:00:20.640> powerful<00:00:20.699> than<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
significantly more powerful than the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.259 
significantly more powerful than the

will<00:00:31.560> be<00:00:31.650> able<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.890> understand<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> armor

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
will be able to understand the armor

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
will be able to understand the armor
getting<00:00:33.059> absolutely<00:00:33.420> ravaged<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> call

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
getting absolutely ravaged with a call

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.260 
getting absolutely ravaged with a call
today<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.210> yeah<00:00:36.210> anyway<00:00:37.610> new<00:00:38.610> video<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.000> just

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
today so yeah anyway new video have just

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.069 
today so yeah anyway new video have just
unveiled<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.140> Tegra<00:00:40.710> k1<00:00:41.420> k<00:00:42.420> by<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.840> way

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
unveiled the Tegra k1 k by the way

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
unveiled the Tegra k1 k by the way
stands<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.739> Kepler<00:00:44.280> which<00:00:44.550> means<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.910> course

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
stands for Kepler which means of course

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.930 
stands for Kepler which means of course
it's<00:00:45.329> based<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> Kepler<00:00:46.410> based<00:00:47.250> cuda

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
it's based on the Kepler based cuda

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.250 
it's based on the Kepler based cuda
cores<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.480> case<00:00:48.840> you're<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:48.989> too<00:00:49.230> familiar

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
cores in case you're not too familiar

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
cores in case you're not too familiar
with<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.129> means<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.670> basically

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
with what that means it's basically

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.049 
with what that means it's basically
their<00:00:51.870> latest<00:00:52.260> desktop<00:00:52.770> GPUs<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.820> now

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
their latest desktop GPUs as of now

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.950 
their latest desktop GPUs as of now
anyway<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:55.410> example<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> GTX<00:00:56.489> 780<00:00:57.030> anyway

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
anyway for example the GTX 780 anyway

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.830 
anyway for example the GTX 780 anyway
there<00:00:58.710> are<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.100> hundred<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.730> ninety<00:01:00.180> two<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
there are a hundred and ninety two of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.250 
there are a hundred and ninety two of
these<00:01:00.989> cuda<00:01:01.500> cores<00:01:01.739> which<00:01:02.520> comprise<00:01:03.260> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
these cuda cores which comprise the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.250 
these cuda cores which comprise the
Tegra<00:01:04.739> k1<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.420> does<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.600> mean<00:01:06.960> well

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
Tegra k1 so what does that mean well

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.789 
Tegra k1 so what does that mean well
firstly<00:01:08.010> they<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:09.000> direct<00:01:09.689> x<00:01:10.040> 11<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.220> open<00:01:12.060> GL

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799

the article you're looking at a GPU
horsepower<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.659> I've<00:02:03.810> wats<00:02:03.960> how<00:02:04.049> much<00:02:04.200> gflops

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
horsepower and I've wats how much gflops

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.800 
horsepower and I've wats how much gflops
it<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.189> perform<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.729> 365<00:02:06.719> which<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:08.629> 240<00:02:09.629> for

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
it can perform of 365 which is 240 for

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.500 
it can perform of 365 which is 240 for
the<00:02:09.899> xbox<00:02:10.259> 360<00:02:11.180> 365<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.480> Tegra<00:02:12.900> so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the xbox 360 365 for the Tegra so

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.420 
the xbox 360 365 for the Tegra so
basically<00:02:13.870> looking<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.500> one<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> half

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
basically looking and one and a half

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.979 
basically looking and one and a half
times<00:02:15.580> ish<00:02:16.299> more<00:02:16.840> powerful<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:19.209> CPU<00:02:19.840> is

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
times ish more powerful the CPU is

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.809 
times ish more powerful the CPU is
actually<00:02:20.290> significantly<00:02:20.620> faster<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.610> well

I'll just be completely honest for me
you<00:04:36.070> know<00:04:36.100> I've<00:04:36.610> got<00:04:36.730> to<00:04:37.000> have<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.150> large<00:04:37.420> screen

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
you know I've got to have a large screen

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.620 
you know I've got to have a large screen
I've<00:04:38.080> got<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.860> be<00:04:38.980> playing<00:04:39.280> with<00:04:39.760> super<00:04:40.480> high

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
I've got to be playing with super high

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.150 
I've got to be playing with super high
quality<00:04:40.660> graphics<00:04:41.500> and<00:04:42.160> just<00:04:42.580> just<00:04:43.210> kind<00:04:43.840> of

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
quality graphics and just just kind of

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.200 
quality graphics and just just kind of
relaxing<00:04:45.160> in<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.430> leather<00:04:45.580> chair<00:04:45.940> just

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
relaxing in the leather chair just

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.150 
relaxing in the leather chair just
relaxing<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.050> just<00:04:47.110> enjoying<00:04:47.560> them<00:04:47.800> at<00:04:47.890> large

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
relaxing and just enjoying them at large

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.730 
relaxing and just enjoying them at large
experience<00:04:48.910> so<00:04:49.150> I<00:04:49.360> don't<00:04:49.810> usually<00:04:50.020> gain<00:04:50.440> much

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
experience so I don't usually gain much

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.760 
experience so I don't usually gain much
on<00:04:51.240> mobile<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.450> mean<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:52.780> do<00:04:52.900> occasionally<00:04:53.290> on

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
on mobile I mean I do occasionally on

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.280 
on mobile I mean I do occasionally on
long<00:04:53.980> trips<00:04:54.190> but<00:04:54.550> that's<00:04:54.910> about<00:04:55.120> it<00:04:55.180> but<00:04:56.080> just

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
long trips but that's about it but just

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.930 
long trips but that's about it but just
the<00:04:56.440> fact<00:04:56.470> that<00:04:56.890> we're<00:04:57.100> getting<00:04:57.190> this<00:04:57.550> of<00:04:57.790> the

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
the fact that we're getting this of the

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.970 
the fact that we're getting this of the
performance<00:04:58.510> bodes<00:04:58.810> extremely<00:04:59.560> well<00:04:59.710> for<00:04:59.740> the

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
performance bodes extremely well for the

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.470 
performance bodes extremely well for the
future<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.520> think<00:05:00.820> that<00:05:01.030> it's<00:05:01.150> going<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.360> be

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
future and I think that it's going to be

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.170 
future and I think that it's going to be
indicative<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:02.260> just<00:05:02.590> showing<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:03.180> what

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
indicative of just showing you what

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.750 
indicative of just showing you what
we're<00:05:04.480> looking<00:05:04.810> forward<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.800> in<00:05:06.250> very
