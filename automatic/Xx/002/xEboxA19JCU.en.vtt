 protein in the diet proteins are 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.749
 the fundamental pillars of life 

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:10.390
 each cell of the human body 

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:13.630
 contains the basic structure of the 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.730
 protein is a chain of amino acids is 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.100
 necessary to consume proteins in the diet 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.280
 to help the body repair 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.320
 cells and produce new cells the 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.500
 protein is also important for the 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.199
 growth and development of children 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.420
 teenagers and pregnant women 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.460
 food sources food 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.410
 proteins are broken down into parts 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.440
 called amino acids during 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.780
 digestion the human body needs a 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.910
 large number of amino acids in quantities 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.090
 big enough to keep a good 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.160
 health amino acids are found in 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.910
 animal sources such as meats 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.399
 the milk the fish the soya soybeans and the 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.399
 eggs as well as in vegetable sources 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.260
 such as beans, legumes, 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.079
 peanut butter and some grains 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.000
 like wheat germ and quinoa 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.340
 you do not need to consume products 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.150
 animals to get all the protein 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.550
 what you need in your 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.800
 the amino acids are classified in three 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.720
 essential non-essential groups 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.570
 conditional the essential amino acids 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.480
 the body can not produce them and they must 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.640
 be provided by the food not 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.370
 it is necessary to eat them in a meal 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 the balance throughout the day is more 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.800
 important non-essential amino acids 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.050
 are produced by the body from 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.410
 the essential amino acids or in the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.150
 normal breakdown of proteins 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.550
 the conditional amino acids are 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.330
 necessary in times of illness and 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.240
 stress recommendations a good diet 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.729
 Balanced supplies proteins 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.270
 enough rare healthy people 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.950
 they need protein supplements 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.220
 vegetarians can get 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.660
 enough essential amino acids 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.660
 consuming a variety of proteins 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.610
 vegetables the amount of proteins 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.610
 recommended daily depends on your 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.580
 age and your health 2 or 3 servings of

 protein- rich foods 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.810
 will satisfy the needs 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.610
 of most adults the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.500
 following are the sizes of the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.680
 recommended serving for 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.620
 2 to 3 ounce protein of lean meat

 peanut butter or an ounce of cheese 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.470
 children and teenagers can 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.730
 need different amounts 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.950
 depending on your age 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.680
 some healthy sources of protein 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.110
 of meat include turkey or chicken without

 or walnut nuts just be careful with 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.040
 like because the nuts are rich

 Fat do not eat more than 4 eggs per week 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.260
