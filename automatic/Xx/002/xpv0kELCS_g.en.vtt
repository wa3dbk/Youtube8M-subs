00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
body and making it better I've always

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.430 
body and making it better I've always
had<00:06:10.360> kind<00:06:10.420> of<00:06:10.660> long<00:06:10.810> nails<00:06:11.020> but<00:06:11.230> they<00:06:11.320> would

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
had kind of long nails but they would

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.870 
had kind of long nails but they would
just<00:06:11.590> break<00:06:11.830> up<00:06:12.040> and<00:06:12.310> I<00:06:12.340> they<00:06:12.460> reach<00:06:12.640> a<00:06:12.730> certain

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
just break up and I they reach a certain

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.710 
just break up and I they reach a certain
point<00:06:13.030> and<00:06:13.360> now<00:06:13.720> I<00:06:13.750> have<00:06:13.960> to<00:06:14.080> file<00:06:14.260> them<00:06:14.530> I<00:06:15.720> used

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
point and now I have to file them I used

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.300 
point and now I have to file them I used
to<00:06:16.840> file<00:06:17.020> them<00:06:17.200> when<00:06:17.320> they<00:06:17.410> broke<00:06:17.650> now<00:06:17.950> I<00:06:17.980> file

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
to file them when they broke now I file

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.920 
to file them when they broke now I file
them<00:06:18.400> because<00:06:18.610> they're<00:06:18.730> too<00:06:18.760> long<00:06:19.030> so<00:06:19.510> anybody

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
them because they're too long so anybody

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.460 
them because they're too long so anybody
over<00:06:20.230> 30<00:06:20.260> I<00:06:20.650> would<00:06:20.800> recommend<00:06:21.490> you<00:06:22.240> take<00:06:22.780> stem

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
over 30 I would recommend you take stem

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.880 
over 30 I would recommend you take stem
kind<00:06:23.740> as<00:06:23.950> a<00:06:23.980> daily<00:06:24.250> supplement<00:06:25.200> because<00:06:26.200> our

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
kind as a daily supplement because our

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.040 
kind as a daily supplement because our
bodies<00:06:27.520> are<00:06:27.550> older<00:06:28.360> and<00:06:28.420> not<00:06:28.570> producing<00:06:28.750> as

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050

and<00:06:39.520> now<00:06:40.090> science<00:06:40.510> is<00:06:40.570> telling<00:06:40.780> us<00:06:40.990> that<00:06:41.260> stem

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
and now science is telling us that stem

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.340 
and now science is telling us that stem
kind<00:06:41.800> can<00:06:42.310> be<00:06:42.400> added<00:06:42.700> to<00:06:42.820> the<00:06:42.910> equation<00:06:43.150> and<00:06:43.660> to
