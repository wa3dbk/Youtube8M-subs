00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.450
 over the past few years the model range 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.460
 jaguar expand significantly and we 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.740
 managed to make it attractive for 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.800
 to a wider range of clients we 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.230
 complemented the range of sedans xfx jay 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.419
 all-wheel drive modifications while 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.960
 managed to keep intrinsically jaguar 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.069
 quality rear wheel drive car 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.619
 perhaps the most notable event 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:33.680
 In recent years, the emergence of f-type 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.270
 new sports car jaguar and reaction to it 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.670
 it was just stunning 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.330
 we decided to put all ours together 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.110
 knowledge and go further equip it 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.840
 highly efficient full system 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.320
 drive to our customers liking 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.040
 the dynamic nature of the current f-type 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.740
 balance his highway 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.870
 agility our response speed 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.550
 the main task and became the preservation 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.829
 achieved level of dynamics and 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.960
 further improvement of a number 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.550
 characteristics we wanted to achieve 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.710
 perfect road grip 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.390
 coating in any weather saving 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.700
 characteristic traits jaguar and essence 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.950
 sports car ie spirit 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.619
 sports car all the advantages of the rear 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.329
 drive perfect steering 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.579
 but the most important difference 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.240
 all-wheel drive f-type has become a system 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.429
 children in the legend life line dinamix 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.719
 she allowed us to achieve 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.389
 balanced engine performance and 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.619
 powertrain transmission systems 

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:32.630
 stability and traction control and 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.069
 using all these systems create sport 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.270
 cars true character jaguar 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.249
 thanks to our developments in the field 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.499
 program management we managed 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:44.149
 maintain the predominance of rear wheel drive and 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:45.829
 at the same time achieve better grip 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.990
 with road surface 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.909
 the fact is that the system of ideas 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.429
 provides torque over 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.679
 demanding how we call it 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.749
 Means that the front wheels spinning 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.029
 the moment is transmitted only when 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.590
 really necessary that is in 

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:01.590
 normal conditions under normal 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.600
 parameters 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.490
 they are pavement car 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.009
 will move with a drive on two wheels 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.379
 and in the end we get top-notch 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.940
 steering accuracy and all 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.220
 benefits of gorgeous 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.840
 rear wheel drive car combined with 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.160
 unique connectivity 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.140
 front wheels 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.349
 when road quality requires it 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.750
 coverage and traffic situation 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.500
 the system di di works every 200 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.430
 milliseconds 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.959
 it reads this vehicle system 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.330
 analyzes them on the basis of the received 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.160
 result changes settings providing 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.000
 perfect grip in any 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.730
 circumstances 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.959
 there are two important points first 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.060
 preventive approaches 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.010
 thanks installed in the car 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.989
 systems we can define it 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.290
 road surface and calculate 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.319
 friction coefficient in the second system 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.660
 response if while doing maneuver 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.480
 the car loses grip on 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.549
 immediately get the right information and 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.989
 based on it we read the most 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.850
 the correct course of action in 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:08.040
 prevailing circumstances in 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.319
 all-wheel drive version of characters type 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.239
 remains unchanged he has all 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.810
 the advantages of rear wheel drive 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.370
 car steering precision 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.380
 quick reaction dynamics and 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.019
 effectiveness of the course is all to him 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.880
 the only difference is that 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.769
 four-wheel drive now gives more 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.230
 driver confidence guaranteeing 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.870
 safety difficult conditions or on 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.989
 grip limit 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.400
 adding all-wheel drive system 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.829
 expanded the f-type coupe line and 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.720
 convertible seems to us that we managed 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.690
 combine the best of both worlds 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.730
 after all we created a stunning maneuverable 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.109
 practical car efficient in 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.109
 any weather on any road
