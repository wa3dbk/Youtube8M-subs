00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 Hi, how are you? 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.630
 I'm going to make the application for you 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.099
 glass film and I just passed 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.839
 in the group attack there only have one 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.820
 time, he only once told the staff that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.199
 took the group that was traveling to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.460
 Sao Paulo and wanted to buy some 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.310
 things for the device 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.420
 but as it has other priorities until 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.070
 so just buy what was more 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.150
 I need the film I have not yet 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.980
 had bought 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.470
 despite being in these days all 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.570
 my phone is without any scratches 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.340
 every day at night I check him 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.360
 wipe the screen well to check the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.879
 no scratch situation and for now 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.170
 Your side is perfect, I'm going to the first 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.559
 thing we have to do when we 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.170
 to start applying the film is 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.170
 switch off the appliance 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:59.879
 As you can see, I already gave a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:06.420
 beforehand with a cloth with a cloth with 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.909
 a company cloth of a cotton cloth 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.520
 simple and now I'll show the application 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.229
 for you 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.110
 the appliance is off what am I going to do 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.130
 Now I'm going to wrap my face around so I 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.680
 can have more access on the sides of the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.270
 apparatus and personnel 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.159
 the tips for applying a movie 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:36.540
 are two first and screen cleaning and 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:38.040
 second is the screen cleaning and take away 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 any kind of trace that may 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.710
 be on the screen because it will 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.369
 create bubbles 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.140
 so let's do the following let's open 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.570
 The material does not know for you here the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.630
 What a marvel this film is Chinese. 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.470
 comprises March 25 all 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.710
 Chinese is 33mm thick 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.630
 superior is not the cleanest 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.229
 for me it makes china look good 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.500
 so let's start opening up on what you had 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.500
 on here 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.530
 Let's open what I've had here not here. 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.310
 first will have the glass film 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.310
 inside a bag 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:30.620
 here we are going to have others here alone 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:33.170
 with the microfiber impeller first 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.190
 wall because alcohol will remove the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.870
 grease that exists on the screen because the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.930
 oiliness will not disrupt the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.370
 placement of film but oiliness 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.370
 she will she will take the brightness of the screen 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:59.450
 so we'll just go light 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:03:01.910
 to operate on the entire screen has passed that the 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.739
 put on sale is already well the paper 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.930
 after passing we will pass a cloth of 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:10.640
 microfiber simple do not need 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.320
 cleaning a million times does not need 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:20.060
 force only needs to clean properly 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.079
 ready in the chest every corner after 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.329
 the cleaning 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:29.600
 I'm going against light to mess with contracts 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:31.250
 to see if you have any 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.200
 the fact that it has no 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.840
 dirt here I'm going to do with the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.079
 part of the staff with much doubt tape 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:44.209
 durex some people have been in the 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:45.980
 internet in a very wrong way to 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.530
 put this tape during this tape 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.389
 cellophane tape applied only appreciate 11 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.380
 it does not have to be applied one million 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.030
 of times 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.540
 take a piece larger than the 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.540
 appliance 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.540
 I'll put it this way and you will Pocinho 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:19.090
 take another piece to close the whole 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:21.040
 the front of the machine that we 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.600
 You need to close soon all the part of the 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.730
 We're going to push the 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.440
 people do not run to get on the screen 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.370
 So it's no use putting half 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.070
 half because you will touch the screen 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.930
 to serving the scotch tape to take 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.410
 any dust that is by 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.590
 top not dirt the screen 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.590
 look that 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.820
 ready to be mayor, now you're going to 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.150
 I'll do it, I'll remove it and I'll 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.169
 apply the glass film to the 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.530
 on the front of the machine that any 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.960
 other 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.280
 The first tip is to remove 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.650
 waste and apply duralex after firing 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.690
 durex tape I have to keep in a corner 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.400
 and already apply the glass film 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:26.550
 The tip is to be careful with the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:31.889
 synchronization start up 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:36.350
 Let's get it out of here but it's the part where 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.350
 I'll glue on your device's screen 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:47.270
 come on let's apply the glass pen 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:59.840
 I removed it from plastic and we're going 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.840
 for public 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.449
 the pa 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.599
 personal glass film it can only 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:13.719
 make an application 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.550
 she can not put you in and removed 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:21.120
 so we have to have a lot now 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.120
 careful to make this application 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:42.319
 let's synchronize with the home button 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:42.319
 holding here just to call 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:49.679
 ready and drop here her application 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:55.469
 done alone you do not have to 

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:57.359
 to do anything we hold here at 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:07:12.839
