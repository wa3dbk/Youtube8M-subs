to get him more up with the riot shield

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.410 
to get him more up with the riot shield
I<00:00:25.359> was<00:00:26.050> practicing<00:00:26.890> that<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.339> whole<00:00:27.550> day<00:00:27.849> but

I was practicing that the whole day but

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.200 
I was practicing that the whole day but
it<00:00:28.539> didn't<00:00:28.929> work<00:00:29.109> out<00:00:29.320> really<00:00:29.679> because<00:00:30.210> well

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
it didn't work out really because well

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.300 
it didn't work out really because well
it's<00:00:31.599> really<00:00:32.020> really<00:00:32.470> hard<00:00:32.619> to<00:00:32.800> get<00:00:32.890> ammo<00:00:33.160> up

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
it's really really hard to get ammo up

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.790 
it's really really hard to get ammo up
at<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.580> riot<00:00:33.820> shield<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.540> I<00:00:34.960> managed<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.530> get

at the riot shield and I managed to get
a<00:00:35.860> 15<00:00:36.430> kills<00:00:36.760> ring<00:00:37.059> with<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.360> riot<00:00:37.570> shield<00:00:37.690> and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
you will see that most of my kills are

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.350 
you will see that most of my kills are
throwing<00:00:40.780> knife<00:00:40.960> kills<00:00:41.289> I<00:00:41.590> only<00:00:42.550> got<00:00:42.879> two

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
going to try that in the future to to

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.000 
going to try that in the future to to
get<00:00:49.539> them<00:00:49.690> more<00:00:49.930> with<00:00:50.199> the<00:00:50.289> riot<00:00:50.500> shield<00:00:50.590> but

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
then i will use the desert eagle akimbo

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.880 
then i will use the desert eagle akimbo
as<00:00:54.219> a<00:00:54.250> secondary<00:00:54.910> well<00:00:55.629> you<00:00:55.840> can<00:00:56.019> see<00:00:56.320> me<00:00:56.530> fast

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
as a secondary well you can see me fast

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.580 
as a secondary well you can see me fast
forward<00:00:57.190> warding<00:00:57.879> sometimes<00:00:58.449> because<00:00:58.899> I'm

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
forward warding sometimes because I'm

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.740 
forward warding sometimes because I'm
playing<00:00:59.980> really<00:01:00.489> really<00:01:01.059> careful<00:01:01.510> with<00:01:01.600> the

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
playing really really careful with the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.290 
playing really really careful with the
riot<00:01:01.929> shield<00:01:02.019> and<00:01:02.500> then<00:01:02.679> you<00:01:03.579> all<00:01:03.640> understand

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
riot shield and then you all understand

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.469 
riot shield and then you all understand
why<00:01:04.480> because<00:01:04.930> it's<00:01:05.080> just<00:01:05.590> so<00:01:06.310> hard<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.299> get

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
why because it's just so hard to get

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.080 
why because it's just so hard to get
ammo<00:01:07.720> up<00:01:07.869> with<00:01:08.049> it<00:01:08.140> so<00:01:08.830> don't<00:01:09.430> blame<00:01:09.610> me<00:01:09.670> for

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
ammo up with it so don't blame me for

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.260 
ammo up with it so don't blame me for
being<00:01:10.979> really<00:01:11.979> really<00:01:12.159> defensive<00:01:13.119> and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
being really really defensive and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.570 
being really really defensive and
protective<00:01:13.360> and<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.439> staying<00:01:15.130> out<00:01:15.310> of<00:01:15.340> their

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
protective and and staying out of their

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.070 
protective and and staying out of their
line<00:01:15.790> of<00:01:15.939> sight<00:01:15.970> because<00:01:16.299> when<00:01:16.930> you're

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
line of sight because when you're

sensor is a really good thing but it can
be<00:02:05.829> a<00:02:05.860> really<00:02:06.310> bad<00:02:06.520> thing<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.500> actually

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
be a really bad thing to and actually

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.120 
be a really bad thing to and actually
the<00:02:08.619> motion<00:02:09.009> sensor

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
the motion sensor

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.610 
the motion sensor
is<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.550> reason<00:02:10.970> why<00:02:11.210> evolved<00:02:11.570> I<00:02:11.750> because

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
is the reason why evolved I because

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.650 
is the reason why evolved I because
there<00:02:12.800> will<00:02:12.920> be<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.100> guy<00:02:13.490> would<00:02:13.520> assess<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.420> pro

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
there will be a guy would assess and pro

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.190 
there will be a guy would assess and pro
and<00:02:14.960> he<00:02:15.140> will<00:02:15.380> kill<00:02:15.650> me<00:02:15.710> that<00:02:16.520> was<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> sweet

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120

but in the meantime this is all I got
for<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.510> guys<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.470> still<00:02:49.070> hope<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:50.030> it

look<00:02:50.630> at<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:50.960> killed<00:02:51.440> two<00:02:51.530> guys<00:02:51.860> at<00:02:52.130> the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
look at that I killed two guys at the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.030 
look at that I killed two guys at the
same<00:02:52.280> time<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:53.990> possible<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.560> kill<00:02:54.830> two

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
same time so it is possible to kill two

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.520 
same time so it is possible to kill two
guys<00:02:55.910> when<00:02:56.210> you're<00:02:56.360> running<00:02:56.630> into<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:57.080> but

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
it's just so hard so most of time you

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.240 
it's just so hard so most of time you
just<00:03:02.540> have<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.780> say<00:03:03.140> close<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.710> your<00:03:03.800> teammates
