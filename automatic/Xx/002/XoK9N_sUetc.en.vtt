00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello welcome to this news 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.620
 educational video 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.970
 but this time it's serious so I 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.559
 speak like that because precisely I 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.210
 would like to show you how to sound 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.190
 a battery when we have only two micro 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 sometimes we have no choice we only have 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.199
 2 years very available so it's 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
 always the drummers last served 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.740
 is not it so then there I put a 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.930
 following a council to denigrate are told 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.689
 and bassist and friends I have a thousand to 1 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.320
 158 between low nothum and the crate 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.430
 clear heading to the sky in the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.980
 bass drum 1 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.870
 an imitation pg 52 so here I put 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 that two micro I made a setting 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.540
 still pretty fast I'm really 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.540
 no sound specialist 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.350
 but then you will be able to see that 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.719
 it still sounds pretty good 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.829
 so in addition as sometimes we do not have 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.539
 the choice you with rice straw 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.379
 so here are two micros straw rice 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.460
 I even have more money to buy myself 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.840
 a short ride and if you hear a 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.399
 sound background a little weird it's the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.789
 neighbor who mows the lawn but that one 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:14.000
 do not care so I will try to do 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.920
 something for you to realize the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.920
 sound you can have with all that's it
