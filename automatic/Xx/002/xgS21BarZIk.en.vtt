minecraft uses
okay<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.210> I<00:02:13.750> will<00:02:13.810> be<00:02:14.110> showing<00:02:14.320> how<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.650> use

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
okay so I will be showing how to use

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.180 
okay so I will be showing how to use
this<00:02:15.730> chart<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.670> first<00:02:19.240> about<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.650> works<00:02:20.950> as

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
this chart so first about it it works as

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.830 
this chart so first about it it works as
a<00:02:21.550> multiplication<00:02:22.060> chart<00:02:23.020> so<00:02:24.270> pretend<00:02:25.270> D<00:02:25.690> in

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
a multiplication chart so pretend D in

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.490 
a multiplication chart so pretend D in
the<00:02:25.990> Middle's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the Middle's

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.210 
the Middle's
are<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.730> babies<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.780> if<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.320> wanted<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.980> white

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
are the babies so if I wanted a white

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.330 
are the babies so if I wanted a white
baby<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.880> would<00:02:31.630> be<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.620> Plus<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:34.290> so

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
baby it would be that Plus that so

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.100 
baby it would be that Plus that so
whatever<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.520> want<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:37.060> could<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.780> could

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
to all the horses I guess um yes elder

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.490 
to all the horses I guess um yes elder
all<00:06:39.169> the<00:06:39.500> horses<00:06:39.919> and<00:06:40.540> that<00:06:41.540> will<00:06:41.810> include<00:06:42.200> the

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
all the horses and that will include the

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.030 
all the horses and that will include the
essence<00:06:43.010> of<00:06:43.250> a<00:06:43.700> dead<00:06:44.320> ducks<00:06:45.550> light<00:06:46.550> and<00:06:47.000> fire

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
essence of a dead ducks light and fire

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:54.100 
essence of a dead ducks light and fire
um<00:06:49.040> and<00:06:50.020> some<00:06:51.020> I<00:06:51.320> think<00:06:52.190> the<00:06:52.700> Pegasus<00:06:53.240> if<00:06:53.630> you

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
um and some I think the Pegasus if you

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.460 
um and some I think the Pegasus if you
if<00:06:54.350> the<00:06:54.820> survivors<00:06:55.820> but<00:06:56.630> they're<00:06:56.900> either<00:06:57.200> in

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
if the survivors but they're either in

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.520 
if the survivors but they're either in
survival<00:06:58.130> mode<00:06:58.160> for<00:06:58.970> the<00:06:59.090> Pegasus<00:06:59.660> I<00:06:59.840> think<00:07:00.350> it

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
survival mode for the Pegasus I think it

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.320 
survival mode for the Pegasus I think it
would<00:07:00.620> be<00:07:00.770> very<00:07:01.040> hard<00:07:01.460> because<00:07:01.669> yet<00:07:02.120> it

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
would be very hard because yet it

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.790 
would be very hard because yet it
includes<00:07:02.900> falling<00:07:03.470> down<00:07:03.850> up<00:07:04.850> above<00:07:05.630> high<00:07:05.960> from

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
includes falling down up above high from

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.050 
includes falling down up above high from

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
the cloud level until the ground and if

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.340 
the cloud level until the ground and if
