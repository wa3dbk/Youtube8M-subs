00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

I<00:00:00.030> can<00:00:00.299> first<00:00:00.539> get<00:00:00.690> I<00:00:00.960> don't<00:00:01.230> know<00:00:01.530> and<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:01.860> don't

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
I can first get I don't know and I don't

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.379 
I can first get I don't know and I don't
know<00:00:02.100> if<00:00:02.220> impact<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.760> word<00:00:02.970> but<00:00:03.149> I<00:00:03.210> just

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
know if impact is a word but I just

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.490 
know if impact is a word but I just
think<00:00:03.510> it's<00:00:03.689> some<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:03.810> our<00:00:03.990> positions<00:00:04.380> they

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
think it's some of our positions they

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.380 
think it's some of our positions they
may<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.950> play<00:00:05.130> so<00:00:05.190> you<00:00:05.879> know<00:00:05.970> II<00:00:06.000> was<00:00:06.299> a

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
may have to play so you know II was a

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.610 
may have to play so you know II was a
kid<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:06.629> may<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.960> plate<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.290> Anthony

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
kid that may have to plate the Anthony

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.080 
kid that may have to plate the Anthony
may<00:00:07.710> have<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.980> play<00:00:08.160> Colt<00:00:08.490> may<00:00:08.639> have<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.910> play

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
may have to play Colt may have to play

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.580 
may have to play Colt may have to play
and<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.269> think<00:00:09.510> some<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.410> byproduct

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
and I think some of that is a byproduct

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.100 
and I think some of that is a byproduct
of<00:00:11.010> obviously<00:00:11.370> their<00:00:12.210> talents<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:12.840> some<00:00:13.019> of

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
of obviously their talents but some of

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.110 
of obviously their talents but some of
it's<00:00:13.259> also<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.559> byproduct<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:15.000> have

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
it's also a byproduct of that we have

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.519 
it's also a byproduct of that we have
some<00:00:15.299> injuries<00:00:15.660> at<00:00:15.780> those<00:00:15.929> positions<00:00:16.139> and

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
some injuries at those positions and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.510 
some injuries at those positions and
there's<00:00:16.680> not<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> lot<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.070> depth<00:00:17.279> at<00:00:17.400> those

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
there's not a lot of depth at those

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.970 
there's not a lot of depth at those
positions<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.390> know<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.350> may<00:00:19.529> see<00:00:19.590> tre<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
positions so you know you may see tre a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.769 
positions so you know you may see tre a
little<00:00:20.250> bit<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.520> really<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.939> depends<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.330> how

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
little bit it really just depends on how

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.060 
little bit it really just depends on how
the<00:00:21.840> games<00:00:22.109> goes<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> Michael<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
he's got a lot of I think actually a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.529 
he's got a lot of I think actually a
couple<00:00:57.600> cousins<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.170> play<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.379> LSU<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.539> no

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
couple cousins that play for LSU so no

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
couple cousins that play for LSU so no
we<00:01:00.690> would<00:01:00.870> recruited<00:01:01.260> Darren<00:01:01.530> early<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> then

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
we would recruited Darren early and then

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.410 
we would recruited Darren early and then
he<00:01:02.219> had<00:01:02.309> committed<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.699> LSU<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.329> were

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
he had committed to LSU and they were

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.329 
he had committed to LSU and they were
recruiting<00:01:03.750> him<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:03.960> an<00:01:04.080> athlete<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
recruiting him as an athlete and then I

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.410

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
Bob Jones and wanted to know if we were

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.649 
Bob Jones and wanted to know if we were
recruiting<00:01:08.040> him<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> quarterback<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.030> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
recruiting him as a quarterback and and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.420 
recruiting him as a quarterback and and
we<00:01:09.869> were<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.409> then<00:01:10.619> Darren<00:01:10.920> came<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.310> took

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
we were and then Darren came up and took

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.950 
we were and then Darren came up and took
a<00:01:11.490> visit<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.030> then<00:01:12.240> committed<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> us<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.930> think

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
a visit and then committed to us I think

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.830 
a visit and then committed to us I think
it<00:01:13.200> was<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.950> opportunity<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.549> play

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
it was just the opportunity to play

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.670 
it was just the opportunity to play
quarterback<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.290> probably<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
quarterback here was probably the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.050 
quarterback here was probably the
overriding<00:01:17.070> factor<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.670> him<00:01:19.610> yeah<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:20.850> we

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
overriding factor for him yeah but we

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.280 
overriding factor for him yeah but we
played<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> Tennessee<00:01:21.750> was<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> biggest

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
played a Tennessee was the biggest

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.420 
played a Tennessee was the biggest
stadium<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.619> played<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.310> would

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
stadium we played and so that would

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.649 
stadium we played and so that would
probably<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> think<00:01:24.570> our

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
probably be the one that I think our

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.760 
probably be the one that I think our
players<00:01:24.840> would<00:01:25.080> go<00:01:25.170> back<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:25.680> we

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
players would go back to you know we

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.920 
players would go back to you know we
played<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.130> hundred<00:01:26.600> thousand-plus<00:01:27.600> at

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
played in a hundred thousand-plus at

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.800 
played in a hundred thousand-plus at
Tennessee<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> think<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.509> I

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
Tennessee so I think you know you I

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.090 
Tennessee so I think you know you I
don't<00:01:30.869> worry<00:01:31.170> about<00:01:31.380> our<00:01:31.500> older<00:01:31.740> guys<00:01:31.890> they've

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
don't worry about our older guys they've

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.380 
don't worry about our older guys they've
been<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.400> big<00:01:32.579> venues<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.240> played

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
been in big venues you know you played

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.670 
been in big venues you know you played
in<00:01:33.509> front<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.689> 90-something<00:01:34.350> when<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.500> played

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
in front of 90-something when we played

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.679 
in front of 90-something when we played
at<00:01:34.799> USC<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.520> mean<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> hundred<00:01:36.119> thousand<00:01:36.600> at

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
at USC I mean a hundred thousand at

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.179 
at USC I mean a hundred thousand at
Tennessee<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.500> they've<00:01:37.710> played<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.070> big

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
Tennessee so we they've played in big

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.679 
Tennessee so we they've played in big
venues<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.880> those<00:01:39.329> young<00:01:39.600> guys

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
venues it's just those young guys

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.760 
venues it's just those young guys
haven't<00:01:40.020> played<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> college<00:01:40.380> football<00:01:40.560> game

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
haven't played a college football game

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.179 
haven't played a college football game
and<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.250> really<00:01:41.729> don't<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:43.040> what<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and so you really don't know what to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.530 
and so you really don't know what to
expect<00:01:44.220> out<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.700> those<00:01:44.850> guys<00:01:45.030> because<00:01:45.299> I've

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
expect out of those guys because I've

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.230 
expect out of those guys because I've
never<00:01:45.750> seen<00:01:46.020> them<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.490> situation<00:01:47.670> and

never seen them in that situation and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.760 
never seen them in that situation and
you<00:01:48.329> hope<00:01:48.720> they<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.049> handle<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.530> some

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
you hope they can handle it but some

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.710 
you hope they can handle it but some
guys<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.000> other<00:01:51.149> guys<00:01:51.329> get<00:01:51.570> caught

them into really hot the Mushaf Ski
Center<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:16.260> was<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:18.180> seemed<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.750> was<00:02:18.870> hot

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
Center it was it seemed like it was hot

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.570 
Center it was it seemed like it was hot
I<00:02:19.050> don't<00:02:19.140> know<00:02:19.380> why<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.590> was<00:02:19.770> hot<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.250> did

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
I don't know why it was hot but it did

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.310 
I don't know why it was hot but it did
seem<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.790> little<00:02:20.880> hotter<00:02:21.150> today<00:02:21.420> obviously

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
seem a little hotter today obviously

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.960 
seem a little hotter today obviously
your<00:02:22.830> preparation<00:02:23.340> has<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.550> change<00:02:23.790> slightly

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
your preparation has to change slightly

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.160 
your preparation has to change slightly
because<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:24.600> are<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> little<00:02:24.810> bit<00:02:24.930> different

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
because there are a little bit different

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.710 
because there are a little bit different
players<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:25.770> as<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.010> said<00:02:26.070> earlier<00:02:26.610> no<00:02:27.300> LSU<00:02:27.660> is
