00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
want to do is you don't want to put your

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.370

new<00:01:12.990> shock<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.880> vise<00:01:15.170> because<00:01:16.170> when

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
new shock in the vise because when

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.499 
new shock in the vise because when
you're<00:01:16.500> pressing<00:01:16.740> down<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.670> can

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
you're pressing down on this you can

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.789 
you're pressing down on this you can
eventually<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.810> damage<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.710> you

eventually you know damage it and you

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.140 
eventually you know damage it and you
don't<00:01:22.890> want<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.159> do<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.580> brand<00:01:24.000> new

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
don't want to do that with brand new

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.120 
don't want to do that with brand new
shocks<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.750> struts<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:27.210> next<00:01:27.479> step<00:01:27.659> is

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
shocks and struts so the next step is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.249 
shocks and struts so the next step is
gonna<00:01:29.130> take<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.640> shock<00:01:30.079> excuse<00:01:31.079> me<00:01:31.200> you

don't take your shock and your strut and
put<00:01:35.040> them<00:01:35.189> back<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> new<00:01:36.240> ones

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.610 

like<00:01:41.870> so<00:01:43.750> once<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:44.870> get<00:01:44.990> those<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:45.230> there<00:01:45.530> you

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
like so once you get those on there you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:53.260 
like so once you get those on there you
take<00:01:45.770> your<00:01:46.120> your<00:01:51.130> your<00:01:52.130> top<00:01:52.430> mount<00:01:52.670> you

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
replace it back onto your new shocks

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.220 
replace it back onto your new shocks
it's<00:01:58.910> kind<00:01:59.150> of<00:01:59.210> difficult<00:01:59.420> doing<00:01:59.840> this<00:01:59.960> one

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
it's kind of difficult doing this one

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:09.230 
it's kind of difficult doing this one
hand

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.880 

the<00:02:57.960> size<00:02:58.760> socket

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.540 

just<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:05.030> bolt<00:03:05.270> down<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.680> nut<00:03:06.920> even<00:03:07.370> more

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
just to bolt down the the nut even more

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.699 
just to bolt down the the nut even more
put<00:03:08.180> some<00:03:08.330> torque<00:03:08.600> under<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:14.060> is

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
put some torque under it and that is
