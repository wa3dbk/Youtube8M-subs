00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.969
 she needs her second recipe for ruth 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.240
 biscuits yogurt and wild berries everything 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.759
 together is then layer in the bay yes 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.699
 we almost do not need anything except and 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:25.220
 myself and a few biscuits there suddenly 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.169
 Well, as always , that's such a mixture 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.300
 from him and cake what I do 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.369
 if I have virtually nothing except the usual 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.070
 in the fridge and quickly what 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.640
 need because it really flitzer 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.620
 easily and quickly provide totally rule 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.970
 take the kind of biscuits and can there 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.970
 first let out his aggression 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.260
 if you 're at brighton there of course 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.690
 a little more butter in it 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.240
 otherwise you can be so 50 percent 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.940
 butter 100 biscuits 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.850
 who comes between risk-taking now 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.110
 the most beautiful is beautiful mix like so 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.820
 a part and want you can also the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.740
 take historic cake or absolute 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.400
 that's the same as this american 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.960
 close made mistake so i got mine 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.630
 then ever changed the opponent 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.880
 post not so handful 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.020
 and usually you do it with you 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.460
 the spoon because it's easy 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.320
 can dose better so here 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.119
 a little bit squeeze you have almost 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.960
 The first layer is fabricated by that 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.180
 really right 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.590
 and that comes now while we are the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.460
 others say prepare briefly in the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.800
 fridge 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.600
 since it is characterized to for sister 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.520
 otherwise this mixes directly with 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.840
 with the yogurt I always find it 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.180
 great and a big challenge 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.830
 when you turn the fridge on and on 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.929
 So what do we do what can we do 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.940
 get it and that's just that 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.130
 and dessert, people always say that 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.119
 is the royal discipline or dare 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.819
 not many ran 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.310
 And I think this recipe shows how 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.740
 banal and simple and without much effort 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.300
 and money is really something 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.490
 nice magic can do so so we do 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.490
 now virtually only once contributed half 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:19.910
 yogurt yogurt stir this 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.470
 little honey honey I'm here 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.540
 I always go a little bit clean in each case 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.540
 mood I'm doing a bit too 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.450
 vanilla still pure zenith or cardamom 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.849
 or whatever you 're up to 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.650
 has really mood today puff cinnamon 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.180
 or more because we already have it 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.620
 soil through the speculum because of it 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.260
 I would do that here now in the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.150
 omit if I have neutral butter biscuits 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.760
 for example , then take flavor 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.650
 almost the filling again and again 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.370
 that 's the second layer already 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.370
 finished 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.090
 press the sporty jaha the 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:03:01.870
 Of course luck is still in the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:05.030
 kitchen 2 1 just for you 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.889
 and as we from the side a beautiful 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.750
 I would like to have a layer of optics 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.030
 feeling in this mass just on it 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.069
 eighth from inside to outside to tell him 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.629
 I like the middle class just like that 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.370
 about half of these stories 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.260
 Mass choice in the other half is yes 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.109
 something else but really here 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.379
 have a bit of careful work otherwise 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.829
 you glue the whole plant to the glass and 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:30.919
 that looks like some real work 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.419
 Of course I will be Czech 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.900
 the shift worked 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.939
 shift work yes so often at churches 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.040
 yes, not to go and it helps too 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.040
 the sensational your shaky hand 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.389
 that helps if said the half - 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.639
 that's all, everything can not do anything 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.680
 wonderful what is coming now comes 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.620
 fruit layer i do not love 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.449
 blueberries because so also like tk 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.669
 deep-frozen blueberries that can too 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:10.790
 be frozen and have years in the 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:12.409
 really always stock because I have the 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.870
 just great and like 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.010
 make it so smoothies or something like that and 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.870
 just really pure 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.759
 if now would want to eat very fast 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.009
 I froze a bit sugar again 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.810
 that's just not so cute and can 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.550
 then you directly right if you have it 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.949
 there is one bit left 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.940
 really great effect enjoyed 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:34.250
 Fresh for us then, looking for something like that 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.979
 blue in the distance and that she totally 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.550
 cool out and so here again 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.949
 layer on it all fruit I go 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.419
 only find the blueberry is 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.970
 Alone because of the ingredients 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.409
 a lot of antioxidants then has the 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.080
 the sun is bitter 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.989
 Sweet, that's not like that 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.879
 a blatant johannes would be for example 

00:04:55.989 --> 00:05:01.719
 that would be annoying because you would need 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:05.139
 additional sugar because otherwise and now 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:07.749
 the cream comes last the penultimate one 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.699
 shift we still have the plaintive and 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:12.179
 you already have your hand here 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.360
 behind the scenes the finished confessed 

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:18.309
 carefully fold in 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.099
 Of course you can do it now as well 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:24.189
 Just do it but you can 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.469
 but also over a spray bag the 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:28.599
 Pouch is really for me thus 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:32.050
 one of the most important kitchen utensils 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:34.829
 because you can just sweeten any sweet ones though 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.089
 can also aufpimpen every tart dish 

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:39.249
 if it gets a bit too fluid in 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:40.869
 The case is not bad if you are 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:42.729
 want to turn it into a cake then 

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:45.009
 really a little gelatine 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.089
 purely give exactly the the scrolling beautiful 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.089
 Press out 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:51.069
 that is different today and then what 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:56.319
 you are either different crowns 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:06:00.700
 or here the nice great but so perfect 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:03.130
 nice and therefore again from the beginning 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.340
 biscuits crumble press in glass 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:11.410
 yoghurt with honey on it would be behind 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:14.110
 and his talk was on top as nonsense 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:17.310
 iglu puts jÃ¶rg still sesame caramel 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.310
 win in the cream 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.490
 the beautiful layer in the bay is there 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.490
 nothing can go wrong 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.020
 because it's all about certain things 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.370
 components to layer and whether one now 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.710
 make a sixth layer on it 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.449
 or whether another layer there are 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.050
 always kind of good and if it is quite 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:40.030
 stupid is not the cause of that 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:43.169
 diabetes as fruits yogurt with chris 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.169
 and then it's okay too
