00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:05.092
 Perform the following multiplication, and express the output in scientific form 

00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:10.093
 So let's hit first and then try to get the scientific formula 

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:13.756
 Before we do this, let us remember what the scientific formula means 

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:18.494
 So that the formula is scientific, and by the way all the numbers that we have here are written in scientific form 

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:23.800
 It is written as: a × 10 raised to a certain force 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.923
 Where a greater or equal to 1 and less than 10 

00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:36.963
 If each of these numbers is greater than 1 and less than 10, both are multiplied by 10 raised to a certain force 

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:39.508
 Let us see how we can beat them 

00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:45.042
 If this equals. I will use purple 

00:00:45.103 --> 00:00:49.017
 9.1 × 10 ^ 6 

00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:51.688
 × 

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:54.938
 3.2 x 

00:00:54.938 --> 00:01:00.325
 Let me use the point, so it will be clearer 

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:09.521
 If it equals (9.1 × 10 ^ 6) 

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:20.341
 × (3.2 × 10 ^ -5) 

00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:24.799
 In the multiplication process, this comes from the bonding property 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.138
 We can remove these arches and beat this one or the other 

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.857
 Or you can reconnect them according to the exchange property 

00:01:32.857 --> 00:01:35.039
 By their content we can rearrange how many numbers we want 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.985
 What I want to rearrange is that I want to hit 9.1 b 3.2 first 

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:44.572
 Then I will hit the result with 10 x 6 x 10 -5. If I rearrange this way 

00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:46.881
 I will rearrange the phrase using the ascending order 

00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:54.658
 This is equivalent to 9.1 x 3.2 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.163
 And I will rearrange so I will solve this first 

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:09.157
 If this is 10 ^ 6 × 10 ^ -5 

00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:12.423
 The reason why this is useful is the ease of hitting it 

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:15.372
 We have the same foundation here, which is 10 

00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:19.505
 So when we find the result we collect the bases 

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:24.057
 If this part becomes 

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:30.754
 10 ^ 6-5, ie 10 ^ 1 

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:33.345
 Equal to 10 

00:02:33.345 --> 00:02:37.524
 This will hit 9.1 x 3.2 

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.150
 Let's do it here 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.818
 We have 9.1 × 3.2 

00:02:42.818 --> 00:02:46.441
 I will first ignore the decimal separators, so I have 91 × 32 

00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.600
 If 2 × 1 = 2 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.551
 2 × 9 = 18 

00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:53.407
 I put zero here, and moved to the status of dozens 

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:56.054
 I will hit everything with 30 and not 3 

00:02:56.054 --> 00:02:58.167
 That's why I put zero 

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:03.461
 If 3 × 1 = 3, then 3 × 9 = 27 

00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:12.772
 Now 2 + 0 = 2, 8 + 3 = 11, put 1 in hand 

00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:18.484
 1 + 1 = 2 and 2 + 7 = 9 

00:03:18.484 --> 00:03:20.156
 We have 2 here 

00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:23.616
 If 91 × 32 = 2912 

00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:28.980
 But in fact what we have is 91 × 32 but 9.1 × 3.2 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.788
 What I will do now is that I will prepare the houses behind the decimal point 

00:03:32.788 --> 00:03:38.802
 I have 2 

00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:42.926
 So I'll put the decimal point here 

00:03:42.926 --> 00:03:49.158
 The result is 29.12 

00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:54.080
 Perhaps you will think that we have finished this way and that this result is a scientific formula 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.379
 Where we have a multiplied number of 10 raised to a force 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:02.300
 But remember that the number in the scientific version should be greater than or equal to 1 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.436
 And less than 10 

00:04:04.436 --> 00:04:08.384
 This is not less than 10, what can we do to write the number in scientific form 

00:04:08.384 --> 00:04:15.443
 And beat him with 10 raised to a force 

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:25.366
 If 29.12 equals 2.912 × 10 

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:28.678
 Notice what you've done so go from here to here 

00:04:28.678 --> 00:04:33.601
 I moved the decimal point to the left by two places, what can I do to get it back 

00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:43.214
 I can hit 2.912 by 10 or move the decimal point to the right. I want to write this if 

00:04:43.214 --> 00:04:54.803
 2.912 × 10 = 29.12 

00:04:54.803 --> 00:04:59.514
 2.912 is the scientific version but I have to hit it with another part 

00:04:59.514 --> 00:05:00.280
 × 10 Other 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.251
 To complete this issue I have 

00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:10.997
 2.912 × 10 × 10 or 10 ^ 1 × 10 ^ 1 

00:05:10.997 --> 00:05:13.274
 What's this, well this is 10 

00:05:13.274 --> 00:05:15.590
 This part will be here 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.644
 Which is about 10 ^ 2 

00:05:17.644 --> 00:05:21.459
 If the output is 2.912 × 10 ^ 2 

00:05:21.459 --> 99:59:59.999
 We're done
