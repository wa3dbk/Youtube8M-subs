00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 all people today's two you belong to me 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.680
 umstyling a wm and she will me 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.719
 the same as the jerry and the crisis 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.540
 then umstylen me with it then 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.070
 can go public viewing and me 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.429
 I'm curious how the same now 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.429
 become 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.919
 so I will definitely be now 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.810
 as pure and I think so if 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.669
 you could not train like that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 a big one because the referee armin 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.170
 nail around the top 50 but is here on 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.440
 any case for i believe the jersey 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.640
 or what for in the green must 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 the vgh here the green and west yet 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.850
 any other cool pants right 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.979
 Sun dark posts to brighten 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 they can also give what they need 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.739
 also black because he is his close 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.629
 maybe if you push so far 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.110
 right here 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:12.270
 ok i think blazer that's one 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:15.750
 a little too much does not know easy 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.729
 tame or it is 8 3 system that is 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.570
 I think that fits well is belief 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.430
 I too pop 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.710
 that suits no future but me 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.359
 So that's why I think that's enough 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.600
 faith is and i want to show too much 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:38.460
 from fashion first future gets one 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.479
 passus make up for the fan mile wrong 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.950
 would like to go there 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 important is really sunscreen 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.909
 waterproof make-up and make-up the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.590
 not very important course 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.630
 apply sun care and if you have the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.670
 applied sun care that then fits 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.039
 just a little concealer on the t 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.030
 zone so that the redness a bit 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.639
 be laminated 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.929
 but not too much you can do that 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:01.229
 just do it with your fingers 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.959
 nothing has worked out that you have that 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.499
 whole with a skoda and also only has 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.789
 benefits because you will probably 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.979
 sweat a bit if you never beautiful 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.950
 realized 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.129
 that's why so little make-up cozy only 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.900
 just a little bit there, the kind of 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.489
 If you want to cover the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.830
 Pour fanmeile it is perhaps far 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.150
 good if you brown but it is on 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.310
 At the beginning you are still a bit pale 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.640
 that's why you can do it a bit 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.129
 help out and you distribute that 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.140
 Just take a look and just not too much 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.019
 only use such a breath that is enough 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.819
 In any case, so that your song beautiful 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.459
 come and maybe you just 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.750
 I have no small ready yours 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.760
 who recommend such a concealer here 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.500
 those who have used granden have him 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.730
 knew to use as a primer 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.900
 and then comes the eyeshadow powered 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.819
 better out and does not go that way 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.129
 fast you'll know when a goal 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.299
 I would always shoot so many 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.739
 different things but it can 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.720
 just a product for two 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.920
 used different purposes 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.870
 now she just takes it like that 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.859
 waterproof kajal and then you spread 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.440
 the outside angle shoots that takes 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.680
 a bit pure and very little in the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.849
 outside angle below this one can 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.590
 right now you just see 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.660
 through the food comes your blue 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.280
 eyes just really cool rejoicing 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.139
 either just let us in this way 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.450
 little smokie or you still can 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.299
 a lighter eyeshadow colors in 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.370
 distribute angle or simply or one 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.310
 waterproof kajal by simply times 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.160
 Here to golden then you take it like that 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.569
 open yourself and spread it out 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.500
 easy in for so this pop culture 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.030
 just as pure and then have easy 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.310
 really nice as an eyecatcher 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.410
 that's my finished picture now and me 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.840
 I'm pretty cool so I could 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.549
 Really imagine so for football or 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.200
 to go to the public viewing 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.940
 Above all , I would have two bands in front of me 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.489
 is a bit warmer and once this 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.099
 jersey or she does not cool out of me 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.569
 think he has really nice deal but 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.980
 I also thought about that 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.669
 because here as this knot make pure 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.340
 could be a little bit 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.120
 not so sporty yet 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.739
 misshapen the fall a little something 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.069
 happens when I am actually 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.900
 that's just right here the 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.030
 souvenirs am quite is now that was 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.889
 that you own the wm edition what me 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.359
 would really be interested is one 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.669
 video the car is therefore already 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.560
 with the jersey and what would 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.389
 actually so on the days so if you 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.550
 Football already works for you 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.800
 jersey and it really shares you 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.599
 yes exactly and who until now 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.699
 not before because I in fact below 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.300
 my playlist with 1 videos to it 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.770
 the wm 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.930
 and then I'll lose you one more 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.520
 video to a wm bronze made 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.919
 So ask a pretty cool wm 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.789
 answered and then I would say mgv 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.789
 off and stand
