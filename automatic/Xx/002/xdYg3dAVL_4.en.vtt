00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.759 
to my local fabric store I picked out
three<00:00:22.730> different<00:00:23.089> trims<00:00:23.569> I<00:00:23.929> started<00:00:24.470> off<00:00:24.589> with

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
three different trims I started off with

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.889 
three different trims I started off with
this<00:00:24.919> teal<00:00:25.249> fringe<00:00:25.669> then<00:00:26.359> added<00:00:26.630> in<00:00:26.720> a<00:00:26.809> little

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:26.899 
this teal fringe then added in a little

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.019 
this teal fringe then added in a little
texture<00:00:27.439> with<00:00:27.589> this<00:00:27.769> pretty<00:00:28.039> feather<00:00:28.729> trim

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
texture with this pretty feather trim

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.549 
texture with this pretty feather trim
which<00:00:29.149> feels<00:00:29.390> very<00:00:29.569> music<00:00:29.899> festival<00:00:30.319> to<00:00:30.409> me

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.530 

so<00:01:18.410> I<00:01:18.440> finished<00:01:18.650> two<00:01:19.160> layers<00:01:19.610> of<00:01:19.730> my<00:01:20.000> trim<00:01:20.330> but

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
so I finished two layers of my trim but

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.790 
so I finished two layers of my trim but
a<00:01:20.600> thing<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.870> keep<00:01:20.960> in<00:01:21.110> mind<00:01:21.350> as<00:01:21.470> you're<00:01:21.620> going

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
a thing to keep in mind as you're going

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.770 
a thing to keep in mind as you're going
is<00:01:22.040> not<00:01:22.190> to<00:01:22.370> glue<00:01:22.580> too<00:01:23.120> close<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.630> zipper

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
is not to glue too close to the zipper

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.210 
is not to glue too close to the zipper
and<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.200> want<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.410> check<00:01:24.590> periodically<00:01:25.070> to

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
and you want to check periodically to

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.800 
and you want to check periodically to
make<00:01:25.280> sure<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:25.640> your<00:01:25.790> zipper<00:01:26.150> is<00:01:26.330> still

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
make sure that your zipper is still

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.510 
make sure that your zipper is still
working<00:01:27.200> because<00:01:27.290> if<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:27.530> glue<00:01:27.740> too<00:01:28.040> closely

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
working because if you glue too closely

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.250 
working because if you glue too closely
if<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.060> glue<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.360> zipper<00:01:29.600> shut<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.050> that's

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
if you glue the zipper shut and that's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.690 
if you glue the zipper shut and that's
no<00:01:30.440> good<00:01:30.590> because<00:01:30.650> then<00:01:31.010> we<00:01:31.130> couldn't<00:01:31.370> use<00:01:31.490> our

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
no good because then we couldn't use our

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.240 
no good because then we couldn't use our
fanny<00:01:31.940> pack<00:01:32.230> so<00:01:33.230> now<00:01:33.350> we're<00:01:33.470> onto<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.740> third

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
fanny pack so now we're onto the third

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.770 
fanny pack so now we're onto the third
