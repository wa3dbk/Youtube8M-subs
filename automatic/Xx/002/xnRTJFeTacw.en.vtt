00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
looking at the water report from my

looking at the water report from my
water<00:00:48.980> board<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.180> in<00:00:50.360> fact<00:00:50.510> if<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:50.690> do<00:00:51.020> this

is<00:00:53.630> if<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:53.960> really<00:00:54.170> want<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.380> go<00:00:54.440> down<00:00:54.470> that

is if you really want to go down that
road<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:55.250> might<00:00:55.370> be<00:00:55.550> better<00:00:55.760> buying<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.600> kit<00:00:56.989> to

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
road you might be better buying a kit to

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.619 
road you might be better buying a kit to
test<00:00:58.340> your<00:00:58.610> own<00:00:59.210> water<00:00:59.540> as<00:01:00.200> it<00:01:00.469> were<00:01:01.300> these<00:01:02.300> you

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
test your own water as it were these you

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.800 
test your own water as it were these you
can<00:01:02.780> get<00:01:02.930> from<00:01:03.170> suppliers<00:01:03.590> for<00:01:04.570> yeah<00:01:05.570> what's

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
can get from suppliers for yeah what's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.129 
can get from suppliers for yeah what's
going<00:01:06.020> on<00:01:06.189> aquariums<00:01:07.189> and<00:01:07.810> where<00:01:08.810> you'll<00:01:09.049> want

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:09.139 
going on aquariums and where you'll want

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:12.940 
going on aquariums and where you'll want
to<00:01:09.259> test<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.219> water<00:01:10.369> there<00:01:11.469> so<00:01:12.469> for<00:01:12.649> me

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
to test the water there so for me

is<00:01:16.520> soft<00:01:17.299> water<00:01:17.709> so<00:01:18.709> I<00:01:18.740> don't<00:01:19.310> need<00:01:19.459> to<00:01:19.520> reduce

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:20.029 
is soft water so I don't need to reduce

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:22.660 
is soft water so I don't need to reduce
the<00:01:20.209> amount<00:01:20.389> of<00:01:20.479> carbonate<00:01:20.990> in<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:21.549> when<00:01:22.549> I'm

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
the amount of carbonate in it when I'm

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.209 
the amount of carbonate in it when I'm
making<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.299> lager<00:01:23.719> I<00:01:24.340> will<00:01:26.259> either<00:01:27.259> put<00:01:27.859> no

making a lager I will either put no
treatment<00:01:28.609> in<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:28.819> at<00:01:28.969> all<00:01:29.209> or<00:01:29.479> I<00:01:29.509> may<00:01:30.319> use<00:01:30.560> some

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
treatment in it at all or I may use some

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.029 
treatment in it at all or I may use some
lactic<00:01:31.369> acid<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:32.119> bring<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.229> pH<00:01:33.679> down

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
particular it's a very pale Marga if I'm

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.989 
particular it's a very pale Marga if I'm
making<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.549> bitter<00:01:37.789> I<00:01:38.200> will<00:01:39.200> add<00:01:39.759> every<00:01:40.759> 5

and<00:02:00.009> also<00:02:01.009> I<00:02:01.249> add<00:02:02.119> a<00:02:02.689> teaspoon<00:02:03.349> of<00:02:03.909> gypsum

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
and also I add a teaspoon of gypsum

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.959 
and also I add a teaspoon of gypsum
which<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.270> calcium<00:02:05.749> sulfate<00:02:06.969> these

which is calcium sulfate these
apparently<00:02:08.450> also<00:02:08.780> help<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.200> lower<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.770> pH<00:02:10.190> of

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
apparently also help to lower the pH of

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.610 
apparently also help to lower the pH of
the<00:02:10.640> mash

the mash

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.280

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
actually lower the pH themselves so I

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.880 
actually lower the pH themselves so I
don't<00:02:21.160> add<00:02:21.400> those<00:02:22.180> two<00:02:22.450> souls<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:23.140> it

don't add those two souls to it
if<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:24.400> making<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:25.680> stacked<00:02:26.680> excuse<00:02:27.580> me<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.900> will

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
if I'm making a stacked excuse me I will

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.809 
if I'm making a stacked excuse me I will
actually<00:02:29.170> add<00:02:29.500> some<00:02:29.799> chalk<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.340> chalk<00:02:30.580> which

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
actually add some chalk the chalk which

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.289 
actually add some chalk the chalk which
is<00:02:31.290> absent<00:02:32.290> from<00:02:32.920> my<00:02:33.099> water<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.900> very<00:02:35.080> very

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
is absent from my water it's very very

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.479 
is absent from my water it's very very
insoluble<00:02:37.299> so<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.379> won't<00:02:38.680> add<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.280> water

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
insoluble so I won't add it to the water

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.910 
insoluble so I won't add it to the water
first<00:02:39.819> I'll<00:02:40.420> actually<00:02:40.629> just<00:02:40.810> stir<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.319> in<00:02:41.530> to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
first I'll actually just stir that in to

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.690 
first I'll actually just stir that in to
the<00:02:42.040> mash<00:02:42.900> I'll<00:02:43.900> usually<00:02:44.230> add<00:02:44.650> again<00:02:45.370> one

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
the mash I'll usually add again one

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.759 
the mash I'll usually add again one
teaspoon<00:02:46.329> of<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.569> for<00:02:46.780> every<00:02:47.019> five<00:02:47.290> gallons

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
eyes you can use you can also just boil

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.440 
eyes you can use you can also just boil
the<00:03:29.230> water<00:03:29.380> for<00:03:29.739> about<00:03:29.829> half<00:03:30.160> an<00:03:30.280> hour<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.670> the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
the chalk will precipitate out and then

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.379 
the chalk will precipitate out and then
you<00:03:34.180> can<00:03:35.340> draw<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.400> water<00:03:36.639> off<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.819> top<00:03:37.120> and

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
you can draw the water off the top and

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.309 
you can draw the water off the top and
use<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.790> essentially<00:03:39.790> that's<00:03:40.319> excuse

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
use that and essentially that's excuse

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.099 
use that and essentially that's excuse
me<00:03:41.730> that's<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.940> only<00:03:43.090> treatment<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.720> I

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
me that's the only treatment that I

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.129 
me that's the only treatment that I
would<00:03:44.859> recommend<00:03:45.340> for<00:03:46.000> brewing<00:03:46.299> many<00:03:46.930> other

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
would recommend for brewing many other

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.839 
would recommend for brewing many other
people<00:03:47.380> have<00:03:47.470> got<00:03:47.590> their<00:03:47.709> own<00:03:47.859> opinions<00:03:48.609> and

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
people have got their own opinions and

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.809 
people have got their own opinions and
and<00:03:49.419> so<00:03:49.569> forth<00:03:49.900> but<00:03:50.530> that's<00:03:50.680> what<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:50.859> do<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.340> I

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
and so forth but that's what I do and I

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.239 
and so forth but that's what I do and I
