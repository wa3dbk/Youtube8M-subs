00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.779
 O 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.610
 I did not want to believe 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.990
 in the early years of the 21st century - the end of the next game can be missed ibge 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.240
 This is because in this context on our planet the team 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.530
 I think it seems to me 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.060
 Paulo 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.530
 counting is a natural or artificial process where they are produced 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.469
 rebar years 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.280
 genetically identical 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.600
 it is a type of reproduction and without its life because it does not involve exchange 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.970
 of gametes between individuals 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.780
 in 1903 the botanist Herbert Motta the Heber 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.790
 has created the term conasp 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.170
 but it became known worldwide as the cloning of the dolly sheep that 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.610
 was born on July 5, 1996 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.080
 made by the Scottish scientist piano if the hulk 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 in 2001 an Italian physician called severino antenor and had the intention of 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.790
 cut in the human 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.790
 which caused great success of the scientific society 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.310
 other scientists even announced that it had condemned the human being 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.200
 but that these facts have never been proved 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.280
 cloning is allowed refers to the provision of services 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.090
 genetically identical to the six 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.190
 the production of identical roles and living beings are themselves plant animals 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.879
 or humans 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:16.279
 in this process normally in the role of a reproductive cell is withdrawn and is 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.989
 You are receiving but no longer use 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.669
 Five months ago I said that right to you. 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.669
 behaving like an embryo giving bad 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.019
 gabriel is important to a rental mother 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.459
 the inverness a form of the pcn identical to the hori worship ministry 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.979
 that mark 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.219
 Already the councilman has been cloned 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.029
 the somatic cell used ordered a mammary gland 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:47.919
 objective of this technique is to produce stem cells for the treatment of 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.959
 diseases and organ donation for transplants 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:56.509
 This technique is the hope of many people with diseases such as 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.929
 diabetes for who are the agents 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:05.199
 this technique will overcome many prejudices and for critical meters 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.819
 the process of producing a cell is very much like cloning 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.029
 reproductive 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.509
 the cell is not implanted north 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.839
 the embryonic stem cells 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:21.429
 stop differentiating themselves in all types of tissues 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.329
 in your multifunction cabinets 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.789
 I can not even the adults 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.789
 each giving rise to the same side 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.650
 scientists have high hopes for the cure in 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.469
 diseases 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.549
 however they encountered ethical parameters 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.489
 but believe that in the future cloning started to produce organ cells 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.729
 or even internal agreements saving the lives of many people who slow down the queue 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.159
 of transplants 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.939
 I can also use the body's own cells instead of implants 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:57.889
 breast 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.799
 conan of the fat cells for example 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.739
 the cloning of human beings can solve the cases of infertility and 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.739
 to prevent children in action with genetic defects 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.969
 species of animals at risk of extinction can be condemned 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.650
 a knife could give birth 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.359
 the granting of a threatened species 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.569
 if everything goes well, the first animal of a species 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:26.780
 threatened from a domestic animal using 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.639
 cloning 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.600
 the future specimen of an endangered species of wild buffalo should 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.389
 born in november 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.729
 American scientists say that pregnancy usually takes place without 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.110
 any problems 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.919
 so if everything goes well until the end of this experience, the 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.190
 first animal threatened technology museum of the conaje 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.370
 and using 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.770
 or minimal domestic as an incubator 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.819
 the sentence is this experience was successful 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.970
 the way for the conservation and preservation of other 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:01.930
 species 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.460
 on the verge of extinction 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.410
 will be the first in a list of other endangered species 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.259
 505 senators will try to wake up 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.320
 such as a species of African antelope 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.610
 the sumatra tiger and the power of god 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.909
 this cloning technique may also recover al-sadr species 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.580
 species already extinct 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.639
 perhaps the most promising case cgd a subspecies of mountain goat 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:34.469
 to every rich Pyrenean child 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.180
 native of the Iberian peninsula 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.410
 the last issue died this year based on state news have succeeded 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.240
 preserve some classes of the animal 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.330
 advances in the technique of cloning which offer the possibility of preserving and 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.050
 propagating endangered species 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.159
 kate faces the difficulties who reproduce in captivity 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.730
 while trying to do 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.789
 the effort to recover their habitats 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.309
 so that they can be reintroduced in nature 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:11.499
 may be for example a technique employed in the case of city dor
