00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 the total is raisa because it is almost 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.589
 halloween and now I bring you a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.300
 super fun craft to know 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.250
 super super super pretty at home or 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.679
 adorning his room are some lamps 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.839
 made of balloons like that in the form of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.119
 Pumpkin for halloween are fine 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.650
 easy to do is so hilarious it 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.490
 They look great if they are going to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.490
 teach how to make them 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.650
 let's start the first thing we're going to 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.870
 need is a balloon to make it the 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.770
 pumpkin body lamp we're going 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.840
 to do ok 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.489
 here I already have a balloon ready and I'm going to 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.989
 inflate it depending on how much 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.149
 inflate is that they have devastated the 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.620
 pumpkin ok so if you want it very 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.059
 big they have to inflate the balloon a lot 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.050
 and they want him tiny he has to be 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.050
 so small ok 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.230
 it does not have to be very big with this 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.950
 size is fine she nothing else you have 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.950
 often 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.180
 We are ready to transform 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.829
 this balloon in a pumpkin lamp 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.390
 to cover our balloon what are we going to 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.100
 be in doing as a paste 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.030
 then what we are going to need is 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.910
 water and white glue and what I'm going to 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.130
 do is nothing else here in this can I'll 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.460
 to put some water he 's not 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.770
 a lot with a little bit is fine and then 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.080
 let's put three pieces of glue 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.880
 White 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.920
 in itself what we are doing is nothing 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.420
 more dilute the glue is not like 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.000
 We are so much water, we are just 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.330
 make the glue look like more 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 watery let's say and now nothing more what 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.850
 we stir well and since we have ready 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.250
 they are not raw is for now so cover 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.620
 the globe and transform it into a lamp 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.570
 ok given what I'll do is grab a 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.470
 brush and I'll grab napkin if 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.730
 orange 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.830
 if you do not have you come in orange 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.650
 they can not get them they can always 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.750
 grab napkins that are yellow or 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.970
 until napkins that are white 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.260
 because then we can paint them but 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.210
 in this case I'm going to start with the 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.890
 orange napkins I will not grab the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.080
 napkin as well as what whole and what 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.330
 I can over the globe what I'm going to do 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.730
 it's like that to break it in parts because I'm going to 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.340
 grab a little bit our paste and what 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.020
 I'm going to put here on the globe and itself 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.560
 nothing else covers not the little balloon 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.940
 a little bit and then they put it on 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.770
 napkin and then since it has over 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.770
 the napkin they put more paste 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.930
 and then we put another piece of 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.940
 napkin and so we follow you up 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.680
 cover the entire globe but as well as 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.080
 can see the first layer will be left 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.700
 very thin and if they leave it like this then it will 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.800
 will undo all the lamp you have to 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.310
 put as a 4 layers to be 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.310
 insurance 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.280
 and since they finished covering all the 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.290
 balloon reach faces and a few hours 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.850
 I would say that if you have time , leave it 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.770
 dry as well as that all night to 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.080
 that is very dry and as here not the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.680
 I will have waiting for me all night already 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.150
 I have another one here and since it is very dry 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.190
 and have already put all the layers 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.770
 because it will be more or less like them and 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.530
 it's really hard as you see and that's it 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.020
 ready and now time of the truth hour of 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.860
 burst the balloon are ready I have already 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.860
 who are my scissors and are we going to 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.860
 kill him 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.670
 and then I just swim in the balloon and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.650
 because he did not lose his form or anything because 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.900
 it was already quite dry instead if 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.400
 been fresh half would have done everything 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.320
 and now the pumpkin is ready 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.930
 so that they put the whole face to him and already 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.480
 see now without list for halloween everything 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.480
 What I do is make two triangles 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.710
 and these are going to be the eyes no matter what 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.660
 it is perfect because the pumpkins 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.240
 of halloween because they never look like that 100% 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.340
 perfect then I'm going to make another mini 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.200
 triangle here for the nose and then 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.530
 let's make the mouth that nothing else I'm going to 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.010
 do it like that and then like that to make it 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.960
 like a smile and then we put him 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.960
 well teeth 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.060
 and then nothing else is a matter of 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.340
 fill everything so that it looks like this 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.340
 super good and super complete 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.910
 ready since they are finished they will be left 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.039
 or like this a little bit I'm not that super 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.020
 cute so you can understand well the 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.289
 can have it like this without moving 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.710
 much nothing more pressure in this part of 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.720
 down here and that's going to be that the lamp 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.710
 stop much easier and you can already 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.259
 stay like this 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.870
 now to illuminate everything I'm going to use 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.520
 these beautiful mini lamps that 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.620
 they look like candles as they are real candles 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.630
 because if we used real candles then 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.009
 you can catch fire are electric the 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.800
 They can then get from 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.180
 crafts or in mercè guides or has 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.650
 well where they see that they sell like that 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.210
 many different trinkets as for 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.070
 do crafts there they can 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.490
 find and now also follow the 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.759
 they turn on and we can put them in 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.099
 use several to make it look good and not 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.660
 you know but I think it takes 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.090
 Turn off the lights so you can see clearly 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.710
 alright so that to use my 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.599
 witch superpowers because it is 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.930
 halloween and I'm going to make them go off 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.930
 lights 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.460
 super super nice truth but good that 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.249
 I already think that here it looks dark 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.499
 so I usually put the lights back 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:29.139
 and that 's how it's going to look, I think it's going 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:31.059
 to see beautiful as a lamp like that 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.469
 night beside your bed or also by 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.629
 example you can put them out of 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.099
 your house to decorate for halloween or not 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.959
 you put them in a garden if you have 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.369
 some halloween party or something and 

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:40.689
 Well, of all that I bring to you on the day of 

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:42.429
