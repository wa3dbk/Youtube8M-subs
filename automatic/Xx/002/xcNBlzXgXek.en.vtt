00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.070 
other video links but anyways I find V
sure<00:00:25.490> actually<00:00:26.490> more<00:00:27.240> simpler<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.900> haven't

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
sure actually more simpler but I haven't

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.740 
sure actually more simpler but I haven't
downloaded<00:00:28.410> anything<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.460> yet<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
downloaded anything to it yet so the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.359 
downloaded anything to it yet so the
good<00:00:30.840> thing<00:00:30.900> about<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.590> not<00:00:31.769> Chinese<00:00:32.130> so

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
good thing about this is not Chinese so

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.459 
good thing about this is not Chinese so
you<00:00:32.430> don't<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.910> install<00:00:33.329> 02<00:00:33.960> lap

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
you don't have to install 02 lap

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.729 
you don't have to install 02 lap
translator<00:00:35.340> that's<00:00:35.940> pretty<00:00:36.239> cool<00:00:36.739> I'm

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
translator that's pretty cool I'm

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.590 
translator that's pretty cool I'm
probably<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> stick<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.730> v<00:00:39.090> share<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
probably going to stick with v share and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.459 
probably going to stick with v share and
actually<00:00:39.960> take<00:00:40.200> off<00:00:40.350> 25<00:00:40.890> GPU<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:43.110> don't<00:00:43.379> know

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
actually take off 25 GPU so I don't know

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.670 
actually take off 25 GPU so I don't know
but<00:00:43.860> yeah<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> looks<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.230> so
