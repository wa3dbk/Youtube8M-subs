00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hi to all users of spaceshames are 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.529
 Doctor Wise we are here also with a new one 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.490
 video dedicated to first time beat 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.880
 a footballer's review 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.070
 crazy bale t but I decided in the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
 second time we review based 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.800
 extended the first time it was immediately 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.109
 13 last team had taken ten more 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 because he was an absurd player 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.820
 he won the games alone this ha 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.099
 of the sensational statistics all above 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.200
 all 80 with and on paper so yes 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.329
 joins the bar club which can count people 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.290
 the likes of bob habens and so on 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.329
 etc 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.840
 let's see how it behaves beginning 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.760
 as always from speed speed that is 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.809
 fantastic has a ball progression to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.050
 crazy foot looks slightly but 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.989
 just slightly slower than maybe 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.570
 some other player like biabiany or 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.480
 gardens pro however it shows more well 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 of 90 of speed this is sure 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.870
 he has good physical strength so he is me 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 often happened to go white from 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.710
 physical look for example in this 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.380
 case as it takes all the speed 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.320
 opposing defense and therefore it really is one 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.780
 car launched in progress the wagon 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.390
 armed will be very difficult to lose 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.450
 no one can fight against the ball 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.320
 because in speed it really is really 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.320
 crazy 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.020
 as for the shooting what to say 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.720
 the is practically perfect 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.860
 finalization is excellent to be 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.189
 a wing to 98 of finalization but succeeds 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.470
 I always never really finalize 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.560
 had problems with one on one 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.479
 goalkeeper you have seen various cases both with 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.159
 precision shooting is perhaps in one 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.990
 against one like before I entered almost 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.780
 slipped to score 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.820
 I always put the ball where the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.340
 so the porter could n't get there though 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.270
 look for a wing that is also capable of 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.460
 finalize the action of must be in 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.280
 your team then regarding the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.810
 power of piero the launch of the 99 pd 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.770
 maximum values and I must say though that it is 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.280
 difficult to do there is no this 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.180
 player 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.519
 if you want 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.780
 which I advise you to do the exchange 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:21.150
 wings then take it to the start of the game 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.340
 as as in this way you can do the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.590
 long shot to cross that is 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.629
 simply devastating 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.280
 in any case it is not that it is 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.989
 essential to do launch in this 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.700
 player because as we have seen how 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.769
 you are vendone variations just take 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.530
 ball welcome straight and go towards 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.299
 the opponent's goal 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.659
 the precision shot and this too 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.639
 crazy has a ball-giving effect 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:48.239
 simply great so if it is 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.980
 use as I recommend if not 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.980
 you want to pull of power to be able to withdraw 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.209
 even quietly with a round trip 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.829
 and you will score almost 99 times out of 100 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.719
 and with the time that you won't mark maybe 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.209
 the doorman or do a miracle anyway 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.379
 you will take the pole or the crossbar for 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.689
 as for dribbling too 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.280
 this very very good 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.709
 the dream of in the basic version of belle 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.419
 I didn't like it I had only tried it 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.639
 for a game because he had loaned me 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.379
 then I had a friend and not against him 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.370
 I know a lot, but I have to say that the 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.919
 liberty of the season is absurd change 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.870
 direction in a second then joining 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.949
 this speed and ball control 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.859
 at a crazy speed you understand that it is 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.780
 very difficult that he loses ball 4 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.659
 stars so you can also do ski 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.340
 with this player that khamis is 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.290
 use or sentinel which increases 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.150
 the defense and header because 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.659
 paradoxically they are the most statistics 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.609
 low of bale or of course that 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.439
 base because so much to all the statische 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.439
 above 80 so it serves no purpose 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.840
 try to increase your shooting speed 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.849
 the passage etc. and so on 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.220
 I have to use this player there from 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.290
 say it is versatile because medium-high 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.659
 of workers has good defensive values 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.609
 so if you want you could use it 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:09.629
 also as external right but in my opinion 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:11.909
 it would be a waste because it is not 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.859
 valued the two and a half million that there is 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.489
 they want to take it home on xbox 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.889
 one and 360 so I recommend or 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.990
 to use it as in this case a 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.449
 4 3 3 4 classic yes m 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.229
 between liga and liga series Portuguese liga 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.509
 bbva or a 4 3 2 1 in this case 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.090
 all liga alive we have a midfield 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.819
 which has a ball possession quality of 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.830
 fantastic passages because he knows well 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.240
 in short, today there were those you say do not forgive 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.340
 a ball that is one 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.099
 you have belen rodriguez to run on 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.949
 exteriors with diego costa that goes from tip 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.380
 who only has to sort the game with the 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.599
 its 69 the passage that is not anyway 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.220
 bad for the role he has to do because 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.750
 however it must simply stop 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.699
 ball and make a filter for the two 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.120
 external in conclusion speed and 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.500
 crazy dribbling acceleration 4 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.330
 stars writes ball match and 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.819
 pour because you want you can using 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.580
 started or outside the shot is right 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:11.560
 finally crazy of the excellent doctor i 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.240
 passes are not bad because anyway 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.030
 if you really have it you need that 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.620
 they triple or come in four 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.930
 contrast them you can also pass the 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.659
 ball more than 90 of passages then makes them 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.639
 precise hayward great is not so 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.470
 problematic since it has one 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.719
 phantom acceleration maximum speed 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.630
 and therefore even if at medium high of 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:33.909
 wordpress is not bad the only against 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.259
 are the three stars weak foot of the three 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.849
 weak piquet salt can 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.159
 organize because you are obliged to 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.500
 re-enter on the left and right that the 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.630
 right is not so trust me in every 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.240
 case is a 10 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.400
 it's probably better to take ronaldo 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.080
 neck buzzer which however costs about one 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.319
 million less credits between this 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.569
 bel is absurd if you have the credits 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.759
 take it because it is certainly worth it 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:59.259
 pain that I thank the boy who comes 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.819
 lent because without him I would not have 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.680
 never ever could review this 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:05.259
 player therefore with today concluded 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.389
 let's try to get 300 likes per bale t 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:11.159
 but I have decided and foresee crazy us 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.159
 we will soon cede to everyone
