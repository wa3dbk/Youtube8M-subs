00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
little bit of a rapey guy I would assume

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.549 
little bit of a rapey guy I would assume
and<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> end<00:01:00.539> when<00:01:00.899> he's<00:01:01.260> all<00:01:01.410> like

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and then at the end when he's all like

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.920 
and then at the end when he's all like
my<00:01:01.770> uncle<00:01:02.070> died<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> fire<00:01:02.670> hey<00:01:03.090> he<00:01:03.660> didn't

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
my uncle died in the fire hey he didn't

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
my uncle died in the fire hey he didn't
really<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.470> wasn't<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.799> oh<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.070> uncle<00:01:05.309> died

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
really see wasn't like oh my uncle died

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.950 
really see wasn't like oh my uncle died
in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> fire<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.729> normally<00:01:06.180> he<00:01:06.270> was<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
in the fire but normally he was like and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.420 
in the fire but normally he was like and
in<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> panel<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.159> he<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.369> little

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
in that panel I think he was a little

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.830 
in that panel I think he was a little
more<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> my<00:01:11.070> uncle<00:01:11.189> died<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> fire

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
more like so my uncle died in the fire

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.990 
more like so my uncle died in the fire
maybe<00:01:12.840> he<00:01:13.049> did<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.770> he's<00:01:14.340> happy<00:01:14.610> about<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
maybe he did and he's happy about that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.999 
maybe he did and he's happy about that
or<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.110> entirely<00:01:16.320> possible<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
or I think it's entirely possible I

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.200 
or I think it's entirely possible I
don't<00:01:17.159> know<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.400> would<00:01:17.490> ever<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.790> revealed

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
don't know if it would ever be revealed

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.969 
don't know if it would ever be revealed
but<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.720> entirely<00:01:18.930> possible<00:01:19.200> maybe

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
but I think it's entirely possible maybe

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.679 
but I think it's entirely possible maybe
someone<00:01:20.340> even<00:01:20.520> implied<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.330> implied

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
someone even implied not really implied

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.120 
someone even implied not really implied
I<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.560> think<00:01:22.680> there's<00:01:22.830> anything<00:01:23.009> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I don't think there's anything that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.700 
I don't think there's anything that
specifically<00:01:23.850> implies<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.530> can

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
specifically implies it but you can

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.980 
specifically implies it but you can
think<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.189> thought<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:27.060> Hospital

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
think it I thought it that Hospital

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.710 
think it I thought it that Hospital
might<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.680> straight<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.520> killed<00:01:30.060> him<00:01:30.240> like

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
might have straight up killed him like

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.690 
might have straight up killed him like
how<00:01:30.810> there's<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.079> fire<00:01:31.369> people<00:01:32.369> would<00:01:32.549> believe

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
how there's a fire people would believe

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.390 
how there's a fire people would believe
that<00:01:33.060> he<00:01:33.150> would<00:01:33.270> die<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.810> fire<00:01:34.110> fuck<00:01:34.920> off<00:01:35.070> I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that he would die in the fire fuck off I

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
time but I don't see how that could be

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.310 
time but I don't see how that could be
the<00:05:09.430> case<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.910> that<00:05:10.389> would<00:05:10.510> be<00:05:10.540> literally<00:05:10.990> the

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
the case and that would be literally the

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.960 
the case and that would be literally the
exact<00:05:11.620> same<00:05:11.800> thing<00:05:12.010> as<00:05:12.130> gain<00:05:12.310> in<00:05:12.400> Aizen<00:05:12.729> so<00:05:12.940> I

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
exact same thing as gain in Aizen so I

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.120

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
like it's supposed to be a reveal or

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.790 
like it's supposed to be a reveal or
something<00:06:07.020> that's<00:06:08.020> what<00:06:08.229> they<00:06:08.349> were<00:06:08.530> called

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
something that's what they were called

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.000 
something that's what they were called
the<00:06:08.979> whole<00:06:09.160> time<00:06:09.419> what<00:06:10.500> the<00:06:11.500> only<00:06:11.710> interesting

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
the whole time what the only interesting

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.620 
the whole time what the only interesting
part<00:06:12.220> is<00:06:12.280> that<00:06:12.340> he<00:06:12.820> kind<00:06:13.030> of<00:06:13.060> looks<00:06:13.270> more<00:06:13.479> like

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
part is that he kind of looks more like

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.960 
part is that he kind of looks more like
zangetsu<00:06:14.229> there<00:06:14.800> so<00:06:15.280> I<00:06:15.580> guess<00:06:15.789> you're

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
zangetsu there so I guess you're

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.730 
zangetsu there so I guess you're
supposed<00:06:16.180> to<00:06:16.270> be<00:06:16.330> like<00:06:16.450> ah<00:06:16.630> but<00:06:17.020> I<00:06:17.050> mean<00:06:17.380> it's

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
supposed to be like ah but I mean it's

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.620 
supposed to be like ah but I mean it's
not<00:06:18.280> a<00:06:18.340> reveal<00:06:18.669> so<00:06:20.340> okay<00:06:21.340> so<00:06:21.580> i<00:06:21.880> assume<00:06:22.300> and

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
not a reveal so okay so i assume and

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.690 
not a reveal so okay so i assume and
hope<00:06:22.660> that<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:23.740> flashback<00:06:24.099> continues<00:06:24.490> into

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
hope that the flashback continues into

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.750 
hope that the flashback continues into
next<00:06:24.729> chapter<00:06:25.210> so<00:06:25.389> we<00:06:25.539> can<00:06:25.810> see<00:06:26.200> what<00:06:27.130> changed

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
next chapter so we can see what changed

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.580 
next chapter so we can see what changed
their<00:06:28.000> minds<00:06:28.300> I<00:06:28.780> don't<00:06:29.020> really<00:06:29.110> need<00:06:29.289> to<00:06:29.410> see

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
their minds I don't really need to see

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.650 
their minds I don't really need to see
him<00:06:29.830> going<00:06:30.099> to<00:06:30.430> like<00:06:30.610> everyone<00:06:31.210> and<00:06:31.389> try<00:06:31.510> and

like recruit all this parameters and all
the<00:06:33.610> specifics<00:06:33.820> of<00:06:34.360> how<00:06:34.510> he<00:06:34.570> put<00:06:34.960> it<00:06:34.990> together

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
the specifics of how he put it together

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.600 
the specifics of how he put it together
I<00:06:35.469> don't<00:06:35.650> really<00:06:35.740> care<00:06:35.950> about<00:06:36.010> that<00:06:36.190> I<00:06:36.340> want<00:06:36.550> to

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
I don't really care about that I want to

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.240 
I don't really care about that I want to
specifically<00:06:37.360> focus<00:06:37.539> on<00:06:37.780> Busby<00:06:38.620> and<00:06:38.800> Haas

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
specifically focus on Busby and Haas

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.129 
specifically focus on Busby and Haas
Walt<00:06:39.520> and<00:06:39.669> what<00:06:40.150> changed<00:06:40.419> their<00:06:40.510> minds<00:06:40.750> and

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
Walt and what changed their minds and

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:42.420 
Walt and what changed their minds and
got<00:06:41.319> them<00:06:41.530> to<00:06:41.680> be<00:06:41.800> where<00:06:41.979> they<00:06:42.099> are<00:06:42.129> now

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
got them to be where they are now

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.950 
got them to be where they are now
hopefully<00:06:43.120> it<00:06:43.210> can<00:06:43.270> be<00:06:43.360> done<00:06:43.509> in<00:06:43.629> one<00:06:43.780> chapter

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
hopefully it can be done in one chapter

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.080 
hopefully it can be done in one chapter
it<00:06:44.289> can<00:06:44.379> be<00:06:44.469> pretty<00:06:44.590> brief<00:06:45.159> and<00:06:45.550> we<00:06:45.879> can<00:06:45.999> have

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
it can be pretty brief and we can have

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.189 
it can be pretty brief and we can have
some<00:06:46.180> things<00:06:46.360> implied<00:06:46.659> like<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:46.930> stuff<00:06:47.110> in

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 
some things implied like the stuff in

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.589 
some things implied like the stuff in
this<00:06:47.289> chapter<00:06:47.530> with<00:06:48.129> the<00:06:48.159> molestie<00:06:49.030> uncle<00:06:49.419> and

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 
this chapter with the molestie uncle and

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:51.149 
this chapter with the molestie uncle and
Haas<00:06:49.960> while<00:06:50.169> killing<00:06:50.349> him<00:06:50.590> that<00:06:50.740> stuff<00:06:50.979> just

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.159 
Haas while killing him that stuff just

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.670 
Haas while killing him that stuff just
kind<00:06:51.400> of<00:06:51.550> implied<00:06:52.509> and<00:06:52.930> I<00:06:53.319> thought<00:06:53.469> that<00:06:53.590> was

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
kind of implied and I thought that was

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.860 
kind of implied and I thought that was
really<00:06:53.830> well<00:06:54.009> done<00:06:54.039> it<00:06:54.490> was<00:06:54.669> concise<00:06:55.360> but<00:06:55.689> it

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
really well done it was concise but it

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.879 
really well done it was concise but it
was<00:06:55.960> enough<00:06:56.199> and<00:06:56.349> there<00:06:56.499> were<00:06:56.560> things<00:06:56.740> you

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:56.889 
was enough and there were things you

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:58.080 
was enough and there were things you
could<00:06:57.009> figure<00:06:57.159> out<00:06:57.310> on<00:06:57.490> your<00:06:57.520> own<00:06:57.669> it<00:06:57.909> shows

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
could figure out on your own it shows

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.209 
could figure out on your own it shows
that<00:06:58.240> sometimes<00:06:58.719> kubo<00:06:59.529> can<00:06:59.740> write<00:06:59.949> things

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:00.219 
that sometimes kubo can write things

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.269 
that sometimes kubo can write things
that<00:07:00.969> have<00:07:01.749> substance<00:07:02.379> and<00:07:02.650> that's<00:07:02.889> nice<00:07:03.099> to

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:03.279 
that have substance and that's nice to

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.760 
that have substance and that's nice to
see<00:07:03.490> so<00:07:04.029> anyway<00:07:04.419> I<00:07:04.659> enjoyed<00:07:05.169> flashback<00:07:05.740> in
