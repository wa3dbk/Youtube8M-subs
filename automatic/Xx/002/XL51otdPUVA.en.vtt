 the multiple money creation 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:10.969
 it will be money 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.009
 because the book money which actually only on 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.790
 Spell on cash represents 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.380
 as practical and fast as the actual cash is needed 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.939
 if it is not picked up any more now may be the claim 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.339
 but forgive it several times 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.879
 No 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:36.139
 if someone wants to withdraw cash you just know a small one 

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:39.919
 Reserve reserve ready for restraint accepted would have been enough

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.760
 this results in 10% minimum reserves 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.860
 The duo from every money seems to get ten times as much book money 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.859
 can 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.010
 new there 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.150
 the modern banking system 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.200
 someone is credited with an amount of money in their account 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.820
 Accessibility time 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.910

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.220
 a minimum reserve of cash is needed 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.460
 the claim can be forgiven on this more Markets

 No 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.640
 more 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 by granting the loans arises here 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.870
 for which the bank receives interest 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.050
 These interest rates create the need for additional money 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.400
 which in turn is caused by a criticism paid on the plane interest 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.000
 appreciate 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 The system is self-employed here 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.759
 your winning a power 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.799
 Increases faster and faster 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.879
 you take money value he is not heard 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.149
 with money is nonexistent 1 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.149
 SID 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.559
 see promptly 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.229
 Inflation and deflation 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.629
 stable prices 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.869
 inflation 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:53.919
 because the money supply in relation to banking services too big 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.599
 the money loses its value 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.169
 As a result, the prices of the products increase and money is lost 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.969
 The value of the general trust decreases greatly, which adds up to more 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.579
 Anbiedert loses 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.579
 the consequence is an escape into the 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.539
 the situation 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:22.649
 the money stock is in proportion to maintain and services 2 low 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:27.539
 the value of money goes up and prices lower nobody spends more money 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.019
 as absolutely necessary because the products are getting cheaper 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.869
 therefore prices must be lowered even more 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:41.119
 the consequence is the flight into the money there will always be strong the 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.839
 Demand for goods you noticed from her and thus the production 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.789
 the economy collapses

 it has noticed 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.329
 the planet has evolved 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.799
 There are many usable GByte now and more are happening 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:18.309
 every day the offender increases to a new report and you merit 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.539
 to those in the tent 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.650
 the rich are happy 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.940
 and the poor too busy and it's not questionable anyway 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:34.449
 every day increases the financial pressure on the residents 1 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.449
 r 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.189
