00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.500
 These days 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.500
 I often hear the word slow life 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.729
 Go ahead as before 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:14.769
 It has come from reflection on whether efficiencyism is handed over 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.349
 Wax 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.529
 Let's go slowly as motto speed 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.099
 It is fine to go slowly 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.099
 Meaning of country is too frontal 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.519
 Those who say to go slowly 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.030
 It seems like I understand how fast I can not go 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.150
 Real slow is that 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.590
 It's about speeding up and slowing down 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.800
 I swear that I'm just reading 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.990
 Speed ​​up 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.990
 While that speed is visible it is still a problem 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.300
 With real speed 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.300
 Is it invisible? 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.490
 One person will do 704 for the earth for one second 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.880
 I can not see the speed of light 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.250
 Light is 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.450
 As if to stop 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.440
 Country designation is done 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.800
 Real speed horse 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.150
 Bad is not speed 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.540
 It was visible speed 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.930
 Even if you lose 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.340
 Similar to trading 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.340
 I do not take care of the process and I can not open the speed 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
 Such visible from within 1974 yen in speed 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.810
 Speed ​​is not good 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.810
 It will be said that 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.990
 The speed is momentary for a moment 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.300
 This is very important 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.530
 When trying to make a match in time 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.900
 Because I can know the thinking 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.590
 When trying to make a decision in a moment 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.530
 Not thinking 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.530
 It is because it can be felt 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.010
 Think carefully in Japan What kind of education inherits 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.470
 Thanks to you 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.059
 It was completely weak 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:10.199
 as a result 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.669
 Only the negative side of thinking is bloated 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.170
 The more you think, the more you think 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.170
 Be cautious and become a weapon 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.669
 Thoughts are not as good as you think 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.079
 Is it Labor Party in Colombo? 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.839
 For what is happening in front of you 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:39.009
 If you act as leaders with feeling 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.709
 Than thinking and thinking and acting 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.970
 How often do you get good results 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.129
 This is true even in the game world 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.129
 It is so even in ordinary life 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.299
 Speed ​​is not bad 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.839
 If your flow is simple and speedy 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.659
 Completion is twenty-nine days 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.769
 If you make things too complicated to think about more elements 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.549
 It becomes difficult for students to work
