00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.749
 hello how about youtube friends today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.819
 I will teach how to play the song shines 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:06.959
 from lion to king and I know that no particular 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.700
 I like it a lot 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:11.010
 really this album does not sound much like 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.470
 psoe seems to me more like a rock type 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.120
 of the sixties this ballad the truth 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.220
 like it reminds me a lot of these 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.869
 times if they have not had the opportunity to 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.019
 listen to the song search here in 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.579
 youtube I recommend them a lot and 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.199
 well here I will show you the 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.900
 right way well let's start with 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.039
 the tutorial well the chords that we're going to 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.150
 use are going to be 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.150
 the council 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.520
 We're going to do less 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.450
 up here 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.240
 then we will use 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.780
 yes minor 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.300
 i 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.410
 again held them lower but so what 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.410
 we do in this part 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.170
 and I left 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.220
 the trait is very simple since nothing is 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.220
 is below and above 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.890
 and the part that starts nothing more initial 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.890
 with and with C sharp minor 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Y 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.430
 this part also carries it in 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.280
 stanzas and also that when he does the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.310
 change so minor let's do it from this 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.310
 way 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.490
 we play first 5a 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:43.250
 then fourth after second and third 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.250
 at par and then again fourth 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.470
 Y 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 then it will be the same for what it would be 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.180
 C sharp minor 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.060
 and for me, for me, we are going to do two 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.060
 times 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.549
 then we will position to solve 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.079
 small in what would be the third 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.079
 rope on the second fret 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.930
 ok the verse is going to be 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.090
 you 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.120
 i 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.819
 this part we repeat it again that goes 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.459
 to be the whole part of the stanza 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.750
 and after that and nothing else, we are going to 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.260
 what is the chorus we are going to use 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.030
 yes minor 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.810
 to me 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.690
 the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.190
 and it goes sharp radio is the same is very 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.190
 simple we start 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.050
 and 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.050
 all right 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.579
 and then what would be the lemon 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.909
 I'm going to do nothing with a strum towards 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.909
 down 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.800
 and then we move to the lower 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.770
 and we repeat this circle again 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.050
 and then after we went to sun 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.610
 and we repeat again everything that would be 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.840
 the verse and the chorus and again the inter 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.120
 I hope you have served them this 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.400
 tutorial the truth the song is very 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.380
 very pretty to dedicate and to touch 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.820
 they already know that if they have doubts let me 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.830
