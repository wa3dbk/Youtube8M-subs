00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.340 
go with the last one smart drift because

versus<00:02:39.560> environment<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:40.220> probably<00:02:40.459> go<00:02:40.730> with

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
versus environment I probably go with

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.610 
versus environment I probably go with
actually<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.450> soft<00:02:41.720> ballistics<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.500> that

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
actually the soft ballistics and that

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.650 
actually the soft ballistics and that
way<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:42.800> don't<00:02:43.040> get<00:02:43.220> any<00:02:43.400> um<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:44.540> know

penalty<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:46.040> range<00:02:46.820> but<00:02:47.769> anyways<00:02:48.769> as<00:02:49.160> far<00:02:49.519> as

the<00:02:50.180> special<00:02:50.600> features<00:02:50.989> that<00:02:51.200> this<00:02:51.410> weapon

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
the special features that this weapon

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.080 
the special features that this weapon
has<00:02:51.860> which<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.340> probably<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.060> most

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
has which is probably the most

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.910 
has which is probably the most
interesting<00:02:53.870> thing<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.470> fact<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.830> it

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
interesting thing is the fact that it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.080 
interesting thing is the fact that it
has<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> third<00:02:55.700> eye<00:02:56.080> I<00:02:57.130> will<00:02:58.130> basically<00:02:58.730> tell

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
has a third eye I will basically tell

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.720 
has a third eye I will basically tell
you<00:02:59.209> this<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.870> best<00:03:00.380> feature<00:03:00.650> in<00:03:01.010> destiny

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
you this is the best feature in destiny

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.790 
you this is the best feature in destiny
for<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.030> mere<00:03:02.180> fact<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.540> when<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.560> aim<00:03:03.769> down

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
for the mere fact that when you aim down

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.130 
for the mere fact that when you aim down
sight<00:03:04.340> with<00:03:04.550> this<00:03:04.730> weapon<00:03:04.970> we<00:03:05.840> notice<00:03:06.110> that

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
sight with this weapon we notice that

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.350 
sight with this weapon we notice that
has<00:03:06.410> like<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.950> radar<00:03:07.340> thing<00:03:07.820> sitting<00:03:08.239> next

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
has like this radar thing sitting next

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.900 
has like this radar thing sitting next
to<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.810> scope<00:03:09.140> right<00:03:09.739> there<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.580> actually

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
to the scope right there that actually

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.630 
to the scope right there that actually
is<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:12.049> thing<00:03:12.260> that<00:03:12.290> gives<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.010> radar

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
is the thing that gives you the radar

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.420 
is the thing that gives you the radar
while<00:03:14.299> you're<00:03:14.480> aiming<00:03:14.900> down<00:03:15.110> sights<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:16.010> when

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
while you're aiming down sights so when

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.710 
while you're aiming down sights so when
you're<00:03:16.549> aiming<00:03:16.850> down<00:03:16.970> side<00:03:17.269> you<00:03:17.480> have<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
you're aiming down side you have the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.680 
you're aiming down side you have the
radar<00:03:18.140> always<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.670> when<00:03:20.060> you're<00:03:20.180> watching

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
radar always so when you're watching

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.150 
radar always so when you're watching
this<00:03:20.840> game<00:03:20.900> play<00:03:21.320> notice<00:03:21.709> what<00:03:21.890> I'm<00:03:22.010> aiming

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
this game play notice what I'm aiming

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.610 
this game play notice what I'm aiming
down<00:03:22.400> side<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.970> radar<00:03:23.390> does<00:03:23.660> not<00:03:23.900> go<00:03:24.290> anywhere

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
down side the radar does not go anywhere

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.190 
down side the radar does not go anywhere
because<00:03:25.489> that's<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.120> big<00:03:26.299> thing<00:03:26.329> with<00:03:26.780> all<00:03:27.049> the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
because that's a big thing with all the

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.440 
because that's a big thing with all the
weapons<00:03:27.560> in<00:03:27.739> destiny<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.430> radar<00:03:29.000> actually

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
weapons in destiny the radar actually

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.440 
weapons in destiny the radar actually
disappears<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.370> does<00:03:31.549> have<00:03:31.760> 5<00:03:32.120> upgrade

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
disappears so it does have 5 upgrade

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.810 
disappears so it does have 5 upgrade
damage<00:03:33.410> options<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.489> could<00:03:34.670> obtain

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
damage options that you could obtain

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.330 
damage options that you could obtain
after<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.540> upgrade<00:03:35.750> this<00:03:36.200> weapon<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:37.160> has

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
after you upgrade this weapon it has

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.280 
after you upgrade this weapon it has
three<00:03:37.370> other<00:03:37.880> additional<00:03:38.540> features<00:03:38.989> that<00:03:39.170> you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
three other additional features that you

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.710 
three other additional features that you
can<00:03:39.470> select<00:03:39.890> it<00:03:40.100> are<00:03:40.310> interchangeable<00:03:41.090> which

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
can select it are interchangeable which

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.500 
can select it are interchangeable which
are<00:03:41.930> lightweight<00:03:42.579> quick-draw<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:43.850> field

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
are lightweight quick-draw and field

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.360 
are lightweight quick-draw and field
scout<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:45.019> would<00:03:45.260> probably<00:03:45.500> go<00:03:45.860> with<00:03:45.920> either

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
scout I would probably go with either

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.030 
scout I would probably go with either
lightweight<00:03:47.090> or<00:03:47.329> quick<00:03:47.780> draw<00:03:48.079> you<00:03:48.829> really

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
lightweight or quick draw you really

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.490 
lightweight or quick draw you really
don't<00:03:49.250> need<00:03:49.430> maximum<00:03:50.180> ammo<00:03:50.720> capacity<00:03:50.900> which

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
don't need maximum ammo capacity which

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.130 
don't need maximum ammo capacity which
is<00:03:51.530> filled<00:03:52.040> Scout<00:03:52.690> quitter<00:03:53.690> all<00:03:53.780> would<00:03:53.989> be

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
is filled Scout quitter all would be

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.780 
is filled Scout quitter all would be
really<00:03:54.440> nice<00:03:54.680> because<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.220> can<00:03:55.340> aim<00:03:55.640> down

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
really nice because you can aim down

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.340 
really nice because you can aim down
sight<00:03:56.150> faster<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:56.900> that's<00:03:57.019> going<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.230> be<00:03:57.320> very

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
sight faster and that's going to be very

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.100 
sight faster and that's going to be very
helpful<00:03:57.890> with<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.310> weapon<00:03:58.549> like<00:03:58.730> this<00:03:59.110> if

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
helpful with a weapon like this if

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.490 
helpful with a weapon like this if
you're<00:04:00.350> playing<00:04:00.530> player<00:04:01.040> versus<00:04:01.459> player<00:04:02.500> the
