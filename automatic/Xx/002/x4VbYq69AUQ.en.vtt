so<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.400> an<00:01:14.549> example<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.810> home<00:01:16.409> mill<00:01:17.159> for

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so this is an example of a home mill for

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.330 
so this is an example of a home mill for
for<00:01:18.090> home<00:01:18.240> brewing<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.840> little<00:01:19.619> different<00:01:20.159> than

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
for home brewing a little different than

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.300 
for home brewing a little different than
like<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> coffee<00:01:21.090> mill<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.930> has<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> particular

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
like a coffee mill it has a particular

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.109 
like a coffee mill it has a particular
setting<00:01:25.009> between<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> two<00:01:26.340> rollers<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
setting between the two rollers as a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.819 
setting between the two rollers as a
couple<00:01:27.420> rollers<00:01:27.869> down<00:01:28.140> inside<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.560> here

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
couple rollers down inside of here

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.100 
couple rollers down inside of here
there's<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> particular<00:01:30.000> gas<00:01:30.270> between<00:01:30.630> them

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
there's a particular gas between them

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.240 
there's a particular gas between them
that<00:01:31.740> allows<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.090> grain<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.170> crushed<00:01:34.860> but

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that allows the grain to be crushed but

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.090 
that allows the grain to be crushed but
not<00:01:35.490> pulverized<00:01:36.329> into<00:01:36.869> flour<00:01:37.200> when<00:01:37.979> you're

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
not pulverized into flour when you're

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.609 
not pulverized into flour when you're
making<00:01:38.460> beer<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.270> want<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.960> grain<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
making beer you do not want the grain to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.130 
making beer you do not want the grain to
be<00:01:40.650> pulverized<00:01:41.490> into<00:01:41.820> flour<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.960> want

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
be pulverized into flour you just want

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.649 
be pulverized into flour you just want
to<00:01:43.170> break<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.710> husk<00:01:43.950> off<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.909> these

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
to break the husk off of it so these

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.760 
to break the husk off of it so these
mills<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.409> we<00:01:46.680> sell<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.200> their<00:01:49.200> design

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
mills that we sell have a their design

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.929 
mills that we sell have a their design
to<00:01:50.549> crack<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.360> barley<00:01:52.220> most<00:01:53.220> beers<00:01:53.520> made<00:01:53.790> out

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
to crack the barley most beers made out

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.510 
to crack the barley most beers made out
of<00:01:54.060> barley<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.290> crack<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.829> barley<00:01:56.189> without

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
of barley so to crack the barley without

of barley so to crack the barley without
turning<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> into<00:01:57.270> flour<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.189> just

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
turning it into flour so this is just

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.850 
turning it into flour so this is just
one<00:01:59.729> example<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.630> mills<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.710> can
