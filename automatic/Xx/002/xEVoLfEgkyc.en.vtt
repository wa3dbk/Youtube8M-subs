 then swing the owl for damage in 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.360
 mid-game and exit the second skill build 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.789

 together with our ultimate and bkb to 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:00.009
 we were not disturbed by casters and designers 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.720
 but closer to the end you can collect 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.550

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.830

 the choice of our shoes will be pt 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.069
 which will give attack speed and 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.370
 additional with 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.670

 Well, at the end of the game we collect Sasha with Yasha 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.730

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.549
 Item build which is also suitable for 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.769

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.510
 will pt 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.310
 Now I want to draw your attention to something 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.129
 what if you can't collect 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.769
 Radik at least 25 minutes of the game 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.540
 go to the previous site build but 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.150
 if you invested during 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.900
 then after the radical take bkb and in the end 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.030
 games we buy a butterfly and a heart 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.389
 but about the skill build hey aitemilda square 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.519
 everything 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.930
 and let's move the gameplay and useful 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.139
 tips for blood sweeper 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.060
 and we'll start with the bloodseeker kerry gameplay 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.400
 should calmly farm on line up 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.219
 mid game then begin to gank with 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.849
 good but frame gameplay for bladiker 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.620
 ganker 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.139
 this farm to level six and 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.069
 ruthless killings throughout 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:34.680
 the remaining game now move on to 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.930
 Helpful advice for a start bladsiker 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.000
 we are from our table at the beginning of his game 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.470
 better use as owl on enemy 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.780
 about custers and disablers 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.209
 and closer to the middle game and kite as gain 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.609
 damage yourself as well it can 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.340
 make good use of bri gankah because 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.379
 it does damage every second and if not 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.919
 will kill the enemy then activates our 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.709
 thirsty 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.639
 about the second and third skill nothing 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.370
 I can not say 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:02.099
 after all it is passives and with them and so everything 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.319
 well, except what can we say about 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.340
 that ours was from trouble you can use 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.790
 for farm in the forest 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.829
 and our thirst sees invisers on wanted 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.530
 would dwell on a bunch of rab h plus 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.289
 force staff the matter is that early force 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.359
 the staff is not very helpful because on the first 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.539
 ulta level pushing the opponent we 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.199
 deal only 120 damage while 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.300
 even Furno will inflict 150 therefore collect 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:31.440
 and force staff at about level two 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.479
 ulty coming up to the third well my guide 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.580
 and came to an end I want to tell everyone 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.610
 thanks for watching and subscribe to 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.949
