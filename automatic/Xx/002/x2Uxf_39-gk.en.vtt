00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.340
 this plant 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.779
 and now all suns in a video and good 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.510
 we are where there is no kraft and we are going to see 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.340
 what is this command that is not very 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.119
 known also not like these game 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.950
 bots 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.990
 but in the end it's called play sound and it's 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.050
 exaggeratedly useful if you are going to access 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.300
 an adventure map or a map I do not know about 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.989
 survival horror they possess 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:42.100
 a lot of things the command goes like this play 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.530
 they are here without parentheses the sound and the 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.420
 destination the destiny of the player 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.840
 that is, or the radius where you live is the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.700
 sound and good as saying is all 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.410
 commands is in the description all 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.739
 the commands that you use if they have 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.660
 some doubt comment and here are the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.809
 normal criteria 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.060
 like this command in the description them 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.840
 I leave a link because here where the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.560
 sound they need to put the name of the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.610
 sound 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.800
 as such it is as it is in the folder 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.990
 app data this is useful because that's how you can 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.200
 replace sounds and use sounds to 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.320
 product 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.899
 but hey there I leave you the goals he edited 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.480
 and I put the address, I do not know, sorry 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.680
 where the sounds are 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.770
 and well this would be to arrate the player 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.370
 closest to you if you put new ones to 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.370
 one and the sound 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:49.630
 and here I would be with radio 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:53.480
 the blog has two radio I say if I 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.460
 I move a little box it is not 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.300
 not understood can be used with 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.850
 any of the radio criteria and 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.490
 everything already achieves a video of that because 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.020
 I think I have not done that and this 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.050
 command is in the description and here a 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.580
 example with this elevated that says number 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.240
 when for example here very nice 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.680
 we preach and we start to raise the story 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.680
 well, it makes us think that we are 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.450
 raising the sound 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.890
 and actually 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.590
 we are here 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.150
 and well basically that's all 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.890
 for this video we will see in a 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.890
 next video goodbye 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.520
 ace
