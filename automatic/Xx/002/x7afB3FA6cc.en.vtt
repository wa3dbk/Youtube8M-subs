00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.089 
this is my review for target exclusive
animated<00:00:02.970> sunstorm<00:00:03.770> sunstorm<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.480> kind<00:00:06.480> of

animated sunstorm sunstorm is a kind of

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.919 
animated sunstorm sunstorm is a kind of
i'm<00:00:08.099> not<00:00:08.550> exactly<00:00:08.880> sure<00:00:09.150> what<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:09.660> called

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
i'm not exactly sure what it's called

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.470 
i'm not exactly sure what it's called
it's<00:00:10.170> based<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.980> real<00:00:11.219> jet<00:00:11.639> but<00:00:11.940> I've<00:00:12.300> never

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
it's based on a real jet but I've never

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.689 
it's based on a real jet but I've never
seen<00:00:12.840> tremendous<00:00:15.199> 8<00:00:16.199> he's<00:00:16.680> basically<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.250> jet

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
seen tremendous 8 he's basically a jet

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.700 
seen tremendous 8 he's basically a jet
with<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> wings<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.600> backwards<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.320> guess<00:00:19.529> is

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
with the wings on backwards I guess is

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.980 
with the wings on backwards I guess is
the<00:00:19.740> best<00:00:20.189> way<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> describe<00:00:21.240> my<00:00:21.539> never<00:00:21.750> like

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the best way to describe my never like

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.620 
the best way to describe my never like
this<00:00:22.230> design<00:00:22.650> element<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.310> having<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> wings

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
this design element of having the wings

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.439 
this design element of having the wings
stick<00:00:25.170> out<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.849> would<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.150> prefer

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
stick out like this I would have prefer

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.609 
stick out like this I would have prefer
if<00:00:27.599> they<00:00:27.720> had<00:00:27.840> had<00:00:27.869> him<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.439> i<00:00:28.500> think

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
if they had had him like that i think

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
if they had had him like that i think
they<00:00:28.830> law<00:00:28.949> devote<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.000> much<00:00:30.060> better<00:00:30.420> that's

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
they law devote so much better that's

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.060 
they law devote so much better that's
just<00:00:30.869> my<00:00:30.990> personal<00:00:31.349> opinion<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
just my personal opinion but it is a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.840 
just my personal opinion but it is a
very<00:00:32.369> nice<00:00:32.610> cartoon<00:00:33.210> accurate<00:00:33.390> jet<00:00:33.989> mold<00:00:34.230> um

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
very nice cartoon accurate jet mold um

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.310 
very nice cartoon accurate jet mold um
like<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.969> said<00:00:36.000> he<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.450> an<00:00:36.600> exclusive<00:00:37.200> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
like I said he was an exclusive to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.040 
like I said he was an exclusive to
target<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.920> got<00:00:38.340> him<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.579> five<00:00:38.820> dollars<00:00:39.329> when

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
they did that sale I'm not sure why they

did a five dollar sale on a $25 figure
but<00:00:46.379> hey<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.800> wasn't<00:00:47.250> complaining<00:00:47.809> but<00:00:48.809> here's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
but hey I wasn't complaining but here's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.330 
but hey I wasn't complaining but here's
a<00:00:49.230> little<00:00:49.410> landing<00:00:49.710> gear<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.039> he<00:00:50.100> rules

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
a little landing gear and he rules

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.510 
a little landing gear and he rules
fairly<00:00:50.850> well<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:51.989> flip<00:00:52.230> them<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:53.370> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
fairly well we can flip them up if you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.819 
fairly well we can flip them up if you
want<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> these<00:00:54.180> back<00:00:54.510> here<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:55.379> hard<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
want and these back here really hard to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
want and these back here really hard to
get<00:00:55.949> out<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> usually<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:56.940> leave<00:00:57.270> them

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
get out so I usually just leave them

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.920 
get out so I usually just leave them
almost<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> way<00:00:59.750> like<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.870> said

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
almost in not all the way like I said

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.670 
almost in not all the way like I said
that<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.320> flips<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:02.300> um<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.660> he<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.899> fly<00:01:04.439> along

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that one flips up um so he can fly along

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.070 
that one flips up um so he can fly along
um<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.580> deploy<00:01:06.299> these<00:01:06.600> missile

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
um you can deploy these missile

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800 
um you can deploy these missile
launchers<00:01:07.530> right<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:08.159> my<00:01:09.000> typical<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.479> don't

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
launchers right here my typical we don't

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.020 
launchers right here my typical we don't
typically<00:01:10.590> don't<00:01:10.860> um<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.939> looks

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
typically don't um I think that looks

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
typically don't um I think that looks
stupid<00:01:12.659> under<00:01:13.229> words<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:13.830> they<00:01:13.890> make

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
stupid under words and I think they make

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.070 
stupid under words and I think they make
a<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.369> bit<00:01:14.520> more<00:01:14.700> sense<00:01:15.090> folded<00:01:15.840> back

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
a little bit more sense folded back

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.630 
a little bit more sense folded back
because<00:01:16.380> they<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.270> jet<00:01:18.270> fire<00:01:18.540> um

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
because they can be like a jet fire um

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
because they can be like a jet fire um
anyway<00:01:20.640> pretty<00:01:21.360> nice<00:01:21.570> Mon<00:01:22.229> jet<00:01:22.680> mode<00:01:22.920> other

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
anyway pretty nice Mon jet mode other

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.850 
anyway pretty nice Mon jet mode other
than<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> fact<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.000> don't<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
than the fact that I just don't like the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.249

that's going to flip that piece back

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.569 
that's going to flip that piece back
automatically<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.920> bend<00:01:59.310> his

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
permanent bend in words on it's a minor

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.740 
permanent bend in words on it's a minor
complaint<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.879> still<00:02:28.330> would<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.540> wished

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
complaint but I still would have wished

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.119 
complaint but I still would have wished
that<00:02:28.900> they<00:02:29.050> hadn't<00:02:29.410> done<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.560> but<00:02:29.799> that's<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
that they hadn't done that but that's a

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.990 
that they hadn't done that but that's a
mold<00:02:30.489> design<00:02:31.950> complaint<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.549> then<00:02:33.849> you<00:02:33.910> want

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
mold design complaint and then you want

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.289 
mold design complaint and then you want
to<00:02:34.090> flip<00:02:34.299> out<00:02:34.450> his<00:02:34.480> feet<00:02:35.250> um<00:02:36.250> he<00:02:36.580> does<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.910> I

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
to flip out his feet um he does that I

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.940 
to flip out his feet um he does that I
think<00:02:37.629> he's<00:02:37.720> one<00:02:37.900> of<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.049> only<00:02:38.080> thing<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
think he's one of the only thing and the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.280 
think he's one of the only thing and the
only<00:02:39.069> transformers<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.180> has<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> turbines

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
only transformers that has a turbines

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.380 
only transformers that has a turbines
for<00:02:42.000> feet<00:02:43.000> which<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.870> think<00:02:44.049> it's<00:02:44.140> kind<00:02:44.319> of<00:02:44.349> cool

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
for feet which I think it's kind of cool

thinking no to get him to stand and they
have<00:03:00.420> animated<00:03:01.420> sunstorm<00:03:02.790> for<00:03:03.790> possibility

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
have animated sunstorm for possibility

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.860 
have animated sunstorm for possibility
he's<00:03:04.569> got<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.799> swivel<00:03:05.799> right<00:03:05.920> here<00:03:06.400> um<00:03:06.870> hinge

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
he's got a swivel right here um hinge

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.550 
he's got a swivel right here um hinge
right<00:03:08.079> here<00:03:08.519> hinge<00:03:09.519> here<00:03:10.379> limited<00:03:11.379> ball

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
right here hinge here limited ball

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.800 
right here hinge here limited ball
jointed<00:03:12.040> head<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:13.030> do<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.360> way<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.660> it's

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
jointed head just do the way that it's

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.690 
jointed head just do the way that it's
designed<00:03:14.230> them<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.739> yes<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.160> does<00:03:15.370> like<00:03:15.579> to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
designed them and yes it does like to

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.910 
designed them and yes it does like to
pop<00:03:15.940> off<00:03:16.180> sadly<00:03:16.810> it's<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.290> little<00:03:17.560> bit<00:03:17.709> too

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
pop off sadly it's a little bit too

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.490 
pop off sadly it's a little bit too
small<00:03:18.220> for<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.819> ball<00:03:19.359> joints<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.019> pops<00:03:20.230> off

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
small for the ball joints so it pops off

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.690 
small for the ball joints so it pops off
so<00:03:20.709> I<00:03:20.739> usually<00:03:21.069> just<00:03:21.100> leave<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.519> in<00:03:21.609> one

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
so I usually just leave it in one

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.039 
so I usually just leave it in one
position<00:03:21.880> although<00:03:22.239> he<00:03:22.420> does<00:03:22.569> have<00:03:22.600> a<00:03:22.810> very

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
position although he does have a very

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.960 
position although he does have a very
nice<00:03:23.290> smirk<00:03:23.739> on<00:03:23.920> his<00:03:24.040> face<00:03:24.100> which<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.819> really

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
nice smirk on his face which I really

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.740 
nice smirk on his face which I really
like<00:03:25.209> anyway<00:03:26.370> very<00:03:27.370> tight<00:03:27.730> ratchets<00:03:28.450> here<00:03:28.720> I

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
like anyway very tight ratchets here I

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.860 
like anyway very tight ratchets here I
might<00:03:28.930> loosen<00:03:29.200> them<00:03:29.440> up<00:03:30.599> ratcheted<00:03:31.599> knees<00:03:31.840> a

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
might loosen them up ratcheted knees a

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.930 
might loosen them up ratcheted knees a
ball-joint<00:03:32.829> defeats<00:03:33.459> which<00:03:33.609> are<00:03:33.760> pretty

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
ball-joint defeats which are pretty

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.220 
ball-joint defeats which are pretty
limited<00:03:34.209> just<00:03:34.569> through<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.930> way<00:03:35.049> that

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
limited just through the way that

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.599 
limited just through the way that
they're<00:03:35.349> designed<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.859> they<00:03:35.950> hinge<00:03:36.220> in<00:03:36.430> if

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
they're designed and they hinge in if

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.690 
they're designed and they hinge in if
you<00:03:36.700> want<00:03:36.730> so<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.209> can<00:03:37.329> be<00:03:37.680> flying<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:39.250> that's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
you want so you can be flying and that's

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.110 
you want so you can be flying and that's
pretty<00:03:40.090> much<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:40.389> I'm<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.680> can<00:03:42.099> if<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.910> want

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
pretty much it I'm you can if you want

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.080 
pretty much it I'm you can if you want
open<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:43.900> cockpit<00:03:44.230> on<00:03:44.799> but<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.340> it's<00:03:45.849> not

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
open this cockpit on but it it's not

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.039 
open this cockpit on but it it's not
designed<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.780> obviously<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:47.950> pops<00:03:48.430> off<00:03:49.049> the

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
designed to obviously it pops off the

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.050 
designed to obviously it pops off the
one<00:03:50.230> time<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.470> did<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:51.040> was<00:03:51.340> afraid<00:03:51.609> I<00:03:51.700> almost

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
one time I did it I was afraid I almost

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.129 
one time I did it I was afraid I almost
broke<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:54.549> wouldn't<00:03:55.299> recommend<00:03:55.630> trying

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
broke it so I wouldn't recommend trying

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.129 
broke it so I wouldn't recommend trying
it<00:03:56.819> may<00:03:57.819> also<00:03:58.000> just<00:03:58.359> have<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.630> interesting

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
it may also just have the interesting

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.870 
it may also just have the interesting
feature<00:03:59.410> where<00:03:59.799> you<00:03:59.829> push<00:04:00.160> on<00:04:00.310> his<00:04:00.489> missile

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
feature where you push on his missile

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.379 
feature where you push on his missile
launchers<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:01.329> these<00:04:02.250> pods<00:04:03.250> flip<00:04:03.849> for<00:04:04.180> which

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
launchers and these pods flip for which

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.839 
launchers and these pods flip for which
I<00:04:04.569> think<00:04:05.139> they<00:04:05.319> label<00:04:05.769> them<00:04:05.919> as<00:04:05.950> net<00:04:06.489> laser

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
I think they label them as net laser

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.289 
I think they label them as net laser
missiles<00:04:07.510> or<00:04:07.630> something<00:04:08.970> I'm<00:04:09.970> not<00:04:10.120> really

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
missiles or something I'm not really

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.120 
missiles or something I'm not really
don't<00:04:10.810> really<00:04:10.930> remember<00:04:11.169> and<00:04:11.620> yes<00:04:11.769> when<00:04:12.040> you

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
don't really remember and yes when you

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.210 
don't really remember and yes when you
do<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:12.489> it's<00:04:13.049> best<00:04:14.049> not<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.319> grab<00:04:14.680> onto<00:04:14.919> his

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
do that it's best not to grab onto his

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.009 
do that it's best not to grab onto his
hands<00:04:15.489> because<00:04:15.790> they<00:04:16.269> do<00:04:16.329> like<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.750> pop<00:04:16.959> off<00:04:17.229> um

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
hands because they do like to pop off um

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.810 
hands because they do like to pop off um
but<00:04:20.019> anyway<00:04:20.590> he<00:04:20.769> can<00:04:20.889> have<00:04:21.130> them

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
but anyway he can have them

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.270 
but anyway he can have them
I<00:04:21.880> guess<00:04:22.630> he<00:04:22.750> could<00:04:22.870> have<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.230> double<00:04:24.040> fire

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
I guess he could have the double fire

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.940 
I guess he could have the double fire
powers<00:04:24.760> upon<00:04:25.450> as<00:04:25.810> opposed<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.350> just<00:04:26.410> as<00:04:26.710> null

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
powers upon as opposed to just as null

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.160 
powers upon as opposed to just as null
race<00:04:27.250> I'm<00:04:27.970> sadly<00:04:28.570> he<00:04:28.720> doesn't<00:04:29.020> have<00:04:29.110> the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
race I'm sadly he doesn't have the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.140 
race I'm sadly he doesn't have the
ability<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.710> bend<00:04:30.010> his<00:04:30.130> arm<00:04:30.190> up<00:04:30.640> all<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.000> way

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
ability to bend his arm up all the way

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.990 
ability to bend his arm up all the way
so<00:04:31.990> he<00:04:32.560> always<00:04:32.890> is<00:04:33.070> going<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.310> be<00:04:33.430> at<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.640> very

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
so he always is going to be at a very

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.490 
so he always is going to be at a very
very<00:04:34.270> slight<00:04:34.720> Bend<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:36.250> usually<00:04:37.290> pose<00:04:38.290> them

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
very slight Bend I usually pose them

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.400 
very slight Bend I usually pose them
with<00:04:38.650> uh<00:04:39.210> like<00:04:40.210> double<00:04:40.630> swords<00:04:41.230> or<00:04:41.380> something
