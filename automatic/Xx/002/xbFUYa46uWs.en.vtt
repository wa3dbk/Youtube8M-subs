00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.140
 to this first day of music the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.140
 We did not expect so many people 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.700
 we are going to present some clips of this 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.650
 documentary that has been produced 45 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.980
 years is called citizen fernando gállego 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.210
 which is a biopic I suppose of the figure of 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.210
 fernando gállego that we have here 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.619
 I want you to know the person you see 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 here is not the person that you have 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.620
 known throughout the past 25 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.910
 years no longer has nothing to do this is 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.750
 I say it 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.900
 it is important existential event that has 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.489
 triggered the production the recording and 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.680
 the realization of this beautiful work 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.390
 that these friends have made for a 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.780
 documentary there has to be a 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.790
 documented a documented and a 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.970
 absolute documentalist eagerness to 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.080
 protagonism that I always have rosero 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.140
 megalomania no presence of hispania a 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.790
 crisis is convinced but to the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.140
 need you to know that we are in 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.590
 a moment in which this wonderful 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.229
 digital culture allows us all already 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.320
 all that absolutely to all and to each 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.180
 one of us to have our own 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.940
 documentary because other people will be able 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.740
 with this digital existential testimony 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.200
 and bibliographic 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.720
 to give faith and give testimony of a 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.720
 epoch that we live of a time 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.670
 and a time that we spent outside the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.280
 need that this country has to be 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.740
 different from the need that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.440
 we have as Catalans to have a 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.640
 new identity 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.260
 there's something we all had and we had the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.270
 great and unique opportunity 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:59.870

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.000
 city ​​of the world in that documentary that 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.100
 these people neutralize as 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.010
 instigator and as protagonist the only thing 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.460
 that we want to fix manifest is that a 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.640
 scene that was called club there was a 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.010
 work that jockey wizard came a 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.590

 psycho consumer of like my first 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.850
 moment of approach to talking and 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.990
 then I was in press then 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.030
 I once did an interview 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.800

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.660
 contact with beige rose or lan for 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.400
 get in touch with nando I will 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.210

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.210

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:35.200
 simply giving him the needed to 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.200
 go from one place to another 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.620

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.629
 I was in the audiovisual sector I did not have 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.790
 no fucking emotion the movie is not a 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.390
 documentary and I propose to make a 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.800
 Biography 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.590
 to which he replies that in no way 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.600
 unless it is posthumous that the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.850
 implications are too large are 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.890
 have to talk about many people many 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.950
 names people who are alive to whom 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.310

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.590
