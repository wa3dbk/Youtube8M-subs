00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.300
 played in the domain it is still at war 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.910
 terrestrial with fact realized with a 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.690
 type 25 equipped with football 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.039
 adjustable and quick charger like 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.190
 for those who had anti-splinters instead 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.710
 inflexible playing dexterity cc 4 then 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.230
 oh well as lethal and as secondary the b 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.730
 23 r1 in play quite good either 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.280
 just the cinema just doesn't 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.870
 he had truncated but we will talk about this 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.909
 so let's help him grow raga then 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.630

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.280
 having said that the national do we care about 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.090

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.710
 you because we are always becoming of 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.659
 more 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.400
 soon I will reach what I am about 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.649
 will be the milestone of the 3,000 members 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.810

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.520

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.799
 I bring to thank do 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.479
 achieving this goal 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.369
 however I hope to be able to propose to you 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.680
 something up to now I see 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.600
 still what to do and again 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.950
 honestly I have no idea 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.130
 what I'm going to do though 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.140
 I don't know now I'll make something up e 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.750
 girls are also happy to 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.429
 participation that in short you have me 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.620
 made to see regarding the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.989
 new series on modern warfare 2 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.510
 because in any case it was albenga 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.599
 someone criticized me for being second 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.519
 he tried to copy over and me 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.260
 I can assure you that the ultra melosa 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.269
 for I knew him by name but we don't have 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.220
 immediately seen of me I enjoy it though 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.769
 however, I knew what it does 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.569
 what did he do besides ee 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.730
 I tried to do something 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.970
 different that I repeat because I propose 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.269
 matches of all against all I can 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.980
 win or lose a little and maybe a 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.299
 these parts of the music point 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.190
 in the background to make the whole thing more 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.130
 anemic in more I propose a kind of 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.260
 live commentary which aims 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.910
 to make you understand what I thought 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.040
 while this can make you understand that anyway 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.140
 also I am wrong sometimes committed by 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.569
 errors and veils correct just below 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.430
 form of commentary so I repeat to you 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.950
 that this was my idea 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.280
 same alain in short to the same alemo 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.859
 in short, he asked if he had come down to him 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.359
 it seemed to be copied because if 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.250
 so it was I would not have had 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.120
 problems to interrupt it because it is clear 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.519
 that 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.349
 that is, copying something bad from someone 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.360
 he himself told me to myself 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.250
 does not seem to me to be quietly copied 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.930
 so I'm really happy in short of 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.349
 how could they continue to propose 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.080
 also because the boys said a lot 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.269
 sincerely copy as the stem does not 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.670
 is and maybe do similar things that 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.959
 then the basic concept that etc. 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.220
 my series and that of me totally 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.409
 different 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.180
 however, copying means that you 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.569
 do everything to be equal to 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.420
 person if for example youtuber proposes 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.370
 a video to do everything to be for 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.109
 make a series equal to that for 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.209
 also to look the same 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.069
 youtube and so this in short what 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.319
 he had written with his place and creed 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.250
 which better reflects the concept of 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.590
 to copy 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.569
 then it is clear that I mean the 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.519
 the same idea can have more people 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.590
 because in any case we are a community of 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.810
 large and growing more and more 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.230
 so it's normal so I hope you 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.280
 understand and accept this 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.970
 then then made this introduction 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.239
 a little bit long but I was anxious 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.200
 let's say so I wanted to say yes 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.380
 says the president of these 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.820
 you get lost in the void or ride that is precisely 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.500
 I'm here to tell you about the cinema of 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.330
 black ops two because it was that game 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.710
 out of a long time of things 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.060
 will enter the tender charge I have to do it 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.910
 over because they are also in it 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.950
 complained ok the game came from 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.450
 a lot and as you all know 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.790
 in short, the chino of black ops is two 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.470
 always been a bit disgusting no because me 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.180
 need matches when you want often 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.040
 counted in negative to see if found 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.320
 in short, all eleven minutes 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.580
 It lasted lasted the game guardianship 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.820
 in short, the total game had 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.830
 quietly china while when 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.230
 then you you were going to do my 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.120
 scores here do the game was not there 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.370
 ok that sail can fix simple seat 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.890
 a change of the lost but one thing that I 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.320
 I personally do not accept and find myself 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.820
 the game cut short when it didn't happen 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.890
 no change shows you better 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.500
 this gameplay in fact the new you will be able to 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.900
 seeing will not be whole will not be truncated 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.580
 because the melos cinema will separate into two 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.990
 parts even if in progress 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.030
 of the match had not occurred 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.919
 no host changes and more from the 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.020
 first part shows me that I had done 30 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.370
 killings and three deaths when instead 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.900
 I can only see you show up 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.940
 only 15 killing of two deaths 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.890
 while for the final part he shows me 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.470
 that the game ends all in full 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.240
 and that viewfinder and then to 62 kg to 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.979
 other dead did odors can see 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.010
 up to 50 kg from seven deaths 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.750
 so the race is still a rude slut 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.650
 I have to end it 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.290
 it hasn't lasted so it's really one 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.930
 which annoys me because I am 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.850
 A thousand thousand peace has been made for weapons 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.120
 to enhance them have been added 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.100
 dlc me still peace shops of this peace of 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.600
 receive it, they never kicked it out 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.190
 I really know what they continue to 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.380
 wait I think they will leave him now 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.770
 so they won't care a thing though 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.510
 I say 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.430
 if you have to offer a service that does not 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.930
 it works don't propose heaven for nothing 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.310
 because at least I play that for me of 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.669
 attacked and I'm sure of what 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.669
 I do 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.230
 nothing, therefore, as always, I invite you to 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.300
 in short, I like it if the video shows 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.430
 liked it and if you agree with me 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.470
 because anyway it's always nice 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.900
 then I invite you to leave a comment 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.390
 also to tell me what you think of 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.250
 video and pass to create the clan 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.360
 to the facebook page and nothing us there 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.360
 we feel good bye bye
