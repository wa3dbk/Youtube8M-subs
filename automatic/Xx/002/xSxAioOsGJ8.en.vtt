00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.119
 shocked to find out again who was behind this 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.760
 attack 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.610
 went beyond the interfaith 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.860
 conflicts it became clear that both crayfish and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.559
 dealing with war whose purpose is genocide 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.200
 terrorists lead her in all walks of life 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.210
 An example meeting took place on November 1 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.379
 Iraqi Nuri al-Maliki with the United States President 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.329
 barrack obama 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.730
 They agreed that Iraq is urgent 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.500
 need help but apart from general statements 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.129
 no specific measures such as 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.830
 life saving was not suggested 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.409
 I am you any man on the street anytime 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.240
 may die due to a car explosion 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.260
 motorcycle or death belt in any 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.850
 moment someone may die 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.650
 now ten or eleven years we 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.750
 Talking about new software 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.479
 security but nothing changes 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.840
 the situation is only getting worse not new 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.680
 checkpoints no low cost arrests 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.450
 counterterrorism operations throughout 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.400
 visibility is not enough to take 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.320
 situation under control and set 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.689
 how many civilians have died since 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.119
 US invasion of iraq 2003 almost 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.130
 impossible many decided life during 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.229
 military operations including skirmishes and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.670
 shelling some died due 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.110
 not high enough 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.890
 health and ruined 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.960
 infrastructure 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.290
 but now we are talking only about the dead in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.140
 the result of terrorist attacks in 2013 and numbers 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.479
