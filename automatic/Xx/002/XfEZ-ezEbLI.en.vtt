that<00:00:56.949> that<00:00:57.219> that<00:00:57.730> makes<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.090> feel<00:00:58.300> that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
that that that makes you feel that

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
something's gonna go wrong and that I

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.540 
something's gonna go wrong and that I
think<00:01:01.059> adds<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.750> very<00:01:01.960> cool<00:01:02.289> element<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:03.160> a<00:01:03.190> film

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
think adds a very cool element to a film

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.249 
think adds a very cool element to a film
like<00:01:03.670> film<00:01:03.969> three<00:01:04.149> because<00:01:04.449> things<00:01:05.110> are

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
like film three because things are

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.330 
like film three because things are
always<00:01:05.289> going<00:01:05.800> wrong<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.280> I<00:01:06.430> look<00:01:07.270> at<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:08.340> set

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
always going wrong and I look at a set

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.080 
always going wrong and I look at a set
on<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.640> location<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.450> think<00:01:11.409> even<00:01:12.090> without

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
on a location I think even without

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.060 
on a location I think even without
placing<00:01:13.630> your<00:01:13.930> character<00:01:14.470> in<00:01:14.650> that<00:01:14.680> place

I<00:03:08.790> think<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.879> visual<00:03:10.329> of<00:03:10.510> Chicago<00:03:11.019> is

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
I think the visual of Chicago is

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.449 
I think the visual of Chicago is
something<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.709> we<00:03:11.859> haven't<00:03:12.040> seen<00:03:12.280> in

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
something that we haven't seen in

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.849 
something that we haven't seen in
indifference<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.689> I<00:03:13.780> think<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.140> by<00:03:14.409> itself

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
indifference and I think that by itself

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:24.269 
indifference and I think that by itself
makes<00:03:15.609> it<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.769> little<00:03:17.769> special<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:22.030> show<00:03:22.239> time
