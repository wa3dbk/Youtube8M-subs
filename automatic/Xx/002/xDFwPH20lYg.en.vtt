00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
back then not now and I thought that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.530 
back then not now and I thought that
that<00:03:04.890> that's<00:03:05.190> stuck<00:03:05.520> with<00:03:05.730> me<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.300> someone

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
that that's stuck with me that someone

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.720 
that that's stuck with me that someone
can<00:03:06.660> plummet<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.410> much<00:03:08.120> but<00:03:09.120> he<00:03:09.390> kind<00:03:09.960> of

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
can plummet that much but he kind of

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.070 
can plummet that much but he kind of
exhaled<00:03:11.730> when<00:03:12.000> he<00:03:12.090> looked<00:03:12.330> at<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.570> number<00:03:12.900> two

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
exhaled when he looked at the number two

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.280 
exhaled when he looked at the number two
because<00:03:13.380> he<00:03:13.560> understands<00:03:14.780> how<00:03:15.780> far<00:03:16.110> he's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
because he understands how far he's

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.550 
because he understands how far he's
falling<00:03:17.330> but<00:03:18.330> he<00:03:18.450> still<00:03:18.660> appreciates<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.350> wife

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
falling but he still appreciates a wife

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.320 
falling but he still appreciates a wife
that<00:03:19.800> he<00:03:19.920> has<00:03:20.130> in<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.370> children<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:20.970> he<00:03:21.090> has
