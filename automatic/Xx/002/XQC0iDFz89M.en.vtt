looking at the new champion of Rex a one

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.780 
looking at the new champion of Rex a one
of<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.350> really<00:00:04.589> cool<00:00:04.770> things<00:00:04.830> about<00:00:05.370> her<00:00:05.609> is

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
of the really cool things about her is

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.670 
of the really cool things about her is
her<00:00:06.060> tunnel<00:00:06.540> system<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.109> she<00:00:07.290> use<00:00:07.440> is

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
her tunnel system that she use is

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.200 
her tunnel system that she use is
something<00:00:08.040> we've<00:00:08.130> never<00:00:08.340> seen<00:00:08.610> before<00:00:08.820> and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
something we've never seen before and

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.730 
something we've never seen before and
that's<00:00:09.420> what<00:00:09.570> we're<00:00:09.690> gonna<00:00:09.750> look<00:00:10.019> at<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.590> when

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
that's what we're gonna look at so when

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.470 
that's what we're gonna look at so when
you<00:00:10.830> activate<00:00:11.250> your<00:00:11.400> W<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.120> burrow

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
you activate your W you burrow

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.910 
you activate your W you burrow
underground<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.380> then<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.679> create

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
underground and then you can create

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.129 
underground and then you can create
these<00:00:14.190> tunnels<00:00:14.730> now<00:00:15.120> after<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> short<00:00:15.719> time<00:00:15.929> you

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
these tunnels now after a short time you

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.200 
these tunnels now after a short time you
click<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.410> them<00:00:16.619> again<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.250> go<00:00:17.640> between<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
click on them again and go between the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.330 
click on them again and go between the
two<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.840> tell<00:00:19.020> an<00:00:19.109> enemy<00:00:19.439> steps<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:19.980> them<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
two and tell an enemy steps on them and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.429 
two and tell an enemy steps on them and
remove<00:00:20.699> them<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> first<00:00:21.720> cool<00:00:22.020> thing<00:00:22.230> with

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
remove them so the first cool thing with

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.590 
remove them so the first cool thing with
this<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.830> how<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.070> vision<00:00:23.580> works<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.240> so

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
this is how the vision works with it so

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.720 
this is how the vision works with it so
as<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.960> see<00:00:25.019> when<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.560> can't<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.279> rec<00:00:26.490> side

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
as you can see when I can't see rec side

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.310 
as you can see when I can't see rec side
the<00:00:27.060> tunnels<00:00:27.570> don't<00:00:27.779> show<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the tunnels don't show up on the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.960 
the tunnels don't show up on the
mini-map<00:00:28.560> even<00:00:29.070> though<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.279> get<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> really

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
mini-map even though you get a really

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.790 
mini-map even though you get a really
quick<00:00:30.330> glimpse<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.929> her<00:00:31.080> as<00:00:31.230> she<00:00:31.260> goes<00:00:31.529> between

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
quick glimpse of her as she goes between

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
quick glimpse of her as she goes between
the<00:00:32.009> bushes<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.540> see<00:00:33.780> her<00:00:33.899> use<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the bushes when you do see her use it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.959 
the bushes when you do see her use it
though<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.739> entrance<00:00:35.309> will<00:00:35.520> stay<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
though that entrance will stay on the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.819 
though that entrance will stay on the
mini-map<00:00:36.180> until<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.750> times<00:00:36.989> out<00:00:37.200> or<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.680> gets

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
mini-map until it times out or it gets

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.010 
mini-map until it times out or it gets
removed<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> don't<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.450> vision<00:00:39.719> of

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
removed but if you don't have vision of

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.970 
removed but if you don't have vision of
where<00:00:40.230> she<00:00:40.440> ends<00:00:40.559> up

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
where she ends up

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.410 
where she ends up
you<00:00:41.100> want<00:00:41.280> actually<00:00:41.489> see<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> exit<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.270> your

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
you want actually see the exit on your

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.869 
you want actually see the exit on your
mini-map<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> cool<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.670> what

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
mini-map now the cool thing is and what

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.549 
mini-map now the cool thing is and what
most<00:00:45.090> people<00:00:45.450> won't<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.809> picked<00:00:45.989> up<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.350> yet

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
most people won't have picked up on yet

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.770 
most people won't have picked up on yet
is<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.700> her<00:00:47.910> cast<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.450> tunnel

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
is that if you see her cast a tunnel

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.389 
is that if you see her cast a tunnel
then<00:00:49.079> there<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> dust<00:00:49.920> cloud<00:00:50.190> that

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
then there is this dust cloud that

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.220 
then there is this dust cloud that
appears<00:00:50.820> where<00:00:51.059> she's<00:00:51.270> tunneled<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.079> where

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
appears where she's tunneled to so where

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.010 
appears where she's tunneled to so where
the<00:00:52.350> X<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.710> these<00:00:53.520> clips<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.210> exactly<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the X is these clips are exactly the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.930 
the X is these clips are exactly the
same<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> first<00:00:55.710> ones<00:00:56.039> except<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.699> see

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
same as the first ones except we can see

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.000 
same as the first ones except we can see
her<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.329> she<00:00:57.360> uses<00:00:57.899> them<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.559> not<00:00:58.710> only<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:58.980> we

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
her as she uses them so not only do we

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.979 
her as she uses them so not only do we
get<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> entrance<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.120> mini<00:01:00.329> map<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:00.960> we

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
get the entrance on that mini map but we

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.319 
get the entrance on that mini map but we
can<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> dustcloud<00:01:02.010> animation<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.120> where

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
can see the dustcloud animation of where

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.969 
can see the dustcloud animation of where
she<00:01:03.539> lands<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.350> where<00:01:04.589> she<00:01:04.739> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
she lands so we know where she is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.980 
she lands so we know where she is
all<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.420> how<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> works

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
all right so now we know how it works

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.630 
all right so now we know how it works
kind<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.500> we're<00:01:07.590> gonna<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.159> Tips<00:01:08.430> &amp;

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
kind of we're gonna go on to the Tips &amp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.969 
kind of we're gonna go on to the Tips &amp;
Tricks<00:01:08.700> par<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.540> actual<00:01:10.020> interesting<00:01:10.680> stuff

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
Tricks par the actual interesting stuff

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.980 
Tricks par the actual interesting stuff
so<00:01:11.280> her<00:01:11.610> tunnel<00:01:11.939> system<00:01:12.330> means<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> can

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
so her tunnel system means that you can

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.380 
so her tunnel system means that you can
bypass<00:01:13.229> wards<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.250> easily<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:14.909> remember

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
bypass wards really easily but remember

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.090 
bypass wards really easily but remember
that<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.689> ear<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> gap

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that your ear you can also be a gap

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.039 
that your ear you can also be a gap
closer<00:01:17.400> into<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> gank<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.720> may<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
closer into a gank so you may have to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.990 
closer into a gank so you may have to
sit<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.380> wait<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.770> its<00:01:19.890> cooldown<00:01:20.310> let's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
sit and wait for its cooldown let's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
sit and wait for its cooldown let's
start<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.450> cheesy<00:01:21.810> gank<00:01:22.140> top<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
start with this cheesy gank top and a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.890 
start with this cheesy gank top and a
lot<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.280> laners<00:01:23.640> don't<00:01:23.909> Ward<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.270> brush<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
lot of laners don't Ward this brush that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
lot of laners don't Ward this brush that
ward<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> river<00:01:25.470> or<00:01:25.770> actually<00:01:26.310> probably<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
ward the river or actually probably that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
ward the river or actually probably that
is<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.330> gonna<00:01:27.479> ward<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:27.840> all<00:01:28.049> honestly<00:01:28.500> which

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
is not gonna ward at all honestly which

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
is not gonna ward at all honestly which
means<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.220> won't<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.790> sneak<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.270> here

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
means they won't see you sneak in here

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.990 
means they won't see you sneak in here
now<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:30.900> by<00:01:31.259> some<00:01:31.320> miracle<00:01:31.590> they<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.460> actually

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
now if by some miracle they do actually

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.819 
now if by some miracle they do actually
Ward<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.450> brush<00:01:33.689> then<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.650> this

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
Ward the brush then you can do this

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.890 
Ward the brush then you can do this
instead<00:01:35.340> over<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.939> back<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.329> Baron<00:01:36.720> pit

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
instead over the back of the Baron pit

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.260 
instead over the back of the Baron pit
into<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.500> brush<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.729> into<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> brush

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
into this brush now going into the brush

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.420 
into this brush now going into the brush
means<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.560> unlikely<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
means that they are really unlikely to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.249 
means that they are really unlikely to
ever<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.060> entrance<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> lets<00:01:43.110> you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
ever see this entrance and it lets you

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.770 
ever see this entrance and it lets you
get<00:01:43.439> behind<00:01:43.649> mid<00:01:44.130> top<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:44.820> even<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.420> counter

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
get behind mid top or even just counter

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
get behind mid top or even just counter
jungle<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> first<00:01:47.280> way<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.520> hit

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
jungle so that's the first way to hit

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.480 
jungle so that's the first way to hit
mid<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> most<00:01:49.079> common<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.860> bypass

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
mid to but the most common one to bypass

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.310 
mid to but the most common one to bypass
wards<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> river<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.780> go<00:01:51.930> straight

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
wards in the river is to go straight

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.469 
wards in the river is to go straight
over<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.070> now<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> lot<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.820> people<00:01:53.970> pink

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
over like this now a lot of people pink

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.450 
over like this now a lot of people pink
the<00:01:54.659> river<00:01:54.869> brushes<00:01:55.380> now<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.310> much

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the river brushes now but not so much

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
the river brushes now but not so much
these<00:01:56.759> side<00:01:57.060> ones<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> lets<00:01:57.930> them<00:01:58.079> feel

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
these side ones so it lets them feel

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.080 
these side ones so it lets them feel
safe<00:01:58.619> even<00:01:59.100> when<00:01:59.219> they're<00:01:59.340> actually<00:01:59.460> boned

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
safe even when they're actually boned

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.179 
safe even when they're actually boned
now<00:02:00.420> botlane<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.020> probably<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.770> lane<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
now botlane is probably the lane that is

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.980 
now botlane is probably the lane that is
the<00:02:02.399> most<00:02:02.579> difficult<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.360> gank<00:02:03.600> or<00:02:03.810> what

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the most difficult to gank or what

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.780 
the most difficult to gank or what
people<00:02:04.170> find<00:02:04.560> most<00:02:04.799> difficult<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.579> there<00:02:05.700> are

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
people find most difficult but there are

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.219 
people find most difficult but there are
a<00:02:05.820> couple<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.329> things<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.689> can<00:02:06.810> actually<00:02:06.930> do

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
a couple of things you can actually do

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.930 
a couple of things you can actually do
which<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.469> pretty<00:02:07.680> cool<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.459> first<00:02:08.729> one

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
which are pretty cool and the first one

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.390 
which are pretty cool and the first one
is<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.479> over<00:02:09.810> dragon<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.069> sucks

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
is going over dragon and this one sucks

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.220 
is going over dragon and this one sucks
is<00:02:11.580> they<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> crab<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:12.780> if

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
is they have the crab but if

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.050 
is they have the crab but if
not<00:02:13.349> your<00:02:13.530> skip<00:02:13.860> pass<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.340> most<00:02:14.519> likely<00:02:14.760> bot

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
not your skip pass the most likely bot

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.600 
not your skip pass the most likely bot
and<00:02:15.269> mid<00:02:15.629> lane<00:02:15.780> wards<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.409> from<00:02:16.980> here<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.459> can

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
and mid lane wards but from here you can

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.089 
and mid lane wards but from here you can
either<00:02:17.849> go<00:02:18.120> straight<00:02:18.150> down<00:02:18.690> or<00:02:18.930> be<00:02:19.260> even<00:02:19.890> more

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
either go straight down or be even more

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.550 
either go straight down or be even more
sneaky<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.940> loop<00:02:21.150> up<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.540> do<00:02:21.959> as<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:22.110> did<00:02:22.409> for

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
sneaky and loop up and do as we did for

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.740 
sneaky and loop up and do as we did for
the<00:02:22.650> top<00:02:22.860> lane<00:02:23.069> gank<00:02:23.370> now<00:02:23.849> honestly<00:02:24.299> doing

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
the top lane gank now honestly doing

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.990 
the top lane gank now honestly doing
both<00:02:25.019> over<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.590> dragon<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.190> over<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.730> wall

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
both over the dragon and over this wall

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.330 
both over the dragon and over this wall
is<00:02:27.239> kind<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.959> waste<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.379> time<00:02:28.650> really<00:02:28.920> but

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
is kind of a waste of time really but

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.130 
is kind of a waste of time really but
doing<00:02:29.700> one<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:29.940> them<00:02:30.239> depending<00:02:30.870> on<00:02:30.959> their

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
doing one of them depending on their

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.320 
doing one of them depending on their
wards<00:02:31.470> art<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.830> actually<00:02:32.129> a<00:02:32.190> good<00:02:32.310> idea<00:02:32.370> okay

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
wards art is actually a good idea okay

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.759 
wards art is actually a good idea okay
so<00:02:33.390> there's<00:02:33.569> one<00:02:33.780> more<00:02:33.959> for<00:02:34.140> bot<00:02:34.319> Lane<00:02:34.470> and

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
so there's one more for bot Lane and

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.259 
so there's one more for bot Lane and
this<00:02:34.890> has<00:02:35.040> actually<00:02:35.340> killed<00:02:35.519> me<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.819> lot<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
this has actually killed me a lot in the

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.089 
this has actually killed me a lot in the
last<00:02:36.360> couple<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.870> days<00:02:37.049> so<00:02:37.410> going<00:02:37.799> over<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
last couple of days so going over the

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.949 
last couple of days so going over the
dragon<00:02:38.280> wall<00:02:38.640> waiting<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.360> cooldown<00:02:39.780> in

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
dragon wall waiting for the cooldown in

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.839 
dragon wall waiting for the cooldown in
case<00:02:40.170> tries<00:02:40.560> warded<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.280> then<00:02:41.430> going<00:02:41.760> over

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
case tries warded and then going over

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.729 
case tries warded and then going over
the<00:02:42.090> corner<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.629> this<00:02:42.870> wall<00:02:43.140> into<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> lane

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
the corner of this wall into the lane

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.920 
the corner of this wall into the lane
and<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.220> wrecking<00:02:44.640> me<00:02:44.819> now<00:02:45.299> people<00:02:45.629> often

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
and just wrecking me now people often

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.720 
and just wrecking me now people often
don't<00:02:46.410> walk<00:02:46.650> behind<00:02:46.860> them<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.489> this<00:02:47.670> is

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
don't walk behind them so this is

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.610 
don't walk behind them so this is
probably<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.390> highest<00:02:48.750> percentage<00:02:49.230> gank<00:02:49.500> you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
probably the highest percentage gank you

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.559 
probably the highest percentage gank you
can<00:02:49.829> do<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.430> can<00:02:50.640> only<00:02:50.879> do<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.209> on<00:02:51.299> red

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
can do but you can only do it on red

ultimate bad-mannered gang really cheesy

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.839 
ultimate bad-mannered gang really cheesy
on<00:02:57.930> top<00:02:58.170> lane<00:02:58.379> and<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:58.799> hella<00:02:59.010> Darius<00:02:59.519> if<00:02:59.730> it

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
on top lane and it's hella Darius if it

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.119 
on top lane and it's hella Darius if it
works<00:03:00.120> go<00:03:00.690> into<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.049> first<00:03:01.230> brush<00:03:01.560> create<00:03:02.099> a

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
works go into the first brush create a

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.770 
works go into the first brush create a
tunnel<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.670> second<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.390> then<00:03:03.540> leave

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
tunnel to the second one and then leave

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.809 
tunnel to the second one and then leave
the<00:03:03.930> lane<00:03:04.140> when<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.769> laner<00:03:04.950> pushes<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.579> you

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
the lane when the laner pushes up you

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.640 
the lane when the laner pushes up you
can<00:03:05.940> activate<00:03:06.420> your<00:03:06.480> ultimate<00:03:07.019> behind<00:03:07.410> them

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
can activate your ultimate behind them

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.440 
can activate your ultimate behind them
and<00:03:07.890> they<00:03:08.160> are<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:08.430> pretty<00:03:08.790> much<00:03:09.030> screwed

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
and they are just pretty much screwed

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.360 
and they are just pretty much screwed
you're<00:03:09.690> right<00:03:10.079> there<00:03:10.349> in<00:03:10.440> front<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.739> them<00:03:10.950> now

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
you're right there in front of them now

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.890 
you're right there in front of them now
let's<00:03:11.579> be<00:03:11.730> honest<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.120> will<00:03:12.299> only<00:03:12.629> probably

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
let's be honest this will only probably

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.990 
let's be honest this will only probably
work<00:03:13.140> once<00:03:13.440> unless<00:03:14.010> they're<00:03:14.190> really<00:03:14.400> dumb<00:03:14.970> but

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
work once unless they're really dumb but

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.240 
work once unless they're really dumb but
it's<00:03:15.359> really<00:03:15.900> funny<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.260> people<00:03:16.739> hate<00:03:17.040> this

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
it's really funny and people hate this

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.289 
it's really funny and people hate this
happening<00:03:17.609> to<00:03:17.819> them

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
happening to them

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.180 
happening to them
so<00:03:18.660> apart<00:03:18.900> from<00:03:18.989> ganking<00:03:19.590> tunnels<00:03:19.980> are<00:03:20.040> also

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
so apart from ganking tunnels are also

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.920 
so apart from ganking tunnels are also
really<00:03:20.549> good<00:03:20.760> just<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.030> have<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.239> network<00:03:21.569> on

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
really good just to have a network on

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.449 
really good just to have a network on
them<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.319> can<00:03:22.500> react<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.919> things<00:03:23.069> around

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
them so you can react to things around

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.159 
them so you can react to things around
the<00:03:23.549> map<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.970> kind<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.359> move<00:03:24.540> around<00:03:24.660> quicker

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
the map and kind of move around quicker

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.650 
the map and kind of move around quicker
the<00:03:25.739> first<00:03:25.980> one<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.430> for<00:03:26.700> Dragon<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.359> also

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
the first one is for Dragon and also

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.909 
the first one is for Dragon and also
lets<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.989> get<00:03:28.139> to<00:03:28.290> your<00:03:28.410> read<00:03:28.620> quicker

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
lets you get to your read quicker

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.710 
lets you get to your read quicker
placing<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:29.700> entrance<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.209> brush<00:03:30.450> here

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
placing the entrance in the brush here

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.509 
placing the entrance in the brush here
means<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.049> even<00:03:31.410> if<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.650> enemy<00:03:31.829> wards<00:03:32.190> over

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
means that even if the enemy wards over

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.370 
means that even if the enemy wards over
dragon<00:03:32.790> they<00:03:33.180> won't<00:03:33.480> see<00:03:33.690> your<00:03:33.780> tunnel<00:03:34.200> and

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
dragon they won't see your tunnel and

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.440 
dragon they won't see your tunnel and
they<00:03:34.680> won't<00:03:34.919> expect<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.489> show<00:03:35.669> up<00:03:35.849> the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
they won't expect you to show up the

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.509 
they won't expect you to show up the
next<00:03:36.750> two<00:03:36.900> are<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.319> get<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.620> bots<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:37.980> top<00:03:38.340> lane

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
next two are to get to bots and top lane

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.129 
next two are to get to bots and top lane
quickly<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.239> just<00:03:39.419> putting<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.780> tunnel

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
quickly and it's just putting the tunnel

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.170 
quickly and it's just putting the tunnel
behind<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.650> lane<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:41.280> enemy<00:03:41.609> will<00:03:41.790> literally

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
behind the lane the enemy will literally

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.599 
behind the lane the enemy will literally
never<00:03:42.540> go<00:03:42.780> back<00:03:42.989> here<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.560> have<00:03:43.859> no<00:03:44.130> danger

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
never go back here so you have no danger

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.430 
never go back here so you have no danger
of<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.790> getting<00:03:45.060> stomped<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.630> can<00:03:45.840> always<00:03:46.230> get

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
of it getting stomped and can always get

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.800 
of it getting stomped and can always get
there<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:47.250> file<00:03:47.459> safe<00:03:47.790> tunnel<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.359> for<00:03:48.630> mid

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
there the file safe tunnel is for mid

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.960 
there the file safe tunnel is for mid
and<00:03:48.989> baron<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.739> in<00:03:49.889> this<00:03:50.069> brush<00:03:50.370> now<00:03:50.819> this

is<00:03:51.120> great<00:03:51.269> if<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.599> can<00:03:51.750> see<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.169> enemy

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
is great if you can see the enemy

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.720 
is great if you can see the enemy
jungler<00:03:52.680> coming<00:03:53.069> mid<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.489> want<00:03:53.639> to
