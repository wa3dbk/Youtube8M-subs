00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
anyway let's get straight on to the next

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.330 
anyway let's get straight on to the next
step<00:02:02.670> what<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.690> next<00:02:03.990> need<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.890> you

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
step what you next need is to just you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.030 
step what you next need is to just you
need<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> get<00:02:05.760> into<00:02:06.030> space<00:02:06.330> game<00:02:06.660> space

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
need to get into space game space

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.960 
need to get into space game space
probably<00:02:08.040> one<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> hardest<00:02:08.550> thing<00:02:08.760> to<00:02:08.790> do

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
probably one of the hardest thing to do

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.760 
probably one of the hardest thing to do
with<00:02:09.119> long<00:02:09.330> shot<00:02:09.600> but<00:02:10.080> defenders<00:02:10.560> always

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
with long shot but defenders always

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.650 
with long shot but defenders always
running<00:02:11.100> at<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.430> because<00:02:11.970> I'm<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.270> scaler<00:02:12.570> I

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
running at you because I'm a scaler I

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.050 
running at you because I'm a scaler I
always<00:02:13.080> try<00:02:13.950> these<00:02:14.130> drag<00:02:14.460> backs<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.940> end

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
always try these drag backs the end

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.360 
always try these drag backs the end
space<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.720> usually<00:02:16.110> works<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:17.100> when<00:02:17.250> you're

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
space it usually works but when you're

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.860 
space it usually works but when you're
off<00:02:17.430> balance<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.210> you're<00:02:18.330> surrounded<00:02:18.840> by

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
off balance and you're surrounded by

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.440 
off balance and you're surrounded by
players<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.800> you're<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.790> not<00:02:20.940> gonna<00:02:21.090> score

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
players just you're just not gonna score

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.360 
players just you're just not gonna score
like<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:21.780> there's<00:02:22.560> obviously<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.010> small

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
like this there's obviously a small

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.860 
like this there's obviously a small
chance<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.850> when<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.030> do<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.300> it's<00:02:24.420> good<00:02:24.630> but

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
chance and when you do it it's good but

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.840 
chance and when you do it it's good but
you're<00:02:25.500> not<00:02:25.590> gonna<00:02:25.770> do<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.040> every<00:02:26.280> time<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:26.820> I

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
you're not gonna do it every time so I

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.390 
you're not gonna do it every time so I
just<00:02:27.120> start<00:02:27.510> by<00:02:27.720> getting<00:02:28.620> into<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.860> good<00:02:29.100> amount

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
just start by getting into a good amount

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.970 
just start by getting into a good amount
of<00:02:29.460> space<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.870> guys<00:02:31.080> as<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.890> this

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
of space so guys as you can see in this

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.330 
of space so guys as you can see in this

I<00:02:32.370> took<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.610> ball<00:02:32.760> dragged<00:02:33.180> back<00:02:33.390> with<00:02:33.570> Rooney

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
I took a ball dragged back with Rooney

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.420 
I took a ball dragged back with Rooney
to<00:02:33.960> getting<00:02:34.170> some<00:02:34.350> space<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.040> hammer

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
to getting some space and I just hammer

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.460 
to getting some space and I just hammer
it<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:36.209> was<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.600> unlucky<00:02:36.810> not<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.140> go<00:02:37.350> in

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
it it was really unlucky not to go in

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.220 
it it was really unlucky not to go in
but<00:02:37.680> because<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.489> got<00:02:39.120> into<00:02:39.450> my<00:02:39.630> top<00:02:39.959> 5

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
but because of that it got into my top 5

link in the description but in that clip
you<00:02:44.430> could<00:02:44.610> see<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.120> was<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.390> plenty<00:02:45.780> of

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
you could see that I was in plenty of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.050 
you could see that I was in plenty of
space<00:02:46.200> really<00:02:47.160> was<00:02:47.280> pretty<00:02:47.459> much<00:02:47.640> under<00:02:47.880> no

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
space really was pretty much under no

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.300 
space really was pretty much under no
pressure<00:02:48.090> at<00:02:48.600> all<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:49.560> took<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:49.980> there

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
pressure at all so I just took it there

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.479 
pressure at all so I just took it there
and<00:02:50.580> that's<00:02:50.910> why<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.270> came<00:02:51.570> off<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:51.989> well<00:02:52.489> so

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
and that's why it came off so well so

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.130 
and that's why it came off so well so
guys<00:02:53.670> now<00:02:53.940> it's<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.239> most<00:02:54.360> important<00:02:54.840> part<00:02:55.080> of

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
guys now it's the most important part of

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.380 
guys now it's the most important part of
a<00:02:55.230> long<00:02:55.440> shot<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:56.130> correct<00:02:56.459> charge<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.239> might

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
a long shot the correct charge you might

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.360 
a long shot the correct charge you might
call<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.630> power<00:02:57.900> but<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.410> just<00:02:58.860> call<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.040> charge

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
call it power but I just call it charge

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.210 
call it power but I just call it charge
of<00:02:59.520> some<00:02:59.700> reason<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.840> I'm<00:03:01.050> 30<00:03:01.590> yards<00:03:01.950> you'll<00:03:02.100> at

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
of some reason so I'm 30 yards you'll at

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.970 
of some reason so I'm 30 yards you'll at
least<00:03:02.340> need<00:03:03.000> three<00:03:03.330> bars<00:03:03.570> 20<00:03:04.380> yards<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.800> need

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
least need three bars 20 yards you need

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.000

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
corner in that situation it was just

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.470 
corner in that situation it was just
barely<00:03:30.130> 30<00:03:30.520> yards<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.240> could<00:03:31.390> have

barely 30 yards so that could have

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.540 
barely 30 yards so that could have
easily<00:03:31.570> gone<00:03:31.900> over<00:03:32.260> but<00:03:32.440> hopes<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:33.160> good<00:03:33.340> long

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550

normal<00:03:52.570> long<00:03:52.870> shots<00:03:53.140> as<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.380> don't<00:03:53.650> need<00:03:53.830> as

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
normal long shots as you don't need as

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.280 
normal long shots as you don't need as
much<00:03:54.250> power<00:03:54.640> as<00:03:54.940> they<00:03:55.420> can<00:03:55.600> get<00:03:55.720> really<00:03:56.020> high

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
much power as they can get really high

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.930 
much power as they can get really high
and<00:03:56.530> just<00:03:56.650> get<00:03:56.890> top<00:03:57.100> corner<00:03:57.520> quite<00:03:57.730> easily

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
and just get top corner quite easily

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.680 
and just get top corner quite easily
finesse<00:03:58.930> is<00:03:59.050> a<00:03:59.110> quite<00:03:59.320> overpowered<00:03:59.710> b14<00:04:00.690> from

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
finesse is a quite overpowered b14 from

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.660 
finesse is a quite overpowered b14 from
far<00:04:01.930> distances<00:04:02.440> anyway<00:04:02.860> up<00:04:03.070> close<00:04:03.400> they're

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
far distances anyway up close they're

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.840 
far distances anyway up close they're
not<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.910> best<00:04:04.150> but<00:04:04.450> um<00:04:04.660> in<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:06.310> example<00:04:06.760> I've

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
not the best but um in the example I've

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.030 
not the best but um in the example I've
got<00:04:07.090> for<00:04:07.270> you<00:04:07.360> in<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.540> minute<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.050> goes<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.830> it

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
got for you in a minute it goes and it

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.650 
got for you in a minute it goes and it
hits<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.340> ground<00:04:09.550> before<00:04:09.730> it<00:04:10.210> goes<00:04:10.360> in<00:04:10.540> the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
hits the ground before it goes in the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.210 
hits the ground before it goes in the
goal<00:04:10.870> but<00:04:11.080> don't<00:04:11.650> think<00:04:11.830> it's<00:04:11.920> quite<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.160> good

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
goal but don't think it's quite a good

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.670 
goal but don't think it's quite a good
example<00:04:12.700> for<00:04:13.480> volleys<00:04:13.840> also<00:04:14.200> I've<00:04:14.260> got<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.440> very

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
example for volleys also I've got a very

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.890 
example for volleys also I've got a very
good<00:04:14.710> example<00:04:15.060> but<00:04:16.060> they<00:04:16.239> need<00:04:16.420> around<00:04:16.750> the

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
good example but they need around the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.050 
good example but they need around the
same<00:04:17.109> power<00:04:17.350> as<00:04:17.380> normal<00:04:17.859> long<00:04:18.010> shots<00:04:18.310> but<00:04:18.609> if

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
same power as normal long shots but if

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.949 
same power as normal long shots but if
you<00:04:19.210> go<00:04:19.359> crazy<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.989> they<00:04:20.140> can<00:04:20.350> just

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
you go crazy and they can just

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.379 
you go crazy and they can just
and<00:04:21.320> lose<00:04:21.470> control<00:04:21.979> so<00:04:22.340> let's<00:04:22.940> go<00:04:23.120> on<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.240> the

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
and lose control so let's go on to the

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.020 
and lose control so let's go on to the
examples<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.770> guys<00:04:24.949> here<00:04:25.220> we<00:04:25.340> are<00:04:25.370> on<00:04:25.639> to<00:04:25.850> the

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
examples so guys here we are on to the

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.180 
examples so guys here we are on to the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
three bars of power and it just curls

check<00:05:08.900> out<00:05:09.020> my<00:05:09.139> compilation<00:05:09.800> often<00:05:10.580> I<00:05:10.669> use<00:05:10.820> a

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
check out my compilation often I use a

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.310 
check out my compilation often I use a
skill<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:11.330> then<00:05:11.419> straight<00:05:11.810> off<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.139> take<00:05:12.260> a

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
skill and then straight off to take a

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.020 
skill and then straight off to take a

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
shot and it improves the long shot it

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
will go in on to the next part using

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.060 
will go in on to the next part using
full<00:05:17.090> bars<00:05:17.270> of<00:05:17.419> power<00:05:17.570> will<00:05:18.110> screw<00:05:18.680> you<00:05:18.889> over

basically<00:05:19.789> I've<00:05:20.389> seen<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.810> few<00:05:21.320> goals<00:05:21.919> where

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
basically I've seen a few goals where

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.740 
basically I've seen a few goals where
it's<00:05:22.280> been<00:05:22.430> complete<00:05:22.820> full<00:05:23.060> power<00:05:23.330> but<00:05:23.389> most

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
it's been complete full power but most

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.870 
it's been complete full power but most
of<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.960> time<00:05:24.169> it<00:05:24.680> will<00:05:24.800> just<00:05:24.979> screw<00:05:25.340> over<00:05:25.580> and

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
of the time it will just screw over and

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.180 
of the time it will just screw over and
fly<00:05:26.240> somewhere<00:05:26.690> wildly<00:05:27.289> but<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.770> lot<00:05:27.919> of<00:05:27.949> times

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
fly somewhere wildly but a lot of times

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.310 
fly somewhere wildly but a lot of times
it<00:05:28.340> can<00:05:28.460> happen<00:05:28.820> by<00:05:28.970> mistake<00:05:29.120> as<00:05:29.720> when<00:05:30.169> I<00:05:30.199> took

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
it can happen by mistake as when I took

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.320 
it can happen by mistake as when I took
my<00:05:30.470> volley<00:05:31.099> with<00:05:31.310> Rooney<00:05:31.699> it<00:05:31.880> could<00:05:32.090> have<00:05:32.210> been

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
my volley with Rooney it could have been

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.750 
my volley with Rooney it could have been
full<00:05:32.690> power<00:05:32.960> but<00:05:33.080> it<00:05:33.320> was<00:05:33.349> just<00:05:33.740> under<00:05:34.099> it's

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
full power but it was just under it's

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.790 
full power but it was just under it's
definitely<00:05:35.479> turned<00:05:35.720> out<00:05:35.870> well<00:05:36.080> for<00:05:36.289> me<00:05:36.470> as<00:05:36.650> I

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
definitely turned out well for me as I

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.770 
definitely turned out well for me as I
didn't<00:05:37.099> hold<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:37.340> for<00:05:37.520> like<00:05:37.639> a<00:05:37.880> millisecond

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
didn't hold it for like a millisecond

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.290 
didn't hold it for like a millisecond
longer

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
longer

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.200 
longer
but<00:05:39.979> as<00:05:40.979> you<00:05:41.220> can<00:05:41.310> see<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:41.580> comes<00:05:41.819> off<00:05:42.000> when

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
but as you can see it comes off when

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.240 
but as you can see it comes off when
it's<00:05:42.330> just<00:05:42.539> under<00:05:42.930> it<00:05:43.080> if<00:05:43.560> you<00:05:43.770> have<00:05:43.919> a<00:05:43.949> full

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
it's just under it if you have a full

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.689 
it's just under it if you have a full
power<00:05:44.550> it<00:05:44.879> will<00:05:45.060> just<00:05:45.240> go<00:05:45.419> crazy<00:05:45.690> so<00:05:46.520> that's<00:05:47.520> my

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
power it will just go crazy so that's my

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.490 
power it will just go crazy so that's my
last<00:05:47.879> tip<00:05:48.180> and<00:05:48.389> I<00:05:48.750> hope<00:05:48.930> you've<00:05:49.080> enjoyed<00:05:49.349> the
