00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
of a second in my life where a neuron

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.839 
of a second in my life where a neuron
fired<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.410> one<00:02:23.739> direction<00:02:23.920> rather<00:02:24.430> than<00:02:24.700> the

that<00:02:29.829> action<00:02:31.530> all<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.920> those<00:02:33.120> fragments<00:02:34.120> of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that action all of those fragments of

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.350 
that action all of those fragments of
time<00:02:34.720> added<00:02:34.930> together<00:02:35.519> would<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.640> equate<00:02:37.329> to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
time added together would it equate to

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.220 
time added together would it equate to
at<00:02:37.569> least<00:02:37.840> five<00:02:38.260> minutes<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:39.989> can't<00:02:40.989> help<00:02:41.079> but

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
at least five minutes I can't help but

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.809 
at least five minutes I can't help but

those shoulda coulda woulda moments that
