laka laka I think it's so humongous that
many<00:00:41.610> groups<00:00:41.910> can't<00:00:42.239> even<00:00:42.510> fit<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.719> stage<00:00:43.079> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
many groups can't even fit on stage so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.470 
many groups can't even fit on stage so
