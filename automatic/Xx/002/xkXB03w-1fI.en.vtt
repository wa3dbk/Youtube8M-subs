hi I'm Mike Rooney today's free art
lesson<00:00:09.259> is<00:00:09.320> going<00:00:09.410> to<00:00:09.469> be<00:00:09.530> on<00:00:09.740> paint<00:00:10.040> and<00:00:10.190> glass

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
lesson is going to be on paint and glass

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.629 
lesson is going to be on paint and glass
I<00:00:11.139> get<00:00:12.139> a<00:00:12.169> lot<00:00:12.379> of<00:00:12.500> emails<00:00:12.860> and<00:00:13.219> people<00:00:13.370> say

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
I get a lot of emails and people say

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.699 
I get a lot of emails and people say
Mike<00:00:13.910> how<00:00:14.089> do<00:00:14.150> you<00:00:14.360> how<00:00:14.570> are<00:00:14.870> you<00:00:14.900> capturing

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
Mike how do you how are you capturing

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.370 
Mike how do you how are you capturing
glass<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:16.910> it's<00:00:17.300> really<00:00:17.689> really<00:00:17.930> simple<00:00:18.289> if

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
glass and it's really really simple if

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.920 
glass and it's really really simple if
you<00:00:18.500> follow<00:00:18.740> a<00:00:18.859> couple<00:00:19.599> procedures<00:00:20.599> and<00:00:20.810> one

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
you follow a couple procedures and one

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.259 
you follow a couple procedures and one
of<00:00:21.109> them<00:00:21.260> is<00:00:21.439> to<00:00:21.619> think<00:00:21.859> of<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.099> glass<00:00:22.369> as<00:00:22.670> just

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
of them is to think of the glass as just

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.120 
of them is to think of the glass as just
having<00:00:23.390> edges<00:00:24.019> instead<00:00:24.320> of<00:00:24.560> trying<00:00:24.800> to<00:00:24.890> think

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
having edges instead of trying to think

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.849 
having edges instead of trying to think
of<00:00:25.279> it<00:00:25.429> as<00:00:25.519> what<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:26.210> is<00:00:26.240> just<00:00:27.199> think<00:00:27.439> of<00:00:27.619> it<00:00:27.710> as

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
of it as what it is just think of it as

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.859 
of it as what it is just think of it as
edges<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:28.609> only<00:00:28.820> paint<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.179> shapes<00:00:29.449> that<00:00:29.599> you

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
edges and only paint the shapes that you

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.790 
edges and only paint the shapes that you
see<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:31.429> may<00:00:31.609> be<00:00:31.670> a<00:00:31.820> two-part<00:00:32.500> so<00:00:33.500> look<00:00:33.710> at

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
see so this may be a two-part so look at

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.410 
see so this may be a two-part so look at
this<00:00:33.920> part<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:34.489> then<00:00:34.610> check<00:00:34.850> out<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:35.149> next

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.770 
let's go ahead and begin what I'm going
to<00:00:45.559> do<00:00:45.680> is<00:00:45.829> lightly<00:00:46.460> draw<00:00:46.699> it<00:00:46.850> in<00:00:46.969> in<00:00:47.180> washes<00:00:47.629> of

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
to do is lightly draw it in in washes of

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.080 
to do is lightly draw it in in washes of
magenta<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:48.559> try<00:00:49.219> to<00:00:49.280> figure<00:00:49.520> out<00:00:49.640> what<00:00:49.969> the

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
magenta and try to figure out what the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.630 
magenta and try to figure out what the
major<00:00:50.300> masses<00:00:50.960> are<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:51.469> get<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.039> shape<00:00:52.309> drawn

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
major masses are and get the shape drawn

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.790 
major masses are and get the shape drawn
on<00:00:52.879> there<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:53.780> what<00:00:53.930> I'm<00:00:54.050> going<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.199> do<00:00:54.440> is

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
on there so what I'm going to do is

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.860 
on there so what I'm going to do is
let's<00:00:55.219> move<00:00:55.430> this<00:00:55.609> over<00:00:55.789> just<00:00:56.270> a<00:00:56.449> little<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:56.780> I

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
let's move this over just a little so I

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.130 
let's move this over just a little so I
can<00:00:57.050> get<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:58.149> so<00:00:59.149> I<00:00:59.210> can<00:00:59.480> get<00:00:59.629> that<00:00:59.809> shadow

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
can get that so I can get that shadow

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.209 
can get that so I can get that shadow
there<00:01:00.680> we<00:01:00.800> go

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
there we go

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.709 
there we go
alright<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.000> what<00:01:02.120> I'm<00:01:02.239> going<00:01:02.329> to<00:01:02.390> do<00:01:02.510> is<00:01:02.629> I'm

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
alright so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.250 
alright so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.870> go<00:01:03.019> with<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:03.230> high<00:01:04.930> horizon<00:01:05.930> on<00:01:06.050> this

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
going to go with a high horizon on this

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.630 
going to go with a high horizon on this
one<00:01:06.410> in<00:01:06.530> other<00:01:06.650> words<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.040> glass<00:01:07.250> is<00:01:07.430> going<00:01:07.580> to

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
one in other words the glass is going to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.970 
one in other words the glass is going to
be<00:01:07.730> very<00:01:07.970> close<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.780> top<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.320> then<00:01:09.770> never

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
be very close to the top and then never

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.560 
be very close to the top and then never
put<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.490> right<00:01:10.640> in<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.940> middle<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:11.330> I'm<00:01:11.420> just

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
put it right in the middle and I'm just

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.570 
put it right in the middle and I'm just
going<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.840> draw<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.230> shape<00:01:12.650> of<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:13.100> right<00:01:14.030> here

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
going to draw the shape of it right here

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.430 
going to draw the shape of it right here
and<00:01:16.580> just<00:01:16.820> draw<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.270> that<00:01:17.480> square<00:01:17.900> then<00:01:18.320> I'm

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
and just draw in that square then I'm

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.650 
and just draw in that square then I'm
gonna<00:01:18.560> draw<00:01:18.830> in<00:01:19.040> where<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.430> cloth<00:01:20.060> ends<00:01:20.510> in

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
gonna draw in where the cloth ends in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.190 
gonna draw in where the cloth ends in
the<00:01:20.750> back<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:22.240> where<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.390> line<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:23.870> for<00:01:24.110> the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
the back and where the line is for the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.180 
the back and where the line is for the
water<00:01:24.410> and<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:26.870> shadow<00:01:27.200> is<00:01:27.680> running<00:01:28.040> right

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
water and the shadow is running right

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.170 
water and the shadow is running right
off<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.610> base<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:30.770> cloth<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:32.030> then

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
off the base of the cloth and then

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.710 
off the base of the cloth and then
there's<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.420> nice<00:01:32.690> round<00:01:33.170> edge<00:01:33.500> right<00:01:33.950> here<00:01:34.370> and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
there's a nice round edge right here and

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.980 
there's a nice round edge right here and
then<00:01:35.720> it<00:01:36.140> let's<00:01:36.710> see<00:01:37.360> I'm<00:01:38.360> not<00:01:38.570> going<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.810> see

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
then it let's see I'm not going to see

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.750 
then it let's see I'm not going to see
any<00:01:39.170> of<00:01:39.350> that<00:01:39.410> so<00:01:39.770> I'm<00:01:39.860> just<00:01:39.920> gonna<00:01:40.220> paint<00:01:40.550> a

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
any of that so I'm just gonna paint a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.500 
any of that so I'm just gonna paint a
little<00:01:41.300> fold<00:01:41.680> right<00:01:42.680> here

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
little fold right here

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.420 
little fold right here
okay<00:01:44.510> so<00:01:44.570> there's<00:01:44.930> basic<00:01:45.410> composition<00:01:45.770> got<00:01:46.400> a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
okay so there's basic composition got a

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.080 
okay so there's basic composition got a
nice<00:01:46.700> high<00:01:46.970> line<00:01:47.590> I've<00:01:48.590> got<00:01:48.800> the<00:01:48.980> jar<00:01:49.280> here<00:01:49.760> and

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
nice high line I've got the jar here and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.660 
nice high line I've got the jar here and
I'm<00:01:50.990> squinting<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:51.740> that's<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.430> key<00:01:52.640> to

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
I'm squinting and that's the key to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.120 
I'm squinting and that's the key to
painting<00:01:53.210> as<00:01:53.360> always<00:01:53.720> squint<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:54.830> that<00:01:55.010> you

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
painting as always squint so that you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.130 
painting as always squint so that you
can<00:01:55.310> see<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.640> big<00:01:55.820> major<00:01:56.030> masses<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:56.900> all<00:01:56.990> I'm

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
can see the big major masses and all I'm

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.790 
can see the big major masses and all I'm
doing<00:01:57.410> is<00:01:57.500> drawing<00:01:57.830> in<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.820> shape<00:01:59.150> of<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.420> jar

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
doing is drawing in the shape of the jar

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.620 
doing is drawing in the shape of the jar
and<00:02:00.800> I'm<00:02:00.920> trying<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.490> forget<00:02:01.820> it's<00:02:02.000> a<00:02:02.120> jar<00:02:02.390> I'm

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
and I'm trying to forget it's a jar I'm

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.300 
and I'm trying to forget it's a jar I'm
not<00:02:02.780> concerned<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.410> it's<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.680> jar<00:02:03.920> full<00:02:04.160> of

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
not concerned that it's a jar full of

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.670 
not concerned that it's a jar full of
water<00:02:04.550> so<00:02:04.850> there's<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.780> composition<00:02:06.500> now<00:02:06.650> I

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
water so there's the composition now I

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.090 
water so there's the composition now I
take<00:02:06.980> the<00:02:07.300> magenta<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.840> I'm<00:02:09.590> going<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.800> start

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
take the magenta and I'm going to start

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.940 
take the magenta and I'm going to start
washing<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.850> dark<00:02:11.150> parts<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.200> see<00:02:12.620> that

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
washing in the dark parts so I see that

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.410 
washing in the dark parts so I see that
this<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.910> dark

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
this is a dark

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.740 
this is a dark
line<00:02:14.540> across<00:02:14.870> here<00:02:16.090> here<00:02:17.590> down<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.800> bottom

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
line across here here down the bottom

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.170 
line across here here down the bottom
little<00:02:20.750> across<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.500> top<00:02:21.819> there's<00:02:22.819> a<00:02:22.910> nice

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
little across the top there's a nice

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.500 
little across the top there's a nice
little<00:02:23.420> dark<00:02:23.810> shape<00:02:24.110> right<00:02:24.410> there<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:25.510> very

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
little dark shape right there a very

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.160 
little dark shape right there a very
thin<00:02:26.930> line<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:29.360> kind<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.870> goes<00:02:30.020> like

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
thin line and this kind of goes like

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.790 
thin line and this kind of goes like
that<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.860> down<00:02:31.239> then<00:02:32.239> there's<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.569> nice<00:02:32.800> medium

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
that and down then there's a nice medium

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.750 
that and down then there's a nice medium
line<00:02:34.040> across<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.000> bottom<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:37.280> course<00:02:37.550> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
line across the bottom and of course the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.220 
line across the bottom and of course the
shadow<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.800> back<00:02:40.390> now<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.569> is<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.050> a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
shadow in the back now this is this is a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.930 
shadow in the back now this is this is a
little<00:02:42.650> bit<00:02:42.769> deeper<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.190> guess<00:02:43.459> it's<00:02:43.640> picking

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
little bit deeper I guess it's picking

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.690 
little bit deeper I guess it's picking
up<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.680> reflection<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.920> side<00:02:46.160> right<00:02:46.489> there

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
up a reflection of the side right there

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.059 
up a reflection of the side right there
so<00:02:46.880> I'm<00:02:46.970> gonna<00:02:47.090> paint<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.569> in<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.890> there's<00:02:49.010> a

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
so I'm gonna paint that in and there's a

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.229 
so I'm gonna paint that in and there's a
little<00:02:49.670> curve<00:02:50.319> right<00:02:51.319> there<00:02:51.819> now<00:02:52.819> I<00:02:52.880> take<00:02:53.180> my

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
little curve right there now I take my

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.300 
little curve right there now I take my
other<00:02:53.480> brush<00:02:53.810> in<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.350> squint<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.069> say<00:02:55.280> oh

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
other brush in and I squint and I say oh

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.570 
other brush in and I squint and I say oh
okay<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.350> is<00:02:57.560> really<00:02:58.069> dark<00:02:58.310> this

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
okay this is a this is really dark this

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.220 
okay this is a this is really dark this
is<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.910> second<00:02:59.330> door<00:02:59.480> so<00:02:59.750> I'm<00:02:59.810> gonna<00:02:59.930> go<00:03:00.110> in

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
panel out when I'm finished with it so

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.590 
panel out when I'm finished with it so
I'm<00:03:13.250> painting<00:03:13.549> on<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.670> panel<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.180> little<00:03:14.330> bit

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
I'm painting on a panel a little bit

I'm finished okay so if that is if
that's<00:03:20.209> going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.540> be<00:03:20.660> my<00:03:20.840> medium<00:03:21.440> then<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:22.070> need

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
that's going to be my medium then I need

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.099 
that's going to be my medium then I need
to<00:03:22.370> go<00:03:22.519> ahead<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.940> darken<00:03:23.329> these<00:03:23.450> darks<00:03:23.930> and

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
to go ahead and darken these darks and

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.720 
to go ahead and darken these darks and
that's<00:03:24.260> what<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.440> do<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.739> usually<00:03:25.040> add<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.340> little

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
that's what I do I usually add a little

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.580 
that's what I do I usually add a little
bit<00:03:25.850> of<00:03:25.970> cobalt<00:03:26.180> violet<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:27.859> my<00:03:28.090> mixture<00:03:29.090> and

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
bit of cobalt violet to my mixture and

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.140 
bit of cobalt violet to my mixture and
kind<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.739> darken<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.250> where<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.400> see<00:03:31.700> really

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
kind of darken it where I see really

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.789 
kind of darken it where I see really
really<00:03:32.450> dark<00:03:32.660> darks<00:03:33.170> is<00:03:33.320> where<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.530> put<00:03:33.769> my

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
really dark darks is where I put my

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.870 
really dark darks is where I put my
cobalt<00:03:34.340> violet

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
cobalt violet

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.479 
cobalt violet
so<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:35.930> see<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.290> go<00:03:36.440> like<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:36.890> really<00:03:37.220> just

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
so I see it go like that and really just

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.490 
so I see it go like that and really just
simplify<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.120> shapes<00:03:38.510> don't<00:03:38.870> think<00:03:39.109> of<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.380> as

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
simplify the shapes don't think of it as

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.750 
simplify the shapes don't think of it as
glass<00:03:39.799> that's<00:03:40.160> what<00:03:40.310> gets<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:40.640> in<00:03:40.730> trouble

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
glass that's what gets you in trouble

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.180 
glass that's what gets you in trouble
when<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.870> start<00:03:41.900> thinking<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.739> as<00:03:42.890> glass

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
when you start thinking of it as glass

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.370 
when you start thinking of it as glass
and<00:03:43.549> you<00:03:43.609> get<00:03:43.790> really<00:03:44.209> wound<00:03:44.600> up<00:03:44.780> about<00:03:45.049> every

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
and you get really wound up about every

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.530 
and you get really wound up about every
shape<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.829> start<00:03:46.130> getting<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.459> trouble<00:03:46.609> so<00:03:47.510> I

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
shape you start getting in trouble so I

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.240 
shape you start getting in trouble so I
squint<00:03:48.260> I've<00:03:49.130> got<00:03:49.430> this<00:03:49.670> I've<00:03:50.030> got<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:51.250> then

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
squint I've got this I've got that then

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.940 
squint I've got this I've got that then
I've<00:03:52.400> got<00:03:52.579> a<00:03:52.609> secondary<00:03:53.420> light<00:03:53.810> which<00:03:54.739> is

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
I've got a secondary light which is

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.710 
I've got a secondary light which is
cross<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.220> saw<00:03:55.609> what<00:03:56.239> I'm<00:03:56.329> going<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.510> do<00:03:56.600> is

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
cross the saw what I'm going to do is

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.680 
cross the saw what I'm going to do is
take<00:03:56.900> Naples<00:03:57.410> yellow<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:58.400> I'm<00:03:59.120> gonna<00:03:59.329> put

take Naples yellow and I'm gonna put
white<00:04:00.260> in<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.920> I'm<00:04:01.069> gonna<00:04:01.190> stroke<00:04:01.549> that

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
white in it and I'm gonna stroke that

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:02.949 
white in it and I'm gonna stroke that
across<00:04:02.390> here

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
across here

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.559 
across here
to<00:04:03.650> denote<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.220> that's<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.579> nice<00:04:04.790> warm<00:04:05.239> light

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
to denote that that's a nice warm light

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.479 
to denote that that's a nice warm light
shape<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.290> again<00:04:06.410> I'm<00:04:06.769> just<00:04:06.799> working<00:04:07.280> really

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
shape and again I'm just working really

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.960 
shape and again I'm just working really
really<00:04:07.910> thin<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.510> just<00:04:09.489> changing<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.579> colors

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
really thin and just changing the colors

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.940 
really thin and just changing the colors
up<00:04:11.180> I'm<00:04:11.389> what<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.690> values<00:04:12.139> stay<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.560> same<00:04:12.769> but

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
up I'm what the values stay the same but

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.039 
up I'm what the values stay the same but
I'm<00:04:13.040> just<00:04:13.190> changing<00:04:13.639> the<00:04:13.730> colors<00:04:14.060> up<00:04:14.239> so<00:04:14.900> this

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
I'm just changing the colors up so this

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.610 
I'm just changing the colors up so this
is<00:04:15.200> going<00:04:15.319> to<00:04:15.380> be<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.590> warm<00:04:16.959> color<00:04:17.959> and<00:04:18.289> then<00:04:18.500> I'm

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
is going to be a warm color and then I'm

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.710 
is going to be a warm color and then I'm
gonna<00:04:18.739> have<00:04:18.950> a<00:04:19.010> door<00:04:19.340> a<00:04:19.850> cooler<00:04:20.180> color<00:04:20.539> a

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
gonna have a door a cooler color a

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.510 
gonna have a door a cooler color a
little<00:04:20.840> bit<00:04:21.079> cooler<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:22.280> just<00:04:22.580> take<00:04:22.760> some

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
little bit cooler so I just take some

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.879 
little bit cooler so I just take some
yellow<00:04:25.520> deep<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.300> put<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.409> back

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
yellow deep and put that in the back

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.550 
yellow deep and put that in the back
I<00:04:28.030> got<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.120> be<00:04:29.210> sure<00:04:29.360> I<00:04:29.389> lighten<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.139> up<00:04:30.199> too

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
I got to be sure I lighten that up too

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.070 
I got to be sure I lighten that up too
but<00:04:30.770> it's<00:04:30.949> a<00:04:31.039> little<00:04:31.370> bit<00:04:31.520> deeper<00:04:31.699> and<00:04:32.150> it's<00:04:33.020> a

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
but it's a little bit deeper and it's a

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.429 
but it's a little bit deeper and it's a
little<00:04:33.379> bit<00:04:33.499> darker<00:04:33.979> and<00:04:34.400> see<00:04:34.669> how<00:04:34.819> it<00:04:34.939> changes

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:35.439 
little bit darker and see how it changes

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.019 
little bit darker and see how it changes
it's<00:04:36.439> almost<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:37.069> same<00:04:37.249> value<00:04:37.729> but<00:04:37.849> it's<00:04:37.969> a

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:38.029 
it's almost the same value but it's a

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.760 
it's almost the same value but it's a
little<00:04:38.270> bit<00:04:38.449> darker<00:04:39.879> then<00:04:40.879> guess<00:04:41.120> what<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:41.509> do

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
little bit darker then guess what you do

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.920 
little bit darker then guess what you do
you<00:04:42.770> go<00:04:42.919> right<00:04:43.159> inside<00:04:43.639> here<00:04:43.669> and<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.689> paint

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
you go right inside here and you paint

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.670 
you go right inside here and you paint
the<00:04:45.050> same<00:04:45.289> thing<00:04:45.680> inside<00:04:46.249> of<00:04:46.310> here<00:04:47.680> because

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
the same thing inside of here because

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.580 
the same thing inside of here because
guess<00:04:49.009> what<00:04:49.219> glass<00:04:49.610> is<00:04:49.909> see-through<00:04:50.590> if

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
guess what glass is see-through if

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.719 
guess what glass is see-through if
you're<00:04:51.710> going<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:51.889> make<00:04:52.039> it<00:04:52.159> look<00:04:52.340> like<00:04:52.490> glass

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
you're going to make it look like glass

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.170 
you're going to make it look like glass
you<00:04:53.180> have<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.719> be<00:04:53.840> able<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.169> see<00:04:54.349> through<00:04:54.560> it<00:04:54.680> so

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
you have to be able to see through it so

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.450 
you have to be able to see through it so
let's<00:04:56.180> see<00:04:56.360> how's<00:04:56.779> this<00:04:56.990> look<00:04:57.259> this<00:04:57.499> goes<00:04:57.770> the

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
let's see how's this look this goes the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.179 
let's see how's this look this goes the
table<00:04:58.849> top<00:04:59.060> goes<00:04:59.590> I'm<00:05:00.590> seeing<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.069> reflection

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
table top goes I'm seeing the reflection

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:05.890 
table top goes I'm seeing the reflection
dip<00:05:02.060> down<00:05:02.919> like<00:05:03.919> so<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:05.330> goes<00:05:05.539> all<00:05:05.779> the<00:05:05.810> way

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
dip down like so and goes all the way

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.279 
dip down like so and goes all the way
across<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:08.090> this<00:05:08.240> is<00:05:08.389> really<00:05:08.599> this<00:05:09.020> is<00:05:09.080> going

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
across and this is really this is going

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.159 
across and this is really this is going
to<00:05:09.379> be<00:05:09.500> interesting<00:05:10.419> when<00:05:11.419> you<00:05:11.539> see<00:05:11.779> how<00:05:11.960> this

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
to be interesting when you see how this

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.050 
to be interesting when you see how this
thing<00:05:12.680> looks<00:05:12.889> like<00:05:13.099> glass<00:05:13.340> when<00:05:13.400> you<00:05:13.699> get<00:05:13.849> done

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
thing looks like glass when you get done

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.570 
thing looks like glass when you get done
so<00:05:14.300> you<00:05:14.360> just<00:05:14.569> go<00:05:14.719> in<00:05:14.870> there<00:05:15.129> swab<00:05:16.129> all<00:05:16.460> I'm

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
so you just go in there swab all I'm

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.990 
so you just go in there swab all I'm
doing<00:05:16.849> it<00:05:16.939> really<00:05:17.180> really<00:05:17.629> light<00:05:21.699> I'm<00:05:22.699> doing

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
doing it really really light I'm doing

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.909 
doing it really really light I'm doing
it<00:05:23.120> really<00:05:23.270> really<00:05:23.719> thin<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:24.349> I<00:05:24.379> can<00:05:24.560> paint<00:05:24.770> on

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
it really really thin so I can paint on

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:25.719 
it really really thin so I can paint on
top<00:05:25.159> of<00:05:25.219> it

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
top of it

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.290 
top of it
now<00:05:26.719> this<00:05:27.169> this<00:05:27.529> is<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.800> this<00:05:28.310> color<00:05:28.789> underneath

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
now this this is a this color underneath

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.779 
now this this is a this color underneath
this<00:05:29.509> is<00:05:29.689> the<00:05:29.839> table<00:05:30.080> top<00:05:30.409> running<00:05:31.159> up<00:05:31.310> into

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
this is the table top running up into

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.600 
this is the table top running up into
the<00:05:32.060> glass<00:05:33.020> so<00:05:33.319> I'm<00:05:33.439> going<00:05:33.589> to<00:05:33.620> take<00:05:33.740> white<00:05:34.069> and

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
the glass so I'm going to take white and

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.519 
the glass so I'm going to take white and
Naples<00:05:35.479> yellow<00:05:35.659> I'm<00:05:35.839> going<00:05:35.990> to<00:05:36.050> lighten<00:05:36.349> it<00:05:36.409> up

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:36.529 
Naples yellow I'm going to lighten it up

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:38.499 
Naples yellow I'm going to lighten it up
just<00:05:36.589> a<00:05:36.949> little<00:05:36.979> bit<00:05:37.279> and<00:05:37.610> paint<00:05:37.879> the<00:05:38.000> inside

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
just a little bit and paint the inside

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.700 
just a little bit and paint the inside
shape<00:05:38.960> of<00:05:39.259> that<00:05:40.120> now<00:05:41.120> I'm<00:05:41.750> going<00:05:42.139> to<00:05:42.349> bring

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
shape of that now I'm going to bring

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.129 
shape of that now I'm going to bring
this<00:05:42.889> a<00:05:42.949> little<00:05:43.250> bit<00:05:43.460> closer<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.870> I've<00:05:44.990> got

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
this a little bit closer so I've got
