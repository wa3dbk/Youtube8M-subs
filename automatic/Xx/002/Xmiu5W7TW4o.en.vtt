this<00:00:24.320> project<00:00:24.950> is<00:00:26.770> about<00:00:27.770> three<00:00:28.430> years<00:00:28.760> old

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
this project is about three years old

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.780 
this project is about three years old
and<00:00:29.660> it<00:00:30.410> was<00:00:30.590> conceived<00:00:31.280> with<00:00:31.640> the

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
and it was conceived with the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.600 
and it was conceived with the
announcement<00:00:32.510> of<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.900> new<00:00:33.200> class<00:00:33.680> in<00:00:34.190> Grand

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
announcement of a new class in Grand

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.520 
announcement of a new class in Grand
Prix<00:00:34.880> racing<00:00:35.360> moto<00:00:35.690> 2<00:00:36.190> where<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:38.150> chassis<00:00:38.780> was

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
Prix racing moto 2 where the chassis was

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.940 
Prix racing moto 2 where the chassis was
completely<00:00:40.520> free<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:41.390> open<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:42.200> design<00:00:42.620> and

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
completely free and open to design and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.260 
completely free and open to design and
so<00:00:43.690> because<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.650> chassis<00:00:46.160> regulations<00:00:46.879> are

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
so because the chassis regulations are

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.010 
so because the chassis regulations are
completely<00:00:47.900> open<00:00:48.110> in<00:00:48.710> moto<00:00:49.520> 2<00:00:49.720> this<00:00:50.720> was<00:00:50.989> a

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
completely open in moto 2 this was a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.520 
completely open in moto 2 this was a
chance<00:00:51.379> for<00:00:51.650> us<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.790> explore<00:00:53.300> our<00:00:53.600> own<00:00:53.930> ideas

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
chance for us to explore our own ideas

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.730 
chance for us to explore our own ideas
on<00:00:55.060> chassis<00:00:56.060> design<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:57.040> this<00:00:58.040> is<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.340> result

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
on chassis design and this is the result

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.420 
on chassis design and this is the result
a<00:01:00.830> year<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.250> half<00:01:01.370> or<00:01:01.580> so<00:01:01.760> since<00:01:02.300> I've

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
a year and a half or so since I've

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.530 
a year and a half or so since I've
we're<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.700> football<00:01:04.000> tail<00:01:04.210> around<00:01:04.480> this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
we're a football tail around this

we're a football tail around this
project<00:01:04.950> it<00:01:05.950> was<00:01:06.070> really<00:01:06.340> interesting<00:01:06.700> to<00:01:06.790> me

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
project it was really interesting to me

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.230 
project it was really interesting to me
because<00:01:06.940> it's<00:01:07.600> all<00:01:08.110> carbon<00:01:08.500> fiber<00:01:08.650> chassis

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
because it's all carbon fiber chassis

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.040 
because it's all carbon fiber chassis
and<00:01:10.450> it's<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.810> ground-up<00:01:11.260> design

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
and it's a ground-up design

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.250 
and it's a ground-up design

I<00:01:16.320> had<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> idea<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.160> build<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.490> motor<00:01:17.640> chief

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
I had the idea to build a motor chief

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.930 
I had the idea to build a motor chief
with<00:01:18.030> motor<00:01:18.270> 2gb<00:01:18.720> bike<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.550> Paul<00:01:20.550> has<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.730> lot

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
with motor 2gb bike and Paul has a lot

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.000 
with motor 2gb bike and Paul has a lot
of<00:01:20.970> experience<00:01:21.300> with<00:01:21.570> carbon<00:01:21.870> fiber

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.270 

we<00:01:43.710> felt<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.520> were<00:01:44.880> two<00:01:45.270> areas<00:01:45.920> where<00:01:46.920> we

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
we felt there were two areas where we

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.440 
we felt there were two areas where we
could<00:01:47.780> gain<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> competitive<00:01:49.409> edge<00:01:49.920> one<00:01:50.610> was<00:01:50.970> in

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
could gain a competitive edge one was in

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.680 
could gain a competitive edge one was in
making<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.560> bike<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.159> small<00:01:53.760> as<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.180> possibly

bike to the rear and the carbon
monocoque<00:02:11.700> frame<00:02:13.190> enables<00:02:14.190> us<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.730> put<00:02:15.570> this

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
monocoque frame enables us to put this

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.610 
monocoque frame enables us to put this
tunnel<00:02:16.500> through<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.610> center<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.320> frame

construction this is as narrow as we can
possibly<00:02:36.600> make<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:38.130> only<00:02:38.310> as<00:02:38.580> wide<00:02:38.820> as

the<00:03:18.630> benefit<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.680> Pierre<00:03:19.860> leaned

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
the benefit of it is that Pierre leaned

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.040 
the benefit of it is that Pierre leaned
over<00:03:20.130> in<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.370> corners<00:03:20.790> dimensional<00:03:21.750> forests

over in the corners dimensional forests

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.220 
over in the corners dimensional forests

Ryder has a hard time feeling the
traction<00:03:30.980> in<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.220> traction

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.140 

with<00:03:39.460> Paul's<00:03:39.850> design

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
with Paul's design

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.600 
with Paul's design
full<00:03:41.510> lean<00:03:41.690> angle<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.140> can<00:03:42.349> absorb<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.459> bumps

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
full lean angle you can absorb the bumps

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.210 
full lean angle you can absorb the bumps
well<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.930> business<00:03:45.349> diction<00:03:45.680> is<00:03:45.769> as<00:03:46.010> much

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
well the business diction is as much

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.990 
well the business diction is as much
greatly<00:03:46.730> reduced<00:03:47.000> with<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.239> air

that<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.410> got<00:04:35.590> from<00:04:35.830> him<00:04:36.190> was<00:04:37.090> very<00:04:37.120> good<00:04:37.720> so<00:04:38.110> I

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
that I got from him was very good so I

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:45.800 
that I got from him was very good so I
always<00:04:38.650> remember<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.630> Sean<00:04:40.630> had<00:04:40.930> an<00:04:41.050> open

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.390 

so<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:47.169> talked<00:04:47.590> with<00:04:47.680> Paul<00:04:47.949> about<00:04:48.250> what

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
so I talked with Paul about what

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.950 
so I talked with Paul about what
batteries<00:04:48.699> he<00:04:48.880> was<00:04:49.000> using<00:04:49.180> for<00:04:49.449> the<00:04:49.510> project

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
batteries he was using for the project

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.740 
batteries he was using for the project
and<00:04:50.169> we<00:04:51.160> discussed<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.669> few<00:04:51.699> things<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.270> one<00:04:52.600> of

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
and we discussed a few things and one of

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.260 
and we discussed a few things and one of
the<00:04:52.810> benefits<00:04:53.290> of<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:54.040> fuse<00:04:54.790> in<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:54.970> Charette

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
the benefits of the fuse in the Charette

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.020 
the benefits of the fuse in the Charette
battery<00:04:55.570> is<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.690> light<00:04:55.930> weight<00:04:56.139> this<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:57.820> very

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
battery is the light weight this is very

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.780 
battery is the light weight this is very
important<00:04:58.510> Paul's<00:04:58.990> project<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.790> vehicle

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
important Paul's project the vehicle

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.340 
important Paul's project the vehicle
needs<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.150> be<00:05:01.210> very<00:05:01.419> likely<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.780> be

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
needs to be very likely to be

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.000 
needs to be very likely to be
competitive<00:05:02.979> in<00:05:03.250> racing<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:03.930> so<00:05:04.930> when<00:05:05.889> I<00:05:05.949> told

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
competitive in racing and so when I told

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.460 
competitive in racing and so when I told
him<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.810> packaging<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:07.990> weight<00:05:08.169> of<00:05:08.350> the

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
him the packaging and weight of the

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.040 
him the packaging and weight of the
Charette<00:05:08.740> battery<00:05:09.040> he<00:05:09.190> was<00:05:09.449> very<00:05:10.449> very<00:05:10.780> happy

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
Charette battery he was very very happy

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.189 
Charette battery he was very very happy
to<00:05:11.169> receive<00:05:11.470> this<00:05:11.680> uriah<00:05:12.070> put<00:05:12.340> it<00:05:12.430> in<00:05:12.520> like

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.059 

I<00:05:16.490> think<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:18.319> hope<00:05:19.319> is<00:05:19.590> that<00:05:19.740> there<00:05:19.919> would<00:05:20.039> be

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069 
I think the hope is that there would be

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:23.890 
I think the hope is that there would be
a<00:05:20.189> spike<00:05:20.969> could<00:05:21.090> be<00:05:21.240> entered<00:05:21.599> in<00:05:21.689> the<00:05:22.759> 2013

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
a spike could be entered in the 2013

00:05:23.900 --> 00:06:11.980 
a spike could be entered in the 2013
Indianapolis<00:05:24.900> Grand<00:05:25.169> Prix<00:05:25.319> race

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.050
