this<00:02:56.550> one's<00:02:56.790> been<00:02:56.970> sized<00:02:57.180> down<00:02:57.420> quite<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> bit

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
this one's been sized down quite a bit

this one's been sized down quite a bit
and<00:02:58.430> if<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.520> look<00:02:59.700> right<00:02:59.850> here<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.980> some

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
and if you look right here you have some

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.890 
and if you look right here you have some
micro<00:03:02.550> adjustments<00:03:03.090> right<00:03:03.209> here<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.630> we're<00:03:03.810> on

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
micro adjustments right here so we're on

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.930 
micro adjustments right here so we're on
the<00:03:04.050> last<00:03:04.410> one<00:03:04.709> here<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.580> get<00:03:05.700> almost

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
the last one here you can get almost

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.240 
the last one here you can get almost
close<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.990> I'd<00:03:07.200> say<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> little<00:03:07.650> over<00:03:07.800> I

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
close to it I'd say a little over I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.280 
close to it I'd say a little over I
think<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.330> little<00:03:09.420> over<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.780> quarter<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.110> an<00:03:10.230> inch

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
think a little over a quarter of an inch

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.510 
think a little over a quarter of an inch
extra<00:03:10.530> adjustment<00:03:11.190> there

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
extra adjustment there

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.760 
extra adjustment there
so<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.090> problem<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.510> has<00:03:12.660> though<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.080> once<00:03:13.650> you

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
so the problem it has though is once you

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.350 
so the problem it has though is once you
start<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:14.100> heat<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.280> band<00:03:14.580> down<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.120> small

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
start to heat this band down to small

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.060 
start to heat this band down to small
you<00:03:15.510> kind<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.810> run<00:03:15.959> out<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.110> links<00:03:16.530> there<00:03:16.920> are<00:03:17.040> a

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
you kind of run out of links there are a

here<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:59.239> let's<00:04:00.239> see<00:04:00.390> here<00:04:01.310> model<00:04:02.310> number

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
here is the let's see here model number

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.120 
here is the let's see here model number
if<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.700> could<00:04:02.850> find<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.510> one<00:04:04.350> two<00:04:04.590> seven<00:04:04.860> two

if I could find it is one two seven two

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.860 
if I could find it is one two seven two
eight<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:06.120> believe<00:04:06.480> it's<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.660> same

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
eight so I believe it's the same

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.120 
eight so I believe it's the same
movement<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.290> think<00:04:07.530> they<00:04:07.590> just<00:04:07.739> changed<00:04:08.010> my

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
movement I think they just changed my

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.830 
movement I think they just changed my
lures<00:04:08.459> based<00:04:08.640> on<00:04:08.820> when<00:04:08.940> they<00:04:09.060> come<00:04:09.239> out<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.570> mean

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
lures based on when they come out I mean

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.870 
lures based on when they come out I mean
overall<00:04:10.200> it's<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.440> exact<00:04:10.739> same<00:04:10.769> watch<00:04:11.310> other

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
overall it's the exact same watch other

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.420 
overall it's the exact same watch other
than<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.209> face<00:04:13.580> so<00:04:14.580> there<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:16.100> Zeus<00:04:17.100> bolt
