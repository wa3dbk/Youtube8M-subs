00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
boys for the previous games because I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.170 
boys for the previous games because I

high-resolution monitor and there's a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.529 
high-resolution monitor and there's a
lot<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> thoughts<00:00:52.170> about<00:00:52.469> who<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.789> man<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
lot of thoughts about who the man is the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.889 
lot of thoughts about who the man is the
dog<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:56.190> vault<00:00:56.430> 101<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:57.840> the

couple<00:01:17.700> hundred<00:01:17.880> years<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> future<00:01:18.900> maybe

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
couple hundred years in the future maybe

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.289 
couple hundred years in the future maybe
around<00:01:21.470> 2277<00:01:22.470> or<00:01:22.740> 2287<00:01:23.610> i<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.180> there's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
around 2277 or 2287 i think there's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.280 
around 2277 or 2287 i think there's
another<00:01:24.479> date<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.869> people<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.170> been

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
another date that people have been

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.649 
another date that people have been
speculating<00:01:25.920> anyways<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.600> wake<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
speculating anyways so you wake up and

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.940 
speculating anyways so you wake up and
you're<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> same<00:01:30.990> guy<00:01:31.049> before<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> bomb<00:01:31.740> fell

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you're the same guy before the bomb fell

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.370 
you're the same guy before the bomb fell

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
he opens up the vault door and bright

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.590 
he opens up the vault door and bright

sunlight nice he's the wasteland you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.260 
sunlight nice he's the wasteland you
know<00:01:55.100> or<00:01:56.100> maybe<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.850> feature<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
know or maybe that's just a feature of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.300 
know or maybe that's just a feature of
the<00:01:57.390> trailer<00:01:57.750> because<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> really<00:01:59.159> good

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the trailer because it was a really good

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.859 
the trailer because it was a really good
effect<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.909> know<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.299> was<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> very<00:02:00.659> powerful

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
effect you know it was a very powerful

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.950 
effect you know it was a very powerful
scene<00:02:01.500> anyways<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.399> also<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> dog

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
scene anyways I also think that the dog

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.420 
scene anyways I also think that the dog
will<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.619> players<00:02:04.860> companion

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
will be a the players companion

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.770 
will be a the players companion
throughout<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> game<00:02:05.939> maybe<00:02:06.329> playing<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
throughout the game maybe playing a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.059 
throughout the game maybe playing a
similar<00:02:07.110> role<00:02:07.290> as<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:08.869> not<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
similar role as a not as a but as the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.760 
similar role as a not as a but as the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
something or whatever anyways so that's

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.300 
something or whatever anyways so that's
probably<00:02:31.200> going<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.560> be<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.710> big<00:02:31.890> feature<00:02:32.100> of

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
probably going to be a big feature of

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.980 
probably going to be a big feature of
the<00:02:32.400> game<00:02:32.580> because<00:02:32.940> was<00:02:33.570> featured<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
the game because was featured in the

the game because was featured in the
trailer<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.910> course<00:02:36.150> everyone<00:02:36.510> is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
trailer and of course everyone is

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.990

wondering<00:02:37.140> when<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.830> release<00:02:38.400> date<00:02:38.640> for<00:02:38.670> fall

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
wondering when the release date for fall

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.730 
wondering when the release date for fall
off<00:02:39.090> or<00:02:39.240> will<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.480> I'm<00:02:39.720> pretty<00:02:40.350> sure<00:02:40.500> it'll<00:02:40.620> be

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
off or will be I'm pretty sure it'll be

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.130 
off or will be I'm pretty sure it'll be
this<00:02:40.920> fall<00:02:41.190> probably<00:02:42.120> October<00:02:42.510> 20th<00:02:42.870> or

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
this fall probably October 20th or

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.860 
this fall probably October 20th or
october<00:02:43.380> 27th<00:02:44.070> because<00:02:45.000> those<00:02:45.390> days<00:02:45.600> are

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
october 27th because those days are

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.440 
october 27th because those days are
tuesdays<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.040> previous<00:02:48.000> follow<00:02:48.180> games

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
tuesdays and the previous follow games

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.280 
tuesdays and the previous follow games
were<00:02:48.660> both<00:02:48.900> released<00:02:50.300> october<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.960> i'm

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
were both released october so i'm

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.660 
were both released october so i'm
thinking<00:02:52.350> probably<00:02:52.830> drown<00:02:53.280> there<00:02:53.460> because

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
thinking probably drown there because

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.040 
thinking probably drown there because
that's<00:02:53.730> good<00:02:53.970> timing<00:02:54.330> for<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.720> holiday

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
that's good timing for the holiday

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.310 
that's good timing for the holiday
season<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:56.120> just<00:02:57.120> make<00:02:57.480> sense<00:02:57.780> from<00:02:58.140> a

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
season and just make sense from a

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.750 
season and just make sense from a
standpoint<00:02:58.800> i<00:02:59.070> mean<00:02:59.220> some<00:02:59.370> people<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.670> been

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
standpoint i mean some people have been

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.850 
standpoint i mean some people have been
saying<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.210> it'll<00:03:00.540> be<00:03:00.630> released<00:03:00.990> on<00:03:01.200> october

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
saying that it'll be released on october

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.920 
saying that it'll be released on october
twenty<00:03:01.980> third<00:03:02.310> because<00:03:02.640> that's<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.060> date<00:03:03.720> of

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
twenty third because that's the date of

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.480 
twenty third because that's the date of
the<00:03:03.990> great<00:03:04.260> tamour<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.130> fallout<00:03:05.310> universe

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
the great tamour in the fallout universe

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.220 
the great tamour in the fallout universe
but<00:03:05.910> i<00:03:06.090> don't<00:03:06.240> think<00:03:06.300> Bethesda's<00:03:06.990> going<00:03:07.170> to

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.490 
but i don't think Bethesda's going to
release<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.680> triple<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.130> game<00:03:08.510> me<00:03:09.510> on<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> friday
