00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.550
 so rich and tasty that my grandmother did 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.919
 and I remember that I did not use dye 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.769
 you already know that the coloring is artificial 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.960
 and it does not provide flavor or aroma and today for 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.260
 make the paella we are going to use saffron 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.670
 natural that does bring flavor and aroma 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.710
 colour 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 for a seafood paella for four 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.960

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.090
 we introduce 10 centimeters of oil 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.090
 as half a glass 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.820
 and we add the salt 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.990
 first as it happens is to mark the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.860
 prawns 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.860

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.720
 Y 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.790
 we already have the squid and the pepper 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.790

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.610

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.610
 we have it little so that it does not burn 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.600
 and then we are going to put the tomato 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.830

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.490
 ground milled 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.950
 but also with quoting in strands that 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.290

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.900

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.070

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.769
