00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
bin number because that'll tell me what

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.429 
bin number because that'll tell me what
year<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
unbolt it from right there unbolt it up

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.749 
unbolt it from right there unbolt it up
there<00:02:02.929> lift<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.590> whole<00:02:03.710> body<00:02:03.979> right<00:02:04.190> off<00:02:04.399> here

there lift the whole body right off here
you<00:02:04.940> can<00:02:05.569> replace<00:02:05.869> all<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:06.289> metal<00:02:06.710> that

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
you can replace all this metal that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.109 
you can replace all this metal that
divide<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.190> out<00:02:07.310> down<00:02:07.550> here<00:02:07.789> in<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.909> floor

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
divide it out down here in the floor

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.000 
divide it out down here in the floor
plan<00:02:10.090> it's<00:02:11.090> not<00:02:11.300> pretty<00:02:11.569> but<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:12.050> fixable

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
plan it's not pretty but it's fixable

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.430 
plan it's not pretty but it's fixable
anyway<00:02:19.690> anyway<00:02:20.690> let<00:02:20.840> me<00:02:20.930> get<00:02:21.079> this<00:02:21.200> VIN

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
anyway anyway let me get this VIN

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.520 
anyway anyway let me get this VIN
numbers<00:02:21.799> I<00:02:21.920> forgot<00:02:22.280> what<00:02:22.430> year<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.730> thing<00:02:23.000> is

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
numbers I forgot what year this thing is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.979 
numbers I forgot what year this thing is
and<00:02:24.530> then<00:02:24.739> we'll<00:02:24.890> go<00:02:25.070> from<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:27.130> nice<00:02:28.130> Evan<00:02:28.459> to

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
and then we'll go from that nice Evan to

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.890 
and then we'll go from that nice Evan to
put<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:31.060> place<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:32.299> not<00:02:32.390> too<00:02:32.600> hard<00:02:32.840> to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
put it in the place it's not too hard to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.470 
put it in the place it's not too hard to
find

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.010 

so<00:02:39.349> here's<00:02:39.620> an<00:02:39.770> interesting<00:02:39.860> point<00:02:41.150> the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
so here's an interesting point the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.920 
so here's an interesting point the
emergency<00:02:42.560> brake<00:02:42.590> was<00:02:42.980> on<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:43.690> don't<00:02:44.690> know<00:02:44.900> if

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
emergency brake was on I don't know if

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.330 
emergency brake was on I don't know if
it<00:02:45.080> matters<00:02:45.410> or<00:02:45.530> not<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:45.920> doubt<00:02:46.129> it's

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
it matters or not it I doubt it's

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.589 
it matters or not it I doubt it's
releasing<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.879> is<00:02:46.970> going<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.209> release<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
releasing it is going to release the

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.699 
releasing it is going to release the
brakes<00:02:47.780> because<00:02:47.959> they're<00:02:48.140> probably<00:02:48.319> frozen

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
brakes because they're probably frozen

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.979 
brakes because they're probably frozen
to<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> drum<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:50.420> idea<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:50.810> the

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
to the drum but the idea that the

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.860 
to the drum but the idea that the
emergency<00:02:51.440> brakes<00:02:51.709> are<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:52.780> probably<00:02:53.780> a

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
emergency brakes are on probably a

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.600 
emergency brakes are on probably a
pretty<00:02:54.230> good<00:02:54.349> contributing<00:02:55.010> factor<00:02:55.459> as<00:02:55.519> to

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
pretty good contributing factor as to

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.550 
pretty good contributing factor as to
why<00:02:55.849> the<00:02:55.910> wheels<00:02:56.450> are<00:02:56.630> locked<00:02:56.840> up<00:02:59.349> sticker<00:03:00.349> on

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
why the wheels are locked up sticker on

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.390 
why the wheels are locked up sticker on
the<00:03:00.650> dash<00:03:00.860> here<00:03:01.160> since<00:03:01.400> 1969<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.890> may<00:03:04.040> be<00:03:04.099> about

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
the dash here since 1969 it may be about

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.300 
the dash here since 1969 it may be about
