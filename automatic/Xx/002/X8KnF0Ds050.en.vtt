00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.550 
currently arguably the best android
phones<00:00:27.000> there<00:00:27.359> are<00:00:27.510> other<00:00:27.720> carriers<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.470> that

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
phones there are other carriers and that

you're on Verizon or you're switching to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.729 
you're on Verizon or you're switching to
verizon<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.059> will<00:00:33.210> need<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> choose<00:00:33.750> now

right<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:35.340> these<00:00:35.579> are<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> top<00:00:36.270> phones<00:00:36.710> again

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
right now these are the top phones again

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.319 
right now these are the top phones again
you<00:00:38.070> could<00:00:38.190> argue<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.820> other<00:00:39.000> carriers

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
you could argue that with other carriers

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.880 
you could argue that with other carriers
and<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> couple<00:00:40.170> others<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:40.860> there

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890

and a couple others that are out there
but<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> most<00:00:42.210> part<00:00:42.329> these<00:00:42.719> are

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
but for the most part these are

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.279 
but for the most part these are
considered<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:44.550> best<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> best<00:00:45.329> tomorrow

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
considered the best of the best tomorrow

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.840 
considered the best of the best tomorrow
there<00:00:46.559> could<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.860> better<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.700> right

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850

it<00:01:57.990> does<00:01:58.850> this<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> only<00:02:00.509> oled<00:02:01.469> screen

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
it does this is the only oled screen

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.620 
it does this is the only oled screen
screen<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:02.909> means<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.420> an<00:02:03.509> organic

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
screen so that means it's an organic

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.249 
screen so that means it's an organic
lighted<00:02:04.380> display<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.360> not<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.719> good<00:02:07.110> in

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
lighted display and it's not as good in

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.830 
lighted display and it's not as good in
sunlight<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.489> does<00:02:08.759> save<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.239> battery<00:02:09.420> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
sunlight but it does save on battery and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.160 
sunlight but it does save on battery and
it's<00:02:10.170> very<00:02:10.530> nice<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.039> very<00:02:11.129> sharp

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
it's very nice and very sharp

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.790 
it's very nice and very sharp
resolutions<00:02:13.170> are<00:02:13.319> all<00:02:13.470> very

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
resolutions are all very

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.330 
resolutions are all very
similar<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> go<00:02:14.790> into<00:02:14.910> that

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
similar so I'm not going to go into that

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.940 
similar so I'm not going to go into that
actual<00:02:17.340> hardware<00:02:17.820> design<00:02:18.560> that's<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.770> big

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
actual hardware design that's a big

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.920 
actual hardware design that's a big
question<00:02:20.100> for<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.640> lot<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.820> people<00:02:20.940> personally

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
question for a lot of people personally

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.200 
question for a lot of people personally
I<00:02:22.140> could<00:02:22.710> give<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.950> my<00:02:23.100> opinion<00:02:23.220> because<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.060> do

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
I could give you my opinion because I do

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.210 
I could give you my opinion because I do
like<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.780> incredibles<00:02:25.350> design<00:02:25.680> has<00:02:26.190> a

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
like the incredibles design has a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.790 
like the incredibles design has a
different<00:02:26.640> sleek<00:02:27.030> look<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.690> as<00:02:28.230> opposed<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
different sleek look to it as opposed to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.600 
different sleek look to it as opposed to
the<00:02:28.890> backs<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.340> these<00:02:30.830> build<00:02:31.830> quality<00:02:32.130> seems

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
the backs of these build quality seems

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.520 
the backs of these build quality seems
very<00:02:32.940> similar<00:02:33.270> on<00:02:33.570> all<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.900> them<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.230> would

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
very similar on all of them I would

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.440 
very similar on all of them I would
argue<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.310> maybe<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.790> motorolas<00:02:36.270> are<00:02:36.420> a

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
argue that maybe the motorolas are a

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.440 
argue that maybe the motorolas are a
little<00:02:36.720> bit<00:02:36.960> more<00:02:37.110> robust<00:02:37.760> but<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.940> do<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.390> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
little bit more robust but I do like the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.810 
little bit more robust but I do like the
incredible<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:41.460> look<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.840> prefer

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
incredible just the look of it I prefer

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.880 
incredible just the look of it I prefer
it<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> little<00:02:45.210> bit<00:02:45.390> more<00:02:45.600> thin<00:02:45.960> but<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
it is a little bit more thin but the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.790 
it is a little bit more thin but the
droid<00:02:47.610> x<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:48.000> about<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.420> same<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:49.380> then<00:02:49.680> you

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
droid x is about the same but then you

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.710 
droid x is about the same but then you
have<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> larger<00:02:50.400> screen<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.570> next

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
have the larger screen so the next

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.900 
have the larger screen so the next
question<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.230> need<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.530> say<00:02:52.740> or<00:02:53.220> come<00:02:53.670> or

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
question you need to say or come or

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.890 
question you need to say or come or
think<00:02:54.300> about<00:02:54.390> rather<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.130> do<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.280> want<00:02:56.550> a

think about rather is do you want a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.540 
think about rather is do you want a
larger<00:02:57.900> screen<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.740> larger<00:02:59.070> screen<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.490> very

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
larger screen the larger screen is very

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.960 
larger screen the larger screen is very
nice<00:03:00.060> on<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.390> droid<00:03:00.600> x<00:03:01.070> you've<00:03:02.070> got<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.430> you

carrier catalog that you can pick from

carrier catalog that you can pick from
that<00:03:38.850> have<00:03:39.150> smaller<00:03:39.480> display<00:03:39.959> sizes<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:41.690> and

that have smaller display sizes and and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.600 
that have smaller display sizes and and
are<00:03:43.110> just<00:03:43.320> as<00:03:43.470> good<00:03:43.620> as<00:03:43.739> one<00:03:43.920> another<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:44.400> for

are just as good as one another but for

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.880 
are just as good as one another but for
different<00:03:44.760> reasons<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:46.230> incredible<00:03:46.800> a

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
different reasons so the incredible a

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.650 
different reasons so the incredible a
lot<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.190> people<00:03:47.459> apparently<00:03:47.880> don't<00:03:48.209> realize

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
lot of people apparently don't realize

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.210 
lot of people apparently don't realize
that<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:48.989> exists<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.590> maybe<00:03:49.770> that's<00:03:50.010> because

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
that it exists and maybe that's because

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.920 
that it exists and maybe that's because
it's<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.610> little<00:03:50.850> hard<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.180> come<00:03:51.390> by<00:03:51.570> from<00:03:51.750> what

it's a little hard to come by from what

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.260 
it's a little hard to come by from what
i<00:03:51.959> understand<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.520> not<00:03:53.550> been<00:03:53.880> in<00:03:54.000> stock

an easy choice in my opinion as tests

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.260 
an easy choice in my opinion as tests
have<00:04:36.199> shown<00:04:36.229> that<00:04:36.740> this<00:04:37.009> is<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.370> best<00:04:37.550> now<00:04:38.240> I

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
have shown that this is the best now I

have shown that this is the best now I
haven't<00:04:38.840> compared<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.259> with<00:04:39.289> this<00:04:39.500> phone<00:04:39.770> yet

this<00:04:49.220> does<00:04:49.490> or<00:04:49.879> should<00:04:50.750> soon<00:04:51.400> but<00:04:52.400> camera

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
this does or should soon but camera

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.540 
this does or should soon but camera
quality<00:04:53.090> in<00:04:53.360> general<00:04:53.720> is<00:04:53.870> best<00:04:54.229> on<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:55.159> droid

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
quality in general is best on the droid

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.260 
quality in general is best on the droid
x<00:04:56.349> that<00:04:57.349> said<00:04:57.680> so<00:04:57.979> there's<00:04:58.819> not<00:04:58.970> a<00:04:59.030> whole<00:04:59.210> lot

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
x that said so there's not a whole lot

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.809 
x that said so there's not a whole lot
more<00:04:59.659> other<00:04:59.810> than<00:04:59.930> maybe<00:05:00.229> battery<00:05:00.740> life<00:05:00.979> my

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
more other than maybe battery life my

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:03.730 
more other than maybe battery life my
experience<00:05:02.090> has<00:05:02.479> been<00:05:02.539> battery<00:05:03.020> life<00:05:03.199> is<00:05:03.349> best

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
experience has been battery life is best

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.619 
experience has been battery life is best
on<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.159> droid<00:05:04.430> incredible<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:05.270> I<00:05:05.360> think

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:05.629 
on the droid incredible and I think

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.020 
on the droid incredible and I think
that's<00:05:05.840> due<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:06.259> oled<00:05:06.620> screen<00:05:07.039> as<00:05:07.250> that

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
that's due to the oled screen as that

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.939 
that's due to the oled screen as that
takes<00:05:08.270> less<00:05:08.569> power<00:05:08.840> than<00:05:09.020> a<00:05:09.259> backlit<00:05:09.710> LCD

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
takes less power than a backlit LCD

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.580 
takes less power than a backlit LCD
screen<00:05:10.639> there's<00:05:11.419> really<00:05:11.810> not<00:05:12.110> much<00:05:12.289> more<00:05:12.530> to

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
screen there's really not much more to

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.070 
screen there's really not much more to
go<00:05:12.770> into<00:05:12.949> other<00:05:13.250> than<00:05:13.490> that<00:05:13.669> they're<00:05:14.449> all<00:05:14.599> very

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
go into other than that they're all very

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.719

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.459 
good phones reliable great signal signal
strength<00:05:20.030> I<00:05:20.150> would<00:05:20.330> say<00:05:20.509> is<00:05:20.690> best<00:05:21.080> on<00:05:21.319> the

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:21.469 
strength I would say is best on the

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:22.930 
strength I would say is best on the
incredible<00:05:21.830> from<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.370> strength<00:05:22.639> or<00:05:22.879> the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
incredible from the strength or the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.510 
incredible from the strength or the
tests<00:05:23.449> I've<00:05:23.569> done<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:24.440> grit<00:05:24.710> tests<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:25.310> those

going<00:05:58.159> to<00:05:58.219> want<00:05:58.340> to<00:05:58.460> go<00:05:58.490> with<00:05:58.699> the<00:05:58.789> incredible

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
going to want to go with the incredible

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.930 
going to want to go with the incredible
as<00:06:00.169> you<00:06:00.440> can<00:06:00.560> tell<00:06:00.620> I<00:06:00.830> do<00:06:01.009> like<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.340> incredible

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
as you can tell I do like the incredible

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.809 
as you can tell I do like the incredible
a<00:06:01.969> lot<00:06:02.240> but<00:06:02.960> I'm<00:06:03.349> very<00:06:03.800> biased<00:06:04.219> towards<00:06:04.669> the

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:04.819 
a lot but I'm very biased towards the

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:06.640 
a lot but I'm very biased towards the
droid<00:06:05.060> x<00:06:05.210> so<00:06:05.509> it's<00:06:05.870> a<00:06:05.990> really<00:06:06.199> tough<00:06:06.469> decision

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
droid x so it's a really tough decision

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.430 
droid x so it's a really tough decision
for<00:06:06.949> me<00:06:07.250> also<00:06:07.430> i<00:06:07.789> think<00:06:08.360> the<00:06:08.779> droid<00:06:09.110> x<00:06:09.229> would

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
for me also i think the droid x would

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.110 
for me also i think the droid x would
went<00:06:09.650> out<00:06:09.710> a<00:06:09.740> little<00:06:10.039> bit<00:06:10.250> for<00:06:10.490> me<00:06:10.669> just

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
went out a little bit for me just

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.510 
went out a little bit for me just
because<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.719> do<00:06:12.259> like<00:06:12.500> the<00:06:12.650> larger<00:06:12.979> screen<00:06:13.310> and

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
because I do like the larger screen and

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.269 
because I do like the larger screen and
it's<00:06:14.240> easier<00:06:14.509> to<00:06:14.629> type<00:06:14.779> up<00:06:15.020> but<00:06:15.710> if<00:06:16.039> you're

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.279 
it's easier to type up but if you're

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.580 
it's easier to type up but if you're
looking<00:06:16.310> for<00:06:16.610> a<00:06:16.789> smaller<00:06:17.060> phone<00:06:17.379> this<00:06:18.379> you

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
looking for a smaller phone this you

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.080

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
can't go wrong with if you must have a

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.999 
can't go wrong with if you must have a
qwerty<00:06:20.300> keyboard<00:06:20.779> you<00:06:21.139> go<00:06:21.319> with<00:06:21.469> the<00:06:21.560> drug<00:06:21.800> to

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
qwerty keyboard you go with the drug to

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.490 
qwerty keyboard you go with the drug to
