00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.540 
medium red and a darker purple here
we're<00:01:08.890> starting<00:01:09.070> off<00:01:09.340> with<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.670> lighter<00:01:09.910> red

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
we're starting off with the lighter red

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.249

we tap it on in a circular motion

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.899 
we tap it on in a circular motion
remembering<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.280> blend<00:01:15.550> it<00:01:15.700> out<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.580> goal<00:01:18.789> is

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
remembering to blend it out the goal is

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.340

vessels under the skin and that takes a

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:30.330 
vessels under the skin and that takes a
lot<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:22.509> blending
