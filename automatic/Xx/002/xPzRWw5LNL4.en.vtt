00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.719
 we were at the LG stand and we are 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.780
 seeing the new smart sharing system 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.930
 with nfc and mira cup called tag on 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:22.080
 who buys a TV lg of 2013 and one 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.960
 Android smartphones will also find in the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.840
 pack a small sticker a tag it 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 let's see it's that sticker sticker 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.410
 then three in the lower part can 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.730
 place that sticker anywhere where 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.219
 there is the remote control on the coffee table 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.200
 next to the TV just support it 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.660
 nfc smartphone on the tag for 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.149
 call up the targeting home application 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.860
 inside the smartphone 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.930
 the application with two arrows is very easy 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.120
 allows us to switch from the smartphone 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.289
 on TV or vice versa for example now 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.730
 is doing mirror so we have 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.530
 moved the arrow from bottom to top 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.840
 up by sending the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.879
 smartphone mirrored towards TV we see 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 that there is a mini malaga some 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.870
 millisecond there is however a mirror 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.100
 practically perfect than what 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.260
 let's see on the smartphone 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.299
 obviously the thing is bi-directional e 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.950
 therefore bastari to support to this point 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.200
 the smartphone on the tag disconnect 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.299
 from the tv aims cannes it says ok 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.790
 we close the connection ri 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.220
 we support to reopen it and first one 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.869
 reverse thing inversely drag the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.729
 arrow from top to bottom then 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.270
 it means we move from the TV to the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.659
 smartphone 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.220
 if the program allows it 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.439
 we will have the remote control with the window 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.970
 the black is not currently the image 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.680
 therefore provided by the program 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.070
 only to stay to control the tv 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.259
 remotely while quietly smart tv there 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.189
 we find ourselves in front of an interface 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.549
 now if he can let us see it 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.630
 at the interface for total control 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.340
 touch environment then using 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.869
 the touch screen of the smartphone for 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.049
 to navigate and to move inside 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.420
 of our smart face lands 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.820
 now recalling it calls it here 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.560
 interface market we have a pad that 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.899
 allows us to navigate with the mouse with the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 arrow directly on the screen 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.370
 this is the smart sharing scheme that 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.900
 works with nfc and I had cash on TV 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.340
 lg of 2013 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.209
 and needs a smartphone 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.209
