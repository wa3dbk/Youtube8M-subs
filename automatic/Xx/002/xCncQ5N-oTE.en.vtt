to be quite honest we do have a quite

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.240 
to be quite honest we do have a quite
easy<00:00:23.369> group<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.900> would<00:00:25.350> say<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.980> we're<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
easy group I would say that we're the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.000 
easy group I would say that we're the
only<00:00:26.400> four<00:00:27.119> or<00:00:27.240> five<00:00:27.449> star<00:00:27.750> rated<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.710> team

when<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> drew<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> groups<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.689> didn't<00:00:30.869> really

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
when I drew the groups I didn't really

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.299 
when I drew the groups I didn't really
pay<00:00:31.230> much<00:00:31.410> attention<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.099> kind<00:00:32.279> of

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
pay much attention I just kind of

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.270 
pay much attention I just kind of
obviously<00:00:32.669> randomly<00:00:33.149> did<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.800> FC

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
obviously randomly did it so we have FC
