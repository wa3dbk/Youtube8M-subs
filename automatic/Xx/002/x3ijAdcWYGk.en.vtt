that<00:00:55.230> clearly<00:00:55.469> makes<00:00:55.739> more<00:00:55.949> sense<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:56.489> but

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that clearly makes more sense now but

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.299 
that clearly makes more sense now but
what<00:00:57.329> tang<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.570> worth<00:00:57.930> looking<00:00:58.289> into<00:00:58.410> he's<00:00:58.800> 6<00:00:59.070> 4

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
what tang is worth looking into he's 6 4

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.760 
what tang is worth looking into he's 6 4
and<00:00:59.550> has<00:00:59.789> strength<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> continue<00:01:01.559> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and has strength is going to continue to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.319 
and has strength is going to continue to
win<00:01:01.890> headers<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.430> us<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.730> even<00:01:03.030> though<00:01:03.149> his

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
win headers for us and even though his

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.579 
win headers for us and even though his
marking<00:01:03.660> isn't<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> greatest<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.500> world

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589

a tired Badstuber Boateng is one of our

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
a tired Badstuber Boateng is one of our
subs<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.229> I'd<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.619> shift<00:01:10.680> him<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.130> the

now remember here we only get three

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.520 
now remember here we only get three
substitutes<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.200> make<00:01:16.350> them

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
really call for a center attacking

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.660 
really call for a center attacking
midfielder<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.079> cam<00:01:49.409> however<00:01:50.189> Crewson

Schweinsteiger<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.450> low<00:01:51.630> stamina<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.590> we

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
Schweinsteiger have low stamina so we

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.280 
Schweinsteiger have low stamina so we
could<00:01:53.159> use<00:01:53.490> him<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:53.909> he's<00:01:54.630> also<00:01:54.840> great<00:01:55.079> at

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
could use him there he's also great at

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.530 
could use him there he's also great at
finishing<00:01:55.590> which<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.399> shot<00:01:56.700> accuracy<00:01:57.000> inside

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
finishing which is shot accuracy inside

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.420 
finishing which is shot accuracy inside
the<00:01:57.659> box<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.259> he's<00:01:58.619> good<00:01:58.799> an<00:01:58.890> attack<00:01:59.250> position

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the box and he's good an attack position

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.429 
the box and he's good an attack position
which<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> tendency<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.810> create<00:02:01.049> space<00:02:01.290> to

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
which is the tendency to create space to

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.139 
which is the tendency to create space to
get<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> better<00:02:01.799> chance<00:02:02.159> at<00:02:02.369> scoring<00:02:02.549> so

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
get a better chance at scoring so

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.730 
get a better chance at scoring so
because<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.110> he<00:02:04.320> would<00:02:04.409> make<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
because of this he would make for a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.819 
because of this he would make for a
great<00:02:04.890> forward<00:02:05.850> replacement<00:02:06.710> Robin<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
great forward replacement Robin and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.889 
great forward replacement Robin and
rebury<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.369> less<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:08.849> stellar<00:02:09.060> stamina<00:02:09.750> so

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
rebury have less than stellar stamina so

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.350 
rebury have less than stellar stamina so
you<00:02:10.050> could<00:02:10.259> use<00:02:10.440> him<00:02:10.619> there<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:11.009> well<00:02:11.360> using

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
you could use him there as well using

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.230 
you could use him there as well using

but<00:02:13.660> where<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.870> put<00:02:14.170> them<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.440> dependent<00:02:14.950> on

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
but where you put them is dependent on

but where you put them is dependent on
the<00:02:15.190> game<00:02:15.400> situation<00:02:16.210> if<00:02:16.870> you're<00:02:17.080> winning<00:02:17.320> you

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
the game situation if you're winning you

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.200 
the game situation if you're winning you
may<00:02:18.040> be<00:02:18.100> better<00:02:18.340> off<00:02:18.520> putting<00:02:18.700> him<00:02:18.910> at<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
may be better off putting him at the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.060 
may be better off putting him at the
midfield<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.900> know<00:02:20.140> he<00:02:20.350> hasn't<00:02:20.590> made<00:02:20.710> for<00:02:20.920> that

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
midfield I know he hasn't made for that

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.090 
midfield I know he hasn't made for that
but<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:21.730> an<00:02:21.850> option<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:22.960> Luiz<00:02:23.200> Gustavo<00:02:23.380> if

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
but it's an option so is Luiz Gustavo if

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.740 
but it's an option so is Luiz Gustavo if
you're<00:02:24.280> losing<00:02:24.460> replace<00:02:25.210> whoever<00:02:25.570> is<00:02:25.660> the

you're losing replace whoever is the

you're losing replace whoever is the
