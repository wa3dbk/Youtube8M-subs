 as a survival 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.870
 why the hell train emerged submerged 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.270
 many more than 1 min 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.359
 something to say is no better thing if I 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.359

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.850
 teach first we need 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.210
 with 30 is enough 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.160
 in pearls of enders with 2016 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.760
 Enough 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.760
 verlander and then on it 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.400
 in the end in the duty I say you're going to 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.400
 find some bugs that are these 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.140
 these bugs that when you kill them you're 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.700
 rods 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 let's grab the postman table 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.860
 these pearls are obtained from the 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.480
 senerman put the caster table put 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.960
 the tongue and grab this 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.110
 put them in alpe adria under the flex 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.380
 powerful and they grab 4 gave us now 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.580
 try to fill the two of 16 now let's go 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.090
 to vote online 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.090
 the ok 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.509
 this law is found in the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.060
 the constructions of reading in the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.890
 reading constructions rediscover and not 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.850
 plus 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.850
 let's do it 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.440
 we have 20 well two more 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.480
 it is not that it is found but more or 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.590
 that are alone 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.590
 they also form alone 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.340
 so it's fine what 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.920
 I wait all day killing these 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.730
 bugs and get all the LEDs what 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.730
 you can not 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.980
 ready we have 32 why that's enough 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.760
 now first we have to prepare 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.020
 for completely and then what 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.340
 we have to do 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.220
 they have to have food and all because 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.200
 even so it is usually long the trip we have 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.760
 to touch second click 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.760
 and will continue where they point us 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.890
 skype and you keep right follow 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.760
 done for a while note every time and 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.760
 then it 's like that 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.760
 two 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.970
 and they got it again yet sometimes it breaks 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:24.030
 so it does not appear more what we say 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.030
 I think the eye but if we continue here 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.200
 we go over there we will find the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.890
 slow I will do fast camera 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.890
 ah 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.880
 good 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.880
 well one goes away cap 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.710
 they saw that it was a short trip 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.420
 It does not take long but sometimes usually 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.420
 be very, very long 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.780
 they saw when it starts to go down 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.820
 here you are here and when it starts 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.820
 down have to end up below 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.340
 the good street 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:38.180
 and put them perfect 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.180
 now it does not become breaking the dispossession 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.969
 quietly to open this portal 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.869
 what do they do this 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:49.159
 put your eyes on the one that remains here 

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:51.309
 obvious that they keep the coordinates in case 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.309
 The doubts 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.389
 good usually when I 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.849
 when you put in the eyes of ender not you 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.060
 suddenly a portal appears but 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.410
 you see that since I was next 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.280
 and well we are here you have to leave 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.280
 go out and give more to 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.480
 this with dates this exploits that 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.920
 is what makes the dragon's life the 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.350
 inverse if to himself from the beginning not 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.360
 you will not take it out, that is, if you take it out 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.180
 life but it regenerates with these two 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.990
 wells and 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.009
 that's not easy to kill him the problem 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.009
 here are the evil doing 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.819
 I dont know 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.620
 and good if these videos told him 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.759
 secret and certain also then the 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.759
 next video to all
