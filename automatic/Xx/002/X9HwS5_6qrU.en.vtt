depending on your tastes and then just

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.600 
depending on your tastes and then just

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
so I'm just scooping the mixture with

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.240 
so I'm just scooping the mixture with
like<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> big<00:03:35.940> tablespoon<00:03:36.650> onto<00:03:37.650> my<00:03:37.860> tinfoil

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
like a big tablespoon onto my tinfoil

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.800 
like a big tablespoon onto my tinfoil
because<00:03:38.550> I<00:03:38.640> didn't<00:03:38.910> have<00:03:39.090> parchment<00:03:39.630> paper

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
because I didn't have parchment paper

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.390 
because I didn't have parchment paper

parchment<00:03:41.820> paper<00:03:42.000> because<00:03:42.210> tin<00:03:42.630> foil<00:03:42.870> works

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260
