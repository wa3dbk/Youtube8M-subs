why<00:00:37.180> it's<00:00:37.629> awesome<00:00:38.129> admittedly<00:00:39.129> not<00:00:39.429> ideal

why it's awesome admittedly not ideal

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.130 
why it's awesome admittedly not ideal
for<00:00:39.969> the<00:00:40.030> under<00:00:40.239> eyes<00:00:40.359> because<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.809> coverage

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
for the under eyes because the coverage

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.349 
for the under eyes because the coverage
is<00:00:41.379> minimal<00:00:41.800> but<00:00:42.160> I<00:00:42.190> love<00:00:42.489> it<00:00:42.640> for<00:00:42.820> around<00:00:43.089> the

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.329 
is minimal but I love it for around the
crevasse<00:00:43.690> of<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.929> nose<00:00:44.140> because<00:00:44.589> it<00:00:44.800> doesn't

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
crevasse of the nose because it doesn't

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.880 
crevasse of the nose because it doesn't
pick<00:00:45.460> up<00:00:45.550> any<00:00:45.730> texture<00:00:46.329> or<00:00:46.600> flaky<00:00:46.870> patches<00:00:47.109> the

pick up any texture or flaky patches the

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.009 
pick up any texture or flaky patches the
consistency<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.670> rather<00:00:48.850> emollient<00:00:49.480> so<00:00:49.899> I'm

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
consistency is rather emollient so I'm

using<00:00:50.199> that<00:00:50.409> under<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:50.739> eyes<00:00:50.949> and<00:00:51.280> to

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
using that under the eyes and to

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.750 
using that under the eyes and to
neutralize<00:00:51.909> any<00:00:52.179> redness<00:00:52.629> on<00:00:52.749> the<00:00:52.899> nose

that<00:01:35.860> brow<00:01:36.040> powder<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.580> much<00:01:36.820> faster<00:01:37.120> than

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.000 
brow pen or brow pencil or what-have-you
it's<00:01:39.940> also<00:01:40.240> more<00:01:40.660> forgiving<00:01:41.230> so<00:01:41.470> precision

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
it's also more forgiving so precision

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.700 
it's also more forgiving so precision
isn't<00:01:42.220> paramount<00:01:42.940> honestly<00:01:43.900> I<00:01:44.080> don't<00:01:44.290> possess

any<00:01:45.160> precision<00:01:45.700> until<00:01:46.120> about<00:01:46.390> 1:00<00:01:47.290> p.m.<00:01:47.530> and

makes my hair far more obedient like dry

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.930 
makes my hair far more obedient like dry
shampoo<00:05:19.870> it<00:05:20.500> also<00:05:20.740> refreshes<00:05:21.430> second<00:05:21.790> day

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
shampoo it also refreshes second day

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.810 
shampoo it also refreshes second day
hair<00:05:22.270> but<00:05:22.600> unlike<00:05:22.750> dry<00:05:23.470> shampoo<00:05:23.980> I<00:05:24.190> find<00:05:24.700> this

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
hair but unlike dry shampoo I find this

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.760 
hair but unlike dry shampoo I find this
product<00:05:25.210> is<00:05:25.360> totally<00:05:25.810> weightless<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.440> it

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
product is totally weightless and it

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.530 
product is totally weightless and it
doesn't<00:05:27.100> make<00:05:27.190> my<00:05:27.340> hair<00:05:27.640> feel<00:05:27.940> gritty<00:05:28.270> or

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
doesn't make my hair feel gritty or

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.050 
doesn't make my hair feel gritty or
dirty<00:05:28.990> because<00:05:29.440> in<00:05:30.160> my<00:05:30.400> opinion<00:05:30.550> there's

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
dirty because in my opinion there's

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.090 
dirty because in my opinion there's
nothing<00:05:31.450> worse<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:32.230> only<00:05:32.470> downside<00:05:32.920> is<00:05:32.950> that

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
nothing worse the only downside is that

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.620 
nothing worse the only downside is that
the<00:05:33.280> results<00:05:33.640> don't<00:05:33.790> last<00:05:34.030> all<00:05:34.240> day<00:05:34.390> so<00:05:34.450> I

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
the results don't last all day so I

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.300 
the results don't last all day so I
should<00:05:34.810> probably<00:05:34.960> buy<00:05:35.230> a<00:05:35.590> little<00:05:35.950> mini<00:05:36.130> one

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
should probably buy a little mini one

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.490 
should probably buy a little mini one
