I<00:00:16.670> talked<00:00:17.390> to<00:00:17.540> Tex<00:00:17.750> man<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.050> got<00:00:18.169> a<00:00:18.200> very<00:00:18.590> nice

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
I talked to Tex man and got a very nice

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.159 
I talked to Tex man and got a very nice
solution<00:00:19.099> it's<00:00:19.849> called<00:00:20.119> custom<00:00:20.330> scrolling<00:00:21.020> it

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
solution it's called custom scrolling it

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.200 
solution it's called custom scrolling it
actually<00:00:21.650> adds<00:00:21.860> some<00:00:22.220> functionality<00:00:22.939> to<00:00:22.970> the

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
actually adds some functionality to the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.260 
actually adds some functionality to the
previous<00:00:23.630> scrolling<00:00:24.079> functionality<00:00:25.119> first<00:00:26.119> I

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
previous scrolling functionality first I

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.850 
previous scrolling functionality first I
would<00:00:26.390> like<00:00:26.419> to<00:00:26.720> show<00:00:26.930> you<00:00:26.960> how<00:00:27.349> to<00:00:27.380> set<00:00:27.680> it<00:00:27.710> up

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
would like to show you how to set it up

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.889 
would like to show you how to set it up
and<00:00:28.040> snag<00:00:28.279> it<00:00:28.489> and<00:00:28.669> then<00:00:28.820> I<00:00:28.849> will<00:00:29.270> show<00:00:29.599> you<00:00:29.660> how

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
to use it

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.670

so<00:00:31.460> here<00:00:31.640> I<00:00:31.669> open<00:00:32.090> Snagit<00:00:32.630> we<00:00:33.350> have<00:00:33.530> the

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
so here I open Snagit we have the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.040 
so here I open Snagit we have the
all-in-one<00:00:34.130> capture<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.270> now<00:00:35.660> we<00:00:35.780> need<00:00:35.960> to

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
all-in-one capture and now we need to

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.799 
all-in-one capture and now we need to
change<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:36.620> settings<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:37.370> what<00:00:38.030> we<00:00:38.120> do<00:00:38.300> is<00:00:38.510> we

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
change the settings so what we do is we

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.860 
change the settings so what we do is we
go<00:00:38.989> down<00:00:39.020> to<00:00:39.410> input<00:00:39.920> which<00:00:40.700> is<00:00:40.730> all-in-one<00:00:41.390> and

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
go down to input which is all-in-one and

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.319 
go down to input which is all-in-one and
we<00:00:42.320> go<00:00:42.469> to<00:00:42.530> advanced<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.429> under<00:00:43.730> advanced<00:00:44.179> we

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
we go to advanced and under advanced we

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.619 
we go to advanced and under advanced we
find<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:45.050> custom<00:00:45.620> scroll<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:46.730> we<00:00:46.850> set<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:47.059> and

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
find the custom scroll so we set it and

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.290 
find the custom scroll so we set it and
it<00:00:47.929> an<00:00:48.050> information<00:00:48.710> window<00:00:48.859> appears<00:00:49.429> okay<00:00:50.239> so

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
it an information window appears okay so

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.910 
it an information window appears okay so
the<00:00:50.570> custom<00:00:50.929> scroll<00:00:51.140> is<00:00:51.320> set<00:00:51.559> up<00:00:51.710> in

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
the custom scroll is set up in

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.649 
the custom scroll is set up in
all-in-one<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:52.579> I<00:00:52.609> want<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:52.999> to<00:00:53.210> be<00:00:53.329> under<00:00:53.629> a

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
all-in-one but I want it to be under a

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.319 
all-in-one but I want it to be under a

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
to use the custom scroll I open a web

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.679 
to use the custom scroll I open a web
page<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:24.530> I<00:01:24.590> want<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.130> capture<00:01:25.700> scrolling

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
page that I want to capture scrolling

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.609 
page that I want to capture scrolling
and<00:01:26.899> this<00:01:27.170> is<00:01:27.289> the<00:01:27.409> Snagit<00:01:27.799> guide<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.420> in

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
and this is the Snagit guide and in

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.310 
and this is the Snagit guide and in
Snagit<00:01:30.619> I<00:01:30.740> click<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.159> capture<00:01:31.430> button<00:01:32.320> now

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.440 
Snagit I click the capture button now
normally<00:01:33.860> only<00:01:33.979> one<00:01:34.250> would<00:01:34.729> capture<00:01:35.210> the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
normally only one would capture the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.690 
normally only one would capture the
whole<00:01:35.630> page<00:01:35.899> but<00:01:36.140> I<00:01:36.200> want<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.500> leave<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.579> little
