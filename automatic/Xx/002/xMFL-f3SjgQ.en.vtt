00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
me I still think this is a bit of a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.839 
me I still think this is a bit of a
wasted<00:02:33.560> slot<00:02:33.860> for<00:02:34.220> something<00:02:34.670> that's

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
wasted slot for something that's

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.400

multicolored<00:02:35.450> why<00:02:35.750> don't<00:02:35.930> they<00:02:36.080> put<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
multicolored why don't they put the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.940 
multicolored why don't they put the
first<00:02:36.590> five<00:02:36.830> color<00:02:37.069> angel<00:02:37.870> because<00:02:38.870> why<00:02:39.620> I

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
first five color angel because why I

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.210 
first five color angel because why I
don't<00:02:40.640> understand<00:02:41.120> that's<00:02:41.690> much<00:02:42.290> better<00:02:42.860> I

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
don't understand that's much better I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.670 
don't understand that's much better I

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
talk about it before overall I think

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.520 
talk about it before overall I think
it's<00:04:58.280> a<00:04:58.400> it's<00:04:59.210> an<00:04:59.390> overall<00:04:59.750> win<00:04:59.960> it's<00:05:00.230> good

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
it's a it's an overall win it's good

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
solid value set I don't think it's going

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.100 
solid value set I don't think it's going

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
to push the price into ridiculous ranges

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.290 
to push the price into ridiculous ranges
because<00:05:06.380> there's<00:05:06.590> not<00:05:06.950> so<00:05:07.730> much<00:05:07.850> in<00:05:08.030> here

that's<00:05:08.750> gonna<00:05:09.080> that's<00:05:09.380> going<00:05:09.770> to<00:05:09.830> make<00:05:10.100> it

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
that's gonna that's going to make it

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.850 
that's gonna that's going to make it
like<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.550> 200<00:05:10.970> hour<00:05:11.060> set<00:05:11.390> I<00:05:11.510> don't<00:05:11.720> think<00:05:11.830> but<00:05:12.830> I

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860
