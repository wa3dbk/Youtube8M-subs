Yolo like this break story progression
but<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.710> don't<00:00:52.860> know<00:00:52.949> how<00:00:53.100> much<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> actually

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
but I don't know how much it actually

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.920 
but I don't know how much it actually
does<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.239> means<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.780> use

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
does it just means that you can use

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.040 
does it just means that you can use
certain<00:00:55.170> HMS<00:00:55.680> before<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.070> beat<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> gym<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
certain HMS before you beat the gym and

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.540 
certain HMS before you beat the gym and
it's<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> huge<00:00:58.590> deal<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.070> don't<00:00:59.219> know<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
it's not a huge deal I don't know but I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.279 
it's not a huge deal I don't know but I
haven't<00:00:59.760> actually<00:00:59.879> fully<00:01:00.359> beta<00:01:00.750> tested<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
haven't actually fully beta tested it

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.599 
haven't actually fully beta tested it
obviously<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.800> gonna<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> little<00:01:02.219> butchy

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
obviously it's gonna be a little butchy

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.320 
obviously it's gonna be a little butchy
but<00:01:02.789> complete<00:01:03.449> pokedex<00:01:03.960> plus<00:01:04.489> 999<00:01:05.489> dexnav

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
but complete pokedex plus 999 dexnav

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.719 
but complete pokedex plus 999 dexnav
that<00:01:07.140> makes<00:01:07.439> every<00:01:07.830> pokemon<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.280> encounter

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that makes every pokemon you encounter

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 
that makes every pokemon you encounter
like<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> super<00:01:09.299> rare<00:01:09.479> kind<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.900> thing<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.200> assume

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
like a super rare kind of thing I assume

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.969 
like a super rare kind of thing I assume
so<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.280> kind<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.549> cool<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:13.560> reason<00:01:13.890> I'm

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
so that's kind of cool the reason I'm

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.560 
so that's kind of cool the reason I'm
still<00:01:14.189> covering<00:01:14.549> power<00:01:14.790> saves<00:01:15.240> like

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
still covering power saves like

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.380 
still covering power saves like
obviously<00:01:16.320> Jenning<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.250> real<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.909> Jenning<00:01:18.270> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
obviously Jenning is real and Jenning is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
obviously Jenning is real and Jenning is
here<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.500> what's<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> point<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.280> power

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
here so like what's the point of power

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.190 
here so like what's the point of power
saves<00:01:20.820> right<00:01:21.090> well<00:01:21.299> they<00:01:21.540> still<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.930> some

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
saves right well they still have some

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.289 
saves right well they still have some
things<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.740> are<00:01:22.860> better<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.490> right<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.270> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
things that are better like right now I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030 
things that are better like right now I
don't<00:01:24.570> think<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.080> don't<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.770> save

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
don't think I don't know if the save

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
don't think I don't know if the save
changing<00:01:26.909> save<00:01:27.150> swapping<00:01:27.659> save<00:01:27.840> editing<00:01:28.259> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
changing save swapping save editing is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.719 
changing save swapping save editing is
actually<00:01:28.740> fully<00:01:28.920> implemented<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
actually fully implemented for the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.010 
actually fully implemented for the
spider<00:01:30.299> tools<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:32.540> stuff<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.630> complete

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
spider tools so stuff like complete

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020 
spider tools so stuff like complete
pokedex<00:01:34.439> 99<00:01:34.799> 9<00:01:34.920> dexnav<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.520> actually<00:01:35.820> kind<00:01:35.970> of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
pokedex 99 9 dexnav is actually kind of

tutorial i did you can use that too
we<00:02:13.980> edit<00:02:14.280> them<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.550> make<00:02:14.670> them<00:02:14.850> competitive

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
so that would be good for that all these

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.260 
so that would be good for that all these
things<00:02:17.400> are<00:02:17.550> good<00:02:17.730> for<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.970> because<00:02:18.060> they're

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
things are good for that because they're

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.320 
things are good for that because they're
all<00:02:18.300> legitimate<00:02:19.310> except<00:02:20.310> for<00:02:20.430> obviously<00:02:20.610> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
I'll leave a like if this was helpful

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.860 
I'll leave a like if this was helpful
but<00:03:26.970> we'll<00:03:27.060> block<00:03:29.120> I'm<00:03:30.120> gonna<00:03:30.269> do<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.630> one

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
but we'll block I'm gonna do that one

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.729 
but we'll block I'm gonna do that one
and<00:03:31.080> this<00:03:31.140> other<00:03:31.380> one<00:03:32.239> this<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.299> 999<00:03:33.900> obviously

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
and this other one this is 999 obviously

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.560 
and this other one this is 999 obviously
there<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.310> same<00:03:35.549> swapping<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:36.330> probably

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
there is same swapping and it's probably

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.060 
there is same swapping and it's probably
gonna<00:03:36.660> be<00:03:36.780> here<00:03:36.959> soon<00:03:37.140> but<00:03:37.380> power-save<00:03:37.799> still

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
gonna be here soon but power-save still

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.270 
gonna be here soon but power-save still
has<00:03:38.220> some<00:03:38.489> uses<00:03:39.019> so<00:03:40.019> hopefully<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.799> becomes

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
has some uses so hopefully that becomes

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.360 
has some uses so hopefully that becomes
that<00:03:41.489> in<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.299> future<00:03:42.830> these<00:03:43.830> might<00:03:44.100> die<00:03:44.310> down

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
that in the future these might die down

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.160 
that in the future these might die down
a<00:03:44.640> little<00:03:44.760> bit<00:03:45.120> until<00:03:45.450> at<00:03:45.570> least<00:03:45.690> Z<00:03:46.019> or

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
a little bit until at least Z or

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.479 
a little bit until at least Z or
whatever<00:03:46.440> comes<00:03:46.709> out<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:46.980> we're<00:03:47.100> stuck<00:03:47.310> with

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
whatever comes out and we're stuck with

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.009 
whatever comes out and we're stuck with

only power save for that for the

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.620 
only power save for that for the
probably<00:03:49.650> 2<00:03:49.890> days<00:03:50.100> or<00:03:50.730> if<00:03:50.910> they<00:03:51.060> patch<00:03:51.299> this

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
probably 2 days or if they patch this

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
but basically power saves is dying a
