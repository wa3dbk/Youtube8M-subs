00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello good 2 x killer welcome to 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:06.150
 a new video and I bring you the review of 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.500
 roy estimated the season 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.820
 first of all tell them that as always 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.950
 the description have the page for 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.680
 buy coins a discount code and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.210
 good a network and a little uneven the 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.150
 that you follow me on twitter you will know that 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.489
 Well, I've had a problem with the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.949
 time to be able to take them out without game 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.810
 how good the video where they are 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.800
 plus a pair of goals that he scored with 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.689
 he then nothing is wrong recorded there are jumps 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 and that's why I have to take the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.930
 borrowed from a video of it any you're going 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.430
 to have your channel in the description by 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.100
 if you want to see many reviews of many 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.219
 good players the best stands are 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.050
 97 95 dribbling defects 99 of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.079
 definition 97 book prediction 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.530
 direct 99 far shot 98 power 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.960
 of shot 97 of golear 97 of agility 99 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.640
 answer and 96 speed let's see 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.609
 a few clicks is worth talking about 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.900
 little of the god player of his states in 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.620
 the letter 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.960
 94 of rhythm that you notice a mega player 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 fast for those of you who have tried it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.920
 well, we a little more to the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.650
 same speed as Christian ronaldo the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.060
 normal version for you to do more or 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.340
 less an idea obviously is not very 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.190
 powerful as him but the as for 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.350
 pure speed is more or less similar 94 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.510
 shooting is a pretty good shot on 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.820
 everything very precise I do not know maybe it's missing 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.700
 a little power sometimes but yes that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.500
 it's a pretty accurate shot and I do not think 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.490
 It is reaching 94 but still shot 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.680
 pretty good 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.450
 88 of passes you already know that in which I 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.570
 fixed as there are very few players at 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.520
 that you really notice the pass 93 of 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.400
 dribble a super agile player can you 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.130
 Do almost what you want with the 91 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.630
 ball control makes the player 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.330
 seem slower to carry the ball 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.360
 stuck to the foot or the ball will escape 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.310
 too much and it seems clumsy so I 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.220
 I think he has the perfect dribble 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.960
 his defense qualities 52 that in this 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.330
 case then it does not matter much 68 the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.130
 headbutting that either 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.340
 there we are seeing the pros and the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.490
 cons as you can see I have added a new 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.040
 Novelty surely you have seen it in 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.480
 the reviews of ariany and such that you have 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.420
 also your channel in the description by 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.860
 If you do not know him, imagine that these 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.240
 heights everyone knows that necessary 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.280
 but just in case because you have in the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.190
 description, go there to see 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.740
 some videos pretty tseltal cursed that 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.050
 goes up 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.980
 you have an opinion of the letter there 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.240
 of the states of the letter and the pros the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.660
 rhythm 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.640
 I think you can see what the letter says 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.040
 that the 94 neither more nor less has the rhythm 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.110
 fair and good then starting that the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.630
 same the right rhythm is a super player 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.130
 quick the shot even if it's not so good 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.990
 like the one who puts history on the letter 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.430
 at least I have not noticed so of 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.100
 good because the lack maybe that 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.590
 power the truth that has a shot 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.410
 pretty good very accurate that always 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.290
 because it will not see will not disappoint 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.880
 the shot the dribble has a dribble 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.560
 also pretty good I tell you have 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.380
 just how to control the ball so that 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.110
 they leave him and he seems slower and then 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.340
 because the agility and such spectacular the 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.500
 four filigree stars that 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.170
 always help and strength is a player 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.360
 that although it is not so much the force I think 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.920
 that also influences the balance more 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.610
 that more than strength but is a player 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.040
 that the truth does not cost much to take it 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.710
 to the ground and the counter because the only one is 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.770
 that sometimes is not in place seems 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.940
 like that feels as much 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.190
 fact of 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.380
 the action of going to Zen to the ms or the 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.080
 position of ms or even sometimes to the 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.390
 of the center forward according to what situation 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.880
 You can come well but objectively 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.560
 is a player who should be in the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.690
 band because that's where you put it for 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.910
 play and there are times that it is not for the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.970
 everything is correct and good then there 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.320
 is saying the letter of mine I would 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.930
 I keep the same rhythm took away a 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.090
 little shot of 94 90 took away a 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.370
 little pass because the 88 of passes me 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.680
 I think it must belong to a player 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.330
 that stands out more than him I put the 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.880
 Dodge because I already tell you that for me it is 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.920
 spectacular the handling of ball over 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.750
 everything in the race he has and the defense and 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.220
 the headbutt because it lowered a little 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.630
 head butt because he has not won me almost 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.850
 no ball overlooked and defense by 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.239
 be the unequal because it does not influence and 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.070
 well, this is all this amount 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.920
 of information makes it worthy of a 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.560
 note of 95 that would bring it closer to 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.770
 outstanding to honors 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.570
 and is kept on their sites and if 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.520
 do what you have to do is 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.190
 stay in the band and get separated by 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.680
 the band and I would not have that much go to the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.210
 center anyway is a player 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.310
 totally recommended is not 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.770
 excessively expensive for what it should and 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.200
 for and for what really performs well 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.760
 I recommend you go for it and nothing 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.990
 well up to here of the video already known 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.850
 always in which favorites has 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.410
 liked to follow me on twitter below 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.389
 Spain is killer in case you have any 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.669
 I'm sure you want to ask me anything 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.669
 anything and a greeting until soon
