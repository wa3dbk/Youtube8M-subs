family<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.580> talking<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.940> my<00:00:15.030> mom<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.450> we

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
family so I was talking to my mom and we

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.810 
family so I was talking to my mom and we
were<00:00:15.630> brainstorming<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.070> after<00:00:17.520> we

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
were brainstorming it and after we

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.580 
were brainstorming it and after we
discussed<00:00:18.240> things<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.779> few<00:00:18.960> minutes<00:00:19.380> she

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
finally came up with the idea that I

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.210 
finally came up with the idea that I
would<00:00:23.699> get<00:00:23.850> back<00:00:24.119> into<00:00:24.449> crochet<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.830> that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
would get back into crochet and that

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.640 
would get back into crochet and that
settled<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.199> make<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
settled it it was going to make the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.630 
settled it it was going to make the
perfect<00:00:29.449> April<00:00:30.449> Fool's<00:00:30.779> Day<00:00:31.019> joke<00:00:31.380> ship<00:00:32.099> the

perfect April Fool's Day joke ship the
whole<00:00:33.000> thing<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.960> completely<00:00:34.680> fake<00:00:35.340> well

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
out and fade and stuff which didn't

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.679 
out and fade and stuff which didn't
really<00:01:07.380> turn<00:01:07.560> out<00:01:07.619> as<00:01:08.040> much<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.270> hoped<00:01:09.570> but

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
really turn out as much as I hoped but

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
really turn out as much as I hoped but
yeah<00:01:10.290> they're<00:01:10.500> pretty<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> reason

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
yeah they're pretty good so the reason

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.149 
yeah they're pretty good so the reason
why<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.479> trolls<00:01:12.780> crochet<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> reason

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
why we trolls crochet that so the reason

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.390 
why we trolls crochet that so the reason
why<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.490> chose<00:01:17.520> crochet<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:20.220> most

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
why we chose crochet is because for most

why we chose crochet is because for most
people<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.060> would<00:01:21.210> seem<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.570> an<00:01:22.130> unrealistic

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
people it would seem like an unrealistic

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.170 
people it would seem like an unrealistic
hobby<00:01:23.909> change<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.259> most<00:01:25.890> people<00:01:26.369> that's<00:01:26.850> why<00:01:27.150> I

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
hobby change so most people that's why I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
chose it and what made it even better is

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
since it was a big project to begin with

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.949 
since it was a big project to begin with
it<00:04:15.980> just<00:04:16.400> took<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.669> long<00:04:17.000> time<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.509> make<00:04:17.660> and

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
but I still have been cubing just as

adjustable<00:04:37.789> V<00:04:38.449> cubes<00:04:38.840> I<00:04:39.020> mean<00:04:39.169> currently<00:04:39.410> the

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
adjustable V cubes I mean currently the

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.460 
adjustable V cubes I mean currently the
reason<00:04:40.009> why<00:04:40.130> you<00:04:40.190> didn't<00:04:40.580> see<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.479> V<00:04:41.630> Cube<00:04:41.990> 5

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
reason why you didn't see the V Cube 5

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.310 
reason why you didn't see the V Cube 5
or<00:04:42.860> 7<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:44.090> know<00:04:44.210> in<00:04:44.330> this<00:04:44.449> video<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:44.870> last<00:04:45.139> one

or 7 you know in this video and last one

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.839 
or 7 you know in this video and last one
is<00:04:45.349> because<00:04:45.650> they<00:04:45.770> are<00:04:45.860> currently<00:04:46.220> in<00:04:46.400> pieces

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
is because they are currently in pieces

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.490 
is because they are currently in pieces
because<00:04:47.090> of<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.240> project<00:04:47.720> but<00:04:48.169> right<00:04:48.320> now<00:04:48.470> I

because of the project but right now I

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.200 
because of the project but right now I
use<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.370> core<00:04:49.910> from<00:04:50.810> my<00:04:51.139> main<00:04:51.410> oh<00:04:51.770> no<00:04:52.759> from<00:04:53.000> the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
use a core from my main oh no from the

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.930 
use a core from my main oh no from the
pink<00:04:53.479> cube<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:54.020> have<00:04:54.259> to<00:04:54.889> pull<00:04:55.490> this<00:04:55.729> together

you've<00:05:05.720> seen<00:05:05.990> in<00:05:06.229> any<00:05:06.410> cores<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.610> be<00:05:07.970> sure<00:05:08.000> to

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
you've seen in any cores so be sure to

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.659 
you've seen in any cores so be sure to
look<00:05:08.900> out<00:05:09.139> for<00:05:09.289> that<00:05:09.410> tutorial<00:05:09.830> I<00:05:10.220> will<00:05:10.280> make

actually my first cube for you order so

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.149 
actually my first cube for you order so
after<00:05:17.660> getting<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.020> great<00:05:18.349> confirmation

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.040 
after getting the great confirmation
that<00:05:19.340> I<00:05:19.370> hadn't<00:05:19.849> paid<00:05:19.970> enough<00:05:20.270> money<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.750> am

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
that I hadn't paid enough money I am

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.629 
that I hadn't paid enough money I am
looking<00:05:21.409> forward<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:21.770> receive<00:05:22.130> them<00:05:22.340> in<00:05:22.490> two

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
looking forward to receive them in two

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.909 
looking forward to receive them in two
to<00:05:22.759> four<00:05:22.940> weeks<00:05:22.970> I<00:05:23.419> think<00:05:23.780> it's<00:05:24.080> after<00:05:24.380> but

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
to four weeks I think it's after but

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.249 
to four weeks I think it's after but
it's<00:05:25.400> only<00:05:25.580> been<00:05:25.759> one<00:05:26.060> week<00:05:26.210> so<00:05:26.419> far<00:05:26.599> so<00:05:26.930> it

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
it's only been one week so far so it

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.050 
it's only been one week so far so it
should<00:05:27.470> be<00:05:27.590> one<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:28.009> three<00:05:28.039> weeks<00:05:28.400> by<00:05:28.580> now<00:05:28.759> but

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
should be one to three weeks by now but

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.060 
should be one to three weeks by now but
of<00:05:29.240> course<00:05:29.449> it<00:05:29.630> says<00:05:29.840> or<00:05:30.409> I<00:05:30.560> could<00:05:30.740> even<00:05:30.770> be

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
of course it says or I could even be

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.580 
of course it says or I could even be
more<00:05:31.220> than<00:05:31.340> four<00:05:31.970> weeks<00:05:32.150> if<00:05:32.449> it's<00:05:32.570> delayed<00:05:32.870> so

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
more than four weeks if it's delayed so

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.469 
more than four weeks if it's delayed so
I'm<00:05:34.130> very<00:05:34.430> much<00:05:34.550> looking<00:05:34.699> forward<00:05:35.000> to<00:05:35.270> that

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
I'm very much looking forward to that

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.899 
I'm very much looking forward to that
