00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.320
 and 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.080
 for pure 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:23.320
 larger and more massive than me but 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:24.490
 super fast what extension 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.270
 after his relaxation is even more 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.220
 impressive 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.590
 neither of them wants to give anything away 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.420
 are even level what phenomenon what 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.470
 to chi anyway 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.730
 after all this time spent away from 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.530
 parquet he stands up to camille 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.430
 maybe it's just gamiq 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.430
 his rhythm during this time 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.750
 however the movements of ti oc are 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.350
 weird it's tougher than I 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.350
 I imagined 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.510
 gold he passed thin I reacted too late 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.870
 yeah 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.870
 It's not over 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.970
 it 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.500
 I do not believe he managed to give in 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.500
 the back of kiyami kiyami to win 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.600
 congratulations I did not think that 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.950
 I was going to win 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:32.060
 I will keep the position of incumbent 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:39.500
 come back to the dock and wait on that 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:42.710
 kind between more damn what 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.850
 that you have behind the head you shi hu 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.780
 he is really your friend's balze 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.350
 rooftop business in the team a 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.060
 down I can not help it's life and my 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.009
 lack of practice absolutely do not excuse 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.880
 nothing was played on merit nothing to say 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.170
 on the merit 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.490
 stop telling bullshit 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.720
 the species of staying watch your feet 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.720
 you played in stupid slippers 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.590

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.040
 expressly lose by chance honestly 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.640
 the dumpling 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.640
 you did not do it on purpose it's not true 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.640
 and
