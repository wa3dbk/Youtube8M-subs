 the people of banfield who has a lot 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.939

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.989
 leadership and a joy for all of them

 from the campus to the teacher's order 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.850
 he was working in good air watching 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.430
 the big goal of the season with 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.350
 that operation return how did the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.629
 name from within the campus and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.270
 then count on 82 yes yes we are 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.550
 behind our goal we are each 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.010
 closer time being aware that 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.899
 there are many games ahead that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.990
 we can not relax and well the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.500
 Saturday we have a difficult game against 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.570
 a great rival 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.730
 in the first the first semester we 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.350
 won we will try to make a good match 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.510
 keeping the same style we talk about 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.010
 work continuity projects are 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.650
 is also talking about the renovation 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.980
 of contract how how that topic goes how 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.020
 is moving forward the truth is read 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.600
 dialogue with the president eduardo 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.320
 espinoza I think I've found some 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.150
 people like few in football of the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.120
 that I had to be with which 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.020
 we maintain a mutual sincerity he knows 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.190
 very clear from me the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.260
 proposals that come to me 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.970
 and there is a proposal from banfield 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.430
 but the goal is in first in 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.280
 rise and it's pretty advanced all 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.380
 but God willing we can ascend what 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.380
 fastest possible after a return
