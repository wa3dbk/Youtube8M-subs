00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
that you keep the zipper part far enough

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.229 
that you keep the zipper part far enough
away<00:00:50.010> from<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> fabric<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> fabric

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
doesn't get caught in the zipper so then

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.520 
doesn't get caught in the zipper so then
you'll<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.570> start<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> bottom<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.440> the
