this<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.360> going<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> base<00:02:01.140> line<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
this is going to be the base line that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.880 
this is going to be the base line that
you<00:02:01.799> follow<00:02:02.159> when<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.969> draw<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.750> wing<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890

the<00:02:07.530> Mac<00:02:07.710> 263<00:02:08.640> brush<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.450> chose<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:10.020> brush

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
the Mac 263 brush and I chose this brush

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.640 
the Mac 263 brush and I chose this brush
because<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:11.009> creates<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.610> straight<00:02:12.360> even

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
because it creates a straight even

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.399 
because it creates a straight even
then<00:02:13.769> line<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.879> all<00:02:15.060> by<00:02:15.209> itself<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:16.110> brush

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
then line just all by itself the brush

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.979 
then line just all by itself the brush

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
I tried to do this with the tart brush

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.839 
I tried to do this with the tart brush
several<00:02:22.500> times<00:02:22.860> when<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.250> was<00:02:23.430> first<00:02:23.640> teaching

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
several times when I was first teaching

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.539 
several times when I was first teaching
myself<00:02:24.180> how<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.689> this<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.140> doesn't<00:02:25.549> work

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
myself how to do this it doesn't work

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
line so that I have a base point to work

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.660 
line so that I have a base point to work
from<00:02:42.239> when<00:02:42.750> I'm<00:02:42.870> forming<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.620> wing<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.519> that's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
from when I'm forming the wing so that's

tart brush and using small quick strokes

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.599 
tart brush and using small quick strokes
to<00:02:50.040> create<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.489> smooth<00:02:51.000> even<00:02:51.569> line<00:02:52.340> now<00:02:53.340> here's

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.660 
video about a quarter of the way down
that<00:03:00.750> line<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.409> we<00:03:01.530> formed<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.489> where

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
that line that we formed this is where

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.420 
that line that we formed this is where
you<00:03:02.790> want<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.150> start<00:03:03.450> dragging<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.799> color<00:03:05.099> in

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
you want to start dragging the color in

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.940 
you want to start dragging the color in
to<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.299> line<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.780> we<00:03:06.930> drew<00:03:07.319> on<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.680> upper

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
to the line that we drew on the upper

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.979 
to the line that we drew on the upper
lash<00:03:08.159> line<00:03:08.189> when<00:03:08.909> i<00:03:08.939> was<00:03:09.150> teaching<00:03:09.329> myself<00:03:09.659> how

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
lash line when i was teaching myself how

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.500 
lash line when i was teaching myself how
to<00:03:10.019> do<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.409> i<00:03:10.650> found<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.609> if<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.819> start<00:03:12.329> a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
to do this i found that if you start a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.509 
to do this i found that if you start a
quarter<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.230> way<00:03:13.349> down<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.859> line<00:03:14.189> and

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
quarter of the way down that line and

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.319 
quarter of the way down that line and
you<00:03:14.639> drag<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.299> in<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.780> slow<00:03:16.680> even<00:03:17.129> strokes<00:03:18.030> it

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
you drag it in in slow even strokes it

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.289 
you drag it in in slow even strokes it
makes<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.410> look<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.919> little<00:03:20.310> more<00:03:20.609> fluid

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
makes the look a little more fluid

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.229 
makes the look a little more fluid
whereas<00:03:22.109> if<00:03:22.379> you<00:03:22.590> started<00:03:23.220> at<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.519> very<00:03:23.790> tip

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
whereas if you started at the very tip

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.420 
whereas if you started at the very tip
of<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.569> wing<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.290> started<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.859> drag<00:03:26.220> it

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
of that wing and you started to drag it

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.360 
of that wing and you started to drag it
down<00:03:26.669> towards<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.720> upper<00:03:28.290> lash<00:03:28.500> line<00:03:28.530> it

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
down towards the upper lash line it

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.750 
down towards the upper lash line it
would<00:03:29.669> get<00:03:29.819> really<00:03:30.180> thick<00:03:31.340> it'd<00:03:32.340> be<00:03:32.579> very

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
would get really thick it'd be very

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.229 
would get really thick it'd be very
chunky<00:03:33.269> chunky<00:03:33.659> monkey<00:03:34.909> i'm<00:03:35.909> not<00:03:36.060> going<00:03:36.209> to

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
this is the easiest thing in the world

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.250 
this is the easiest thing in the world
that<00:03:39.000> I've<00:03:39.180> ever<00:03:39.209> done<00:03:39.510> because<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:40.079> not

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
that I've ever done because it's not

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.369 
that I've ever done because it's not
it's<00:03:40.620> tough<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.459> learn<00:03:41.669> but<00:03:42.419> once<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.959> get<00:03:43.169> it

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
it's tough to learn but once you get it

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.890 
it's tough to learn but once you get it
it's<00:03:43.650> such<00:03:44.069> a<00:03:44.099> feeling<00:03:44.669> of<00:03:44.909> accomplishment<00:03:45.269> so
