now<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:08.099> have<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.340> take<00:00:08.519> all<00:00:08.730> your<00:00:09.000> action

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
now you have to take all your action

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.160 
now you have to take all your action
cards<00:00:09.540> each<00:00:09.690> team<00:00:09.929> has<00:00:10.110> three<00:00:10.639> and<00:00:11.639> these<00:00:11.849> are

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
cards each team has three and these are

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.770 
cards each team has three and these are
broken<00:00:13.170> down<00:00:13.530> into<00:00:13.820> support<00:00:14.820> which<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.480> mainly

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
broken down into support which is mainly

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.500 
broken down into support which is mainly
defensive<00:00:16.410> move<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.250> activate<00:00:17.730> which<00:00:18.270> is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
defensive move and activate which is

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.290 
defensive move and activate which is
mainly<00:00:18.869> movement<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.680> attack<00:00:20.550> which<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
mainly movement and attack which is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.779 
mainly movement and attack which is
obviously<00:00:21.750> offensive<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.490> have<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.699> look

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
obviously offensive so you have to look

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.290 
obviously offensive so you have to look
at<00:00:23.939> your<00:00:24.029> situation<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:25.490> each<00:00:26.490> team<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.119> take

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
at your situation and each team can take

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.759 
at your situation and each team can take
one<00:00:27.539> action<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.109> important<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.740> you

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
one action and it's important that you

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.980 
one action and it's important that you
decide<00:00:29.130> carefully<00:00:29.369> because<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.330> can't<00:00:30.660> take

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
decide carefully because you can't take

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.010 
decide carefully because you can't take
the<00:00:31.199> same<00:00:31.410> action<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.160> next<00:00:32.189> turn<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.809> with

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the same action the next turn so with

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.620 
the same action the next turn so with
grey<00:00:34.260> team<00:00:34.559> who<00:00:34.860> aren't<00:00:35.520> facing<00:00:35.730> any<00:00:36.030> foes<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
grey team who aren't facing any foes and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.540 
grey team who aren't facing any foes and
which<00:00:36.870> use<00:00:37.020> their<00:00:37.200> support<00:00:37.590> card<00:00:37.829> power<00:00:38.219> field

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
which use their support card power field

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.030 
which use their support card power field
this<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.300> useful<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.930> will<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.649> can

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
this is useful because it will it can

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.619 
this is useful because it will it can
also<00:00:41.160> prevent<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.820> gene<00:00:42.000> steal<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> team<00:00:42.510> from

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
also prevent a gene steal a team from

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.350 
also prevent a gene steal a team from
attacking<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.410> being<00:00:43.980> attacked<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.520> your<00:00:45.149> turn

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
attacking or being attacked on your turn

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.819 
attacking or being attacked on your turn
so<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.780> reused<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.260> 12<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> tricky<00:00:46.770> situation

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
so it's reused for 12 a tricky situation

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.660 
so it's reused for 12 a tricky situation
Lorenzo<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.010> fighting<00:00:50.610> nothing<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:52.469> de<00:00:53.460> know

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
Lorenzo is fighting nothing and de know

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.310 
Lorenzo is fighting nothing and de know
he<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.780> fighting<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.739> single<00:00:56.129> gene<00:00:56.309> stealer<00:00:57.320> so

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
he is fighting a single gene stealer so

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.869 
he is fighting a single gene stealer so
I<00:00:58.649> could<00:00:58.949> attack<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.520> would<00:00:59.609> only<00:00:59.640> mean

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
I could attack but that would only mean

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.400 
I could attack but that would only mean
one<00:01:00.030> person<00:01:00.300> will<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.480> attacking<00:01:00.930> instead<00:01:01.320> of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
one person will be attacking instead of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.770 
one person will be attacking instead of
with<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> move<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> activate<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.539> now<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
with a move and activate so now the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.690 
with a move and activate so now the
movement<00:01:04.350> side<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.830> isn't<00:01:05.369> massively

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
movement side of it isn't massively

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.420 
movement side of it isn't massively
useful<00:01:07.640> but<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.119> activate<00:01:09.659> side<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.380> let<00:01:11.189> de

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
useful but the activate side will let de

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.929 
useful but the activate side will let de
know<00:01:12.950> do<00:01:13.950> something<00:01:14.189> use<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> first<00:01:14.850> though

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
know do something use the first though

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.130 
know do something use the first though
we're<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.210> decide<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> cards<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.020> or

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
we're going to decide the cards with or

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.130 
we're going to decide the cards with or
without<00:01:16.470> result<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.750> flame<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:18.900> attack

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
without result them so flame your attack

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.359 
without result them so flame your attack
with<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> purple<00:01:19.740> team<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.220> can

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
with the purple team because they can

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.100 
with the purple team because they can
see<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.759> dream<00:01:20.970> states<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> rest<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
see to dream states and the rest of the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.440 
see to dream states and the rest of the
action<00:01:22.409> cards<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> side<00:01:23.610> because

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
action cards go to the side because

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.880 
action cards go to the side because
you're<00:01:24.720> not<00:01:24.810> using<00:01:24.990> them<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.259> turn<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.710> I

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you're not using them this turn and I

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.350 
you're not using them this turn and I
find<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.280> useful<00:01:26.640> Panther<00:01:26.939> sort<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:27.240> of

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
find that a useful Panther sort out of

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
find that a useful Panther sort out of
the<00:01:27.420> next<00:01:27.630> day<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.259> power<00:01:28.590> field<00:01:28.920> first<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:29.729> I

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the next day so power field first but I

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.260 
the next day so power field first but I
get<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.030> place<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.479> these<00:01:30.570> support<00:01:31.110> tokens

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
get to place one of these support tokens

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.850 
get to place one of these support tokens
these<00:01:33.270> support<00:01:33.630> tokens<00:01:33.990> reflects<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.680> any

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
these support tokens reflects on any

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.980 
these support tokens reflects on any
marine<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.400> they<00:01:36.119> basically<00:01:36.540> allow<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.869> a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
marine and they basically allow you a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.100 
marine and they basically allow you a
reroll<00:01:37.409> whether<00:01:37.829> you're<00:01:38.040> attacking<00:01:38.640> or<00:01:39.110> if

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
reroll whether you're attacking or if

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.100 
reroll whether you're attacking or if
you're<00:01:40.350> defending<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.060> very<00:01:42.299> useful<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you're defending so it's very useful to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
you're defending so it's very useful to
keep<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.470> kick<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.009> Marines<00:01:44.280> alive<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
keep your kick your Marines alive and to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.600 
keep your kick your Marines alive and to
kill<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:45.540> Jhene<00:01:45.720> steelers<00:01:46.079> how<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.680> marine

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
kill more Jhene steelers how the marine

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.889 
kill more Jhene steelers how the marine
can<00:01:47.729> only<00:01:47.850> use<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> sport<00:01:48.420> token<00:01:48.720> when

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
can only use a sport token when

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.840 
can only use a sport token when
defending<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.009> change<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> stacking<00:01:50.610> is

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
defending it I change the stacking is

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.429 
defending it I change the stacking is
front<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.810> let<00:01:51.899> something<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> bear<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.320> mind

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
front so let something to bear in mind

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.710 
front so let something to bear in mind
now<00:01:53.040> power<00:01:53.250> field<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.820> stop<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> genius<00:01:54.540> dealer

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
now power field can stop a genius dealer

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.709 
now power field can stop a genius dealer
swarm<00:01:54.960> from<00:01:55.079> attacking<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:57.240> also<00:01:57.390> stops

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
swarm from attacking but it also stops

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.209 
swarm from attacking but it also stops
me<00:01:57.840> attacking<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.380> now<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.680> only<00:01:58.740> two<00:01:58.979> genes

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
me attacking it now with only two genes

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
dealers I'm going to take the risk now

move an activate Lorenzo is going to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.199 
move an activate Lorenzo is going to
move<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.560> he<00:02:07.710> swaps<00:02:08.039> positions<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
move so he swaps positions with the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
Marine next to him Skippy oh this means

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.220 
Marine next to him Skippy oh this means
is<00:02:11.340> now<00:02:11.489> facing<00:02:11.760> down<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.060> corridor

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
is now facing down the corridor

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.160 
is now facing down the corridor
he's<00:02:13.560> going<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.890> turn<00:02:14.670> which<00:02:15.510> comes<00:02:15.750> after<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
he's going to turn which comes after the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.720 
he's going to turn which comes after the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.780 
I'm fat instead I'll lay in the way he's

this<00:02:39.239> means<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.629> once<00:02:39.930> you've<00:02:40.079> cleared<00:02:40.470> this

stays<00:03:38.549> there<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.269> just<00:03:39.389> useful<00:03:39.599> for

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
stays there so it's just useful for

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.690 
stays there so it's just useful for
another<00:03:40.019> day<00:03:40.169> and<00:03:41.930> that<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.319> end<00:03:43.349> of<00:03:43.799> the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
another day and that is the end of the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.280 
another day and that is the end of the
space<00:03:45.150> marines<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.569> those<00:03:45.690> plays<00:03:45.900> now<00:03:46.049> there's

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
space marines of those plays now there's

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.690 
space marines of those plays now there's
no<00:03:46.470> special<00:03:46.889> his<00:03:47.069> action<00:03:47.280> place<00:03:47.430> now<00:03:47.549> there's

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
no special his action place now there's

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.099 
no special his action place now there's
no<00:03:47.819> gene<00:03:48.060> Steelers<00:03:48.389> to<00:03:48.510> attack<00:03:48.810> because

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
no gene Steelers to attack because

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.629 
no gene Steelers to attack because
usually<00:03:49.260> after<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:49.769> now<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.459> remaining

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
usually after this now the remaining

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.759 
usually after this now the remaining
gene<00:03:50.940> stairs<00:03:51.150> would<00:03:51.299> attack<00:03:51.569> so<00:03:52.260> we<00:03:52.380> skip<00:03:52.650> that

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
gene stairs would attack so we skip that

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.509 
gene stairs would attack so we skip that
phase<00:03:53.010> when<00:03:53.190> we<00:03:53.250> go<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.549> event<00:03:53.730> phase<00:03:54.209> and

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
phase when we go to the event phase and

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.740 
phase when we go to the event phase and
now<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.579> draw<00:03:56.879> an<00:03:57.000> event<00:03:57.239> card<00:03:57.419> so<00:03:57.629> its

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
now you draw an event card so its

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.250 
now you draw an event card so its
flanking<00:03:58.230> maneuver<00:03:59.510> basically<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.900> will

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
flanking maneuver basically this will

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.339 
flanking maneuver basically this will
mean<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.790> gene<00:04:02.790> Steelers<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.930> tells<00:04:04.169> you

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
mean that gene Steelers it tells you

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.599 
mean that gene Steelers it tells you
something<00:04:04.650> about<00:04:04.709> what<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.129> geniuses<00:04:05.489> are

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
something about what the geniuses are

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:06.530 
something about what the geniuses are
going<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.790> have<00:04:05.879> to<00:04:05.970> do<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:06.209> in<00:04:06.299> this<00:04:06.389> case

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
going to have to do so in this case

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.509 
going to have to do so in this case
they'd<00:04:06.750> all<00:04:06.840> moved<00:04:07.079> behind<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.680> spice<00:04:08.280> rings

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
they'd all moved behind the spice rings

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.069 
they'd all moved behind the spice rings
but<00:04:08.700> they're<00:04:08.790> all<00:04:08.910> dead<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.449> that's<00:04:09.629> fine<00:04:09.870> and

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
but they're all dead so that's fine and

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.780 
but they're all dead so that's fine and
it<00:04:10.440> tells<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.709> how<00:04:10.949> many<00:04:11.160> gene<00:04:11.370> Steelers<00:04:11.669> are

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
it tells you how many gene Steelers are

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.729 
it tells you how many gene Steelers are
going<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.120> spawn<00:04:12.389> so<00:04:12.750> that's<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.989> minus<00:04:13.349> born<00:04:13.620> on

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
going to spawn so that's a minus born on

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.460 
going to spawn so that's a minus born on
red<00:04:13.949> and<00:04:14.239> a<00:04:15.239> minus<00:04:15.419> for<00:04:15.720> an<00:04:15.840> orange<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.320> that's

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
red and a minus for an orange so that's

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.810 
red and a minus for an orange so that's
one<00:04:16.680> gene<00:04:16.889> stealer<00:04:17.190> from<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.400> left<00:04:17.549> pile

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
one gene stealer from the left pile

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.539 
one gene stealer from the left pile
facing<00:04:18.690> amino<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.260> one<00:04:19.889> gene<00:04:20.099> stealer<00:04:20.400> from

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
facing amino and one gene stealer from

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.570 
facing amino and one gene stealer from
the<00:04:20.639> right<00:04:20.789> pile<00:04:21.150> on<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.419> ventilation<00:04:22.109> duct

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
the right pile on the ventilation duct

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.490 
the right pile on the ventilation duct
placing<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.700> librarian<00:04:24.180> now<00:04:25.140> there's<00:04:25.349> no

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
placing the librarian now there's no

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.930 
placing the librarian now there's no
movement<00:04:25.800> icon<00:04:26.340> usually<00:04:26.760> on

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
movement icon usually on

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.270 
movement icon usually on
like<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:28.230> one<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.410> drew<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.890> set<00:04:29.040> them<00:04:29.160> up

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
like the one I drew to set them up

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.370 
like the one I drew to set them up
there's<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:30.000> movement<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.600> this<00:04:30.960> tells<00:04:31.170> you

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
there's a movement and this tells you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.650 
there's a movement and this tells you
which<00:04:31.920> types<00:04:32.310> of<00:04:32.490> genius<00:04:32.760> dealers<00:04:33.030> are<00:04:33.450> going

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
which types of genius dealers are going

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.880 
which types of genius dealers are going
to<00:04:33.720> move<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.230> how<00:04:34.350> they're<00:04:34.530> going<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.710> move

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
to move and how they're going to move

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.200 
to move and how they're going to move
whether<00:04:35.160> it's<00:04:35.340> up<00:04:35.460> or<00:04:35.640> down<00:04:35.790> if<00:04:36.000> they're<00:04:36.120> going

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
whether it's up or down if they're going

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.230 
whether it's up or down if they're going
to<00:04:36.300> plant<00:04:36.510> their<00:04:36.630> targets<00:04:37.370> right<00:04:38.370> now<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.090> goes

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
to plant their targets right now it goes

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.800 
to plant their targets right now it goes
back<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.990> space<00:04:40.290> range<00:04:40.560> turn
