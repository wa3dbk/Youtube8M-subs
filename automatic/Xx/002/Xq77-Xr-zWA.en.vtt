as<00:01:03.949> you<00:01:04.250> can<00:01:04.430> see<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:05.030> carburetors<00:01:05.659> are<00:01:05.900> on

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
as you can see the carburetors are on

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.890 
as you can see the carburetors are on
the<00:01:07.010> on<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.760> right-hand<00:01:08.240> side

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
the on the right-hand side

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.890 
the on the right-hand side
the<00:01:09.409> pipes<00:01:09.680> are<00:01:09.950> on<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.220> left-hand<00:01:10.549> side<00:01:10.970> so

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
the pipes are on the left-hand side so

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.840

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
the cylinder heads had to be made

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.219 
the cylinder heads had to be made
special<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:15.110> give<00:01:15.710> us<00:01:15.860> that<00:01:16.070> configuration<00:01:17.229> it

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
special to give us that configuration it

and all this are his design this bike is
if<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.380> look<00:01:33.560> at<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.799> chassis<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.460> can<00:01:34.610> see

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
if you look at the chassis you can see

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.370 
if you look at the chassis you can see
that<00:01:35.000> it's<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.210> real<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.720> I've<00:01:35.869> got<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.050> pretty

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
that it's a real is I've got a pretty

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.320 
that it's a real is I've got a pretty
short<00:01:36.830> wheelbase<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:39.020> normal<00:01:40.060> spike<00:01:41.060> with

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
short wheelbase and a normal spike with

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.120 
short wheelbase and a normal spike with
this<00:01:41.479> kind<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.810> motor<00:01:42.080> this<00:01:42.380> much<00:01:42.619> horsepower

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
this kind of motor this much horsepower

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.620 
this kind of motor this much horsepower
and<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:43.729> kind<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.090> torque

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
and this kind of torque

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.870 
and this kind of torque
you'd<00:01:45.409> be<00:01:45.590> on<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.860> back<00:01:46.009> tire<00:01:46.280> all<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.670> time

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
you'd be on the back tire all the time

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.419 
you'd be on the back tire all the time
hard<00:01:47.360> right<00:01:47.690> in<00:01:47.720> wheely<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:48.920> pipe<00:01:49.159> doesn't

upper part of the frame and this because

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.729 
upper part of the frame and this because
it's<00:02:07.939> feeding<00:02:08.149> those<00:02:08.390> torque<00:02:08.690> loads<00:02:08.959> above

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
it's feeding those torque loads above

through a corner and you get on the gas
hard<00:02:16.010> or<00:02:16.250> if<00:02:16.340> you're<00:02:16.489> accelerating<00:02:16.820> away<00:02:17.269> from

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
hard or if you're accelerating away from

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.690 
hard or if you're accelerating away from
a<00:02:17.600> stoplight<00:02:18.079> hard<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.980> won't<00:02:19.190> pick<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.519> front

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
a stoplight hard it won't pick the front

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.340 
a stoplight hard it won't pick the front
end<00:02:19.940> up<00:02:20.090> it'll<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:20.690> keep<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.989> front<00:02:21.200> end

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
end up it'll just keep the front end

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.440 
end up it'll just keep the front end
down<00:02:21.530> which<00:02:21.829> means<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.400> handling<00:02:22.820> is<00:02:23.000> always

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
down which means the handling is always

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.470 
down which means the handling is always
consistent<00:02:23.930> this<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:25.489> bike<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:26.209> can't

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
consistent this is this bike you can't

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.210 
consistent this is this bike you can't
even<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.810> can't<00:02:26.840> even<00:02:27.140> describe<00:02:27.530> how<00:02:27.650> well<00:02:28.070> this

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
even I can't even describe how well this

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.340 
even I can't even describe how well this
bike<00:02:28.459> handles<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.480> can<00:02:29.690> flick<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:30.170> through

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
bike handles you can flick it through

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.060 
bike handles you can flick it through
the<00:02:30.440> turns

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
the turns

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.830 
the turns
it<00:02:31.310> feels<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:31.940> light<00:02:32.420> it's<00:02:32.989> really<00:02:33.410> nimble

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
it feels really light it's really nimble

the<00:02:39.469> handling<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.159> unbelievable<00:02:41.000> because<00:02:41.689> it

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
the handling is unbelievable because it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.709 
the handling is unbelievable because it
can<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:42.799> this<00:02:43.010> short<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.819> can<00:02:43.969> be<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.390> light

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
can be this short it can be this light

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.809 
can be this short it can be this light
and<00:02:45.049> it<00:02:45.530> still<00:02:45.799> doesn't<00:02:46.099> want<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.489> spend<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
anything quite like this the gas tank is

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.690 
anything quite like this the gas tank is
is<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:57.079> replica<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.650> what<00:02:57.950> Mert<00:02:58.159> had<00:02:58.400> on<00:02:58.549> his

is a replica of what Mert had on his

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.890 
is a replica of what Mert had on his
dirt<00:02:58.909> track<00:02:59.180> bikes<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:02.150> order<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.540> make<00:03:02.719> this

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
dirt track bikes in order to make this

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.080 
dirt track bikes in order to make this
work

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
work

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.140 
work
the<00:03:05.630> oil<00:03:06.500> tank<00:03:06.860> had<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.280> be<00:03:07.400> moved<00:03:07.760> normally

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
the oil tank had to be moved normally

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.180 
the oil tank had to be moved normally
the<00:03:08.270> oil<00:03:08.420> tank<00:03:08.750> goes<00:03:08.990> where<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.230> shock<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.860> and

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
the oil tank goes where the shock is and

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.550 
the oil tank goes where the shock is and
so<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.060> oil<00:03:11.270> tank<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:11.810> over<00:03:12.080> here

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
so the oil tank is over here

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.559 
so the oil tank is over here
the<00:03:12.890> oil<00:03:13.069> tank<00:03:13.340> look<00:03:13.580> is<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.819> number<00:03:14.150> plate<00:03:14.390> it

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
the oil tank look is a number plate it

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.210 
the oil tank look is a number plate it
also<00:03:14.720> doubles<00:03:15.020> as<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.319> number<00:03:15.650> plate<00:03:15.890> because

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
also doubles as a number plate because

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.309 
also doubles as a number plate because
we're<00:03:16.370> not<00:03:16.490> using<00:03:16.670> numbers<00:03:17.090> on<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.360> street<00:03:17.690> so

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
we're not using numbers on the street so

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.720 
we're not using numbers on the street so
it<00:03:18.440> holds<00:03:18.590> quite<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:18.890> bit<00:03:19.069> of<00:03:19.160> oil<00:03:19.370> it's<00:03:19.580> got<00:03:19.700> a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
it holds quite a bit of oil it's got a

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.960 
it holds quite a bit of oil it's got a
good<00:03:19.850> oil<00:03:19.970> capacity

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.590
