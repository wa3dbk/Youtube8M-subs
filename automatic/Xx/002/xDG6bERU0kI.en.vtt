00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello welcome 1000 best building 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.480
 I am here in the beautiful Eifel 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.700
 on the nordschleife weather plays today 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.510
 not quite so wet with still spots in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.389
 the green hell 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.049
 That's why we drive the universal tire 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:22.050
 the sportback in seven rr from the bachelor 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.930
 stay tuned here today as we do 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.880
 Early morning at the hotel from the window 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.570
 we have been watching so far powerful 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.820
 18 degrees about 15 to 18 degrees 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.469
 Of course, rain does not do the optimum 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.870
 conditions around here on the nordschleife 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.760
 to pass 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.469
 But naturally we have the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.960
 Tires from the full can 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.730
 is then half dried and on 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.320
 Of course these are the optimal ones 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.629
 Conditions for the sport in the 7th 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.390
 Proven has black material from the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.850
 home of metzeler proven because because 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.550
 butcher very strong focus at 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.190
 racing off road racing has that is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.149
 they drive like their cups and theirs 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.210
 e mails not public 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.610
 smooth-ironed raceways out but 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.680
 just on the isle of man and so on 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.960
 We are now at noon so I am very 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.880
 been on the road with 356 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.369
 nordschleife my first time up here 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.110
 the track is still wet one stains with 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.450
 and from the beginning it was 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.890
 trust here for this mature and that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.350
 is certainly the strength of the mature 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.860
 there is nowhere extreme but it always 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.689
 Nordschleife is extremely good 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.610
 a mix of a country road and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.259
 race track for the dis know those 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.340
 nothing new for that yet here 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.479
 were 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.609
 is the racing teams 23 miles long is 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.409
 already increase number that is for me 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.329
 as a beginner impossible to remember the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.329
 lines means I always have to 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.649
 correct lines again 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.750
 work fine with the mature 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.179
 also on the brake very willing that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.399
 Steering and what I like 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.500
 Liked the new here 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.420
 the not quite optimal asphalt 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.679
 the good own damping behavior that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.569
 Metzler has always been quite one 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.179
 great thing that the mature that 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.670
 Such a flexible cashier have that 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.700
 here on the race track at nÃ¼rburgring 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.290
 not quite big cinema can be no other 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.750
 tire that works so well that the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.269
 Precise stability always 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.099
 but it still guarantees that 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.019
 These bodies of asphalt are so great 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.819
 be ironed out and that anyway 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.129
 this this good connection 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.530
 fails and this feeling of trust 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.549
 be donated 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.019
 You can not imagine a chamberlain 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.170
 I'm with any other mature 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.459
 have been better on the road 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.410
 grip and traction I have to say 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.510
 Now say we are here now 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.680
 Cozy around the course we brought for 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.739
 me to all the other parameters 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.170
 I have already noticed slowly 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.530
 the tire comes on temperature then it is 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.639
 because even better curve exit 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.799
 traction example in order crib in 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.599
 order tomorrow then the route should 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.019
 can be really hot but then 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.829
 the time where you then the ristic rrk three 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.099
 raise 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.680
 but today he has proved the m7 of 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.049
 Metzeler that he still has the reference 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.299
 In rough everyday is when you are athletic 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.769
 drive wants to drive safely and not 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.910
 just ironed on accordingly 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.459
 asphalt is traveling but also in 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.239
 the rough reality out there in the 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.650
 ruthless world there he is in seven 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.209
 Sport is the most faithful companion and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.599
 the camera recommended the katz 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.599
