00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:12.759 
handheld GPS so to access it let's hit

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.490 
handheld GPS so to access it let's hit
the<00:00:12.880> menu<00:00:13.090> button<00:00:13.210> twice<00:00:13.690> and<00:00:15.869> let's<00:00:16.869> look<00:00:17.140> for

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
the menu button twice and let's look for

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.130 
the menu button twice and let's look for
wrote<00:00:17.920> planner<00:00:18.489> some<00:00:19.149> pushpins<00:00:19.660> right<00:00:19.930> there

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
wrote planner some pushpins right there

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.729 
wrote planner some pushpins right there
and<00:00:21.149> I<00:00:22.149> have<00:00:22.329> no<00:00:22.509> Road<00:00:22.720> so<00:00:22.989> let's<00:00:23.200> create<00:00:23.560> a

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:23.739 
and I have no Road so let's create a

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:29.030 
and I have no Road so let's create a
road<00:00:25.860> we<00:00:26.860> need<00:00:27.009> to<00:00:27.130> select<00:00:27.399> our<00:00:27.640> first<00:00:27.849> point

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
road we need to select our first point

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.690 
road we need to select our first point
we<00:00:30.040> could<00:00:30.220> use<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:30.550> map<00:00:30.869> recently<00:00:31.869> founds

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
we could use the map recently founds

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.850 
we could use the map recently founds
waypoints<00:00:33.700> or<00:00:33.850> City<00:00:34.210> so<00:00:34.600> let's<00:00:35.140> use<00:00:35.380> map<00:00:35.650> for

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
waypoints or City so let's use map for

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.210 
waypoints or City so let's use map for
the<00:00:35.920> first<00:00:36.100> point<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:38.380> we'll<00:00:38.680> use<00:00:38.920> the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
the first point so we'll use the

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.820 
the first point so we'll use the
joystick<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:40.030> select<00:00:40.630> the<00:00:40.750> point<00:00:41.020> at<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.590> top

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
joystick to select the point at the top

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.910 
joystick to select the point at the top
here<00:00:42.040> it's<00:00:42.160> going<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.310> tell<00:00:42.640> you<00:00:43.230> how<00:00:44.230> far<00:00:44.260> from

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
here it's going to tell you how far from

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.010 
here it's going to tell you how far from
your<00:00:45.100> current<00:00:45.220> location<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:46.420> point<00:00:46.840> is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
your current location that point is

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.380 
your current location that point is
right<00:00:47.230> now<00:00:47.380> it's<00:00:47.530> 131<00:00:48.370> meters<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.000> it's<00:00:49.150> due

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
right now it's 131 meters and it's due

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.530 
right now it's 131 meters and it's due
west<00:00:49.630> of<00:00:49.900> us<00:00:50.020> and<00:00:50.260> if<00:00:51.220> I<00:00:51.340> scroll<00:00:51.910> down<00:00:52.240> you'll

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
west of us and if I scroll down you'll

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.780 
west of us and if I scroll down you'll
see<00:00:52.600> it<00:00:52.750> goes<00:00:52.930> southwest<00:00:53.530> 212<00:00:54.310> meters<00:00:54.640> so

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
see it goes southwest 212 meters so

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.530 
see it goes southwest 212 meters so
let's<00:00:55.180> select<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.860> push<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.540> joystick

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
let's select that just push the joystick

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.150 
let's select that just push the joystick
in<00:00:58.960> as<00:00:59.170> an<00:00:59.350> enter<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.930> we<00:01:02.079> just<00:01:02.320> added<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.860> point

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
in as an enter and we just added a point

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.819 
in as an enter and we just added a point
to<00:01:03.430> our<00:01:03.790> route<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:04.689> when<00:01:05.199> we're<00:01:05.320> done<00:01:05.500> we<00:01:05.710> could

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
to our route so when we're done we could

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.000 
to our route so when we're done we could
just<00:01:05.979> hit<00:01:06.100> back<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:07.750> back<00:01:08.050> again<00:01:08.500> and<00:01:08.680> let's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
just hit back go back again and let's

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.800 
just hit back go back again and let's
select<00:01:09.220> another<00:01:09.610> point<00:01:09.880> we'll<00:01:10.060> select<00:01:10.300> from

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
select another point we'll select from

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.930 
select another point we'll select from
our<00:01:10.930> Waypoint<00:01:11.080> list<00:01:11.620> I<00:01:11.830> only<00:01:12.310> have<00:01:12.550> two<00:01:12.790> in

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
our Waypoint list I only have two in

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.380 
our Waypoint list I only have two in
here<00:01:13.120> we'll<00:01:13.420> select<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:14.140> test<00:01:14.409> if<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:16.240> is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
here we'll select the test if that is

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.980 
here we'll select the test if that is
good<00:01:16.600> we'll<00:01:16.780> select<00:01:17.080> use<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:19.240> now<00:01:19.420> we<00:01:19.479> have<00:01:19.659> two

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
good we'll select use so now we have two

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.460 
good we'll select use so now we have two
points<00:01:20.620> let's<00:01:21.549> select<00:01:21.850> another<00:01:22.030> one<00:01:22.470> this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
points let's select another one this

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.890 
points let's select another one this
time<00:01:23.530> let's<00:01:24.310> use<00:01:24.430> recently<00:01:25.150> fine<00:01:26.430> we'll<00:01:27.430> do

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
time let's use recently fine we'll do

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
time let's use recently fine we'll do
Vancouver

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
Vancouver

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.140 
Vancouver
we'll<00:01:30.700> use<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:31.299> that's<00:01:32.549> 679<00:01:33.549> kilometers

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
we'll use that that's 679 kilometers

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.649 
we'll use that that's 679 kilometers
west<00:01:34.420> of<00:01:34.630> us<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:36.369> we<00:01:36.700> could<00:01:36.880> keep<00:01:37.090> adding

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
west of us and we could keep adding

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.460 
west of us and we could keep adding
points<00:01:38.400> when<00:01:39.400> you're<00:01:39.549> done<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.869> hit<00:01:40.930> back

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
points when you're done just hit back

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.020 
points when you're done just hit back
and<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:43.270> we<00:01:44.020> can<00:01:44.260> edit<00:01:44.590> our<00:01:45.010> route<00:01:45.220> view<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:45.939> on

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
and now we can edit our route view it on

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.990 
and now we can edit our route view it on
the<00:01:46.060> map<00:01:46.330> reverse<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.409> so<00:01:47.619> go<00:01:48.010> in<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.580> opposite

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
the map reverse it so go in the opposite

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.359 
the map reverse it so go in the opposite
direction<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:50.320> could<00:01:50.500> change<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.920> name<00:01:50.950> of<00:01:51.100> it

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
direction we could change the name of it

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.510 
direction we could change the name of it
right<00:01:51.430> now<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.880> defaulted<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.810> route<00:01:53.229> 0<00:01:53.650> 0<00:01:53.950> 1<00:01:54.220> or

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
right now it defaulted to route 0 0 1 or

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.060 
right now it defaulted to route 0 0 1 or
we<00:01:55.000> could<00:01:55.180> delete<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.479> route<00:01:55.810> if<00:01:56.049> we<00:01:56.740> go<00:01:56.920> into

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
we could delete the route if we go into

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.710 
we could delete the route if we go into
edit<00:01:57.549> route<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:59.290> could<00:01:59.470> select<00:01:59.650> a<00:01:59.950> point<00:02:00.189> and

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
edit route we could select a point and

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.230 
edit route we could select a point and
we<00:02:01.720> can<00:02:01.900> move<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.259> down<00:02:02.830> move<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.430> up<00:02:03.580> we<00:02:04.060> could

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
we can move it down move it up we could

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.700 
we can move it down move it up we could
review<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.659> make<00:02:04.990> sure<00:02:05.020> it's<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.500> correct

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
review it make sure it's the correct

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.789 
review it make sure it's the correct
point<00:02:06.540> remove<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.659> completely<00:02:07.810> from<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.590> list

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
point remove it completely from the list

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.569 
point remove it completely from the list
or<00:02:09.099> insert<00:02:09.909> another<00:02:10.209> point<00:02:10.569> by<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.370> we'll

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
or insert another point by it so we'll

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.869 
or insert another point by it so we'll
just<00:02:12.790> say<00:02:12.969> move<00:02:13.450> up

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.789 

hit<00:02:18.879> back<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.930> could<00:02:23.079> view<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.349> route<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.739> the

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
hit back we could view the route on the

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.339 
hit back we could view the route on the
map<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:27.670> tries<00:02:27.909> to<00:02:27.939> show<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.360> whole<00:02:28.870> route

then<00:02:49.290> reverse<00:02:50.290> route<00:02:50.530> again<00:02:50.769> just<00:02:51.310> reverses

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
then reverse route again just reverses

the route changing the name is just like

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.210 
the route changing the name is just like
changing<00:02:55.359> a<00:02:55.480> waypoint<00:02:55.629> name<00:02:56.139> we<00:02:56.709> just<00:02:56.950> start

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
changing a waypoint name we just start

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.559 
changing a waypoint name we just start
typing<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.700> name<00:02:57.909> and<00:02:58.180> when<00:02:58.299> we're<00:02:58.450> done

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
typing in the name and when we're done

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.940 
typing in the name and when we're done
select<00:02:58.989> done<00:02:59.230> and<00:03:01.290> then<00:03:02.290> last<00:03:02.560> we<00:03:02.799> could

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
select done and then last we could

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.750 
select done and then last we could
delete<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.370> route<00:03:03.519> from<00:03:03.819> our<00:03:03.970> list<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:05.609> we<00:03:06.609> go

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
delete the route from our list if we go

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.170 
delete the route from our list if we go
back<00:03:09.629> and<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:12.010> go<00:03:12.190> into<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.760> road<00:03:12.909> planner

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
back and we go into the road planner

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.240 
back and we go into the road planner
again<00:03:13.359> you'll<00:03:13.810> see<00:03:14.049> we<00:03:14.260> have<00:03:14.290> create<00:03:14.799> row<00:03:15.010> and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
again you'll see we have create row and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.089 
again you'll see we have create row and
the<00:03:15.609> route<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.000> we<00:03:16.060> just<00:03:16.329> created<00:03:16.780> if<00:03:17.230> we<00:03:17.920> go

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
the route that we just created if we go

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.509 
the route that we just created if we go
into<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.430> route<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:18.730> start<00:03:19.000> navigating<00:03:19.660> it

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
into the route and start navigating it

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.699 
into the route and start navigating it
so<00:03:21.519> let's<00:03:21.669> do<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:22.150> we'll<00:03:22.389> go<00:03:22.510> view<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.109> we'll

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
so let's do that we'll go view and we'll

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.539 
so let's do that we'll go view and we'll
navigate<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.900> stop<00:03:26.199> your<00:03:26.410> route<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.889> actually
