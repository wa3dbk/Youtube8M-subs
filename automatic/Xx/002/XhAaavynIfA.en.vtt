00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.380 
interesting one I kind of see that
series<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.460> at<00:02:05.579> least<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> game<00:02:06.060> six

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
series going to at least the game six

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.570 
series going to at least the game six
maybe<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.840> game<00:02:07.079> seven<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.070> it's<00:02:08.250> hard<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.520> me

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
maybe a game seven but it's hard for me

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.540 
maybe a game seven but it's hard for me
to<00:02:08.700> pick<00:02:08.880> who<00:02:09.060> would<00:02:09.179> win<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:10.340> based<00:02:11.340> on

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
to pick who would win but based on

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.370 
to pick who would win but based on
everything<00:02:11.760> I've<00:02:12.060> seen<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.750> kind<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.230> go<00:02:13.350> with

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
everything I've seen I kind of go with

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.480 
everything I've seen I kind of go with
the<00:02:13.500> Spurs<00:02:13.830> because<00:02:14.040> they've<00:02:14.190> been<00:02:14.220> playing

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
the Spurs because they've been playing

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.580 
the Spurs because they've been playing
really<00:02:15.120> good<00:02:15.240> basketball<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
really good basketball and the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.110 
really good basketball and the
postseason<00:02:17.250> no<00:02:17.460> one's<00:02:17.640> been<00:02:17.760> playing<00:02:17.970> better

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
postseason no one's been playing better

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.930 
postseason no one's been playing better
than<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.420> heat

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
than the heat

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.030 
than the heat
leave<00:02:19.090> because<00:02:19.960> he'd<00:02:20.320> haven't<00:02:20.680> been<00:02:20.770> playing

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
leave because he'd haven't been playing

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.650 
leave because he'd haven't been playing
around<00:02:21.190> with<00:02:21.430> anyone<00:02:21.790> they've<00:02:22.150> been<00:02:22.180> takin

around with anyone they've been takin

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.830 
around with anyone they've been takin
care<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.840> business<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:24.100> know<00:02:24.220> getting<00:02:24.840> sweeps

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
care of business you know getting sweeps

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.800 
care of business you know getting sweeps
and<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.410> know<00:02:26.500> only<00:02:26.650> five<00:02:26.980> games<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.210> I<00:02:28.450> kind

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
and you know only five games so I kind

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.690 
and you know only five games so I kind
of<00:02:28.870> see<00:02:29.020> them<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.800> know<00:02:29.890> just<00:02:30.130> blowing<00:02:30.520> past

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
of see them you know just blowing past

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.730 
of see them you know just blowing past
the<00:02:30.850> Pacers<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.540> it's<00:02:32.230> going<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.410> be<00:02:32.530> good

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
the Pacers and it's going to be good

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.990 
the Pacers and it's going to be good
because<00:02:32.920> Pacers<00:02:33.340> have<00:02:33.460> home<00:02:33.670> court<00:02:33.700> advantage

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
because Pacers have home court advantage

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.480 
because Pacers have home court advantage
so<00:02:34.600> if<00:02:34.720> they<00:02:34.840> beat<00:02:35.050> them<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.070> see<00:02:36.220> but

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
so if they beat them you can see but

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.740 
so if they beat them you can see but
that's<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.760> my<00:02:36.910> opinion<00:02:36.940> let<00:02:37.420> me<00:02:37.480> know<00:02:37.600> you
