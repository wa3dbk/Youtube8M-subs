an old German design and what's great
about<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.910> boost<00:00:33.570> pedal<00:00:33.780> as

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
about it is that it is a boost pedal as

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.810 
about it is that it is a boost pedal as
well<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> fuzz<00:00:34.829> pedal<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.699> be<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
well as a fuzz pedal and it can be a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.979 
well as a fuzz pedal and it can be a
boost<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.420> fuzz<00:00:36.870> pedal<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:38.040> reality<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.989> my

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
boost and fuzz pedal the reality was my

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.200 
boost and fuzz pedal the reality was my
father<00:00:40.230> kind<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.559> saw<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.769> huge<00:00:41.129> gap<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:41.970> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
father kind of saw a huge gap in the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.899

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
that kept the base for the low end it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.290 
that kept the base for the low end it's
always<00:00:47.250> tough<00:00:47.430> when<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.699> hit<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> distortion

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200 
know that the volume and tone are always
in<00:00:55.469> line<00:00:55.649> kind<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.579> essence<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.059> your

today<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.239> will<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.420> playing<00:01:00.600> through<00:01:00.780> an<00:01:00.870> old

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
today we will be playing through an old

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.860 
today we will be playing through an old
flip-top<00:01:01.410> b15<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.120> source<00:01:03.359> tone<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.719> that

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
flip-top b15 and the source tone on that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.710 
flip-top b15 and the source tone on that
is<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.050> kind<00:01:04.289> of<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:08.240> I'm<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.539> real

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
is just kind of like I'm just a real

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.960 
is just kind of like I'm just a real
basic<00:01:09.929> standard<00:01:10.590> classic<00:01:11.009> sound<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.850> I'm

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
basic standard classic sound so I'm

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.419 
basic standard classic sound so I'm
gonna<00:01:12.090> start<00:01:12.500> here<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> boost<00:01:13.890> mode<00:01:14.160> and

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
gonna start here in the boost mode and

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:15.740 
gonna start here in the boost mode and
as<00:01:14.759> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.000> tell<00:01:15.149> it's<00:01:15.330> kind<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.539> going<00:01:15.690> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
as you can tell it's kind of going to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.999 
as you can tell it's kind of going to
just<00:01:15.899> bring<00:01:16.140> out<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.410> bottom<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.830> kind<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
just bring out the bottom and kind of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.380 
just bring out the bottom and kind of
make<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.220> glow<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.550> little<00:01:17.640> bit<00:01:17.910> more<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.300> this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
make it glow a little bit more so this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:33.420 
make it glow a little bit more so this
is<00:01:18.539> with<00:01:18.660> it<00:01:18.690> off<00:01:22.580> once<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.700> step<00:01:23.940> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.149> pedal

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.980 

so<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.490> can<00:01:34.670> tell<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:34.939> kind<00:01:35.119> of<00:01:35.210> this<00:01:35.810> whole

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
so you can tell it kind of this whole

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.140 
so you can tell it kind of this whole
circuit<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:36.409> kind<00:01:36.650> of<00:01:36.710> inductor<00:01:37.100> based<00:01:37.340> versus

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
circuit is kind of inductor based versus

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.270 
circuit is kind of inductor based versus
your<00:01:38.299> typical<00:01:38.540> kind<00:01:38.930> of<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.380> cap<00:01:39.590> bled<00:01:40.130> to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
your typical kind of just a cap bled to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.190 
your typical kind of just a cap bled to
ground<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.210> can<00:01:41.600> kind<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.900> see<00:01:42.049> how<00:01:42.170> it

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
ground so you can kind of see how it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.960 
ground so you can kind of see how it
just<00:01:42.440> kind<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.590> gives<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:43.009> much<00:01:43.280> more<00:01:43.310> warmer

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
just kind of gives it a much more warmer

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.760 
just kind of gives it a much more warmer
rounder<00:01:44.600> sound<00:01:44.869> which<00:01:45.049> is<00:01:45.140> kind<00:01:45.320> of<00:01:45.350> nice<00:01:50.770> so

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
rounder sound which is kind of nice so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.620 
rounder sound which is kind of nice so
that's<00:01:51.890> always<00:01:52.130> kind<00:01:52.399> of<00:01:52.430> cool<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.360> next

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
that's always kind of cool the next

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.480 
that's always kind of cool the next
feature<00:01:53.780> up<00:01:54.020> is<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.350> fuzz<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.070> what<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.250> like

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
feature up is the fuzz and what I like

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.039 
feature up is the fuzz and what I like
about<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.880> more<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:56.090> than<00:01:56.420> any<00:01:56.509> other<00:01:56.570> pedal<00:01:56.960> is

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
about it more so than any other pedal is

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.050 
about it more so than any other pedal is
that<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.320> actually<00:01:57.470> keeps<00:01:57.830> my<00:01:58.130> low-end<00:01:58.549> on<00:01:58.850> my

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
that it actually keeps my low-end on my

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
that it actually keeps my low-end on my
bass<00:01:59.240> so<00:01:59.899> when<00:02:00.110> I'm<00:02:00.200> rocking

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.990 

and<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.769> third<00:02:14.950> feature<00:02:15.159> is<00:02:15.519> when<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.790> do<00:02:15.879> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
and the third feature is when you do the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.430 
and the third feature is when you do the
boost<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.659> fuzz<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.110> you're<00:02:17.230> kind<00:02:17.409> of

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
boost and the fuzz and you're kind of

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.960 
boost and the fuzz and you're kind of
using<00:02:17.769> both<00:02:17.950> together<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:18.610> kind<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.819> gives

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
using both together and it kind of gives

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:32.580 
using both together and it kind of gives
it<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.120> slightly<00:02:19.450> different<00:02:20.040> kind<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.069> EQ<00:02:21.370> curve

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.539 

this<00:02:33.590> pedal<00:02:33.890> has<00:02:33.920> actually<00:02:34.280> become<00:02:34.519> very

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
this pedal has actually become very

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.069 
this pedal has actually become very
popular<00:02:35.239> with<00:02:35.359> a<00:02:35.390> lot<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.689> session<00:02:36.049> musicians

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.440 
popular with a lot of session musicians
due<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.920> fact<00:02:37.159> that<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.459> majority<00:02:38.180> of<00:02:38.329> them

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
due to the fact that a majority of them

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.179 
due to the fact that a majority of them
like<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:38.719> go<00:02:38.810> just<00:02:38.959> direct<00:02:39.409> in<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.980> they<00:02:40.040> don't

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
like to go just direct in and they don't

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.949 
like to go just direct in and they don't
necessarily<00:02:40.250> rely<00:02:40.790> on<00:02:40.819> an<00:02:40.969> amp<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.329> so<00:02:41.719> what's

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
necessarily rely on an amp and so what's

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.270 
necessarily rely on an amp and so what's
great<00:02:42.109> about<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.620> is<00:02:42.680> you're<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.189> know

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
great about this is you're you know

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.559 
great about this is you're you know
you're<00:02:43.459> no<00:02:43.549> longer<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:43.879> relying<00:02:44.299> on<00:02:44.450> the

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
you're no longer just relying on the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.470 
you're no longer just relying on the
tone<00:02:44.780> pop<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.739> your<00:02:45.980> bass<00:02:46.250> or<00:02:46.640> at<00:02:46.760> least<00:02:46.939> this

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
tone pop of your bass or at least this

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.599 
tone pop of your bass or at least this
old<00:02:47.689> bass<00:02:47.870> with<00:02:48.049> a<00:02:48.079> scratchy<00:02:48.500> tone<00:02:48.680> pot<00:02:48.889> with

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
old bass with a scratchy tone pot with

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:50.979 
old bass with a scratchy tone pot with
this<00:02:49.849> you<00:02:50.000> kind<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.239> have<00:02:50.299> almost<00:02:50.599> of<00:02:50.689> a<00:02:50.780> tone

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
this you kind of have almost of a tone

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.199 
this you kind of have almost of a tone
blend<00:02:51.319> so<00:02:51.950> by<00:02:52.189> going<00:02:52.489> direct<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:52.909> you're<00:02:53.060> kind

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
blend so by going direct in you're kind

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.670 
blend so by going direct in you're kind
of<00:02:53.239> eliminating<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> whole<00:02:54.019> use<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.290> having

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
of eliminating the whole use of having

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.319 
of eliminating the whole use of having
to<00:02:54.769> use<00:02:54.799> an<00:02:55.159> old<00:02:55.250> amp<00:02:55.459> which<00:02:55.909> is<00:02:56.030> always<00:02:56.209> kind

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
to use an old amp which is always kind

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.759 
to use an old amp which is always kind
of<00:02:56.450> cool<00:02:56.629> so<00:02:57.170> here<00:02:57.319> I<00:02:57.349> can<00:02:57.439> give<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.650> some

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
of cool so here I can give you some

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.970 
of cool so here I can give you some
demonstrations<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.609> would<00:02:58.819> be<00:02:59.000> with<00:02:59.689> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
demonstrations this would be with the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.869 
demonstrations this would be with the
everything<00:03:00.980> wide<00:03:01.280> open<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:07.400> by<00:03:07.549> using<00:03:07.700> the

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
everything wide open just by using the

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:21.069 
everything wide open just by using the
tone<00:03:08.030> pot<00:03:08.239> on<00:03:08.329> this<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:11.409> get<00:03:12.409> much<00:03:12.620> more<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:21.049> a

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
tone pot on this I get much more so a

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.509 
tone pot on this I get much more so a
lot<00:03:21.379> of<00:03:21.409> the<00:03:21.530> subtleties<00:03:21.919> really<00:03:22.250> come<00:03:22.400> across

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
lot of the subtleties really come across

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.159 
lot of the subtleties really come across
exceptionally<00:03:23.239> well<00:03:23.389> especially<00:03:23.750> when<00:03:24.079> in

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
exceptionally well especially when in

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.300 
exceptionally well especially when in
the<00:03:24.260> studio<00:03:24.500> environment<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:25.069> can<00:03:25.219> hear

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
the studio environment you can hear

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.949 
the studio environment you can hear
everything<00:03:25.489> nice<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:25.909> isolated<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.540> it

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
everything nice and isolated and it

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.050 
everything nice and isolated and it
works<00:03:27.139> well<00:03:27.319> another<00:03:28.280> big<00:03:28.489> feature<00:03:28.669> is<00:03:28.909> that

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
works well another big feature is that

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.819 
works well another big feature is that
especially<00:03:29.239> when<00:03:29.569> going<00:03:29.810> di<00:03:30.079> when<00:03:30.439> you<00:03:30.560> put<00:03:30.739> it

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
especially when going di when you put it

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.649 
especially when going di when you put it
in<00:03:30.919> the<00:03:31.040> boost<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.609> fuzz<00:03:31.879> mode<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.299> can<00:03:32.450> kind

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
in the boost and fuzz mode you can kind

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.569 
in the boost and fuzz mode you can kind
of<00:03:32.719> vary<00:03:33.019> by<00:03:33.650> using<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:34.040> know<00:03:34.159> a<00:03:34.189> lot<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:34.459> the

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
of vary by using you know a lot of the

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.309 
of vary by using you know a lot of the
boost<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.299> little<00:03:35.480> bit<00:03:35.599> of<00:03:35.719> fuzz<00:03:35.900> something

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
boost and a little bit of fuzz something

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.839 
boost and a little bit of fuzz something
kind<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.500> would<00:03:36.620> be<00:03:36.709> more<00:03:36.889> like<00:03:37.099> this<00:03:37.370> let<00:03:37.760> me

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
kind of would be more like this let me

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.559 
kind of would be more like this let me
show<00:03:38.060> you<00:03:38.120> this<00:03:38.720> would<00:03:38.870> be<00:03:38.930> kind<00:03:39.169> of<00:03:39.199> a<00:03:39.319> subtle

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
show you this would be kind of a subtle

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:48.130 
show you this would be kind of a subtle
just<00:03:41.569> kind<00:03:41.780> of

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.630 

or<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.500> can<00:03:49.590> go<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.860> complete<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.580> total

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
or you can go to a complete and total

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.920 
or you can go to a complete and total
opposite<00:03:51.209> way<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.510> can<00:03:51.630> use<00:03:51.720> just<00:03:51.810> a

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
opposite way and you can use just a

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.600 
opposite way and you can use just a
little<00:03:51.959> bit<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.290> boost<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:53.099> kind<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.310> really

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
little bit of boost and kind of really

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.949 
little bit of boost and kind of really
lay<00:03:53.819> into<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.120> fuzz<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.599> get<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.750> much

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
lay into the fuzz and you get a much

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.390 
lay into the fuzz and you get a much
more

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.680 

the<00:04:01.400> bass<00:04:01.580> bullies<00:04:01.909> become<00:04:02.150> very<00:04:02.480> popular

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
the bass bullies become very popular

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.420 
the bass bullies become very popular
with<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:03.140> lot<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.500> new<00:04:03.620> metal<00:04:03.920> bands<00:04:04.220> for

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
with a lot of the new metal bands for

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.830 
with a lot of the new metal bands for
just<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:04.790> know<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:05.030> fact<00:04:05.269> that<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.540> can<00:04:05.690> kind

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
just you know the fact that you can kind

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.270 
just you know the fact that you can kind
of<00:04:05.900> run<00:04:06.080> everything<00:04:06.260> wide-open<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.069> still

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
of run everything wide-open and it still

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.789 
of run everything wide-open and it still
keeps<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.670> old<00:04:07.849> bass<00:04:08.269> tone<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:09.049> retains<00:04:09.680> all

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
keeps the old bass tone and retains all

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.500 
keeps the old bass tone and retains all
the<00:04:09.860> tightness<00:04:10.250> but<00:04:10.430> just<00:04:10.700> as<00:04:10.819> pretty<00:04:11.030> bananas

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
the tightness but just as pretty bananas

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.059 
the tightness but just as pretty bananas
and<00:04:11.690> that's<00:04:12.170> how<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.319> like<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.680> run<00:04:12.799> it<00:04:12.890> a<00:04:12.920> lot

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
and that's how I like to run it a lot

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:33.620 
and that's how I like to run it a lot
myself<00:04:13.519> so<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:13.879> see

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.930 

my<00:04:34.560> favorite<00:04:34.920> feature<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.340> base<00:04:35.550> bully<00:04:35.850> is

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
my favorite feature of the base bully is

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.190 
my favorite feature of the base bully is
the<00:04:36.060> fact<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.420> it<00:04:36.510> really<00:04:36.630> does<00:04:36.900> keep<00:04:37.140> the

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
the fact that it really does keep the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.200 
the fact that it really does keep the
low-end<00:04:37.650> tight<00:04:37.920> and<00:04:38.130> solid<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.880> know<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.000> lot

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
low-end tight and solid you know a lot

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.430 
low-end tight and solid you know a lot
of<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.360> distortion<00:04:39.660> pedals<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.080> I've<00:04:40.230> used

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
of the distortion pedals that I've used

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.440 
of the distortion pedals that I've used
in<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.590> past<00:04:40.620> might<00:04:41.490> just<00:04:42.090> because<00:04:42.300> it's

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
in the past might just because it's

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.670 
in the past might just because it's
distortion<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.020> kind<00:04:43.170> of<00:04:43.200> puts<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.500> in<00:04:43.590> the

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
distortion it kind of puts it in the

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.020 
distortion it kind of puts it in the
guitar<00:04:43.950> range<00:04:44.190> so<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.550> becomes<00:04:44.880> like<00:04:45.000> a

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
guitar range so it becomes like a

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.120 
guitar range so it becomes like a
mid-range<00:04:45.450> kind<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:45.870> mud<00:04:46.170> ball<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.710> don't

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
mid-range kind of mud ball I don't

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.500 
mid-range kind of mud ball I don't
really<00:04:47.400> like<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.790> what's<00:04:47.970> great<00:04:48.180> about<00:04:48.210> this

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
really like it what's great about this

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.450 
really like it what's great about this
is<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.780> does<00:04:48.990> keep<00:04:49.230> its<00:04:49.440> full<00:04:49.830> low-end<00:04:50.220> and

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
is it does keep its full low-end and

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.000 
is it does keep its full low-end and
that's<00:04:50.610> great<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:52.260> three<00:04:52.440> features<00:04:52.650> that<00:04:52.830> are

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
that's great the three features that are

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.890 
that's great the three features that are
real<00:04:53.130> popular<00:04:53.550> with<00:04:53.670> this<00:04:53.850> is<00:04:54.030> just<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.720> boost

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
real popular with this is just the boost

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.300 
real popular with this is just the boost
feature<00:04:55.110> which<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:55.770> allows<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.100> take

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
feature which just allows you to take

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.710 
feature which just allows you to take
your<00:04:56.430> clean<00:04:56.670> signal<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.120> kind<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.300> boost<00:04:57.570> it

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
your clean signal and kind of boost it

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.600 
your clean signal and kind of boost it
up<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:58.260> kind<00:04:58.470> of<00:04:58.530> brings<00:04:58.770> out<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:58.950> real<00:04:59.250> rich

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
up it kind of brings out a real rich

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.730 
up it kind of brings out a real rich
kind<00:05:00.360> of<00:05:00.420> warm<00:05:00.750> enhancement<00:05:01.410> on<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.590> low-end

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
kind of warm enhancement on the low-end

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.170 
kind of warm enhancement on the low-end
which<00:05:02.070> is<00:05:02.190> always<00:05:02.340> real<00:05:02.550> nice<00:05:02.700> almost<00:05:02.970> kind<00:05:03.150> of

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
which is always real nice almost kind of

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.610 
which is always real nice almost kind of
like<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.330> reggae<00:05:03.660> type<00:05:03.930> approach<00:05:04.230> which<00:05:04.470> is

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
like a reggae type approach which is

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.830 
like a reggae type approach which is
good<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.940> second<00:05:06.270> feature<00:05:06.390> that's<00:05:06.660> very

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
good the second feature that's very

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.690 
good the second feature that's very
popular<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.290> to<00:05:07.410> fuzz<00:05:07.680> obviously<00:05:08.370> because

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
popular is to fuzz obviously because

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.520 
popular is to fuzz obviously because
that's<00:05:08.880> primarily<00:05:09.600> I<00:05:09.720> think<00:05:09.960> why<00:05:10.050> players<00:05:10.290> go

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
that's primarily I think why players go

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.500 
that's primarily I think why players go
form<00:05:10.830> just<00:05:11.070> because<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:11.460> keeps<00:05:11.640> its<00:05:11.940> original

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
form just because it keeps its original

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.690 
form just because it keeps its original
richness<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.140> thickness<00:05:13.620> for<00:05:14.160> bass<00:05:14.340> which<00:05:14.550> is

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
richness and thickness for bass which is

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.040 
richness and thickness for bass which is
hard<00:05:14.880> to<00:05:14.970> do<00:05:15.090> with<00:05:15.240> distortion<00:05:15.720> because<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.930> lot

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
hard to do with distortion because a lot

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.310 
hard to do with distortion because a lot
of<00:05:16.140> times<00:05:16.290> it<00:05:16.440> just<00:05:16.470> becomes<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.950> hot<00:05:17.160> mess<00:05:18.320> the

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
of times it just becomes a hot mess the

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.840 
of times it just becomes a hot mess the
third<00:05:19.530> feature<00:05:19.740> that's<00:05:20.040> real<00:05:20.160> popular<00:05:20.610> is<00:05:20.730> to

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
third feature that's real popular is to

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.850 
third feature that's real popular is to
boost<00:05:21.060> and<00:05:21.300> fuzz<00:05:21.660> because<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.200> can<00:05:22.350> drive<00:05:22.590> the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
boost and fuzz because you can drive the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.740 
boost and fuzz because you can drive the
boost<00:05:23.070> into<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.520> fuzz<00:05:23.730> and<00:05:24.060> you<00:05:24.420> can<00:05:24.570> kind<00:05:24.720> of

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
boost into the fuzz and you can kind of

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.540 
boost into the fuzz and you can kind of
control<00:05:25.020> varying<00:05:25.470> amounts<00:05:25.860> so<00:05:26.040> it's<00:05:26.250> pretty

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
control varying amounts so it's pretty

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.800 
control varying amounts so it's pretty
good<00:05:26.670> especially<00:05:27.180> when<00:05:27.420> you<00:05:27.510> just<00:05:27.570> want<00:05:27.780> to
