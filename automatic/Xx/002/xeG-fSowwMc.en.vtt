doing pulmonary or cardiac which would

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.920 
doing pulmonary or cardiac which would
determine<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.369> kind<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.269> stethoscope<00:00:27.720> that

you're going to get so a couple of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.049 
you're going to get so a couple of
things<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:31.500> there's<00:00:32.009> different<00:00:32.430> components

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
things one there's different components

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.030 
things one there's different components
of<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> stethoscope<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:34.320> affect<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> way

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
of the stethoscope that affect the way

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.959 
of the stethoscope that affect the way
that<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.340> works<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:38.070> diaphragm<00:00:38.489> of

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
that it works there is the diaphragm of

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.450 
that it works there is the diaphragm of
the<00:00:39.149> stethoscope<00:00:39.719> which<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.530> gonna<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the stethoscope which is gonna go on the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.180 
the stethoscope which is gonna go on the
chest<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.090> chest<00:00:42.420> piece<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
chest it's a chest piece and this is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.100 
chest it's a chest piece and this is
going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> show<00:00:44.820> higher<00:00:45.270> you're<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.020> be

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
going to show higher you're going to be

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.779 
going to show higher you're going to be
able<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.289> hear<00:00:46.500> high-pitched<00:00:46.800> noises<00:00:47.370> from

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
able to hear high-pitched noises from

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.260 
able to hear high-pitched noises from
this<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.539> high-pitched<00:00:48.960> noises<00:00:49.230> would<00:00:49.620> be

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
this so high-pitched noises would be

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.729 
this so high-pitched noises would be
pulmonary<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.809> would<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:51.930> breath<00:00:52.230> sounds

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
pulmonary there would be breath sounds

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.950 
pulmonary there would be breath sounds
and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> other<00:00:53.699> side<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.449> called<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and then the other side is called the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.959 
and then the other side is called the
Bell<00:00:55.289> or<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> open<00:00:56.070> Bell<00:00:56.250> which<00:00:57.680> is<00:00:58.820> going<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
Bell or the open Bell which is going to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.110 
Bell or the open Bell which is going to
you're<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> hear<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> low<00:01:01.170> pitched

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
you're going to hear the low pitched

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.609 
you're going to hear the low pitched
noises<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.600> you're<00:01:04.019> gonna<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.409> with

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
noises so you're gonna do that with

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.620 
noises so you're gonna do that with
cardiac<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> lot<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.909> times<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.330> you're<00:01:06.450> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
cardiac so a lot of times if you're in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.100 
cardiac so a lot of times if you're in
the<00:01:06.720> ICU<00:01:06.869> or<00:01:07.560> you're<00:01:08.070> doing<00:01:08.310> general<00:01:09.110> medical

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the ICU or you're doing general medical

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.770 
the ICU or you're doing general medical
surgical<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:11.270> intermediate<00:01:12.270> care<00:01:12.479> you're

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
surgical or intermediate care you're

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.870 
surgical or intermediate care you're
probably<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> want<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.710> diaphragm<00:01:14.640> as

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
probably going to want a diaphragm as

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
probably going to want a diaphragm as
well<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.420> an<00:01:15.540> open<00:01:15.720> Bell<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.710> can

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
well as an open Bell so that you can

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.359 
well as an open Bell so that you can
best<00:01:17.759> auscultate<00:01:18.659> both<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.740> lungs<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.310> well

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
best auscultate both the lungs as well

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.120 
best auscultate both the lungs as well
as<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.939> heart<00:01:21.590> another<00:01:22.590> thing<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> consider

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
as the heart another thing to consider

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.520 
as the heart another thing to consider
is<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.850> two<00:01:24.030> different<00:01:24.180> kinds<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.960> set<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
is I have two different kinds of set the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.100 
is I have two different kinds of set the
Scopes<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.479> cheaper

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
Scopes here this one is a cheaper

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.770 
Scopes here this one is a cheaper
version<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.880> use<00:01:30.060> these<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.360> lot<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.689> times

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
version so we use these a lot of times

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.109 
version so we use these a lot of times
in<00:01:31.259> isolation<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.909> thrown

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
in isolation because they can be thrown

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.420 
in isolation because they can be thrown
away<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.470> think<00:01:34.680> how<00:01:34.920> much<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.340> I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
away so you want to think how much can I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
away so you want to think how much can I
spend<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.150> want<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> higher<00:01:36.630> quality<00:01:37.200> which

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
spend do I want a higher quality which

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.109 
spend do I want a higher quality which
is<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> use<00:01:37.770> steel<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.610> aluminum

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
is going to use steel and aluminum

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.090 
is going to use steel and aluminum
versus<00:01:39.930> plastic<00:01:42.079> plastic<00:01:43.079> parts<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.710> that

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
versus plastic plastic parts that that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.649 
versus plastic plastic parts that that
aren't<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.549> hold<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:44.909> over<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> long

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
aren't going to hold up over a long

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.660 
aren't going to hold up over a long
period<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> time<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.920> actually<00:01:47.399> can't

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
period of time and you actually can't

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.910 
period of time and you actually can't
hear<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.180> well<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:48.899> as<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.409> with

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
hear as well with these as you can with

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.550 
hear as well with these as you can with
the<00:01:50.220> better<00:01:50.460> quality<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.840> those<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.290> some<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the better quality so those are some of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.380 
the better quality so those are some of
the<00:01:52.590> things<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.159> want<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.399> consider<00:01:53.549> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
hearing and in choosing a stethoscope

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.350 
hearing and in choosing a stethoscope
you<00:01:58.469> want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> figure<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.549> what<00:01:59.850> size<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.299> you

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you want to figure out what size do you

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760 
you want to figure out what size do you
need<00:02:00.509> you're<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> smaller<00:02:01.500> size

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
need you're going to get a smaller size

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.789 
need you're going to get a smaller size
if<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:02.729> pediatric<00:02:03.540> patients<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:04.200> larger

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
if it's for pediatric patients a larger

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249 
if it's for pediatric patients a larger
size<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.490> adult<00:02:05.880> patients<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.600> how<00:02:07.079> much

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
size for adult patients and how much

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.320 
size for adult patients and how much
money<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.160> spend<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.940> get<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> higher

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
money can you spend can you get a higher

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330 
money can you spend can you get a higher
quality<00:02:09.569> which<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.050> using<00:02:10.530> better<00:02:10.739> materials

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
quality which is using better materials

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.430 
quality which is using better materials
is<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> last<00:02:12.000> longer<00:02:12.720> overpay

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
is going to last longer overpay

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.710 
is going to last longer overpay
at<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.560> time<00:02:13.830> as<00:02:14.040> well<00:02:14.580> as<00:02:14.760> giving<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> more

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
at a time as well as giving you a more

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.800 
at a time as well as giving you a more
clear<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.470> better<00:02:17.150> sound<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.630> your

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
clear and better sound that your

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.680 
clear and better sound that your
auscultate<00:02:19.460> so<00:02:20.460> those<00:02:20.610> are<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:20.820> some<00:02:21.060> some

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
auscultate so those are just some some

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.350 
auscultate so those are just some some
things<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.110> think<00:02:22.290> about
