00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.980
 hello welcome to the new video review in that opportunity I'm going to 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.320
 talk about the book 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.389
 dark of laurentiis 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.609
 what most caught my attention in this book 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.980
 on your cover look how pretty 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.650
 his letter with relief 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.449
 and a beautiful phrase 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.829
 the back 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.829
 predestined to be condemned to get lost 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.039
 clear love book 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.730
 I imagined that it makes the biggest bigger story ever told of 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.170
 love between did not know who anywhere in the book 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.620
 back cover 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.260
 the leg inside speaks of the characters 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.290
 you just have to start reading read happy to start learning about 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.300
 all 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.880
 good percent 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.130
 the book at first a little slow 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.410
 the same thing I delayed 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.220
 more than half absolutely nothing happened simply 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.370
 presentation of characters 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.370
 the book is about a girl 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.250
 what chose a light spahic reformatory 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.390
 i 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.980
 in the face of the problems you found when you read the book 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.120
 know your friends 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.280
 falls in love with two of the companions 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.080
 obviously one falls in love more than the other but two are daniel chopped 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 that hide a big one is believed 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.910
 as it passed from there the one 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.010
 no no no he did not know anything 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.770
 bush jr trains but approximately half on 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.110
 the action starts we do not start to find out many things 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.680
 p the love story starts to flow 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.760
 the thief fights mystery the secrets and really I sit in the book and over 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.020
 that it would be one of my favorites from the middle to the front I really liked it 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.270
 a lot and there that to him or not because in this book 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 by the way one leaves him with many doubts and 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.470
 therefore we must wait for the second part that he comes now in November 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.650
 to be able to find out 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.650
 that is still happening with our protagonist 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.179
 and with him 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.919
 boy that the pama that I'm not going to tell you but you discover it when 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.049
 read the book 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.509
 a track 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.379
 it has to do with tangibles 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.069
 in we operate 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.329
