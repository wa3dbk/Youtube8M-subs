should know how to connect the battery
and<00:00:07.350> everything<00:00:07.799> so<00:00:08.580> now<00:00:09.150> your<00:00:09.540> battery

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
and everything so now your battery

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.789 
and everything so now your battery
should<00:00:10.080> be<00:00:10.230> connect<00:00:10.559> our<00:00:10.740> fully<00:00:11.340> charged<00:00:11.820> and

should be connect our fully charged and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.740 
should be connect our fully charged and
once<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.009> simply<00:00:14.880> slide<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> tray

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
once it is simply slide it in the tray

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.710 
once it is simply slide it in the tray
and<00:00:15.960> connect<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> helicopter<00:00:17.660> now<00:00:18.660> you

and connect it to the helicopter now you

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.840 
and connect it to the helicopter now you
should<00:00:19.020> have<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.260> red<00:00:19.410> LED<00:00:19.830> light<00:00:20.310> flashing

should have the red LED light flashing

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.550 
should have the red LED light flashing
in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> back<00:00:21.180> if<00:00:21.449> not<00:00:21.750> something<00:00:22.140> isn't

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
in the back if not something isn't

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.870 
in the back if not something isn't
connected<00:00:22.949> right<00:00:23.130> or<00:00:23.310> your<00:00:23.460> pottery<00:00:23.760> is

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
connected right or your pottery is

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.620 
connected right or your pottery is
possibly<00:00:24.269> dead<00:00:25.369> now<00:00:26.369> since<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.359> that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
possibly dead now since you have that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.019 
possibly dead now since you have that
connected<00:00:28.170> basically<00:00:29.039> go<00:00:29.279> through<00:00:29.310> how<00:00:30.000> you

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
connected basically go through how you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.089 
connected basically go through how you
use<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> controller<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.260> get<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> most<00:00:31.859> use

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
use a controller and get the most use

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.180 
use a controller and get the most use
out<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:33.200> first<00:00:34.200> off<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.649> should<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:34.980> all

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
out of it first off you should have all

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.360 
out of it first off you should have all
your<00:00:35.370> trims<00:00:35.730> centered<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> controller<00:00:37.370> so

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
your trims centered on the controller so

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.600 
your trims centered on the controller so
mine<00:00:39.329> arts<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:39.960> they<00:00:40.770> are<00:00:40.800> kind<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.460> off

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
mine arts really they are kind of off

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.400 
mine arts really they are kind of off
the<00:00:41.640> center<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> bit<00:00:42.450> each<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.110> them<00:00:43.260> just

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the center a bit each of them just

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.959 
the center a bit each of them just
because<00:00:43.590> I've<00:00:43.920> already<00:00:44.129> trimmed<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.700> so

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
because I've already trimmed them so

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.880 
because I've already trimmed them so
there's<00:00:45.719> no<00:00:45.899> need<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.140> me<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.440> put<00:00:46.649> them<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
there's no need for me to put them to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.459 
there's no need for me to put them to
Center<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.219> then<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.640> trim<00:00:47.850> them<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.469> your

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
Center and then just trim them get your

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.139 
Center and then just trim them get your
throttle<00:00:50.129> chairman's<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.640> should<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.030> on

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
throttle chairman's you should see on

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.090 
throttle chairman's you should see on
mine<00:00:51.390> should<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:51.960> all<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> bottom

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
mine should be all the way to the bottom

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.090 
mine should be all the way to the bottom
no<00:00:53.399> matter<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.050> halfway<00:00:55.289> up<00:00:55.680> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
no matter what as if it's halfway up it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.709 
no matter what as if it's halfway up it
will<00:00:56.340> start<00:00:56.760> flying<00:00:57.090> once<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.420> turn<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
will start flying once you turn the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.569 
will start flying once you turn the
controller<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.379> because<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> will<00:00:59.280> think<00:00:59.460> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
controller on because it will think you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.490 
controller on because it will think you
want<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> trim<00:01:00.059> higher<00:01:00.300> than<00:01:00.629> idle<00:01:01.050> type

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
want the trim higher than idle type

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.889 
want the trim higher than idle type
thing<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.920> once<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.120> all<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.449> set<00:01:03.750> up

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
thing so once you have all that set up

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.590 
thing so once you have all that set up
it's<00:01:04.769> time<00:01:05.070> now<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.280> turn<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.790> your<00:01:05.970> remote<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
it's time now to turn on your remote so

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.130 
it's time now to turn on your remote so
simply<00:01:07.380> flip<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> switch<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.869> you'll<00:01:09.869> hear

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
simply flip the switch up you'll hear

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.490 
simply flip the switch up you'll hear
the<00:01:10.409> blades<00:01:10.710> move<00:01:10.979> three<00:01:11.310> times<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.500> then

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the blades move three times and then

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
the blades move three times and then
after<00:01:13.920> about<00:01:14.159> five<00:01:14.549> seconds<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> light

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
after about five seconds here the light

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.640 
after about five seconds here the light
will<00:01:15.720> stop<00:01:15.930> flashing<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:18.380> then<00:01:19.380> you're

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
will stop flashing and then you're

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.960 
will stop flashing and then you're
basically<00:01:19.860> good<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> go<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.580> put

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
basically good to go so now you can put

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.580 
basically good to go so now you can put
into<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> throttle<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.049> see<00:01:25.259> how<00:01:25.560> it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
into the throttle just to see how it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.929 
into the throttle just to see how it
moves<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:27.270> there<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> go<00:01:27.509> now<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:29.729> course

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
moves and there you go now of course

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.670 
moves and there you go now of course
this<00:01:30.119> stick<00:01:30.390> right<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
this stick right here will be in the

throttle distich the same stick just

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.550 
throttle distich the same stick just
moving<00:01:35.759> right<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.119> left<00:01:36.150> will<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.810> pissed

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
moving right to left will be pissed

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.730 
moving right to left will be pissed
again<00:01:37.799> 360s

on a carpet or anything like that so now
go<00:02:14.800> ahead<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.160> try<00:02:15.250> your<00:02:15.310> first<00:02:15.550> ever<00:02:15.820> you're

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
go ahead and try your first ever you're

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.670 
go ahead and try your first ever you're
going<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.540> want<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.750> only<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.290> air<00:02:17.410> for

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
going to want to only be in the air for

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.500 
going to want to only be in the air for
about<00:02:17.709> three<00:02:18.070> or<00:02:18.100> four<00:02:18.250> seconds<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:19.000> see<00:02:19.209> which

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
about three or four seconds to see which

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.500 
about three or four seconds to see which
way<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.720> moves<00:02:20.019> so<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.350> can<00:02:20.560> trim<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.800> so<00:02:21.510> for

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
way it moves so you can trim it so for

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.770 
way it moves so you can trim it so for
example<00:02:22.600> i'll<00:02:23.110> set<00:02:23.350> my<00:02:23.380> trim<00:02:23.830> way<00:02:24.220> left<00:02:24.780> for

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
example i'll set my trim way left for

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:37.940 
example i'll set my trim way left for
tilting<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.280> can<00:02:27.430> see<00:02:27.640> how<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.970> reacts

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.210 

so<00:02:38.780> okay<00:02:39.780> I've<00:02:39.840> seen<00:02:40.080> there<00:02:40.290> we're<00:02:40.590> way<00:02:40.800> off<00:02:40.830> to

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
so okay I've seen there we're way off to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.030 
so okay I've seen there we're way off to
the<00:02:41.370> left<00:02:41.730> over<00:02:42.060> there<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:45.650> if<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.860> notice

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
the left over there so if you notice

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.740 
the left over there so if you notice
something<00:02:47.400> by<00:02:47.760> going<00:02:48.060> backwards<00:02:48.300> you're

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
something by going backwards you're

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.530 
something by going backwards you're
going<00:02:48.989> left<00:02:49.230> right<00:02:49.769> after<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.099> take<00:02:50.370> off<00:02:50.580> you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
going left right after you take off you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.360 
going left right after you take off you
will<00:02:52.200> immediately<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.739> want<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.099> stop<00:02:53.340> and

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
will immediately you want to stop and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.160 
will immediately you want to stop and
try<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.849> land<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.269> but<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.750> probably<00:02:55.019> won't

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
try and land it but you probably won't

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.130 
try and land it but you probably won't
lend<00:02:55.410> since<00:02:55.769> it's<00:02:55.980> your<00:02:56.069> first<00:02:56.220> time<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.930> keep

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
lend since it's your first time so keep

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.020 
lend since it's your first time so keep
trimming<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.590> keep<00:02:58.800> taking<00:02:59.190> off<00:02:59.310> be<00:02:59.550> blinding

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
trimming it keep taking off be blinding

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.570 
trimming it keep taking off be blinding
try<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> get<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.019> best<00:03:01.140> room<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.530> can<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:02.010> it's

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
try to get the best room you can so it's

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.640 
try to get the best room you can so it's
pretty<00:03:02.849> stable<00:03:03.209> when<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.900> take<00:03:04.349> it<00:03:04.500> up

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
pretty stable when you just take it up

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.440 
pretty stable when you just take it up
and<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.370> doesn't<00:03:05.700> move<00:03:05.880> towards<00:03:06.269> one

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
and it doesn't move towards one

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.479 
and it doesn't move towards one
direction<00:03:06.870> quite<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.140> bit<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:08.129> once<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.430> should

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
direction quite a bit so once you should

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.800 
direction quite a bit so once you should
have<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.000> should<00:03:09.180> be<00:03:09.299> something<00:03:09.690> like

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
have that you should be something like

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.130 
have that you should be something like
really<00:03:14.060> should<00:03:15.060> be<00:03:15.180> able<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.450> maintain<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.900> nice

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
really should be able to maintain a nice

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.009 
really should be able to maintain a nice
hover<00:03:16.410> like<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.890> without<00:03:17.849> going<00:03:18.720> out<00:03:18.900> of

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
hover like that without going out of

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:37.410 
hover like that without going out of
control<00:03:23.630> now<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.900> try<00:03:25.140> some<00:03:25.380> fun<00:03:25.650> stuff
