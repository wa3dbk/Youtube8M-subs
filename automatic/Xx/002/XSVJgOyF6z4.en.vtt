this this no need to panic
I<00:01:21.609> still<00:01:22.119> believe<00:01:22.149> a<00:01:22.450> Walters<00:01:22.899> unit<00:01:23.229> we<00:01:23.380> still

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
I still believe a Walters unit we still

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.160 
I still believe a Walters unit we still
won<00:01:23.799> one<00:01:24.009> in<00:01:24.159> this<00:01:24.249> series<00:01:24.609> if<00:01:25.600> we<00:01:25.749> panicking

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
won one in this series if we panicking

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.840 
won one in this series if we panicking
because<00:01:26.320> we<00:01:26.590> won<00:01:26.770> all<00:01:26.979> against<00:01:27.369> a<00:01:27.490> world-class

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
because we won all against a world-class

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.419 
because we won all against a world-class
team<00:01:28.149> away<00:01:28.390> from<00:01:28.600> home<00:01:28.780> then<00:01:29.249> we<00:01:30.249> should

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
team away from home then we should

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.029 
team away from home then we should
probably<00:01:30.520> be<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:30.909> best<00:01:31.090> team<00:01:31.270> in<00:01:31.359> the<00:01:31.420> world<00:01:31.509> I

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
probably be the best team in the world I

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.090 
probably be the best team in the world I
still<00:01:33.039> believe<00:01:33.280> we<00:01:33.310> walked<00:01:33.670> outside<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:35.100> like

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
still believe we walked outside and like

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.559 
still believe we walked outside and like
I<00:01:36.130> said<00:01:36.369> it's<00:01:36.520> up<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.759> figures<00:01:37.149> to<00:01:37.329> put<00:01:37.479> the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
the afternoon and at night so I'm

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.280 
the afternoon and at night so I'm
looking<00:02:02.750> for<00:02:02.960> two<00:02:03.580> evenly<00:02:04.580> contested<00:02:05.290> game

looking for two evenly contested game
and<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.740> think<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.310> week<00:02:07.430> is<00:02:07.550> not<00:02:07.610> gonna<00:02:07.790> play<00:02:07.940> a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and I think the week is not gonna play a

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.480 
and I think the week is not gonna play a
huge<00:02:08.300> role<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:09.440> their<00:02:09.650> result<00:02:09.980> tomorrow<00:02:10.100> I
