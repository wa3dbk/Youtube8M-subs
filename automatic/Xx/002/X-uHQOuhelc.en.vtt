choice<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.270> basically<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.440> try<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
choice and I basically just I try to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.170 
choice and I basically just I try to
keep<00:00:38.360> substituting<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.829> stall<00:00:40.829> him<00:00:41.489> out<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
keep substituting to stall him out and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.810 
keep substituting to stall him out and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
happened he kind of outplayed me when to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.350

what but that was really good in his
part<00:00:54.840> his<00:00:55.140> tentacles<00:00:55.590> gonna<00:00:55.739> set<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
part his tentacles gonna set up the
