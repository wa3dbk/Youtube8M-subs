00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.100 
place to it people would either put it
there<00:03:23.320> probably<00:03:23.739> or<00:03:24.630> at<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.690> very<00:03:25.810> bottom

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
there probably or at the very bottom

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.360 
there probably or at the very bottom
where<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.380> foot<00:03:26.620> peg<00:03:26.829> is<00:03:27.010> there<00:03:27.190> although

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
where the foot peg is there although

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.770 
where the foot peg is there although
that<00:03:27.640> would<00:03:27.760> tend<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.150> get<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.360> knocked<00:03:28.540> off

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
that would tend to get it knocked off

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.050 
that would tend to get it knocked off
but<00:03:31.709> you're<00:03:32.709> holding<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:32.980> camera<00:03:33.160> for<00:03:33.489> me<00:03:33.640> it's

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
don't wreck this one won't wreck this

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.770

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
this when it's all backed up I don't

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:07.240 
this when it's all backed up I don't
think<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:52.860> yeah<00:04:04.010> what<00:04:05.010> kind<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.280> bike<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.460> it

klx250s<00:04:08.250> f

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.610 

let's<00:04:16.489> see<00:04:16.670> this<00:04:16.880> tastes<00:04:17.359> like<00:04:17.480> I<00:04:17.780> get<00:04:18.140> tons<00:04:18.470> of

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
let's see this tastes like I get tons of

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.410 
let's see this tastes like I get tons of
zip<00:04:18.829> ties<00:04:19.040> so<00:04:19.250> if<00:04:19.340> this<00:04:19.489> one's<00:04:19.700> not<00:04:19.970> quite<00:04:20.030> long

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
zip ties so if this one's not quite long

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:29.350 
zip ties so if this one's not quite long
enough<00:04:20.450> for<00:04:21.040> substitute<00:04:22.040> one<00:04:22.190> of<00:04:22.340> my

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.459 

we're<00:04:30.360> not<00:04:30.479> catching<00:04:30.689> enough<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.199> know<00:04:31.319> what

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:31.469 
we're not catching enough you know what

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:33.290 
we're not catching enough you know what
we're<00:04:31.590> gonna<00:04:31.650> get<00:04:31.919> bigger<00:04:32.610> there's<00:04:32.909> a<00:04:33.030> bigger

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
we're gonna get bigger there's a bigger

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.649 
we're gonna get bigger there's a bigger
zip<00:04:33.569> tie<00:04:33.780> all<00:04:34.199> right<00:04:34.499> here<00:04:34.650> right<00:04:34.979> so<00:04:35.569> it's<00:04:36.569> a

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
zip tie all right here right so it's a

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.059 
zip tie all right here right so it's a
lot<00:04:36.900> more<00:04:36.960> confident<00:04:37.620> with<00:04:37.680> clicking<00:04:37.979> this

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
lot more confident with clicking this

00:04:38.069 --> 00:05:04.120 
lot more confident with clicking this
one

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.970 

cool<00:05:05.130> there<00:05:05.490> were<00:05:05.640> maximum<00:05:06.330> stretch<00:05:06.980> we'll

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
cool there were maximum stretch we'll

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.940 
cool there were maximum stretch we'll
keep<00:05:08.190> it<00:05:08.370> towards<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.120> inside<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.720> bike

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
keep it towards the inside of the bike

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.700 
keep it towards the inside of the bike
so<00:05:10.950> less<00:05:11.160> chance<00:05:11.430> of<00:05:11.550> something<00:05:11.790> getting<00:05:12.090> it

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
so less chance of something getting it

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:21.350 
so less chance of something getting it
in<00:05:13.710> there<00:05:13.890> or<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.490> I<00:05:20.030> don't<00:05:21.030> know<00:05:21.090> if<00:05:21.180> that's

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
in there or that I don't know if that's

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.330 
in there or that I don't know if that's
got<00:05:21.540> macro<00:05:21.990> so<00:05:22.140> maybe<00:05:22.410> a<00:05:22.500> little<00:05:22.800> fuzzy<00:05:23.070> that

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
got macro so maybe a little fuzzy that

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:34.610 
got macro so maybe a little fuzzy that
