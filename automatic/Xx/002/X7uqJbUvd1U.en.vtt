00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.540
 You can look at pretty girls 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.850
 principle for this I downloaded the game 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 dance kidding game is really cool 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.820
 according to the schedule it stands out among 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.079
 the rest of the motorcycle races and which 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.260
 present in the open spaces 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.760
 google play we start with the last one 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.010
 positions and opponents here are not simple they 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.280
 know when to slow down on the turns and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.909
 I don't know that and that's why I 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.970
 it is hard 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:16.680
 but due to the fact that the computer opponent 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.159
 brakes too often you can not just 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.270
 in not rushing forward and even cornering 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.670
 of course we need to do it 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.310
 get used to it so to speak in general physics 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.049
 this game and not fly out like this 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.369
 rhinestones and how am I what the smoke from the pants goes it 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:40.530
 so ok guys go basically 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:46.049
 overtook everyone was and this is just me 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.480
 I was lucky in time to slow down and catch up 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.390
 all even here 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.920
 you can become a goat as you can see 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.080
 it's all without problems you can do well 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.780
 so you see the opponents strongly strongly 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.520
 inhibit too and i'm catching up so 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.860
 then I do not know at what speed 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.290
 need to move going into such 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.800
 turn in general regulate your 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.000
 speed and were easily cross 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.230
