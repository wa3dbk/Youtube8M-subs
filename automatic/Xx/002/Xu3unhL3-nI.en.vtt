with<00:00:56.460> sugar<00:00:56.850> gliders<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> definitely

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
with sugar gliders but you definitely

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619 
with sugar gliders but you definitely
want<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> find<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.980> vet<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.090> best<00:01:00.359> thing<00:01:00.539> to

but it really is important that you find
a<00:01:27.960> vet<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.259> your<00:01:28.380> sugar<00:01:28.710> gliders<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.520> one

thing if your vet doesn't see them on
let's<00:01:32.970> say<00:01:33.180> an<00:01:33.420> annual<00:01:33.960> wellness<00:01:34.170> visit<00:01:34.890> level

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
let's say an annual wellness visit level

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.060 
let's say an annual wellness visit level
they<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.970> no<00:01:36.180> baseline<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:37.170> work<00:01:37.350> from<00:01:37.710> and

they have no baseline to work from and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
they have no baseline to work from and
that's<00:01:38.610> really<00:01:38.909> important<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.780> unfortunate

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that's really important it's unfortunate

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.200 
that's really important it's unfortunate
that<00:01:40.619> most<00:01:40.950> people<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.820> vet<00:01:42.030> with

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
that most people go to the vet with

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.179 
that most people go to the vet with
their<00:01:42.420> gliders<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.500> they're<00:01:43.680> pretty<00:01:43.979> much

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
their gliders when they're pretty much

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.850 
their gliders when they're pretty much
at<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.430> store<00:01:45.180> when<00:01:45.840> sugar<00:01:46.259> gliders<00:01:46.619> start

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
at that store when sugar gliders start

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.090 
at that store when sugar gliders start
looking<00:01:47.220> sick<00:01:47.549> they're<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.560> sick

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
looking sick they're really really sick
