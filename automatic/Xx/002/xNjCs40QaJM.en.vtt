00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 And then go get another video of an itch there. 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.519
 we have a role of the line and in the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.219
 videos of imported cars I know 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.779
 because it's what a taxman is and more 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.960
 popular but that's it, right? 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:26.000
 It's good, people got here in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.890
 workshop is a Corsican 1.4 2012 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.189
 he arrived with the clutch pedal 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.189
 down the left I have already taken it 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.080
 It is well lit where is half 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.670
 world right 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.640
 but here is the clutch pedal 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.740
 was low or not good and is with the suitcase 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.630
 who failed to engage the marches is 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.080
 At first I tried to bleed to the 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.910
 system by placing oil and lives 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.910
 sangria that has right here 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.780
 but at first I could not 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.410
 here then the first procedure 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.710
 when such a car comes with that 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.280
 symptom mechanic's workshop see if 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.250
 Is there any brake oil leak 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.390
 beyond the part there between the engine and the box 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.260
 male 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.729
 if there is a leak there is us 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.790
 can condemn the average cylinder to miss 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.810
 pressure 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.910
 in this case the problem was not this and yes 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.619
 the master cylinder which is what is there in the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.479
 clutch zero defect car already 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:02:00.479
 I told him, I spoke with him on Sunday. 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:06.800
 buy an egg waiting and bring his 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.800
 down and the clutch pedal is 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.470
 You're not sure what you can be. 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.480
 which is to have a sense that it can be 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.380
 deferido car is the tip there can be the 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.380
 your pedal 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.940
 This is it, there are details on 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.110
 relation to the clutches the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.180
 hydraulic 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.519
 whenever you have a new chance and 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.860
 to cfo or not only do you see in 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.720
 your car's tank and see if the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.269
 side has a hose 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 the outlet of a hose if it had 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.200
 idea of ​​a hose that way more 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.610
 Direct with candy on top of your car 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.610
 after the hydraulic 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.630
 if you have it is still high the pain 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.200
 cable 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.060
 then the tip is there the leak in the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.250
 lower part 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.260
 Do you know the cylinder if you do not? 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.030
 is leaking 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.440
 you take a look here in the current 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.510
 pedal here and see if it is 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.530
 pressing if he has pressure is 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.720
 sending oil to the actuator there you 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.150
 cylinder if you do not look at sending 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.020
 there it means the problem is in it 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.400
 you can diagnose very easy won 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.520
 and the purpose of the videos is not to do with 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.010
 that vehicle owners become 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.830
 mechanic is not that but the owner has 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.970
 an awareness of what happens in the 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:37.160
 which is the defect and so picks 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:41.330
 can not coil is to charge excess of 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.920
 labor charge apparent defect and 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.390
 did not solve the problem 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.390
 So stay the tip and go 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.390
 thanks
