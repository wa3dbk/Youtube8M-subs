00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.320
 here's the next question how much money is needed 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.719
 take with you to turkey to egypt but 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.850
 The question of course is interesting and at least you 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.060
 need to take 50 dollars with you 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.630
 spending is a minimum based on 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.669
 order not to buy anything 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.119
 But if you are planning to buy something 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:30.300
 usually it is well starting from everyone there 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.570
 souvenirs and so on, this amount will be 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.640
 probably make a big figure 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.140
 depending on what you want 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.230
 receive 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.629
 so you would like to buy but in Turkey 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.760
 Here judging by the reviews of many 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.920
 my acquaintances rely on what you 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.050
 buy guaranteed quality there 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.600

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.190
 exclusive quality branded well 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.730
 is it possible therefore 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.010
 amount basically money goes to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.220

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.890

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.390

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 advise because i need 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.530
 ask you some questions that is 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.259
 how do you prefer to spend your 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.979

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.329
 depending on the hotel, that is, if it is 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.909

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.549

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.049
 which 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.180
 which you first need to ask 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.040
 questions can then be formulated 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.710
 the amount of money you need by yourself 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.880
