this<00:00:00.269> level<00:00:00.539> really<00:00:00.690> seems<00:00:00.989> like<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.170> missed

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
this level really seems like a missed

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.800 
this level really seems like a missed
opportunity<00:00:01.589> I<00:00:02.310> mean<00:00:02.610> everything<00:00:03.270> here<00:00:03.689> is

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
opportunity I mean everything here is

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.240 
opportunity I mean everything here is
pretty<00:00:03.929> much<00:00:04.110> stuff<00:00:04.410> we've<00:00:04.560> already<00:00:04.710> seen<00:00:05.040> we

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
pretty much stuff we've already seen we

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.799 
pretty much stuff we've already seen we
started<00:00:05.670> level<00:00:05.910> 2<00:00:06.120> in<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.390> docks<00:00:07.790> the<00:00:08.809> people

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
started level 2 in the docks the people

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.780 
started level 2 in the docks the people
are<00:00:10.080> identical<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.860> pretty<00:00:11.099> much<00:00:11.250> every<00:00:11.670> other

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
are identical to pretty much every other

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.580 
are identical to pretty much every other
chapter<00:00:12.090> we<00:00:12.360> had<00:00:12.599> there's<00:00:12.870> just<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.200> hell<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.440> a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
chapter we had there's just a hell of a

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.250 
chapter we had there's just a hell of a
lot<00:00:13.769> more<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.040> them<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.630> later<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.870> there<00:00:16.139> are

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
lot more of them and later on there are

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260 
lot more of them and later on there are
a<00:00:16.440> few<00:00:16.859> minor<00:00:17.160> gameplay<00:00:17.760> elements<00:00:18.150> but

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
a few minor gameplay elements but

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.640 
a few minor gameplay elements but
they're<00:00:18.420> pretty<00:00:18.570> much<00:00:18.779> negligible<00:00:19.470> they

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
they're pretty much negligible they

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.970 
they're pretty much negligible they
really<00:00:20.189> don't<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.520> anything<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.500> this<00:00:22.500> chapter

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
really don't do anything so this chapter

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.410 
really don't do anything so this chapter
just<00:00:23.189> ends<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.490> feeling<00:00:23.820> really<00:00:24.000> thin<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
just ends up feeling really thin and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420 
just ends up feeling really thin and
stretched<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.890> knew<00:00:26.039> they<00:00:26.189> didn't

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
stretched out like they knew they didn't

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.710 
stretched out like they knew they didn't
have<00:00:26.550> enough<00:00:26.699> gameplay<00:00:27.150> time<00:00:27.390> where<00:00:27.599> we're

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
have enough gameplay time where we're

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.020 
have enough gameplay time where we're
gonna<00:00:27.779> end<00:00:27.900> up<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> bad<00:00:28.500> review<00:00:31.820> keep<00:00:32.820> your

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
were really fearing if that's the case

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.229 
were really fearing if that's the case
because<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:58.070> know<00:00:58.220> maybe<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:58.640> reviewer<00:00:59.059> would

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
because you know maybe a reviewer would

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.030 
because you know maybe a reviewer would
have<00:00:59.360> said<00:00:59.540> well<00:00:59.809> at<00:01:00.080> least<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.530> game<00:01:00.710> didn't

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
have said well at least the game didn't

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.660 
have said well at least the game didn't
waste<00:01:01.220> my<00:01:01.520> time<00:01:02.410> there<00:01:03.410> was<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.620> lot<00:01:03.920> of<00:01:03.950> bugs<00:01:04.369> it

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
waste my time there was a lot of bugs it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.480 
waste my time there was a lot of bugs it
was<00:01:04.790> terrible<00:01:05.269> I<00:01:05.540> hated<00:01:06.500> a<00:01:06.710> lot<00:01:06.890> about<00:01:07.040> it<00:01:07.340> but

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
was terrible I hated a lot about it but

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.340 
was terrible I hated a lot about it but
least<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.360> was<00:01:08.450> short<00:01:10.810> can't<00:01:11.810> even<00:01:11.930> say<00:01:12.170> that

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
least it was short can't even say that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.260 
least it was short can't even say that
this<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.830> actually<00:01:13.100> running<00:01:13.460> longer<00:01:13.880> than<00:01:14.180> I

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
this is actually running longer than I

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.850 
this is actually running longer than I
think<00:01:14.509> both<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:15.140> Soul<00:01:15.320> Reaper<00:01:15.619> games

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
think both of the Soul Reaper games

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:24.130 
think both of the Soul Reaper games
so-called<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:21.910> actually<00:01:22.910> did<00:01:23.240> use<00:01:23.450> telekinesis

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
so-called I actually did use telekinesis

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.139 
so-called I actually did use telekinesis
on<00:01:24.289> purpose<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.830> kill<00:01:24.979> that<00:01:25.130> guy<00:01:25.369> simply<00:01:25.910> due

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
on purpose to kill that guy simply due

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.160 
on purpose to kill that guy simply due
to<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.360> fact<00:01:26.539> that<00:01:26.720> if<00:01:26.899> you're<00:01:27.020> actually

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
to the fact that if you're actually

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.960 
to the fact that if you're actually
trying<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.649> fight<00:01:27.890> him<00:01:28.070> out<00:01:28.190> here<00:01:28.490> it's<00:01:28.640> really

this<00:01:47.149> this<00:01:47.660> is<00:01:47.720> just<00:01:48.020> bad<00:01:48.229> access

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.710 

so<00:01:59.200> this<00:01:59.590> part<00:01:59.920> really<00:02:00.490> sucks<00:02:00.850> do<00:02:01.240> not<00:02:01.450> fight

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
so this part really sucks do not fight

so this part really sucks do not fight
this<00:02:01.869> guy<00:02:02.079> where<00:02:02.290> I'm<00:02:02.380> standing<00:02:02.680> see<00:02:03.130> those

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
this guy where I'm standing see those

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.770 
this guy where I'm standing see those
two<00:02:03.640> chicks<00:02:03.909> in<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.180> back<00:02:04.360> they<00:02:04.600> keep

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
two chicks in the back they keep

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.960 
two chicks in the back they keep
shooting<00:02:05.110> arrows<00:02:05.470> at<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.829> and<00:02:06.280> those<00:02:06.549> arrows

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
shooting arrows at you and those arrows

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.290 
shooting arrows at you and those arrows
defy<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.509> law<00:02:07.899> of<00:02:08.190> physics<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.670> nature<00:02:10.060> and

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
defy the law of physics and nature and

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.000 
defy the law of physics and nature and
everything

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.010 

for<00:02:16.010> example<00:02:16.700> once<00:02:16.940> we<00:02:17.090> get<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.330> few<00:02:17.510> hits<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:17.870> it
