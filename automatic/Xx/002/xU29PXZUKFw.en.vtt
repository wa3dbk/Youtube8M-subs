00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
I said earlier the biggest thing in

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.500 
I said earlier the biggest thing in
reducing<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.430> temperature<00:03:52.610> is<00:03:52.970> doing<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.390> in

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
reducing the temperature is doing it in

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.960 
reducing the temperature is doing it in
a<00:03:53.600> controlled<00:03:54.049> way<00:03:54.140> and<00:03:54.470> rubbing<00:03:54.950> alcohol<00:03:55.459> can

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
a controlled way and rubbing alcohol can

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.009 
a controlled way and rubbing alcohol can
help<00:03:56.180> do<00:03:56.360> this<00:03:58.239> rehydrate<00:03:59.239> obviously<00:03:59.720> let

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
help do this rehydrate obviously let
