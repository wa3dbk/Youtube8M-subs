00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
apparently this data set that was the

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.170 
apparently this data set that was the
secret<00:05:37.800> level<00:05:38.160> it<00:05:38.280> was<00:05:38.340> pretty<00:05:38.610> creepy<00:05:38.880> though

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
secret level it was pretty creepy though

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
I don't like I guess they're hinting

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.930

that<00:05:43.140> the<00:05:43.440> boy<00:05:43.590> became<00:05:43.950> Slenderman<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.700> don't

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
that the boy became Slenderman I don't

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.990 
that the boy became Slenderman I don't
really<00:05:45.270> know<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:46.050> wish<00:05:46.740> this<00:05:46.920> game<00:05:47.190> had<00:05:47.430> more<00:05:47.730> to

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
really know I wish this game had more to

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.420 
really know I wish this game had more to
it<00:05:48.240> this<00:05:48.630> game<00:05:48.840> was<00:05:49.050> very<00:05:49.560> disappointing

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
it this game was very disappointing

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.430 
it this game was very disappointing
actually<00:05:50.640> I<00:05:51.090> played<00:05:51.780> it<00:05:51.900> again<00:05:52.170> and<00:05:52.380> I

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
actually I played it again and I

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.410 
actually I played it again and I
finished<00:05:52.830> it<00:05:52.980> in<00:05:53.190> literally<00:05:53.550> 20<00:05:53.940> minutes<00:05:54.210> and

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
finished it in literally 20 minutes and

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.450 
finished it in literally 20 minutes and
I<00:05:54.480> think<00:05:54.660> that's<00:05:54.810> kind<00:05:54.990> of<00:05:55.140> ridiculous<00:05:55.560> I<00:05:55.950> wish

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
I think that's kind of ridiculous I wish

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.190 
I think that's kind of ridiculous I wish
there<00:05:56.640> was<00:05:56.760> more<00:05:56.820> to<00:05:57.300> this<00:05:57.420> game<00:05:57.630> maybe<00:05:57.930> like

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
there was more to this game maybe like

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.230 
there was more to this game maybe like
an<00:05:58.350> episodic<00:05:58.860> thing<00:05:59.280> like<00:05:59.730> The<00:05:59.910> Walking<00:06:00.090> Dead

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
an episodic thing like The Walking Dead

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.790 
an episodic thing like The Walking Dead
I<00:06:00.630> think<00:06:01.170> that<00:06:01.320> would<00:06:01.470> have<00:06:01.560> been<00:06:01.650> awesome

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
I think that would have been awesome

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.940 
I think that would have been awesome
then<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.310> would<00:06:02.550> be<00:06:02.730> you<00:06:03.660> know<00:06:03.840> I<00:06:04.080> think<00:06:04.710> I<00:06:04.890> would

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
then I would be you know I think I would

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.320
