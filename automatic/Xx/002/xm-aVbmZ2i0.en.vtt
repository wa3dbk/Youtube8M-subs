00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
completed with this we could use it to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
completed with this we could use it to
hang<00:00:31.770> our<00:00:32.130> different<00:00:32.579> key<00:00:32.759> chains<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.480> so

kinds of papers is that you can change
the<00:03:53.730> photo<00:03:53.909> frame<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.799> you<00:03:55.950> want<00:03:56.129> start

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
the photo frame so that you want start

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640 
the photo frame so that you want start
with<00:03:56.879> one<00:03:57.150> constant<00:03:57.810> thing<00:03:58.049> which<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.469> quite

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
with one constant thing which is quite

eat or whatever the festival is so the

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.900 
eat or whatever the festival is so the
basic<00:04:19.380> idea<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:19.949> that<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.280> won't<00:04:20.459> start<00:04:20.729> with

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
basic idea is that you won't start with

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.960 
basic idea is that you won't start with
one<00:04:21.419> boring<00:04:22.380> design<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:23.130> your<00:04:23.310> home<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.759> could

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
one boring design in your home you could

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.029 
one boring design in your home you could
interchange<00:04:24.360> everything<00:04:25.349> and<00:04:25.560> then<00:04:25.770> make<00:04:26.009> a

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
interchange everything and then make a

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.350 
interchange everything and then make a
real<00:04:26.520> good<00:04:26.849> key<00:04:27.599> holder<00:04:28.050> out<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:29.180> this<00:04:30.180> is

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
real good key holder out of it this is

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.150 
real good key holder out of it this is
actually<00:04:30.539> a<00:04:30.840> second<00:04:31.199> idea<00:04:31.530> which<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:31.830> could

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
actually a second idea which you could

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.520 
actually a second idea which you could
put<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.580> use<00:04:32.789> if<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.630> don't<00:04:33.870> want<00:04:34.139> to<00:04:34.259> use<00:04:34.380> a

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
put to use if you don't want to use a

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.350 
put to use if you don't want to use a
photo<00:04:34.800> frame<00:04:35.099> but<00:04:35.370> still<00:04:35.610> make<00:04:35.849> a<00:04:35.880> key<00:04:36.150> holder

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
photo frame but still make a key holder

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.010 
photo frame but still make a key holder
then<00:04:37.289> you<00:04:37.560> can<00:04:37.800> actually<00:04:38.449> pay<00:04:39.449> something<00:04:39.810> like

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
then you can actually pay something like

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.950 
then you can actually pay something like
keys<00:04:40.410> over<00:04:40.680> here<00:04:41.490> on<00:04:41.729> the<00:04:41.910> door<00:04:42.120> or<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.389> wall<00:04:42.720> and

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
keys over here on the door or a wall and

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.110 
keys over here on the door or a wall and
then<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.680> can<00:04:43.860> simply<00:04:44.220> pass<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.669> hooks<00:04:44.849> on

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
then you can simply pass the hooks on

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.600 
then you can simply pass the hooks on
the<00:04:45.419> wall<00:04:45.449> or<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.020> door<00:04:46.740> so<00:04:47.070> that<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.460> would

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
the wall or the door so that you would

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.760 
the wall or the door so that you would
have<00:04:47.789> a<00:04:47.849> key<00:04:48.750> holder<00:04:48.990> which<00:04:49.410> is<00:04:49.440> made

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
have a key holder which is made

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.089 
have a key holder which is made
instantly<00:04:50.639> um<00:04:51.030> just<00:04:51.990> phase<00:04:52.349> the<00:04:52.620> hook<00:04:52.770> on<00:04:52.949> the

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
instantly um just phase the hook on the

00:04:53.099 --> 00:05:02.090 
instantly um just phase the hook on the
side<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:54.349> finish<00:04:55.349> it<00:04:55.500> completely

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.240 

with<00:05:02.640> whom<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.120> would<00:05:03.270> look<00:05:03.450> like<00:05:03.510> this<00:05:04.250> with

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
with whom it would look like this with

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.270 
with whom it would look like this with
keys<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.850> may<00:05:06.030> look<00:05:06.240> like<00:05:06.270> this<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.280> with

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
basically you could also cut these

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.860 
basically you could also cut these
things<00:05:13.320> off<00:05:13.830> if<00:05:14.220> this<00:05:14.700> is<00:05:14.850> permanent<00:05:15.120> else<00:05:15.660> you

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
things off if this is permanent else you

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.350 
things off if this is permanent else you
can<00:05:16.050> just<00:05:16.080> remove<00:05:16.680> them<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.100> use<00:05:17.760> this<00:05:18.030> hooks

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
can just remove them and use this hooks

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.120 
can just remove them and use this hooks
when<00:05:18.600> you<00:05:18.720> want<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:19.110> get<00:05:19.290> rid<00:05:19.470> of<00:05:19.500> this<00:05:19.830> frame

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.200 
when you want to get rid of this frame
so<00:05:20.790> I<00:05:20.820> just<00:05:21.360> cut<00:05:22.140> them<00:05:22.700> so<00:05:23.700> that<00:05:23.850> I<00:05:23.970> could

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
so I just cut them so that I could

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.810 
so I just cut them so that I could
remove<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:24.810> whenever<00:05:25.200> I<00:05:25.470> want<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.010> also<00:05:26.610> you

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
could take printouts of these letters

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.640 
could take printouts of these letters
which<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.190> actually<00:05:29.490> wrote<00:05:30.090> here<00:05:30.480> so<00:05:31.050> that<00:05:31.260> the

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
which I actually wrote here so that the

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.010 
which I actually wrote here so that the
effect<00:05:32.220> would<00:05:32.400> be<00:05:32.460> neat<00:05:33.120> when<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:33.840> are

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
actually taking a printout as of now I'm

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.660 
actually taking a printout as of now I'm
just<00:05:36.540> using<00:05:36.810> this<00:05:37.140> so<00:05:37.890> this<00:05:38.220> is<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.490> final
