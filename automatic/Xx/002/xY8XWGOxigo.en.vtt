00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.010 
I started this course in 1984 going up
to<00:00:42.140> Glasgow<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.330> got<00:00:44.330> halfway<00:00:44.540> through<00:00:44.720> the

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
to Glasgow and got halfway through the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.190 
to Glasgow and got halfway through the
second<00:00:45.440> year<00:00:45.680> we<00:00:46.370> just<00:00:46.880> 10<00:00:47.630> weeks<00:00:47.900> of

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
second year we just 10 weeks of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.600 
second year we just 10 weeks of
injecting<00:00:49.130> each<00:00:49.430> other<00:00:49.640> with<00:00:51.280> anaesthetic<00:00:52.280> I

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
injecting each other with anaesthetic I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.370 
injecting each other with anaesthetic I
was<00:00:52.970> part<00:00:53.210> of<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.390> course<00:00:53.630> and<00:00:53.900> I<00:00:53.930> passed<00:00:54.170> that

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
was part of the course and I passed that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.230 
was part of the course and I passed that
successfully<00:00:55.130> and<00:00:55.280> then<00:00:55.400> I<00:00:55.490> found<00:00:55.790> out<00:00:55.940> I<00:00:55.970> had

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
successfully and then I found out I had

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.960 
successfully and then I found out I had
a<00:00:56.330> plastic<00:00:56.600> anemia<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.470> I<00:00:57.680> went<00:00:58.580> down<00:00:58.760> to

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
a plastic anemia so I went down to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.850 
a plastic anemia so I went down to
messed<00:00:59.510> up<00:00:59.720> and<00:01:00.140> had<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.530> bone<00:01:00.740> marrow

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
messed up and had a bone marrow

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.310 
messed up and had a bone marrow
transplant<00:01:01.220> so<00:01:02.030> rather<00:01:02.570> than<00:01:02.810> go<00:01:02.930> back<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:03.230> the

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
transplant so rather than go back to the

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.430 
transplant so rather than go back to the
course<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:03.710> went<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:04.130> did<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.430> chemistry<00:01:05.000> degree

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
course I went and did a chemistry degree

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.230 
course I went and did a chemistry degree
has<00:01:06.440> some<00:01:06.650> work<00:01:06.800> published<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.730> I've<00:01:08.060> been

I first did a degree before this and
then<00:01:14.330> well<00:01:15.170> that<00:01:15.350> led<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.560> I<00:01:15.740> didn't<00:01:16.010> really

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
then well that led to I didn't really

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.160 
then well that led to I didn't really

enjoy working in it was a lot of lab
based<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:19.310> quite<00:01:19.610> I<00:01:19.790> think<00:01:19.970> enjoyed<00:01:20.360> working

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570

itself<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.650> Resta<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.850> opportunity<00:01:26.360> came<00:01:26.570> up

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
itself and Resta the opportunity came up

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.240 
itself and Resta the opportunity came up
a<00:01:26.840> couple<00:01:26.869> of<00:01:27.140> years<00:01:27.350> ago<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:27.950> thought<00:01:28.190> it

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
a couple of years ago and I thought it

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.280 
a couple of years ago and I thought it
was<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.460> really<00:01:28.610> good<00:01:28.790> only<00:01:28.940> day<00:01:29.150> to<00:01:29.750> go<00:01:29.900> back<00:01:30.080> to

doing what I planned on doing it again
it's<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.750> fairly<00:01:32.990> good<00:01:33.560> balance<00:01:33.590> of<00:01:34.100> hands-on

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
it's a fairly good balance of hands-on

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.160

you get to do local anesthetics and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.449 
you get to do local anesthetics and
carry<00:02:24.879> out<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.060> procedure<00:02:25.239> itself<00:02:26.129> which<00:02:27.129> is

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
carry out the procedure itself which is

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.430 
carry out the procedure itself which is
really<00:02:28.090> interesting<00:02:28.450> because<00:02:29.050> it's<00:02:29.379> the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
really interesting because it's the
