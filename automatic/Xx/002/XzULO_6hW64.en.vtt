stations<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.470> rest<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.520> six<00:02:21.730> will<00:02:21.940> be

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
stations and rest of the six will be

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.980 
stations and rest of the six will be
medicine<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.500> surgery<00:02:23.970> ok<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.810> how<00:02:25.960> I

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
medicine and surgery ok so this is how I

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.410 
medicine and surgery ok so this is how I
prepared<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:27.030> started<00:02:28.410> reading<00:02:29.410> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
prepared I started reading the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.660 
prepared I started reading the
Pediatrics<00:02:31.420> first<00:02:31.750> because<00:02:32.320> if<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.340> look<00:02:33.520> at

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
Pediatrics first because if you look at

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.750 
Pediatrics first because if you look at
Pediatrics<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.660> number<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.520> scenarios<00:02:36.520> they

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
Pediatrics the number of scenarios they

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.000 
Pediatrics the number of scenarios they
can<00:02:36.910> frame<00:02:37.240> from<00:02:37.600> pediatrics<00:02:38.260> are<00:02:38.620> very

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
can frame from pediatrics are very

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.880 
can frame from pediatrics are very
limited<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:40.390> contrast<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.170> medicine<00:02:41.709> and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
limited in contrast to medicine and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.130 
limited in contrast to medicine and
surgery<00:02:42.070> it's<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.580> very<00:02:42.790> vast<00:02:43.120> subject<00:02:43.750> you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
surgery it's a very vast subject you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.470 
surgery it's a very vast subject you
have<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.350> cover<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.830> lot<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.280> things<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:46.209> what<00:02:46.450> I

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
have to cover a lot of things so what I

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.040 
have to cover a lot of things so what I
did<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.140> tried<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:48.209> prepare<00:02:49.209> Pediatrics

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
did is I tried to prepare Pediatrics

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.620 
did is I tried to prepare Pediatrics
thoroughly<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:51.239> because<00:02:52.239> there<00:02:52.360> are<00:02:52.480> very

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
thoroughly I because there are very

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.420 
thoroughly I because there are very
limited<00:02:52.810> cases<00:02:53.320> there<00:02:53.739> are<00:02:53.770> not<00:02:53.950> many<00:02:54.130> cases

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
limited cases there are not many cases

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.820 
limited cases there are not many cases
you<00:02:54.790> know<00:02:54.910> there<00:02:55.030> will<00:02:55.090> be<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.560> child<00:02:56.560> with

your time on the ocean like medicine and
surgery<00:05:40.060> because<00:05:40.720> surgery<00:05:41.229> again<00:05:41.320> is<00:05:41.590> a<00:05:41.620> bit

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
surgery because surgery again is a bit

they<00:05:42.880> can't<00:05:43.090> has<00:05:43.300> too<00:05:43.540> many<00:05:43.720> cases<00:05:43.960> on<00:05:44.700> surgery

so concentrate on this smaller task

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.940 
so concentrate on this smaller task
where<00:05:48.610> there<00:05:48.910> are<00:05:49.060> less<00:05:49.930> topics<00:05:50.410> to<00:05:50.590> prepare

where there are less topics to prepare

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.180 
where there are less topics to prepare
and<00:05:51.430> smash<00:05:52.150> these<00:05:52.479> topics<00:05:53.050> then<00:05:53.590> go<00:05:53.860> for<00:05:54.160> the

and smash these topics then go for the

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.550 
and smash these topics then go for the
general<00:05:55.180> practice<00:05:55.600> where<00:05:55.870> you<00:05:56.110> know<00:05:56.229> you<00:05:56.290> can
