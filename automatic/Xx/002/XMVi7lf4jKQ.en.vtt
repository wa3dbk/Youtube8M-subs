00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
set myself a rule in this series and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.840 
set myself a rule in this series and
that<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> am<00:00:34.800> only<00:00:35.040> allowed<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.820> play

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
that is that I am only allowed to play

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.869 
that is that I am only allowed to play
two<00:00:36.090> games<00:00:36.360> each<00:00:37.020> round<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.579> being

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
two games each round so with that being

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.690 
two games each round so with that being
said<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:39.870> actually<00:00:40.140> finally<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.430> past

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
said can we actually finally get past

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.819 
said can we actually finally get past
these<00:00:42.000> Oklahoma<00:00:42.660> City<00:00:42.899> Thunder<00:00:43.379> by

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
these Oklahoma City Thunder by

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.520 
these Oklahoma City Thunder by
simulating<00:00:44.430> these<00:00:44.789> games<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.899> question

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
simulating these games that question

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.770 
simulating these games that question
that<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.010> still<00:00:47.250> open<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.629> this

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that is still open but for now in this

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.439 
that is still open but for now in this
series<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.710> simply<00:00:50.219> haven't<00:00:50.579> had<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.149> lot<00:00:51.420> of

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
series we simply haven't had a lot of

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.110 
series we simply haven't had a lot of
luck<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> department<00:00:52.230> yet<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.610> Oklahoma

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
luck in that department yet the Oklahoma

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540 
luck in that department yet the Oklahoma
City<00:00:54.270> Thunder<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.160> opponent

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
City Thunder they are that one opponent

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.060 
City Thunder they are that one opponent
that<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.300> simply<00:00:57.690> couldn't<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.469> past<00:00:58.770> in

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that we simply couldn't get past in

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.670 
that we simply couldn't get past in
every<00:00:59.609> single<00:00:59.969> season<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.600> seems<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:01.109> an<00:01:01.320> S

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
every single season it seems like an S

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.160 
every single season it seems like an S
up<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.480> starting<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
up now you can see it is starting to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
up now you can see it is starting to
look<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.799> once<00:01:05.070> again<00:01:05.390> we<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.540> now

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
look like it once again we are now

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
all and we have already given up one

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.080 
all and we have already given up one
game<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.810> our<00:01:13.080> home<00:01:13.350> court<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.790> straight

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
game on our home court so going straight

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
game on our home court so going straight
into<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> simulation<00:01:16.080> process<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.799> Game

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
into the simulation process of Game

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.240 
into the simulation process of Game
three<00:01:17.460> now<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.270> Oklahoma<00:01:18.810> City<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.979> see

what I was looking for in this series we
want<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:36.990> those<00:01:37.200> wins<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.460> sure

so as we are now jumping into the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.520 
so as we are now jumping into the
simulation<00:01:41.610> process<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.270> Game<00:01:42.509> four<00:01:42.899> this

simulation process of Game four this

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.580 
simulation process of Game four this
game<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.159> crucial<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.600> need<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.990> win<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.320> game

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
game is crucial we need to win this game

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.889 
game is crucial we need to win this game
to<00:01:46.649> tie<00:01:47.070> up<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.460> series<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.060> take<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.689> back

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
to tie up the series and take it back

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.620 
to tie up the series and take it back
home<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.680> Los<00:01:49.920> Angeles<00:01:50.060> without<00:01:51.060> facing

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.459 
the bad news we lost once again now down
three<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.549> now<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.630> decision<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
three to one now is the decision that

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.859 
three to one now is the decision that
most<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.189> are<00:02:02.219> most<00:02:02.579> likely<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
most of you are most likely not going to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.410 
most of you are most likely not going to
agree<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.380> me<00:02:04.619> along<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.130> way<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
agree with me along this way but like I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
agree with me along this way but like I
said<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.960> am<00:02:07.079> only<00:02:07.350> allowed<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.890> play<00:02:07.920> two<00:02:08.310> games

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
said I am only allowed to play two games

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.750 
said I am only allowed to play two games
each<00:02:08.940> round<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:10.080> want<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.500> play<00:02:10.770> Game<00:02:11.220> six

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
each round and I want to play Game six

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.520 
each round and I want to play Game six
and<00:02:12.000> Game<00:02:12.599> seven

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
and Game seven

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.800 
and Game seven
but<00:02:13.740> happens<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.640> if<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.120> need<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.450> decide

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
but happens and if I need to decide

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.050 
but happens and if I need to decide
which<00:02:16.050> game<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.590> simulate<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.280> would<00:02:17.760> rather

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
which game to simulate I would rather

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.270 
which game to simulate I would rather
assimilate<00:02:18.840> game<00:02:19.170> five<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.830> our<00:02:19.860> home<00:02:20.250> court

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
assimilate game five on our home court

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.870 
assimilate game five on our home court
instead<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.450> Game<00:02:21.690> six<00:02:22.110> away<00:02:22.680> from<00:02:23.040> home<00:02:23.280> so

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
instead of Game six away from home so

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.940 
instead of Game six away from home so
with<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.270> being<00:02:24.540> said<00:02:24.690> let's<00:02:25.440> hop<00:02:25.680> straight

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
with that being said let's hop straight

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.250 
with that being said let's hop straight
into<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.430> simulation<00:02:26.790> process<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.630> Game<00:02:27.900> five

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
into the simulation process of Game five

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.370 
into the simulation process of Game five
and<00:02:28.530> hopefully<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.970> can<00:02:30.000> walk<00:02:30.450> away<00:02:30.630> with<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
and hopefully we can walk away with a

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.760 
and hopefully we can walk away with a
much-needed<00:02:31.860> win<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:33.510> need<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.900> win<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.230> game

it is a must-win game can we actually

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.040 
it is a must-win game can we actually
take<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.860> series<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.520> game<00:02:38.940> six<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.510> Game

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
take this series to a game six and Game
