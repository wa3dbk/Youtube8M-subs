this compares to my SC Borrowed and blue
which<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.660> took<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.230> while<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.800> get<00:02:28.950> because<00:02:29.340> it

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
which I took a while to get because it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.600 
which I took a while to get because it
was<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.330> hard<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.600> find<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.380> shade

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
was so hard to find and this is shade

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.330 
was so hard to find and this is shade
975<00:02:32.610> or<00:02:32.910> poolside<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.560> doesn't<00:02:34.890> really<00:02:35.040> look

975 or poolside it doesn't really look
like<00:02:35.400> pool<00:02:36.300> water<00:02:36.600> because<00:02:36.870> pool<00:02:37.080> water's

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
like pool water because pool water's

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.590 
like pool water because pool water's
bluer<00:02:37.650> than<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.060> next<00:02:39.360> color

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
bluer than that and then the next color

bluer than that and then the next color
is<00:02:40.790> typical<00:02:41.790> green<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.650> would<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.070> see

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
is typical green and I would like to see

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.460 
is typical green and I would like to see
how<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.490> compares<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.060> se<00:02:45.660> mint<00:02:45.870> candy<00:02:46.170> apple

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
how this compares to se mint candy apple

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.500 
how this compares to se mint candy apple
and<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:47.100> one<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.370> called<00:02:47.580> mint<00:02:47.970> mist<00:02:48.300> or

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and this one is called mint mist or

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.560 
and this one is called mint mist or
shade<00:02:48.810> 980<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.920> once<00:02:50.700> again<00:02:50.850> it's<00:02:51.120> not<00:02:51.330> the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
shade 980 and once again it's not the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.300 
shade 980 and once again it's not the
same<00:02:51.750> as<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.080> one<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.230> have<00:02:52.440> on<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.980> lot

lighter it's a very very light a lot of
whites<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.400> that's<00:02:56.700> why<00:02:56.820> I'm<00:02:56.940> curious

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
whites in it so that's why I'm curious

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.770 
whites in it so that's why I'm curious
about<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.290> one<00:02:59.000> second<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.209> last<00:03:00.480> is

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
about that one second to the last is

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.750 
about that one second to the last is
this<00:03:01.020> color<00:03:01.320> which<00:03:01.890> pulls<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.400> little<00:03:02.640> bit

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
this color which pulls a little bit

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.550 
this color which pulls a little bit
greener<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.390> looks<00:03:03.600> similar<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.290> Color

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
called urban utopia shade 965 so it's a

lot greener and then the last one that I

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.180 
lot greener and then the last one that I
picked<00:03:14.490> up<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.959> color<00:03:16.290> right<00:03:16.590> here<00:03:16.620> and
