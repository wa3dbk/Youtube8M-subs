watch together one lap on the Budapest

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.570 
watch together one lap on the Budapest
circuit<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:27.000> Hungary<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.950> we<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
circuit in Hungary so here we are on the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.150 
circuit in Hungary so here we are on the
last<00:00:29.670> corner<00:00:29.970> trying<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.740> get<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.950> good

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
last corner trying to to to get a good

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.570 
last corner trying to to to get a good
speed<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.669> start<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.150> lab<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> straight<00:00:34.890> is

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
speed to start the lab is a straight is

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.740 
speed to start the lab is a straight is
the<00:00:35.790> longest<00:00:36.090> straight<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> track<00:00:36.720> that

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the longest straight on the track that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.740 
the longest straight on the track that
we<00:00:37.080> get<00:00:37.230> maybe<00:00:37.440> three<00:00:37.710> hundred<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.129> ten

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
we get maybe three hundred and ten

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.000 
we get maybe three hundred and ten
kilometers<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.320> very<00:00:40.710> very<00:00:40.860> strong

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
kilometers is a very very strong

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.000 
kilometers is a very very strong
breaking<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:42.260> some<00:00:43.260> possibility<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> front

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
breaking here some possibility of front

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.939 
breaking here some possibility of front
blocking<00:00:44.220> it<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:45.030> slow<00:00:45.750> corner<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.620> very

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
blocking it is slow corner and is very

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.619 
blocking it is slow corner and is very
important<00:00:47.400> to<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:47.670> out<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> good<00:00:48.330> traction

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
important to go out in the good traction

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.080 
important to go out in the good traction
and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.739> got<00:00:49.860> into<00:00:50.010> corner<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and then we got into corner to here is a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.210 
and then we got into corner to here is a
corner<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.780> always<00:00:52.019> very<00:00:52.530> understeer

corner a long way and you're going out a

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.299 
corner a long way and you're going out a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
losing any time on them on the straight

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.940 
losing any time on them on the straight
and<00:01:55.530> here<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.310> finish<00:01:56.609> a<00:01:57.179> lap<00:01:57.929> in<00:01:58.140> Hungary

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and here we finish a lap in Hungary

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.029 
and here we finish a lap in Hungary
which<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> small<00:02:00.060> circuit<00:02:00.689> but<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.499> fun

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
which is a small circuit but very fun

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.930 
which is a small circuit but very fun
and<00:02:02.219> nice

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940
