00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I'm not had to google this apparently

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.170 
I'm not had to google this apparently
there's<00:02:16.739> different<00:02:17.280> types<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.700> birds<00:02:17.910> out

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
there's different types of birds out

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.830 
there's different types of birds out
there<00:02:18.209> there<00:02:18.840> are<00:02:19.080> birds<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.510> they're<00:02:21.510> called

there there are birds and they're called

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.949 
there there are birds and they're called
generalists<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.910> specialists<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.660> Rob

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
generalists and specialists so Rob

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.050 
generalists and specialists so Rob
picked<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.770> names<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.370> generalists<00:02:26.820> because

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
picked the names of generalists because

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.360 
picked the names of generalists because
he<00:02:27.209> picked<00:02:27.989> this<00:02:28.260> blade<00:02:28.830> shape<00:02:29.040> which<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
he picked this blade shape which is a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.020 
he picked this blade shape which is a
sheep's<00:02:29.640> hood<00:02:29.820> he<00:02:30.270> needed<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.630> after<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.989> bird

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
sheep's hood he needed it after a bird

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.130 
sheep's hood he needed it after a bird
apparently<00:02:33.030> used<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.300> terrorize<00:02:33.540> them<00:02:33.989> and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
apparently used to terrorize them and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.090 
apparently used to terrorize them and
the<00:02:35.010> beak<00:02:35.220> was<00:02:35.640> exactly<00:02:36.120> shaped<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.600> this

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
the beak was exactly shaped like this

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.420 
the beak was exactly shaped like this
right<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:39.600> fitting<00:02:40.110> because<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:41.100> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
right so it's fitting because the the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.789 
right so it's fitting because the the
term<00:02:41.850> generalists<00:02:42.600> basically<00:02:43.200> means<00:02:43.350> someone

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
term generalists basically means someone

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.590 
term generalists basically means someone
or<00:02:43.920> something<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.459> thrive<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:45.120> a

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
or something that can thrive in a

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.360 
or something that can thrive in a
variety<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.049> conditions<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.130> not<00:02:47.310> a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
variety of conditions so it's not a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.520 
variety of conditions so it's not a
specialized<00:02:48.150> beak<00:02:48.510> if<00:02:48.959> we're<00:02:49.170> talking<00:02:49.440> about

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
specialized beak if we're talking about

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.000 
specialized beak if we're talking about
the<00:02:49.739> birds<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.700> likely<00:02:51.690> said<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.350> again<00:02:52.620> Lee

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
the birds and likely said and again Lee

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.060 
the birds and likely said and again Lee
is<00:02:53.130> wicked<00:02:53.820> smart<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.480> I'm<00:02:55.470> pretty<00:02:55.860> sure<00:02:56.010> I

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
is wicked smart and I'm pretty sure I

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.060 
is wicked smart and I'm pretty sure I
know<00:02:56.160> if<00:02:56.340> he<00:02:56.400> pulled<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.760> out<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.000> his<00:02:58.070> mental

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
know if he pulled this out of his mental

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.860 
know if he pulled this out of his mental
Wikipedia<00:02:59.700> but<00:02:59.910> he<00:03:00.000> said<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.269> but<00:03:00.630> just

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
Wikipedia but he said that but just

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.270 
Wikipedia but he said that but just
checking<00:03:01.200> out<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.440> blade<00:03:01.680> checking<00:03:02.070> out<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
checking out the blade checking out the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.280 
checking out the blade checking out the
knife<00:03:02.430> he<00:03:02.610> said<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.030> winter<00:03:03.180> still<00:03:03.420> 11<00:03:03.660> he

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
knife he said this in winter still 11 he

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.160 
knife he said this in winter still 11 he
goes<00:03:04.910> he's<00:03:05.910> confident<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.720> would<00:03:06.810> attack

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
goes he's confident that it would attack

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.500 
goes he's confident that it would attack
any<00:03:08.010> job<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.340> put<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.000> basically<00:03:09.269> that's

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
any job I put it to and basically that's

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.610 
any job I put it to and basically that's
what<00:03:09.660> Rob<00:03:09.870> designed<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.440> for<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.720> that's<00:03:13.380> how

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
what Rob designed it for so that's how

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.970 
what Rob designed it for so that's how
he<00:03:13.680> came<00:03:13.890> up<00:03:13.950> with<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> name<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.610> generalist<00:03:15.980> so

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
he came up with a name to generalist so

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.180 
he came up with a name to generalist so
that's<00:03:17.250> pretty<00:03:17.459> cool

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
that's pretty cool

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.120 
that's pretty cool
overall<00:03:20.190> length<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.560> little<00:03:22.560> under<00:03:22.860> 8

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
overall length is a little under 8

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.740 
overall length is a little under 8
inches<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:24.030> basically<00:03:24.420> about<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.720> same

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
inches so basically about the same

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.979 
inches so basically about the same
length<00:03:25.200> as<00:03:25.760> most<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.970> his<00:03:27.150> knives<00:03:27.450> here<00:03:27.750> as<00:03:27.840> you

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
length as most of his knives here as you

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.949 
length as most of his knives here as you
can<00:03:28.140> see<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.880> blade<00:03:30.120> length<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:30.900> a

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
can see the blade length is just a

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.479 
can see the blade length is just a
little<00:03:31.230> shy<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.280> three<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> half<00:03:32.820> inches<00:03:34.489> he

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
little shy of three and a half inches he

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.460 
little shy of three and a half inches he
did<00:03:35.670> something<00:03:35.940> pretty<00:03:36.030> cool<00:03:36.299> with<00:03:36.570> again<00:03:37.290> he

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
did something pretty cool with again he

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.080 
did something pretty cool with again he
gave<00:03:37.590> us<00:03:37.799> option<00:03:38.220> what<00:03:38.459> do<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.610> want<00:03:38.760> us<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:38.940> do

gave us option what do you want us to do

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.789 
gave us option what do you want us to do
in<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.269> handle<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.989> that's<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> worst<00:03:40.590> thing

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
in a handle and that's the worst thing

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.560 
in a handle and that's the worst thing
you<00:03:40.890> can<00:03:41.010> do<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.670> person<00:03:42.120> like<00:03:42.150> me<00:03:42.390> because

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
you can do to a person like me because

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.619 
you can do to a person like me because
man<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.200> don't<00:03:43.410> know<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.950> don't<00:03:44.579> know<00:03:44.700> I'd<00:03:45.390> rather

man I don't know I don't know I'd rather
let<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.319> this<00:03:46.470> case<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.890> told<00:03:47.069> Rob<00:03:47.280> just<00:03:47.730> Rob

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
let the in this case I told Rob just Rob

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.970 
let the in this case I told Rob just Rob
just<00:03:48.239> do<00:03:48.360> something<00:03:48.569> that<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.770> do

really
would<00:03:50.950> look<00:03:51.099> really<00:03:51.340> good<00:03:51.550> I<00:03:51.760> left<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.150> up<00:03:52.269> to

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
would look really good I left it up to

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.949 
would look really good I left it up to
him<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:53.019> he<00:03:53.110> basically<00:03:53.260> did<00:03:53.769> this<00:03:54.720> he<00:03:55.720> did<00:03:55.900> the

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
him so he basically did this he did the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.610 
tumble wash on this on his hand off you
can<00:04:00.970> see<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.330> it's<00:04:01.720> pretty<00:04:01.989> cool-looking<00:04:02.200> the

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
can see it it's pretty cool-looking the
