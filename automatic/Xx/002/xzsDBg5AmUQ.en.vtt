00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.680
 what's up kids here in general I 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.780
 I extract the tutorial from the application and 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.180
 fruit that is the official application of 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.680
 grand theft auto 5 the gta 5 and this 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.189
 application we can not have only 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.779
 for what is apple it is worth fixing 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.910
 the application that I downloaded for my 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.759
 mobile I 'm going to show you this 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.130
 application has to tune some 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.810
 cars to train our dog and now 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.460
 is the rest you see below is 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.760
 just advertise that if you give yourself 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.589
 takes us directly to the pastor and you 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.680
 makes you go down then the grand theft auto 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.530
 vice sites that put there then they are 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.879
 the games are worth no more 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.500
 then once if we give the 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.790
 holy to see that we have our 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.190
 cars we have those of the three 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.190
 new story characters and we have 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.960
 the one of our online character to fix 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.390
 I'm going to show you an example of franklin that 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.189
 this bike is the green bike is that 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.019
 we stole a mission that then later we 

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:04.119
 Be sure you all know what is 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.270
 I noticed that I challenged that I was 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.509
 yellow with yellow smoke 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.070
 and a little bit the engine I think you can also 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.409
 touch up the license plate you see that I put 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.509
 'genius that is my middle name I know that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.700
 you all know me as a general but 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.219
 well also used the name of news 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.009
 for other things there is a little 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:26.009
 I want to reveal a little bit for when 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.399
 rapeo and others good to see here the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.110
 car online fijaros are rifle 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.969
 bird that is my main car is the one of 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.939
 I write it is the one he always used for 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.679
 that does not go there then to notice that I 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.970
 he had retouched the green bike he had 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.979
 yellow post with yellow smoke 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.119
 It is what you are seeing once 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.530
 do that, it will take a few days 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.209
 update the game to get you out 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.729
 the bike as we have done it or the 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.310
 car or what you want me 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.069
 I teach what I do I did the motorbike 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.200
 note that the green and all six of which 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.840
 but I made yellow with the smoke 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.079
 yellow and also fix the license plate 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.150
 as we get with linux as I said 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.850
 it was already license plates to it's something 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.460
 that is very very handsome since not all 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.030
 world has an apple I know that many 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.430
 I am so much and that's why it annoys me 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.070
 I have this since I have an iphone so 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.920
 I teach and the truth is that the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.390
 license plate is very very handsome now 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.400
 they can be what is the entry part 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.590
 to the dog and then at the end of the video 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.630
 have a thing with a license plate issue 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.940
 I'll tell you later at the end of the video the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.640
 dog's theme should be given to 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.560
 chop and notice that we get this up 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.900
 to the left of the bone that to me 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.630
 comes out transparent in this case is the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.730
 dog happiness 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.680
 happiness is recharged here with this 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.450
 application so then the dog will be 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.560
 happy or will be unhappy in the game to 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.260
 make it happy you have to take it out for a walk 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.000
 what is that you have to give him water too 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.820
 what happens with that and you have to give it 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.700
 eat that is given with the above also 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.520
 we can teach him to do things that is 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.040
 what you will learn later in the game 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.630
 that's why you have to have him here happy 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.330
 taking it out for a walk and so on 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.220
 then in the game do the things that 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.740
 you have taught him here because if not 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.810
 is happy they will tell you the game that no 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.970
 not that it will not make love 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.770
 explain a lot this I want those who 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.950
 what do you have, what do you do not have 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.140
 you are not very interested in knowing how 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.510
 do things that is done from 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.210
 minigames and giving them there in the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.890
 application after you notice that if you are 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.680
 happy down to the right puts happiness 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.960
 is the bar almost to the top and makes 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.850
 things that we say let's go play him 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.560
 we point and go to the square so that 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.000
 you feel the circle so that of the leg 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.280
 and X for him to ask is that I know 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.230
 and here you have the case of the necklace that 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.150
 it is also changed with the application and 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.160
 we can change the color of several 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.500
 colors so the application is us 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.240
 offers to have a little bit our cars that 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.360
 neither offers us a great variety is 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.520
 just tune it out is a bit and then 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.990
 offers us the part of the dog that 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.770
 true that yes it is quite complete 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.120
 since we can do that happy 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.730
 buy a necklace of various colors 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.410
 that there is and then on to teach him three 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.670
 tricks that is to give the leg that feels 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.910
 and ask that the truth is that it is 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.130
 pretty good and nothing helps us 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.870
 much more the application and then the subject 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.760
 of online that told you about license plates 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.560
 is that to me for example personally I do not 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.320
 I go to online and my registration 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.450
 those who are not is not yet know why 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.040
 why if someone knows why because 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.340
 I have a friend that if you want to leave him 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.230
 in online we do not know why he does 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.760
 I do not, but we think it's because 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.890
 you have to delete the application and return it 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.660
 to install that I have not done it but 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.730
 good if someone knows the solution that I 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.060
 Leave a comment that tells me what happens 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.560
 and I will leave 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.479
 in the description so nothing that has 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.039
