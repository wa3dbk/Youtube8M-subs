00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
reason why I did that was because the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
reason why I did that was because the
intake<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.350> came<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:53.039> mean<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> Apple<00:00:54.090> that

intake that came I mean the Apple that

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.639 
intake that came I mean the Apple that
came<00:00:54.680> with<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.860> broke<00:00:56.280> already

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
so yeah I was actually testing out the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.380 
so yeah I was actually testing out the
tube<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.590> put<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> tube<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.059> was<00:01:03.180> trying

it behind the tank and it's kind of like
I<00:01:57.570> don't<00:01:58.200> know<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> little<00:01:59.070> annoying<00:01:59.280> to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.249 
see it back there I guess I could put it
on<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> side<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.329> don't

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
on the side but I don't know I don't

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.840 
on the side but I don't know I don't
have<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> lot<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.710> room<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> desk<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
have a lot of room in the desk here so I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.370 
have a lot of room in the desk here so I
don't<00:02:06.030> want<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.240> put<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> filter<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.200> side

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
don't want to put the filter on the side

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.760 
don't want to put the filter on the side
also<00:02:08.179> but<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.209> don't<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.899> maybe<00:02:10.170> though<00:02:10.470> you

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
also but I don't know maybe though you

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.559 
also but I don't know maybe though you
know<00:02:10.890> once<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.220> rotolo<00:02:11.700> grows<00:02:12.030> which<00:02:12.420> is

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
know once that rotolo grows which is

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.550 
know once that rotolo grows which is
going<00:02:13.080> really<00:02:13.170> slow

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
going really slow

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.190 
going really slow
but<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.099> little<00:02:14.280> story<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.150> no<00:02:15.900> stunts

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
but this little story and no stunts

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.589 
but this little story and no stunts
plans<00:02:16.440> should<00:02:16.709> cover<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.489> shouldn't<00:02:18.480> be

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
plans should cover it and shouldn't be

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.000 
plans should cover it and shouldn't be
too<00:02:19.170> bad

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
too bad

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.680 
too bad
either<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.670> or<00:02:20.730> all<00:02:21.030> gonna<00:02:21.209> get<00:02:21.390> another

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
either that or all gonna get another

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.000 
either that or all gonna get another
white<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.099> white<00:02:23.130> background<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:25.010> don't

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
white like a white background I don't

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.990 
white like a white background I don't
know<00:02:26.069> let<00:02:26.250> me<00:02:26.280> know<00:02:26.370> what<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.640> guys<00:02:26.730> think

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
know let me know what you guys think

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.759 
know let me know what you guys think
also<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:28.280> got<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.580> new<00:02:30.150> bulb<00:02:30.480> for<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:33.260> new<00:02:34.260> 13

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
also I got a new bulb for this new 13

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.729 
also I got a new bulb for this new 13
watt<00:02:34.950> bulb<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.480> think<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> spectrum<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.560> my

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
watt bulb I think the spectrum of my

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.630 
watt bulb I think the spectrum of my
other<00:02:37.890> bulb<00:02:38.160> was<00:02:38.900> starting<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.989> lose<00:02:40.170> its<00:02:40.410> uh

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
other bulb was starting to lose its uh

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.449 
other bulb was starting to lose its uh
strength<00:02:41.640> because<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.510> was<00:02:42.690> getting<00:02:43.230> some<00:02:43.620> hair

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
strength because I was getting some hair

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.309 
strength because I was getting some hair
allergy<00:02:44.880> actually<00:02:45.360> still<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.780> some<00:02:46.080> if<00:02:46.260> you

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
allergy actually still have some if you

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:58.130 
allergy actually still have some if you
can<00:02:46.410> see<00:02:46.769> on<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.910> plan<00:02:56.600> did<00:02:57.600> some<00:02:57.780> research

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
can see on this plan did some research

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.309 
can see on this plan did some research
it<00:02:58.319> says<00:02:58.940> usually<00:02:59.940> get<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.180> when<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:01.200> know

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
it says usually get that when you know

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.199 
it says usually get that when you know
low<00:03:01.530> co2<00:03:01.830> levels<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.910> or<00:03:03.180> not<00:03:03.660> enough<00:03:04.080> flow<00:03:04.349> or

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
low co2 levels and or not enough flow or

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.180 
low co2 levels and or not enough flow or
the<00:03:06.209> spectrum<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.810> lighting<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.380> you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
the spectrum in the lighting that you

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.350 
the spectrum in the lighting that you
have<00:03:08.540> its<00:03:09.540> power<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.730> that's<00:03:11.940> where<00:03:12.150> I'm<00:03:12.239> at

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
have its power so that's where I'm at

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.449 
have its power so that's where I'm at
now<00:03:12.569> I'm<00:03:12.780> gonna<00:03:12.870> wait<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> week<00:03:13.319> actually<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:14.069> fix

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
now I'm gonna wait a week actually I fix

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.759 
now I'm gonna wait a week actually I fix
this<00:03:14.640> on<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.090> weekend<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.650> probably<00:03:16.650> this

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
this on the weekend so probably this

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.099 
this on the weekend so probably this
weekend<00:03:17.250> I'll<00:03:17.430> clean<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.060> attach<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.900> and

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
weekend I'll clean it and attach it and

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.160 
weekend I'll clean it and attach it and
see<00:03:19.650> how<00:03:19.739> see<00:03:20.220> how<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.340> works<00:03:20.780> but<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:21.930> far<00:03:22.109> I

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
see how see how it works but so far I

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.410 
see how see how it works but so far I
really<00:03:22.380> like<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.709> flow<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.220> think<00:03:23.579> this<00:03:23.850> filter

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
really like the flow I think this filter

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.789 
really like the flow I think this filter
is<00:03:24.540> perfect<00:03:24.959> for<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:25.320> tank<00:03:25.500> let<00:03:25.650> me<00:03:25.709> know

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
is perfect for this tank let me know

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.099 
is perfect for this tank let me know
what<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.010> guys<00:03:26.100> think<00:03:26.690> it's<00:03:27.690> things<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.959> do
