00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.849 

mmm<00:00:01.890> calculation<00:00:02.700> shows<00:00:02.970> that<00:00:03.000> that<00:00:03.659> 24<00:00:04.589> by<00:00:04.799> 24

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
mmm calculation shows that that 24 by 24

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.950 
mmm calculation shows that that 24 by 24
by<00:00:05.460> 12<00:00:06.140> the<00:00:07.140> volume<00:00:07.519> of<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.670> square<00:00:08.970> trap<00:00:09.330> would

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
by 12 the volume of a square trap would

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.079 
by 12 the volume of a square trap would
be<00:00:10.139> 4<00:00:10.590> cubic<00:00:11.040> feet<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:12.799> like<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.830> said<00:00:14.370> I'm<00:00:14.580> well

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
be 4 cubic feet so like I said I'm well

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.480 
be 4 cubic feet so like I said I'm well
under<00:00:15.599> 18<00:00:16.049> cubic<00:00:16.320> feet

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
under 18 cubic feet

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.240 
under 18 cubic feet
given<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.060> cloverleaf<00:00:18.480> design<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.380> these

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
given the cloverleaf design of these

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.179 
given the cloverleaf design of these
traps<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.660> I'm<00:00:22.050> gonna<00:00:22.230> go<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> full

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
traps so I'm gonna go with the full

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.540 
traps so I'm gonna go with the full
width<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> roll<00:00:26.119> squared<00:00:27.380> for<00:00:28.380> my<00:00:29.099> top<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
width of the roll squared for my top and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.900 
width of the roll squared for my top and
bottom<00:00:29.849> panels<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.510> I'll<00:00:31.199> make<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.769> depth<00:00:31.980> 12

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
bottom panels and I'll make the depth 12

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.440 
bottom panels and I'll make the depth 12
inches<00:00:33.800> I<00:00:37.670> double-check<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> law<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.210> well

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
inches I double-check the law as well

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.610 
inches I double-check the law as well
and<00:00:41.030> there<00:00:42.030> again<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.480> 18<00:00:42.840> cubic<00:00:43.050> feet<00:00:43.410> for

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and there again it's 18 cubic feet for

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.080 
and there again it's 18 cubic feet for
saltwater<00:00:44.129> perch<00:00:44.460> traps<00:00:45.170> maximum<00:00:46.170> size<00:00:47.090> so

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
saltwater perch traps maximum size so

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.350 
saltwater perch traps maximum size so
I'm<00:00:48.239> well<00:00:48.870> underneath<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:51.239> what

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
I'm well underneath that and that's what

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.200 
I'm well underneath that and that's what
I'm<00:00:51.449> gonna<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.559> go

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.120 

here's<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.960> first<00:00:56.110> panel<00:00:56.500> going<00:00:56.710> in<00:00:56.890> place

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
here's the first panel going in place

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.230 
here's the first panel going in place
side<00:00:57.700> panel

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
side panel

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.960 
side panel
I<00:00:58.270> went<00:00:59.170> went<00:00:59.800> ahead<00:00:59.860> with<00:01:00.160> an<00:01:00.280> 8<00:01:00.520> inch<00:01:00.730> height

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
I went went ahead with an 8 inch height

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.330 
I went went ahead with an 8 inch height
because<00:01:01.540> that's<00:01:02.440> where<00:01:02.620> it<00:01:02.680> cut<00:01:02.860> real<00:01:03.070> clean

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
because that's where it cut real clean

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.470 
because that's where it cut real clean
along<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:04.720> lines<00:01:04.930> there<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.770> see<00:01:06.270> making<00:01:07.270> the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
along the lines there you see making the

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.750 
along the lines there you see making the
best<00:01:07.630> use<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.110> material<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.670> that's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
best use of the material and that's

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.990 
best use of the material and that's
plenty<00:01:10.000> high<00:01:10.270> anyway<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.420> I<00:01:13.480> slept<00:01:13.720> these<00:01:13.930> uh

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
plenty high anyway so I slept these uh

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.710 
plenty high anyway so I slept these uh
hog<00:01:16.000> rings<00:01:16.330> on<00:01:16.690> here<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.520> set<00:01:18.520> my<00:01:18.700> edges<00:01:19.120> and

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
hog rings on here and set my edges and

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.440 
hog rings on here and set my edges and
then<00:01:19.930> I'm<00:01:20.020> gonna<00:01:20.200> go<00:01:20.380> around<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:21.150> zap<00:01:22.150> down

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
then I'm gonna go around and zap down

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.140 
then I'm gonna go around and zap down
the<00:01:22.720> rest<00:01:23.230> of<00:01:23.410> it<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:24.550> once<00:01:24.730> that<00:01:24.880> first

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
the rest of it and once that first

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150 
the rest of it and once that first
panels<00:01:25.510> put<00:01:26.170> down<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.530> rest<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.890> them<00:01:26.980> and<00:01:27.100> go

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
panels put down the rest of them and go

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.600 
panels put down the rest of them and go
in<00:01:27.280> real<00:01:27.490> easy

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
in real easy

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.340 
in real easy
there's<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.880> clothed<00:01:31.270> cloverleaf<00:01:31.900> part

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
there's the clothed cloverleaf part

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.960 
there's the clothed cloverleaf part
completed<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:35.010> next<00:01:36.010> thing<00:01:36.220> I'll<00:01:36.640> put<00:01:36.850> the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
completed and next thing I'll put the

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.870 
completed and next thing I'll put the
bait<00:01:37.119> compartment<00:01:37.720> in<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:37.990> center<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.880> we'll

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
bait compartment in the center and we'll

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.370 
bait compartment in the center and we'll
open<00:01:40.000> those<00:01:40.270> slots<00:01:40.570> up<00:01:40.840> there<00:01:41.050> with<00:01:41.260> the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
open those slots up there with the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.700 
open those slots up there with the
panels<00:01:41.860> join<00:01:42.070> together<00:01:42.220> for<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:43.150> entry

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
panels join together for the the entry

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.000 
panels join together for the the entry
for<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.800> perch<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.160> get<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:46.440> slap<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.560> top<00:01:47.740> on
