 browser and I mean the browser that 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.620
 has by default it 's italy like that 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.630
 from here browser that is basically 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.300
 a world is the default browser on 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.790
 of the operating system android 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.800
 in particular is phone as well 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.660
 came with the chrome browser by 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.130
 defect and can also download from 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.470
 other browsers than in the next 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.930
 Next video is to teach how to set up 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.779
 and install then let's enter here to 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.180
 browser here that we normally enter 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.829
 It appears that a page in this case 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.440
 it looked like a white page but when 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.989
 we open a new page by default 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.110
 will not load it with the home page that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.420
 has been configured at some time 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.190
 how much does an application configure 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.050
 a home page then yes 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.910
 we want to have a page of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.949
 different start for each time 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.960
 Let's open a new page on 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.739
 procedure is very simple we enter 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.559
 here the configuration we enter 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.530
 general here in general we can see which 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.720
 is the one that is configured by default 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.050
 we click here and here we have several 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.460
 options blank page flat 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.830
 default most visited sites u 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.660
 other 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.240
 in this case I do not like to have 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.020
 google home page then let's go 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.020
 here we give google 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.590
 google.com and we will accept it and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.170
 we do here the test amount grams another 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.900
 page should appear no longer in the country 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.500
 but google premium another page 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.790
 it immediately opens me up this time 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.020
 google.com dot com that we 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.540
 We are located in Colombia 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.010
 it's so simple I changed the page 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.440
 start in this cell 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.440
 let's close all these windows 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.180
 by default it gives me a blank but 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.520
 every time I go to open a window 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.620
 new then I will open it with 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.710
 account the home page that I have 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.930
 created or predefined has been simple 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.640
 you can basically define the page 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.080
 start for the next browser 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.660
 by default with the operating system 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.490
