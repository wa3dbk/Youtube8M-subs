00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
all right a little bit quicker Toby one

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.600 
all right a little bit quicker Toby one
and<00:02:07.040> two<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.730> one<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.330> two<00:02:08.960> one<00:02:09.680> and<00:02:09.979> two<00:02:10.369> and

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.780 
and two and one and two one and two and
one<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.150> two<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.320> once<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.800> bring<00:02:13.040> your<00:02:13.280> knees
