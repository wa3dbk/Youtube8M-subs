and<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:03.300> first<00:00:03.570> heard<00:00:03.750> about<00:00:03.870> gt6

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
and I first heard about gt6

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.380 
and I first heard about gt6
I<00:00:04.950> thought<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.759> know<00:00:05.879> what<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> great

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
I thought you know what a great

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.690 
I thought you know what a great
opportunity<00:00:09.679> normally<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> production<00:00:11.280> car

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
opportunity normally on a production car

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.549 
opportunity normally on a production car
or<00:00:11.969> even<00:00:12.000> on<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> show<00:00:12.780> car<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> lot<00:00:13.530> of

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
or even on a show car you have a lot of

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.829 
or even on a show car you have a lot of
restrictions<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.790> for<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.089> first<00:00:15.269> time<00:00:15.599> we

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
restrictions so for the first time we

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.300 
restrictions so for the first time we
didn't<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.470> know<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.770> typical

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
didn't have you know the typical

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.470 
didn't have you know the typical
boundaries<00:00:18.740> we<00:00:19.740> had<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> mix<00:00:20.250> between<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:21.060> very

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
boundaries we had a mix between a very

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.710 
boundaries we had a mix between a very
far<00:00:21.750> away<00:00:21.930> show<00:00:22.800> car<00:00:23.100> design<00:00:23.460> free<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.330> pure

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
far away show car design free and pure

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.250 
far away show car design free and pure
emotion<00:00:25.430> and<00:00:26.430> still<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:27.300> should<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.930> car

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
emotion and still it should be a car

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.979 
emotion and still it should be a car
that<00:00:28.529> reacts<00:00:29.099> realistically<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.269> group

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.680 

I'm<00:00:36.989> frame<00:00:37.380> was<00:00:37.559> very<00:00:37.829> short<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.450> know<00:00:39.570> we

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I'm frame was very short so you know we

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.540 
I'm frame was very short so you know we
had<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> really<00:00:40.260> speed<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.920> all<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
had to really speed it up all the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.330 
had to really speed it up all the
designers<00:00:42.030> started<00:00:42.840> sketching<00:00:43.340> some

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
designers started sketching some

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340 
designers started sketching some
proposals<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.180> great<00:00:45.629> opportunity<00:00:46.320> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
proposals a great opportunity that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.560 
proposals a great opportunity that
computer<00:00:46.980> games<00:00:47.190> give<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.059> doing

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
computer games give you is like doing

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.710 
computer games give you is like doing
stuff<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.110> ever<00:00:49.260> dreamed<00:00:49.620> of

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.850 

while<00:00:54.720> sketching<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.560> excite

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
while sketching you have to excite

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.740 
while sketching you have to excite
yourself<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.640> every<00:00:57.000> line<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.480> every

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
yourself with every line with every

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.660 
yourself with every line with every
every<00:00:58.110> design<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:59.040> to<00:00:59.130> excite<00:00:59.460> all

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
every design you do have to excite all

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.600 
every design you do have to excite all
the<00:00:59.820> others<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.320> chosen<00:01:01.680> by<00:01:02.100> them

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
the others and to get chosen by them

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.280 
the others and to get chosen by them
because<00:01:02.970> they<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.540> most<00:01:03.840> promising

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
because they think this most promising

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.450 
because they think this most promising
one

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
one

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.810 
one
the<00:01:06.970> most<00:01:07.270> stunning<00:01:08.020> aspect<00:01:08.560> of<00:01:08.830> this<00:01:09.340> come<00:01:09.610> is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
the most stunning aspect of this come is

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.310 
the most stunning aspect of this come is
the<00:01:10.360> proportion<00:01:11.080> it<00:01:11.290> is<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:11.890> low<00:01:12.160> so<00:01:12.640> wide<00:01:12.910> and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the proportion it is so low so wide and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.580 
the proportion it is so low so wide and
so<00:01:14.320> fast<00:01:14.740> looking<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:16.270> it's<00:01:16.860> incredible<00:01:19.590> we

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
so fast looking that it's incredible we

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.340 
so fast looking that it's incredible we
have<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.770> really<00:01:20.950> small<00:01:21.570> cabin<00:01:22.570> we<00:01:23.110> have<00:01:23.200> this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
have a really small cabin we have this

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.860 
have a really small cabin we have this
attached<00:01:23.800> really<00:01:24.460> big<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.000> spheric<00:01:25.600> wheels

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
attached really big and spheric wheels

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.620 
attached really big and spheric wheels
which<00:01:26.500> have<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:27.190> smooth<00:01:27.520> blend<00:01:27.790> into<00:01:28.270> all<00:01:28.450> the

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
which have a smooth blend into all the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.500 
which have a smooth blend into all the
other<00:01:28.750> big<00:01:29.050> geometric<00:01:30.010> volumes<00:01:30.430> so<00:01:30.910> after<00:01:31.330> the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
other big geometric volumes so after the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.870 
other big geometric volumes so after the
3d<00:01:31.810> data<00:01:31.990> was<00:01:32.200> generated<00:01:32.370> we<00:01:33.370> looked<00:01:33.550> at<00:01:33.700> it

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
3d data was generated we looked at it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.390 
3d data was generated we looked at it
and<00:01:34.210> we<00:01:34.360> reviewed<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:35.230> and<00:01:35.620> we<00:01:35.830> got<00:01:35.980> to<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.190> stage

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
and we reviewed it and we got to a stage

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.950 
and we reviewed it and we got to a stage
where<00:01:36.610> we<00:01:36.640> liked<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.030> car<00:01:37.210> that's<00:01:37.540> when<00:01:37.810> the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
where we liked the car that's when the

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:49.730 
where we liked the car that's when the
real<00:01:38.140> work<00:01:38.170> begins

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.010 

we<00:01:50.280> start<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.730> an<00:01:50.850> armature<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:51.750> steel

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
we start out with an armature so steel

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.900 
we start out with an armature so steel
frame<00:01:52.320> basically<00:01:52.770> that's<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.980> box<00:01:53.220> frame<00:01:53.550> on

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
frame basically that's a box frame on

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.120 
frame basically that's a box frame on
which<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.480> welded<00:01:54.870> together<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.010> we<00:01:56.100> put

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
which we welded together and then we put

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.790 
which we welded together and then we put
foam<00:01:56.820> underneath<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.960> whole<00:01:58.170> car

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
foam underneath because the whole car

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.179 
foam underneath because the whole car
doesn't<00:01:59.100> need<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.430> played

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
doesn't need to be played

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.919 
doesn't need to be played
if<00:02:01.579> one<00:02:01.759> of<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.880> biggest<00:02:02.210> things<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.509> need<00:02:02.659> is

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
if one of the biggest things in need is

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.529 
if one of the biggest things in need is
just<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.729> personal<00:02:04.729> desire<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.240> have<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.450> have

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
just a personal desire you have to have

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.179 
just a personal desire you have to have
an<00:02:05.630> interest<00:02:05.929> in<00:02:06.079> you<00:02:06.530> want<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.829> see<00:02:06.920> these

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
an interest in you want to see these

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.380 
an interest in you want to see these
cars<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.640> if<00:02:07.729> it's<00:02:07.880> not<00:02:07.999> something<00:02:08.360> that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
cars and if it's not something that

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.240 
cars and if it's not something that
you're<00:02:08.569> passionate<00:02:08.750> about<00:02:09.080> it's<00:02:10.069> gonna<00:02:10.129> be

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
you're passionate about it's gonna be

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.400 
you're passionate about it's gonna be
really<00:02:10.489> difficult<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.900> do<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.170> kind<00:02:12.349> of

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
really difficult to that do the kind of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.289 
really difficult to that do the kind of
level<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.099> detail<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.700> finesse<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.150> you

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
level of detail and finesse that you

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.930 
level of detail and finesse that you
need<00:02:14.510> we<00:02:14.870> started<00:02:15.290> working<00:02:15.560> on<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.310> surfaces

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
need we started working on the surfaces

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.089 
need we started working on the surfaces
we<00:02:17.180> refined<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.900> car<00:02:18.140> we<00:02:18.680> look<00:02:18.860> at<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
we refined the car we look at the
