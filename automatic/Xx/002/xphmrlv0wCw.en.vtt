00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.130
 at the same time giving the Internet of mobile networks 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.480
 you watch the driver show the most interesting 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:14.430
 from the world of gadgets internet and technology 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:16.439
 for a week, the eye channel showed everything for 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.240
 I try sleeves on the Internet rumors 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.080
 the fact that in a short time in Russia can 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.900
 ban google 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.250
 and with it facebook and twitter vavu 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.020
 this somehow ban google what 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.190
 that it is necessary to use Yandex but 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.720
 everything is not so simple it really 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.190
 news about dingir that is to say she is like 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.199
 one side is the other side of her 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.610
 no matter how I explain it now 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.769
 what was our favorite last week 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.780
 control authority for all Roskomnadzor 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.519
 sent by this three service a notification 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.319
 about the need to register in 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.089
 as an organizer of distribution 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:44.159
 Information this concept appeared after 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.539
 introducing a sensational law and bloggers 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.829
 In short, the idea is that all the portals are 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.420
 which users can publish 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.190
 at least some content are 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.899
 distribution organizers 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 Information Well, so by the same law 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.589
 Still, the organizers are obliged to keep on 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.389
 the territory of Russia for six 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.399
 months activity information 

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:01.109
 users keyword on 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.929
 Russian territory violators will 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.280
 blocked already on January 1, 2015 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.110
 accordingly if listed 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.630
 portals will ignore the requirement 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.310
 there will be a formal reason to ban them 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.659
 google and companies are certainly no fights to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.939
 lose a million Russian market and 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.530
 replacing a dozen new servers so 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.700
 most likely the requirement is met by 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.409
 at least you want to believe it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.270
 somehow reluctant to load yourself with a system 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.740
 proxies and vpn-s so everything seems to be not 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.570
 as scary as it seemed on the other 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.469
 hand one more nasty little bell 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.820
 there is now something more positive and 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.390
 very soon in mid-October 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.560
 official announcement is expected new 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.299
 Google may however happen 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.399
 that guglofonov will be several networks 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.020
 there were details regarding 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.969
 a device called nexus x 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.409
 likely to say frankly 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.960
 pleases 13 megapixel camera 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.460
 snapdragon 805 battery processor on 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.289
 3200 milliampere hours 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.609
 hd resolution supposedly 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.590
 the company is engaged in production 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.140
 motorola gadget will look like 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.020
 seriously grown up moto x diagonal 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.789
 the smartphone consists 5 9 inches that is 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.679
 Essentially we are dealing with the first peacock 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.090
 nexus of ruler and I'm not sure what it is 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.770
 well and however it is possible that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.659
 at the same time the largest will be 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.210
 presented apparatus and the usual sizes 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.979
 nexus 6 but this is not a fact at all 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.510
 case, we will know the whole truth already in 15 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.260
 the dates of October so watch 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.519

 friday 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.769
 apple gave a few reasons to talk 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.269
 about a company that was famous 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.290
 harmonious combination of your own 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.620
 managed it on two of these 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.940
 direction and so requests of people with 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.150
 weak psyche and pregnant women 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.230

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.190
 oedipus the funny thing is 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.629
 that the owners of iphone 5s and below in general 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.190

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.470
 rising around apple production 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.910
 last week it all started a few 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.430
 publications in which it was reported that 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.769

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.150
 becomes not very smooth in fact 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.650
 it's more like a question from 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.599
 competitors below blame the real problem 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.730

 make some shots the owners don't 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.360
 everything determines the position of the owner 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.250
 finds a face and makes sure that 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.600

 but he has already reached the final of the competition and 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.470
 the guys assembled a working prototype on the base 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.690
 intel iddis chip so it's quite possible 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.500
 the novelty will soon appear on kickstarter 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.030
 then on sale 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.770
 Generally from all robots quadrocopter 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.790
 have proven themselves the best pair 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.860
 already do any 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.660
 intelligent flying assistant that knew how 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.380
 take off delivering loads and also myself 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.550
 walking a dog 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.259
 some manufacturers for example the same 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.789
 samsung offer watches with features 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.520
 smartphone but the device called 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.440
 the portal is more like a smartphone with features 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.330
 wrist watches guys from california 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.460
 startups Rubix decided not to waste time on trifles and 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.560
 stupidly put on a hand a hefty smartphone 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.539
 with a 6 inch screen for this 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.039
 it took two watchbands as well 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.870
 flexible case and screen 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.220
 so that the device clings to the hand 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.900
 something like a communicator from the movies 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.030
 about the future may be just that 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.710
 there must be a really smart watch 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.440
 as for the filling inside will stand 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.180
 two giga RAM batteries for 3200 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.190
 milliamper hours some cool 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.930
 processor also bluetooth module ltd 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.610
 wi-fi and of course not without 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.530
 sensors to measure the pulse and 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.060
 physical activity once already blades 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.919
 all the same on your hand, let everything count and 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.720
 monitor and besides smartphone 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.819
 the watch is protected from moisture and dust 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.500
 and from blows it is also important for 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.419
 wearable electronics yet the project is not 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.979
 very vigorously started on the site of Andy 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.690
 calvary scored a little more than ten 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.220
 percent of the required amount but something 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.110
 tells me that with the development of flexible 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.229
 screens of similar hybrids will be all 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.229
 more 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.570
 and the third disappears again worn hand on 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.950
 This time the bracelet that serves 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.360
 a kind of key to all doors 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.710
 bracelet called nume 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.810
 they are interested in such famous 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.000
 companies like stealth force and master card 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.890
 invested in the project about 14 million 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.690
 dollars the main thing is that the bracelet 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.470
 he can shoot 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.480
 electrocardiogram then use 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.430
 her to identify the owner that is 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.350
 apparently purity of heartbeat and amplitude 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.460
 in humans it is also a unique parameter 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.440
 I personally think that this method 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.480
 identification is not very obvious if 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.580
 pulse jumped for example after running or 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.260
 fell below normal as in this case 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.270
 The device will go east to the window and 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.190
 realizes that he is the hands of his owner 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.990
 just begins to serve in this way 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.670
 universal car key 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.800
 electronic locks can even be with him 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.120
 pay for purchases through nfc and more 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.620
 use as a remote for 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.120
 control technology at least many 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.100
 users including me and arise 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.320
 questions on this cunning identification by 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.720
 pulse nevertheless device pre-ordered 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.400
 10,000 people and investors are not 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.400
 fools won how many millions in bukhara 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.169
 well, for a snack skate power station under 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.060
 the name of the cup was created by the designer from 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.650
 the netherlands in fact is an ordinary skate in 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.879
 there is no electric but there is 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.620
 built-in battery which 

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:32.180
 charging while riding and 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.499
 really don't care why 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.120
 you don't produce a little while 

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:37.310
 electricity which should be enough for 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.930
 8 charge of the same iPhone or for 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.729
 listening to music for this skate 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.259
