reading<00:02:08.509> them<00:02:08.570> but<00:02:08.750> do<00:02:09.229> yourself<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.710> favor

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
reading them but do yourself a favor

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.350 
reading them but do yourself a favor
because<00:02:10.190> there<00:02:10.429> are<00:02:10.490> a<00:02:10.520> few<00:02:10.640> options<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.239> need

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
because there are a few options you need

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.140 
because there are a few options you need
to<00:02:11.480> consider<00:02:11.840> based<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.010> design<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.790> your

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
to consider based on the design of your

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.569 
to consider based on the design of your
compartment<00:02:14.689> door<00:02:14.900> as<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.799> exists<00:02:16.220> right<00:02:16.280> now

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
compartment door as it exists right now

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.270 
compartment door as it exists right now
in<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.569> kit<00:02:17.810> you'll<00:02:17.989> find<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.470> actual<00:02:18.829> spring

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
in the kit you'll find the actual spring

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.339 
in the kit you'll find the actual spring
itself<00:02:19.730> now<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.090> air<00:02:20.299> spring<00:02:20.689> is<00:02:20.900> designed

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
itself now the air spring is designed

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.119 
itself now the air spring is designed
it's<00:02:22.220> pre<00:02:22.459> pressurized<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:24.079> want<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.010> keep

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
it's pre pressurized you want to keep

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.649 
it's pre pressurized you want to keep
this<00:02:25.280> away<00:02:25.459> from<00:02:25.790> heat<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.180> certainly<00:02:26.510> don't

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
this away from heat you certainly don't

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.899 
this away from heat you certainly don't
want<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.959> try<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.319> open<00:02:27.439> this<00:02:27.709> device<00:02:28.069> but<00:02:28.790> as

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
want to try and open this device but as

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.750 
want to try and open this device but as
you<00:02:29.030> compress<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.510> spring<00:02:30.129> in<00:02:31.129> the<00:02:31.280> relaxed

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
you compress the spring in the relaxed

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.399 
you compress the spring in the relaxed
form<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.209> door<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.599> open<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.049> then<00:02:33.200> when<00:02:33.319> you

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
form the door is open and then when you

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.589 
form the door is open and then when you
close<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.920> door<00:02:34.159> the<00:02:34.790> spring<00:02:35.120> becomes

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
close the door the spring becomes

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.410 
close the door the spring becomes
compressed<00:02:36.590> like<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.790> that's<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.180> heart

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
compressed like that so that's the heart

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.990 
compressed like that so that's the heart
of<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.689> system<00:02:38.900> also<00:02:39.500> with<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.189> kit<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.819> get

installation over a larger surface of
the<00:03:53.690> dorsum<00:03:54.260> compartment<00:03:54.859> doors<00:03:55.010> are<00:03:55.220> pretty

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
the dorsum compartment doors are pretty

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.520 
the dorsum compartment doors are pretty
fragile<00:03:55.699> and<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:56.599> need<00:03:56.780> some<00:03:57.019> extra<00:03:57.260> support

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
fragile and you need some extra support

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.250 
fragile and you need some extra support
so<00:03:58.069> you'll<00:03:58.519> be<00:03:58.669> actually<00:03:59.030> mounting<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.810> top

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
so you'll be actually mounting the top
