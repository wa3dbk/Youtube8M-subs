teach<00:00:07.750> you<00:00:07.779> how<00:00:08.200> to<00:00:08.230> make<00:00:08.500> your<00:00:08.740> Evie<00:00:09.190> through

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
teach you how to make your Evie through

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.759 
teach you how to make your Evie through
robot<00:00:09.820> stay<00:00:10.150> a<00:00:10.330> certain<00:00:10.870> distance<00:00:11.080> away<00:00:11.650> from

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
robot stay a certain distance away from

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.100 
robot stay a certain distance away from
the<00:00:11.980> keyboard<00:00:12.280> so<00:00:13.269> first<00:00:13.540> you're<00:00:13.690> going<00:00:13.809> to<00:00:13.990> go

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
the keyboard so first you're going to go

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.820 
the keyboard so first you're going to go
into<00:00:14.320> flow<00:00:14.620> control<00:00:15.130> and<00:00:15.160> select<00:00:15.759> a<00:00:15.910> loop

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
into flow control and select a loop

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.769 
into flow control and select a loop
I'd<00:00:17.830> recommend<00:00:18.340> making<00:00:18.880> it<00:00:19.000> bigger<00:00:19.210> because

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
I'd recommend making it bigger because

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.230 
I'd recommend making it bigger because
it<00:00:20.170> makes<00:00:20.380> it<00:00:20.470> way<00:00:20.619> easier<00:00:20.910> then<00:00:21.910> you're<00:00:22.060> going

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
it makes it way easier then you're going

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.820 
it makes it way easier then you're going
to<00:00:22.330> go<00:00:22.449> into<00:00:22.689> sensors<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:23.410> select<00:00:23.710> the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
to go into sensors and select the

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.570 
to go into sensors and select the
ultrasonic<00:00:24.519> sensor<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.830> will<00:00:27.010> need<00:00:27.279> teams

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
ultrasonic sensor you will need teams

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.320 
ultrasonic sensor you will need teams
add<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.500> your<00:00:29.529> robot<00:00:29.890> otherwise<00:00:30.849> it<00:00:31.179> will

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
add that to your robot otherwise it will

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.299 
add that to your robot otherwise it will
not<00:00:31.390> work<00:00:31.539> then<00:00:32.529> you're<00:00:32.710> going<00:00:32.860> to<00:00:33.010> go<00:00:33.100> into

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
not work then you're going to go into

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.820 
not work then you're going to go into
data<00:00:33.489> operations<00:00:34.210> you<00:00:34.989> need<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.320> select<00:00:35.620> the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
data operations you need to select the

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.820 
data operations you need to select the
great<00:00:36.040> news<00:00:36.220> button<00:00:37.229> you<00:00:38.229> need<00:00:38.409> to<00:00:38.620> change

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
great news button you need to change

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.439 
great news button you need to change
this<00:00:39.220> to<00:00:39.610> Tenten<00:00:40.000> and<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.830> 20<00:00:42.449> therefore

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
this to Tenten and this to 20 therefore

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.799 
this to Tenten and this to 20 therefore
it'll<00:00:44.140> stay<00:00:44.440> in<00:00:44.970> between<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.089> distance<00:00:46.479> of<00:00:46.600> 10

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
it'll stay in between the distance of 10

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.410 
it'll stay in between the distance of 10
and<00:00:46.989> 20<00:00:47.290> centimeters<00:00:47.589> between<00:00:48.180> away<00:00:49.180> from

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
and 20 centimeters between away from

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.469 
and 20 centimeters between away from
your<00:00:49.600> keyboard<00:00:49.839> then<00:00:50.940> you're<00:00:51.940> going<00:00:52.150> to<00:00:52.269> go

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
your keyboard then you're going to go

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.859 
your keyboard then you're going to go
into<00:00:52.809> flow<00:00:53.019> control<00:00:53.970> you<00:00:54.970> need<00:00:55.119> to<00:00:55.360> select<00:00:55.659> the

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
into flow control you need to select the

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:04.890 
into flow control you need to select the
switch<00:00:59.610> like<00:01:01.260> ok<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:02.470> then<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:04.449> go<00:01:04.629> back

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
switch like ok so then and you go back

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.190 
switch like ok so then and you go back
into<00:01:05.110> action<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:06.520> select<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:07.479> move<00:01:07.720> tanks

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
into action and you select to move tanks

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.840 
into action and you select to move tanks
to<00:01:08.410> put<00:01:08.680> there<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.430> first<00:01:12.640> one

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
to put there and there the first one

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.330 
to put there and there the first one
will<00:01:13.330> turn<00:01:13.690> it<00:01:13.870> on<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.830> second<00:01:15.220> one<00:01:15.310> you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
will turn it on and the second one you

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.910 
will turn it on and the second one you
need<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:15.790> turn<00:01:15.970> it<00:01:16.090> off<00:01:16.240> then<00:01:17.170> it'll<00:01:17.560> stop<00:01:17.890> when

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
need to turn it off then it'll stop when

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.060 
need to turn it off then it'll stop when
it<00:01:18.520> gets<00:01:18.820> too<00:01:19.600> close<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.190> cuboid<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:23.290> you

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
it gets too close to the cuboid then you

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.120 
it gets too close to the cuboid then you
need<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.400> go<00:01:24.580> back<00:01:24.850> here<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.450> change<00:01:26.440> this<00:01:26.830> to

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
need to go back here and change this to

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.190 
need to go back here and change this to
logic

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
logic

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.859 
logic
and<00:01:29.289> then<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.460> last<00:01:30.640> step<00:01:30.939> is<00:01:31.600> you're<00:01:31.840> going

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
and then the last step is you're going

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.490 
and then the last step is you're going
to<00:01:32.259> take<00:01:32.890> this<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.430> drag<00:01:33.969> it<00:01:34.030> there<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.570> this

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
to take this and drag it there and this

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.350 
to take this and drag it there and this
one<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:36.310> there<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:39.159> you're<00:01:39.369> done<00:01:39.549> make

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
one to there and then you're done make

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.369 
one to there and then you're done make
sure<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.719> download<00:01:40.869> it<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.289> your<00:01:41.320> Oh<00:01:41.469> bot<00:01:41.829> bye
