00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 and now we are going to fool you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.340
 balls 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.670
 for this we take the ball 10 or 12 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.670
 inches 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:23.420
 cut paste stick 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.939
 9 mm. 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.120
 ok she come 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:34.110
 we tied the ribbon now put on 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:36.650
 we are selling the balloon and accordingly now 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.650
 we had 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:19.450
 finally you blow a little 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.340
 close the cylinder so as not to tear 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:29.020
 and this step because if complete 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.959
 the balloon then the pressure can burst even 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.890
 an interesting moment when we inflate in the summer 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.880
 all you room we go out into the cold 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:46.709
 Coke on put the ball is inflated why 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:57.570
 significantly very very strong and only 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:57.570
 you go warm room tie 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:07.920
 consider so here we lean 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.920
 ribbon 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.629
 we twist the ball we twist the ball and 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.680
 tying up 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.820
 you do it 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:34.220
 and it turns out such a foil ball 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.220
 Velcro
