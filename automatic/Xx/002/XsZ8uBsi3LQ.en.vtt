to try out these new Auto flaggers and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.670 
to try out these new Auto flaggers and
see<00:01:08.580> how<00:01:08.760> they<00:01:09.630> would<00:01:09.720> work<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> field

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
see how they would work out in the field

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
see how they would work out in the field
and<00:01:10.950> how<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.159> would<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.670> them<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.570> really

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and how we would like them we really

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.109 
and how we would like them we really
like<00:01:13.140> them<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> guys<00:01:14.460> off<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.939> road

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
like them you get the guys off the road

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.609 
like them you get the guys off the road
that<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.360> actually<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:16.049> there<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that are actually out there with the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.770 
that are actually out there with the
Flagstaff's<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.700> could<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.000> actually<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
Flagstaff's you could be actually in a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.870 
Flagstaff's you could be actually in a
vehicle<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.470> could<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.770> away<00:01:20.580> from<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
vehicle and you could be away from the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.539 
vehicle and you could be away from the
traffic<00:01:21.119> when<00:01:22.020> vehicles<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.770> coming<00:01:22.830> by<00:01:23.220> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
traffic when vehicles are coming by and

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.570 
traffic when vehicles are coming by and
I<00:01:23.729> think<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.270> big<00:01:24.750> safety<00:01:25.259> benefit<00:01:26.100> for

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
I think it's a big safety benefit for

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.510 
I think it's a big safety benefit for
our<00:01:26.700> guys<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> Auto<00:01:28.170> flaggers<00:01:28.710> we

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
our guys to have the Auto flaggers we

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
our guys to have the Auto flaggers we
hear<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> time<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.780> people<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.439> see

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
hear all the time that people don't see

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.640 
hear all the time that people don't see
us<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.520> blend<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> background<00:01:33.650> well

us we blend in with the background well
the<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.130> Auto<00:01:35.280> flaggers<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> big<00:01:36.420> machine

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the the Auto flaggers are a big machine

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.390 
the the Auto flaggers are a big machine
sitting<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> side<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> road<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
sitting on the side of the road and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.399 
sitting on the side of the road and
people<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:39.180> them<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.390> long<00:01:39.570> ways<00:01:39.810> off<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
people see them a long ways off with the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.679 
people see them a long ways off with the
lights<00:01:40.619> flashing<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
lights flashing but I think they see a

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.319 
lights flashing but I think they see a
four<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.979> two<00:01:44.189> different<00:01:44.579> styles<00:01:44.790> here

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
four we have two different styles here

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
four we have two different styles here
one's<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.259> wider<00:01:46.500> than<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.950> other

one's a little bit wider than the other

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.219 
one's a little bit wider than the other
other<00:01:47.430> one<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.390> need<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.869> bit<00:01:49.020> wider

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
other one so you need a little bit wider

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.319 
other one so you need a little bit wider

you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.320> get<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.530> off<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.979> smaller<00:01:59.549> shoulder

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
you can get it off on a smaller shoulder

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.330 
you can get it off on a smaller shoulder
you<00:02:00.719> know<00:02:00.750> you're<00:02:00.990> kind<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.380> sitting<00:02:02.219> duck
