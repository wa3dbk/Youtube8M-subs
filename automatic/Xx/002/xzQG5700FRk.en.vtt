00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 the straw button to make the complete we see more still this with real 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.210
 he would talk to us now as well 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.559
 here on the opposite side 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:10.989
 represent for them 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:13.909
 So press back and we start now 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.909
 to designate this 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.160
 since Bahia and takes two more law once speaks the foot approach 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.910
 Internet does not pull and these of course still have to move now 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.559
 however, first of all, all of the changes in the environment send me back our objects 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.250
 I see that note on it 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.470
 and that would be 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.480
 yes then our other side of the little one 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.120
 14 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.080
 the right leg and the left leg to the countries for now, first of all 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.730
 told 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.490
 turn can 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.430
 so 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.430
 l Schilling's Bund Rheine 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.440
 then 11 CNY 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.200
 and 1 USD 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.790
 and at the end, of course, percent c 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.170
 because of the 4th 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.659
 The loser, of course, now also counted one day later 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.720
 on 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 DAPD 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.090
 Großhans 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.090
 then pull to the right 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.770
 because our right foot 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.610
 and clarify legally so uses will we will this for our 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.010
 so gates cover the man's connection here in the basin and so cover 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.010
 our ranks and just in 1 10 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.780
 and here too 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.700
 we can delete the two red again 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.620
 the grandparents fold 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.520
 and now we still have the rounds 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.660
 our two 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.510
 not worth much for us you see her 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.750
 not quite the whole hour so they will be off 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.859
 for that the two knees select again with folk 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.549
 we can clarify several cases and then we will do this a little bit 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.739
 move forward 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.299
 the feet have to be natural now 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.169
 to the rear 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.169
 was not aware who my little more approach 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.799
 and the toes 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.679
 meanwhile affects her 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.679
 of course, very forward 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.299
 and so 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.299
 and the law is ready as far as we can see 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:46.019
 that looks very vivid and that is of course now our objects say 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.209
 that is climbs yes that belongs that the Tories access this object 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.430
 may speak that if we should move a position that 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.879
 this will prevent the object from changing its arm speaks to 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:59.910
 Apple moves 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.310
 The train of course, first of all, our moped went a direction if 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.919
 I discovered one direction but only once 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.629
 and this is called Direction and I've been to another project before 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.179
 the direction shown there is not yet as old as age at age 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:20.159
 Matured on a certain surface and the whole thing runs in a similar way 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.900
 the last round in our attributes window 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.289
 we have the faithful 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.539
 you would only be the great laid and here we all great 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:33.919
 finance the accrued also have this property and the inheritance and fair all 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.059
 Of course, now the cool take everything will open again 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:40.489
 had unknown offenders 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.659
 he did not confuse animals here the pelvis that Roth the grotesquely a joint 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.110
 but an object the pelvis is considered the first joint and we are now using 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.180
 Lufthansa's head 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.700
 select and thus we have 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.469
 all proudly declared 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.469
 and he could do it now 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.060
 Briefing time will be 17 and quite simply all tours will go into these 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.059
 Dialog no 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.139
 and like Semenya 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.519
 the painter transfer 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:10.480
 and now 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.719
 we can here 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.179
 of course, close this again 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:16.379
 fold a-tec 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:19.449
 and Wikipedia easily on car direction 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.939
 and then that would be completely outlandish 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.449
 as this forum here a finger Beck speaks that ever dreamed 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.999
 to act on this object we can imagine ourselves here quite simply 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.819
 and draw this into our figure 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:37.749
 and then the friendship act Tatort and I will show only once 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:39.949
 what happened to the example 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.740
 to write that down 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.849
 we see so 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.759
 the whole 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.369
 whether moves will be complete and that what we wanted and I lost 

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:54.189
 car values ​​clicked on me in a very fine way too 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.020
 and defined in our coach Klopp dialogue or church towers 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.259
 the light and tools 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.370
 and we are here now if we have any point on Velen 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.300
 Jens Lehmann will get that one easier 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.280
 they have the complete object Schwartz except, of course, the 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.050
 authorize selected Munich NIM Othmar to simplify 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.470
 for example 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.159
 the right arm 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.710
 and then we are here 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.970
 have this area 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.310
 is proving and everything else is despised and the whole course is natural i 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.560
 yes also in Karow to these black over and that is actually the 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.440
 Sighting of which I have rescued speak all things very much FIFA 11 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.640
 In this area, Dr Dr Joint has a very strong access to everything Kraus 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.280
 There was one less 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.060
 a lesser charge and maybe fry fat was not a goal 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.240
 and of course I can show for example now 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.840
 by using scrub around with depressed control plaster here 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.150
 Just paint over began to paint on it 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.059
 and of course now 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.249
 time our joint 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:02.809
 move 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:05.979
 then we'll see that the whole thing is hanging so we have that too 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.490
 Possibility to determine how strong around 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.150
 the world will have from 4 4 to the area 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.980
 and because it's about a click with the car density 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.129
 the best possibility 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:17.610
 for the simple reason 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.539
 just like the Irishman 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.680
 take this direction 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.840
 as well as it can be very difficult with this the clean transition and 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.599
 percent 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.389
 we had had no justification but we can go hunting for goals 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.939
 the whole thing after three years 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:42.939
 in a new folder 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.599
 SZ 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:48.550
 and I'll go the name 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.460
 the birth of Groitzsch we say we have all the time through the networked world 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.349
 given 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:59.059
 and that on the massive part to gates and again to his next 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:00.839
 Days already how can we 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.770
 animating this object speaks for example to make it work
