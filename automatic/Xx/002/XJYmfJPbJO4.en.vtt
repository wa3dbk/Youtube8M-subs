00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.680
 Shrub of medium or large size, the most widespread species in Italy is the pitosforo tobira 

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:28.252
 it has evergreen, spatula-shaped leaves that develop into bunches, shiny and slightly leathery 

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:36.027
 it is a rustic and vigorous shrub, which tends to adapt even in non-ideal cultivation conditions 

00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:45.071
 In any case it is advisable to place the pitosforo in a very sunny place, preferring rich and deep soils 

00:00:46.217 --> 00:00:51.217
 very well drained, as the excesses of water tend to favor the development of root rots 

00:01:28.456 --> 00:01:33.456
 let's avoid watering the plant excessively, but in any case let's intervene with watering during the hottest months of the year 

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:39.801
 especially in the case of specimens grown in pots or during periods of particular drought 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 The plant produces tiny flowers, at the apex of the branches, delicately scented 

00:01:57.665 --> 00:02:05.660
 pruning takes place after flowering, shortening the entire foliage by about a third, in order to make the shrub more dense and compact
