00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.110
 sometimes I think that if patients are 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.630
 will fix inside of me see what I think 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.410
 they would run out of the office not 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.410
 I would never go back 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.890
 they told me that you are better thank you 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.770
 but I really believe that in this 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.340
 profession the best is a matter of 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.340
 personal opinion 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.360
 the night Andre gave me an ultimatum or 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.190
 we got married or separated we do not understand 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.900
 why does it come to me to press justly 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.800
 now for this topic we never talk about 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.900
 get married 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.460
 I have still not long ago is 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.110
 interesting because you never mentioned it 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.140
 here we are going to say that you did not 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.140
 account 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.520
 I'm in love with you 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.390
 I am your analyst I am not an option 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.820
 real 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.970
 if I will refer to each of the 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.800
 patients for which at some time 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.100
 I felt attracted I would be left without 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.850
 patients 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.850
 I recognized myself 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.930
 a police expert in explosives that 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.640
 they secured deposit several families 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.640
 dead long prisoner 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.710
 explosives expert 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.420
 of average degree perverse sitting 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.909
 in front of a guy like me 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.920
 that you know comes from flying a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.470
 barn through the air I slept well 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.759
 perfectly with the conscience 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.670
 quiet of work right the best 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.439
 possible there are sessions where I have 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.430
 have to make a very big effort to not 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.549
 get an outburst in front of the patient 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.340
 we think clearly I have 17 years study of 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.689
 Classical dance since I was 6 I'm an only child 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.920
 within two months the contest begins 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.420
 to enter the stable ballet of 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.650
 theater 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.650
 and on my last chance 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.190
 my mom thought it would be good if 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.110
 speak with you 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.090
 for you to evaluate me if there was something in 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.460
 the accident that justifies you 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.350
 have to make an evaluation think 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.050
 of trying to kill me because of the pressures 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.880
 of the ballet years ago that I under pressure 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.500
 and she never supports me comes so that 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.620
 follow a report that says everything is 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.120
 well i'm fine 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.290
 I'm not a crazy person who's out there 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.799
 throwing themselves against the cars 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.319
 You do not feel like I'm seeing us 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.749
 attending to a couple 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.909
 some weeks they have a guy and he makes 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:36.510
 five years are trying to have another 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.459
 when they stop trying 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.930
 she gets pregnant I'm not sure 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.150
 want to continue with this pregnancy 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.269
 so I want to hear something clear and 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.799
 concrete to your yes abortion not so much 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.019
 disappointments by not continuing to be 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.439
 your faithful disciple for the rest of the 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.329
 you gave him to supervise cases in this 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:59.069
 as a friend I do not know where to put my 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:02.340
 I do not know, I did not know who to consult 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.159
 every time you talk about sabrina if you put 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.859
 sad I do not even know where the 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.129
 most of the time you have to start 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:14.069
 to think about the possibility of deriving 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.769
 marine to another therapist I will not derive 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.719
 to marina to no other therapist yo 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.770
 I can handle anything that happens 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:25.949
 in therapy for that I am here or not 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.949
 [Music]
