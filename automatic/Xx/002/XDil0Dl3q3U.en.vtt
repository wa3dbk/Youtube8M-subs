00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
then glue the pattern right on top take

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.360 
then glue the pattern right on top take
your<00:01:07.810> next<00:01:08.050> layer<00:01:08.230> and<00:01:08.590> just<00:01:08.620> place<00:01:09.040> it<00:01:09.070> right

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
your next layer and just place it right

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.410 
your next layer and just place it right
on<00:01:09.430> top<00:01:10.920> press<00:01:11.920> it<00:01:12.100> down<00:01:14.730> and<00:01:15.730> repeat<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.240> same

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
on top press it down and repeat the same

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.210 
on top press it down and repeat the same
step<00:01:18.660> take<00:01:19.660> your<00:01:19.810> last<00:01:20.020> layer<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.920> one<00:01:21.070> with

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
step take your last layer the one with

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.040 
step take your last layer the one with
the<00:01:21.340> pattern<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:21.910> place<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:22.330> right<00:01:22.600> on<00:01:22.660> top

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
the pattern and place it right on top

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.750 
the pattern and place it right on top
push<00:01:26.050> it<00:01:26.230> down<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:26.830> it's<00:01:27.040> nice<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.550> smooth<00:01:28.060> and

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
push it down so it's nice and smooth and

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.250 
push it down so it's nice and smooth and
with<00:01:30.760> this<00:01:30.970> project<00:01:31.480> we're<00:01:31.690> actually<00:01:31.900> going

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
with this project we're actually going

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.440 
with this project we're actually going
to<00:01:32.350> work<00:01:32.950> with<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.370> glue<00:01:33.670> when<00:01:33.909> it's<00:01:34.030> wet<00:01:34.420> you

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
to work with the glue when it's wet you

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.270 
to work with the glue when it's wet you
want<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.930> take<00:01:35.110> your<00:01:35.260> scissors<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.710> carefully

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
want to take your scissors and carefully

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.850 
want to take your scissors and carefully
cut<00:01:36.460> out<00:01:36.640> your<00:01:36.850> shape<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.470> then<00:01:38.470> we<00:01:38.680> will

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
cut out your shape and then we will

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.760 
cut out your shape and then we will
start<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.880> shape<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.470> once<00:01:41.470> you're<00:01:41.650> done

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
start to shape it once you're done

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.200 
start to shape it once you're done
cutting<00:01:41.980> out<00:01:42.220> your<00:01:42.250> pattern<00:01:42.580> you<00:01:42.790> want<00:01:43.060> to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
cutting out your pattern you want to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:51.930 
cutting out your pattern you want to
punch<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.540> hole<00:01:43.570> at<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.020> top<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:50.820> while<00:01:51.820> the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
punch a hole at the top and while the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.340 
punch a hole at the top and while the
glue<00:01:52.120> is<00:01:52.150> still<00:01:52.330> wet<00:01:52.600> we're<00:01:53.020> going<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.200> begin

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
glue is still wet we're going to begin

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.140 
glue is still wet we're going to begin
to<00:01:53.680> shape<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:54.430> I'm<00:01:54.610> just<00:01:54.760> going<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:54.940> take<00:01:55.120> a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
to shape it so I'm just going to take a

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.719 
to shape it so I'm just going to take a
pencil<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.690> kind<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.620> wrap<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:57.040> around<00:01:57.130> very

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
pencil and kind of wrap it around very

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.880 
pencil and kind of wrap it around very
carefully<00:01:59.250> go<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.580> way<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:02.530> top<00:02:02.650> it<00:02:02.680> gives

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
carefully go this way just top it gives

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.100 
carefully go this way just top it gives
it<00:02:03.100> some<00:02:03.250> dimension<00:02:03.400> so<00:02:04.120> it's<00:02:04.270> not<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:04.870> a

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
it some dimension so it's not just a

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.090 
it some dimension so it's not just a
flat<00:02:05.890> anchor<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.750> can<00:02:07.960> keep<00:02:08.530> working<00:02:08.950> at

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
flat anchor and you can keep working at

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.510 
flat anchor and you can keep working at
it<00:02:09.130> kind<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.700> pinch<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.680> sides<00:02:11.680> like<00:02:12.069> this

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
it kind of pinch the sides like this

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.600 
it kind of pinch the sides like this
and<00:02:13.180> it's<00:02:13.510> gonna<00:02:13.690> look<00:02:14.020> like

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and it's gonna look like

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.980 
and it's gonna look like
when<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.030> dries<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.600> once<00:02:15.810> you're<00:02:15.960> done

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
when it dries so once you're done

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.170 
when it dries so once you're done
shaping<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.680> want<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.920> let<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.160> dry<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.700> it

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
shaping it you want to let it dry and it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.210 
shaping it you want to let it dry and it
gets<00:02:18.420> really<00:02:18.690> hard<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.950> what<00:02:20.100> you're

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
gets really hard so this is what you're

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.130 
gets really hard so this is what you're
