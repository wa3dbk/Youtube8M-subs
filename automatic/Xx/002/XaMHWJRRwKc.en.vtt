00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.010
 but before 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.010
 I do not 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.430
 some time ago in 23 years 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.410
 through a decree 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.750
 for example 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:15.120
 dam or this huaca will be inside 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.330
 of a national park that has the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.260
 name of a lady who cared 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.370
 A lot that died not long ago was 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:30.580
 native to a man 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:34.190
 also approached our province 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.730
 she was called vintages neighborhoods then 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.040
 they gave him the name the decree gave him the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.880
 amenÃ¡bar's name has worried a lot 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.740
 for the cut of by tourism 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.810
 and that 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:55.060
 this type of 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.060
 I have the caves 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.700
 the natural things then 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.700
 to preserve these places 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.220
 already 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.220
 in good shape by institutional 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.400
 and that's what I think 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.400
 and we are even fighting 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.200
 us what we worry about this 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.230
 the quotes yesterday in measuring we are 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.240
 struggling because that 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.060
 you arrive 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.630
 To make 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.680
 we managed to start making a 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.849
 ecotourism project well finished for 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.719
 what 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:46.440
 the province that has a place that 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:49.020
 we not only 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.250
 enjoy 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.810
 at the level of vacations and things like that 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.460
 study it also so that we had 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.479
 our history and our archeology 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.479
 very valuable
