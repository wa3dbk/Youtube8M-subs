00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello everyone thinking a few can 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.620
 bragging about trying dried 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.440
 watermelons 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.840
 watermelons can actually be dried and what 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.179
 i am going to do today i am 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.809
 I will test my electric dryer 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.809
 izidri 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.930
 on how she can handle the drying of watermelons 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.789
 thin sliced watermelon 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.000
 sunflower seeds by max 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.640
 removed 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.070
 such small pieces of thickness somewhere 0 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.469
 5 centimeters this can even be connected 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:38.460
 to make juice from watermelons not 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.230
 I got to where I should not put one tier 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.230
 with such protection 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.320
 this is a tray for pastila if that juice 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.030
 will flock somewhere 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.329
 watermelon pieces themselves will spread 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.600
 on pallets made by hand mesh and 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.910
 net pallets need to 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.539
 juicy foods like watermelon tomatoes 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.960
 and others well after suturing 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.479
 could separate lay the pieces i 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 cut about a third of the watermelon on 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.799
 sample 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.320
 who are rich in watermelons are engaged in them 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.140
 growing up of course such a method 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.150
 preservation of watermelon for the winter and in general how 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.000
 would do for yourself or your family 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.100
 delicacy such opportunity exists with 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.140
 using such dryers 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.070
 how izidri do not know how to cope 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.580
 other 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.250
 drying machines 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.810
 with such a task but saw the photos 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.490
 dried watermelons in izidri machines 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.100
 what have i got the opportunity to 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.170
 own experience everything check everything 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.960
 try very interesting what kind of land 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.750
 the taste of watermelon should increase 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000
 after drying because 97 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.330
 percent of all nutrients 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.220
 all vitamins are preserved 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.100
 minerals there are all there 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.979
 nutrients sweetness intensify over 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.490
 an account of the fact that shrunkenness passes as usual 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.520
 and it happens 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 it will probably dry for how long 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.620
 it will take in time I recognize the content and 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.780
 so all the watermelon pieces are laid out 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.320
 temperature set at 55 degrees 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.800
 including electric drying drying time of 10 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.900
 till 16 o'clock at the end let's see what 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.170
 get try in general it passed 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.170
 eight o'clock and I look so that watermelon 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.500
 already and ready very quickly drained 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.320
 the continuation of 10 hours is not 16 only 8 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.930
 hours past the shields they stuck very 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.209
 thin cut them so probably Egypt 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.030
 dried quickly but something to take away them 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.769
 can be very sweet 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.959
 need and here's what a dried slice 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.120
 the taste is amazing here this piece is very 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.510
 well removed by thickness where 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.320
 a bit thicker it turns out softer 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.480
 inside 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.540
 but in general, too, is ready easier 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.780
 removed when you take the net 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.880
 the selection we are flexible and so all that is on it 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.130
 are also much easier to remove 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.350
 when watches hold 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.019
 such a mesh pallet is not very good 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.510
 removed in places still very much 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.730
 sticks and he reminds when a fish 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.310
 re-dried and we are trying to separate the piece 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.220
 fish from the bone is wrong and here the next 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.290
 since all the same, I will try to dry on the pallet 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.390
 for pastila in extreme cases it will be possible 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.570
 turn over each piece 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.940
 because on the grid I don't like how 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.350
 watermelon behaves well here's a piece of 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.230
 separated 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.810
 and sticks so strongly in dried 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.760
 watermelon only enhanced taste of watermelon in 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.280
 several times very sweet very 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.800
 delicious great snack great 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.050
 delicacy reminds forgiven he on his 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.270
 the structure is well so unusual forgiven 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.260
 because from watermelon I don't know to 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.200
 made marshmallow 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.500
 the case of watermelon makes a big difference 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.040
 between the homemade net pallet and 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.050
 with native sticks off perfectly on 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.560
 homemade unfortunately very large 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.810
 losses 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.640
 that is, this is the tooth 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.620
 you need to bite off such nuances 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.750
 save and then lose or 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.330
 use here such detachable sechin 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.850
 then the methods by us and watermelon are fine of them 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.500
 removed so draw conclusions in 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.560
 in general, I have turned out real 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.290
 watermelon chips delicious incredible 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.020
 very sweet very tasty come off 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.510
 very hard to take away with only succeeded 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.670
 take off on self-made mesh trays 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.920
 Unfortunately, almost half remained there. 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.080
 net pan which was in 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.560
 complete losslessly failed 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.960
 take off 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.180
 out unfortunately self-made take off so not 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.860
 succeeded so specifically by example 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.140
 watermelon I would not recommend 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.110
 use next time try 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.870
 dry watermelon on pasta trays 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.090
 I hope it can also be done though 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.980
 the lower part of course will not 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.880
 ventilate like net pallets 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.800
 but try who has such drying 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.530
 harvesters highly recommend trying 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.650
 dried watermelon you will love 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.169
 here is this here is a piece of pastila from 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.719
 watermelon can do pastila zar 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.330
 but the only thing is that it will be by weight 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:19.420
 gold because she is this piece 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.640
 gone somewhere near the watermelon 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.010
 because juice needs to be filtered and 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.180
 leave only the flesh delicious 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.190
 of course it turns out 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.770
 I hope you have the information 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.590
