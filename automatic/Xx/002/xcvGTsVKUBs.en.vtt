00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.759
 well this is a preparation of a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.730
 pretty extreme bike trail for what 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.170
 It would be a motorcycle that is capable of doing 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.660
 that we need a trail that is 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.340
 road and field not in this case this 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.560
 motorcycle has been prepared so that it has a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.180
 very jacket use therefore 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.520
 we could say that it is a preparation 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.900
 quite extreme in this case we talk 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.510
 of a yamaha super ténéré 1200 that a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.430
 high-end motorcycle and high displacement and 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.890
 therefore very heavy we are talking 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.500
 of about two hundred thirty-odd kilos 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.000
 in running order and therefore everything 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.680
 it is designed so that you can 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.630
 endure an off road use but at the same 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.970
 time have resistance to blows and 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.829
 falls therefore the first things 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.489
 that we have sought is precisely the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.110
 protection 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.720
 we are talking about protections 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.690
 side fenders and a crankcase cover 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.020
 very resistant that I can 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.550
 Protect the motor in knocks of stones 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.379
 in this case we have also made a 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.840
 transformation to adapt a wheel of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.870
 21 when they normally reach 19 the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.850
 21 has helped us to lift the bike and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.570
 make it therefore less vulnerable to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.000
 hits 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.320
 on the underside of the engine other 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.390
 things that have been modified on this bike 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.360
 it's also the rear suspension we're 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.510
 talking about a mattek cushion of 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.729
 multiple ways therefore adjustable in 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.530
 all its facets and that helps us 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.420
 also to that when we are loaded with 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 suitcases for trips we can also 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.910
 make harder and also be psuv it has 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.310
 lifted the motorcycle from behind to make it 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.770
 to be the highest another modification 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 important is the exhaust pipe are 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.880
 talking about an escape that allows us 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.770
 be able to remove the passenger footrests 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.899
 in our in my case I do not use them 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.300
 because I always travel alone 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.789
 Large and heavy load platform 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.840
 to carry all the luggage 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.250
 tools etcetera protections of what 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.259
 that would be the part of painting by 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.030
 example deposit these stickers we 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.040
 protect the deposit from scratches of 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.470
 the legs 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.350
 larger footrests to be able to be 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.650
 many hours of standing driving the motorcycle 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.209
 and the brake pedal also extended with 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.039
 which we also have a better touch to the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.000
 braking time in general we are 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.400
 speaking therefore of a 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.380
 transformation 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.770
 quite extreme finally the handlebar 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.000
 with multiple adaptations since a 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.590
 he brings he has the problem this 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.120
 we can be doing many hours of 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.739
 road but then many hours of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.630
 field therefore being able to adapt the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.300
 Driving position is an element 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.890
 fundamental are multiple details that 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.360
 make this bike a much more bike 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.360
 jacket that the motorcycle that comes out
