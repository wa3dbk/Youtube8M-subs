here we go with a scary audio guide for
a<00:00:03.680> long<00:00:04.680> method<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.250> guess<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.759> farming<00:00:06.390> Gil<00:00:08.660> to

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
a long method I guess of farming Gil to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
on a bunch of little thunder ease

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.870 
on a bunch of little thunder ease
well<00:01:03.539> maybe<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.439> since<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> nice<00:01:05.580> big

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
well maybe not little since the nice big

now<00:01:09.130> basically<00:01:09.670> what<00:01:09.820> we<00:01:09.939> want<00:01:10.149> to<00:01:10.210> do<00:01:10.329> is<00:01:10.450> to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
now basically what we want to do is to

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.940 
now basically what we want to do is to
spam<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.049> heck<00:01:11.740> out<00:01:12.009> of<00:01:12.040> quake<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.850> energy

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
spam the heck out of quake and energy

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.490 
spam the heck out of quake and energy
for<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.040> group<00:01:15.220> of<00:01:15.399> three<00:01:15.670> I<00:01:15.700> usually<00:01:16.210> just

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
for the group of three I usually just

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.929 
for the group of three I usually just
pick<00:01:17.500> quake<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.890> if<00:01:21.039> I<00:01:21.130> would<00:01:21.280> pay<00:01:21.460> attention

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
pick quake and if I would pay attention

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.050 
pick quake and if I would pay attention
to<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.180> attacks<00:01:24.149> nice<00:01:26.429> as<00:01:27.429> you<00:01:27.549> can<00:01:27.640> see<00:01:27.970> it

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
to the attacks nice as you can see it

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.690 
to the attacks nice as you can see it
already<00:01:28.210> took<00:01:28.450> out<00:01:28.630> two<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.960> them<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.549> then

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
already took out two of them and then

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.910 
already took out two of them and then
we're<00:01:30.820> done<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.640> really<00:01:33.970> quick<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:35.619> do<00:01:35.799> it

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
we're done it's really quick to do it

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.060 
we're done it's really quick to do it
this<00:01:36.070> way<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.520> for<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.630> this<00:01:38.470> is<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.829> ton

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
this way and for the this is the ton

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.399 
this way and for the this is the ton
very<00:01:39.280> King<00:01:39.610> no<00:01:40.600> we<00:01:40.720> don't<00:01:40.899> want<00:01:41.049> to<00:01:41.110> attack<00:01:41.289> him

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
very King no we don't want to attack him

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.010 
very King no we don't want to attack him
that<00:01:41.590> way<00:01:41.709> one<00:01:41.950> using<00:01:42.340> energy<00:01:44.220> okay<00:01:46.020> that

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
that way one using energy okay that

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.949 
that way one using energy okay that
should<00:01:47.789> take<00:01:48.789> them<00:01:49.000> up<00:01:49.090> really<00:01:49.299> fast<00:01:49.630> off<00:01:49.929> a

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
should take them up really fast off a

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.270 
should take them up really fast off a
dual<00:01:50.170> cast<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:52.360> can<00:01:52.509> also<00:01:52.659> put<00:01:53.140> on<00:01:53.170> any<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.099> the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
dual cast you can also put on any of the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.289 
dual cast you can also put on any of the
SP<00:01:54.789> materia<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.630> boosts<00:01:56.640> attack<00:01:57.640> or<00:01:57.939> magic

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
SP materia that boosts attack or magic

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.550 
SP materia that boosts attack or magic
power<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.330> they<00:02:01.720> will<00:02:01.750> even<00:02:02.049> go<00:02:02.259> down<00:02:02.409> even

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
power and they will even go down even

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.249 
power and they will even go down even
faster<00:02:03.250> since<00:02:03.569> you're<00:02:04.569> dishing<00:02:04.750> out<00:02:04.990> even

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
faster since you're dishing out even

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:16.070 
faster since you're dishing out even
more<00:02:05.459> damage

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.630 

it's<00:02:16.500> what<00:02:16.680> happens<00:02:17.040> when<00:02:17.190> you're<00:02:17.370> playing

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
it's what happens when you're playing

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.540 
it's what happens when you're playing
through<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.230> camera<00:02:19.230> screen<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.280> paying

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
through a camera screen that paying

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.980 
through a camera screen that paying
attention<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.090> what's<00:02:21.240> going<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.810> again

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
attention to what's going on so again

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.720 
attention to what's going on so again
you<00:02:25.590> want<00:02:25.770> energy<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> can't<00:02:29.610> even

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
you want energy do it so I can't even

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.660 
you want energy do it so I can't even
attack<00:02:31.130> okay<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:33.240> just<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.600> few<00:02:33.840> bottles<00:02:34.670> and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
attack okay so just a few bottles and

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.050 
attack okay so just a few bottles and
already<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.560> Gil<00:02:37.560> one<00:02:37.770> up<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.520> four<00:02:38.760> million

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
already the Gil one up to four million

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.660 
already the Gil one up to four million
six<00:02:39.630> hundred<00:02:39.690> something<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:41.220> does<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.550> was

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
six hundred something that does it was

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.130 
six hundred something that does it was
like<00:02:41.910> four<00:02:42.120> million<00:02:42.330> five<00:02:42.630> hundred<00:02:42.660> something

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
like four million five hundred something

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.040 
like four million five hundred something
at<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.470> start<00:02:43.770> that's<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:44.130> bad

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
at the start that's not bad

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.500 
at the start that's not bad
of<00:02:46.050> course<00:02:46.280> each<00:02:47.280> fight<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.730> think<00:02:47.880> if<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:48.360> get

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
of course each fight I think if you get
