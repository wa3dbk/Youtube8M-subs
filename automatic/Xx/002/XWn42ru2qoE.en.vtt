back<00:00:42.879> 21<00:00:43.390> years<00:00:43.659> ago<00:00:44.129> when<00:00:45.129> our<00:00:45.180> American

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
back 21 years ago when our American

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.090 
back 21 years ago when our American
athletes<00:00:46.540> weren't<00:00:46.930> using<00:00:47.199> american-made<00:00:47.860> bob

new<00:01:02.799> technology<00:01:03.489> involved<00:01:04.059> that<00:01:04.180> went<00:01:04.420> into

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
new technology involved that went into

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.780 
new technology involved that went into
building<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:05.290> new<00:01:05.409> night<00:01:05.620> train<00:01:05.890> -<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.700> know

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
building the new night train - you know

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.390 
building the new night train - you know
we<00:01:06.970> applied<00:01:07.360> all<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.690> new<00:01:07.990> technology<00:01:08.680> over

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
we applied all the new technology over

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.520 
we applied all the new technology over
the<00:01:09.520> last<00:01:09.729> four<00:01:10.060> years<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.930> one<00:01:14.350> of<00:01:14.469> the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
the last four years and one of the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.080 
the last four years and one of the
surprises<00:01:15.250> was<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:15.700> by<00:01:15.880> using<00:01:20.280> work<00:01:21.280> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
surprises was that by using work the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.039 
surprises was that by using work the
slug<00:01:22.360> came<00:01:22.570> out<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.200> accurate<00:01:23.890> that<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:25.810> did

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
slug came out so accurate that we did

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:34.580 
slug came out so accurate that we did
not<00:01:26.289> have<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.859> spend<00:01:27.039> any<00:01:27.520> time<00:01:27.700> whatsoever

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.190 

well<00:01:35.590> an<00:01:35.740> engineering<00:01:36.270> dopers<00:01:37.299> talks<00:01:37.840> about

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
well an engineering dopers talks about

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.779 
well an engineering dopers talks about
the<00:01:38.409> fact<00:01:38.649> that<00:01:38.799> they're<00:01:39.009> using<00:01:39.039> whale<00:01:39.579> and

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
the fact that they're using whale and

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.999 
the fact that they're using whale and
engineering<00:01:40.240> parts<00:01:40.630> in<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.229> new<00:01:41.350> sled<00:01:41.619> well<00:01:41.950> I

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
engineering parts in the new sled well I

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.020 
engineering parts in the new sled well I
think<00:01:42.070> that<00:01:42.310> makes<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.609> even<00:01:42.700> more<00:01:42.850> special

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
think that makes it even more special

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.050 
think that makes it even more special
and<00:01:43.659> shows<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.590> approach<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.549> was<00:01:45.700> taken

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
and shows the approach that it was taken

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.779 
and shows the approach that it was taken
to<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.299> building<00:01:46.689> of<00:01:46.840> this<00:01:46.960> sled<00:01:47.789> digitized

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:53.499 
that you were able to take SolidWorks

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
know when we're watching it on

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.499 
know when we're watching it on
television<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.000> going<00:02:05.299> down

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
television that the is going down

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.149 
television that the is going down
with<00:02:05.720> some<00:02:05.900> parts<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.380> we<00:02:06.530> made<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.040> that

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159
