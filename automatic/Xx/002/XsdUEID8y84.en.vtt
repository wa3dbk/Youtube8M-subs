to<00:04:09.120> know<00:04:09.150> each<00:04:09.780> other<00:04:10.200> but<00:04:10.920> it's<00:04:11.069> also<00:04:11.220> that

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
to know each other but it's also that

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.760 
to know each other but it's also that
strong<00:04:11.850> around

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
strong around

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.130 
strong around
that's<00:04:13.310> strong<00:04:13.670> commitment<00:04:14.600> of<00:04:14.660> that<00:04:14.780> tutor

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
to getting to know the students there

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.520 
to getting to know the students there
that<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.900> key

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
that is a key

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.910 
that is a key
look<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.489> think<00:04:20.239> it's<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:20.989> lovely<00:04:21.230> step<00:04:21.650> from

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
look I think it's a lovely step from

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.750 
look I think it's a lovely step from
primary<00:04:22.310> school<00:04:23.200> into<00:04:24.200> into<00:04:25.130> secondary<00:04:25.520> and

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
primary school into into secondary and

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.100 
primary school into into secondary and
that<00:04:25.880> students<00:04:26.300> are<00:04:26.420> traveling<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:26.990> the

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
that students are traveling to the

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.270 
that students are traveling to the
center<00:04:27.380> of<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.530> city<00:04:27.680> there's<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:27.980> certain

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
center of the city there's a certain

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.530 
center of the city there's a certain
independence<00:04:28.490> they're<00:04:28.940> traveling<00:04:29.300> at

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
independence they're traveling at

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.160 
independence they're traveling at
obviously<00:04:29.960> peak<00:04:30.530> hours<00:04:31.300> with<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.330> large<00:04:33.020> group

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
obviously peak hours with a large group

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.990 
obviously peak hours with a large group
of<00:04:33.350> people<00:04:33.500> there's<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.860> nice<00:04:34.070> energy<00:04:34.760> about

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
of people there's a nice energy about

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.760 
of people there's a nice energy about
the<00:04:35.180> city<00:04:35.390> that<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.080> think<00:04:36.410> certainly

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
the city that I think certainly

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.140 
the city that I think certainly
translates<00:04:37.310> into<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.580> school<00:04:37.850> this<00:04:37.970> school

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
translates into the school this school

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.990 
translates into the school this school
is<00:04:38.510> really<00:04:38.750> energy<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.560> think<00:04:40.400> also<00:04:40.520> in<00:04:40.790> terms

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
is really energy I think also in terms

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.970 
is really energy I think also in terms
of<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.240> location<00:04:41.570> just<00:04:41.840> where<00:04:42.260> we<00:04:42.410> are<00:04:42.590> on<00:04:42.830> our

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
of the location just where we are on our

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.040 
of the location just where we are on our
access<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.120> whole<00:04:44.420> lot<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.660> learning

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
access to a whole lot of learning

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.900 
access to a whole lot of learning
opportunities<00:04:45.140> that's<00:04:45.770> wonderful<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:46.790> it

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
opportunities that's wonderful and it

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
opportunities that's wonderful and it
certainly<00:04:47.150> emphasizes<00:04:47.960> some<00:04:48.170> of<00:04:48.260> our<00:04:48.410> key

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
certainly emphasizes some of our key

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.170 
certainly emphasizes some of our key
ideas<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:51.200> terms<00:04:51.560> of<00:04:51.740> responsibilities<00:04:52.610> in

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
ideas in terms of responsibilities in

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.990 
ideas in terms of responsibilities in
terms<00:04:53.480> of<00:04:53.660> trust<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.890> students<00:04:55.250> are<00:04:55.340> not<00:04:55.670> as

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
terms of trust the students are not as

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.790 
terms of trust the students are not as
another<00:04:56.600> skills<00:04:56.930> I've<00:04:57.050> taught<00:04:57.230> in<00:04:57.380> behind

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
another skills I've taught in behind

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.000 
another skills I've taught in behind
six-foot<00:04:58.690> fences<00:04:59.690> but<00:05:00.260> in<00:05:00.470> fact<00:05:00.710> they<00:05:00.980> have

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
six-foot fences but in fact they have

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.820 
six-foot fences but in fact they have
that<00:05:01.600> that<00:05:02.600> freedom<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.110> go<00:05:03.350> into<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.620> city

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
that that freedom to go into the city

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.260 
that that freedom to go into the city
and<00:05:04.010> be<00:05:04.100> part<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.550> city<00:05:04.760> community<00:05:05.240> I

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
and be part of that city community I

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.120 
and be part of that city community I
don't<00:05:05.360> think<00:05:05.600> it's<00:05:05.690> a<00:05:05.780> lovely<00:05:06.050> bridge<00:05:06.530> to

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
don't think it's a lovely bridge to

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.860 
don't think it's a lovely bridge to
senior<00:05:07.520> school<00:05:07.760> but<00:05:07.940> then<00:05:08.060> also<00:05:08.210> enter<00:05:08.690> life

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
senior school but then also enter life

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.370 
senior school but then also enter life
beyond<00:05:09.320> school<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:10.700> I<00:05:11.360> think<00:05:11.780> it's<00:05:11.900> it's<00:05:12.170> a

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
beyond school so I think it's it's a

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.610 
beyond school so I think it's it's a
really<00:05:12.770> positive<00:05:13.720> stage<00:05:14.720> for<00:05:15.170> students<00:05:15.530> in

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
really positive stage for students in

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.780 
really positive stage for students in
learning<00:05:15.740> that<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.280> middle<00:05:16.490> school<00:05:16.670> is<00:05:16.760> very

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
learning that the middle school is very

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.610 
learning that the middle school is very
much<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.120> stage<00:05:17.480> in<00:05:17.720> which<00:05:17.840> students<00:05:18.380> progress

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
much a stage in which students progress

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.280 
much a stage in which students progress
through<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.670> it's<00:05:20.240> not<00:05:20.390> an<00:05:20.510> end<00:05:20.660> in<00:05:20.750> itself

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
through and it's not an end in itself

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.380 
through and it's not an end in itself
well<00:05:21.800> it's<00:05:21.950> preparation<00:05:22.640> and<00:05:22.910> much<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.240> our

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
well it's preparation and much of our

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.410 
well it's preparation and much of our
successes<00:05:23.810> of<00:05:24.020> middle<00:05:24.260> school<00:05:24.530> will<00:05:25.160> be

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
successes of middle school will be

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
successes of middle school will be
demonstrated<00:05:26.420> by<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.600> way<00:05:26.750> students<00:05:27.170> can

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
demonstrated by the way students can

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.650 
demonstrated by the way students can
move<00:05:27.620> into<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:28.550> senior<00:05:28.880> years<00:05:29.060> of<00:05:29.210> school<00:05:29.480> and

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
move into the senior years of school and

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.440 
move into the senior years of school and
then<00:05:29.960> into<00:05:30.170> university<00:05:30.770> so<00:05:31.550> it's<00:05:31.850> it's<00:05:32.210> not

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
then into university so it's it's not

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.080 
then into university so it's it's not
the<00:05:32.570> measure<00:05:32.870> in<00:05:33.200> itself<00:05:33.620> of<00:05:33.920> we've<00:05:34.910> done

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
the measure in itself of we've done

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.210 
the measure in itself of we've done
really<00:05:35.300> well<00:05:35.450> in<00:05:35.510> you<00:05:35.720> know<00:05:35.840> but<00:05:36.380> we<00:05:36.680> look<00:05:36.920> to

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
really well in you know but we look to

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.580 
really well in you know but we look to
those<00:05:37.820> schools<00:05:38.210> that<00:05:38.480> attitudes<00:05:39.200> the

those schools that attitudes the
