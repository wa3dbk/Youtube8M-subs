00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:16.500
 vade retro satan or my god and brothers 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.119
 minecraft ita ways and are pieces today 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 I'm here to present you a new fashion 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.210
 today's fashion elementar creepers 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.000
 mod 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 let's start the fashion of today I had 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.220
 already reviewed in the past I think 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.560
 exactly in version 1.5.1 this one 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.469
 version is here is worth about almost a year 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.559
 ago this new fashion came out about a 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.800
 month ago and is the same as the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.600
 elemental creepers and is for 1.6.4 therefore 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.539
 even if the official mode was not 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.489
 updated this has been recreated which a 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.090
 small differences from the other 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.739
 however it is for 1.6.4 fantastic fashions that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.360
 advice for all the pec ways 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.850
 survival because it is really difficult 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.899
 survive with this fashion a second 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.460
 that one of a fig moment 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.690
 mind briefly features fast 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.420
 because I'm milan I don't know why 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.680
 however 20,000 open programs and vi 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.150
 I show everyone here why there 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.790
 introduces first we must 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.619
 wear life-saving armor with 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.990
 protection 10 because otherwise these first 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.580
 break up and show you all the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.960
 creeper that there are before I do you 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.869
 see a nice clipper effect 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.610
 then it costs here is the creeper file though 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.950
 I'm not mistaken it's the clipper cookie 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.540
 exactly ok we also take a sword 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.580
 when we kill the cookie clip I was 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.350
 however any kind of creeper no 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.909
 it didn't happen, let's see if it happens to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.329
 fajr let us not even see the fajer 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.329
 luck 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.610
 ok as you see when we give ourselves a 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.610
 creeper there is the possibility that i 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.409
 restore a ghost but a ghost 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.689
 really strong because this ghost is 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.790
 stronger than the normal creeper e 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.100
 does a bang without doing damage ie not 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.390
 destroys the soil but the explosion there 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.649
 practically creates steering there 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.020
 it destroys that we must be careful 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.049
 to the ghost creeper who has a creeper 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.189
 I think it's bestial then I take a 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.890
 moment the creative I'll show you 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.810
 all here for the first clipper is the file 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.810
 clipper I let him get closer because 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.509
 if I walk away well let's say that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.790
 yes it is not very easy to keep it that is 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.180
 let's explode so look when 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.819
 hits us will create a fire zone of 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.290
 about 10 blocks for 10 and as you see 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.670
 may even ignite the whole 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.170
 forest so you have to be careful 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.940
 when using do what though when 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.470
 find a file clipper I recommend 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.950
 run like crazy to not make you 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.599
 to take 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.970
 then we have the cookie 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.970
 clipper whose creeper you look at when 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.040
 what attacks is happening beautiful boom 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.230
 gives us five stupid cookies 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.660
 creeper useless creeper and all these 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.010
 clippers can play wherever they are 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.500
 of the areas where they shoot the most for 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.299
 example far creepers seems to be an era more spa 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.680
 frequently in the desert compared to the 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.049
 ex creeper so there are small ones 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.850
 differences between unicri per ma come 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.950
 immediately to see the water creeper on 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.660
 water creeper is a creeper for everything but 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.120
 all blue I really like the skin 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.900
 that when they burst they release quantities 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.360
 infinite water in the middle and water e 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.950
 the ati instead will move like the waters 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.080
 normal that we can find you see 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.090
 in fact even if it goes to meet with 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.890
 a river as you see does not generate 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.870
 practically nothing is a combo 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.700
 particular will remain here until the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.950
 we remove later we have 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.440
 the electric creeper for the elective creeper 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.560
 to the only peculiarity that when it explodes 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.329
 it doesn't hurt but lightning will hit us 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.069
 so we really need to be careful one 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.170
 moment that the funnel in the water otherwise 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.390
 I die even though they are protections 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.519
 10 10 a ultra protection is not true 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.489
 powa can't be done minecraft does nothing 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.069
 I did it with the not enough item if then 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.170
 we have the dark creeper here now vi 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.510
 let's see if we have for example not 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.000
 I know it's a bit of torches we put here 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.329
 from the torches you come torch me 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.250
 ok in this perfect area and let's put a 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.290
 dark creeper when the dark explodes 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.970
 reaper removes all sources of 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.459
 lighting therefore destroys any 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.440
 type of light source the skin 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.049
 how have you seen est as you have seen it is 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.450
 stupendous look at it now if I can 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.150
 to look back here look how beautiful it is 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.359
 I like a lot nobles here watch it 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.340
 it's scary it's too good ok now 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.019
 instead let's see the lightsleeper on 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.959
 lightsleeper instead does the opposite 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.609
 when there is a source not luminous 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.169
 It has 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.739
 practically as you saw it creates doug 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.540
 the stone 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.060
 exact is practically the opposite effect 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.930
 del dark reaper 15 now we expose a 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.090
 dark creeper here where this is where e 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.220
 we blow it up it will destroy all 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.440
 the forms of light therefore also the bulk 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.850
 too blues bothers me i hate you 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.410
 wanted that is not true 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.900
 let us now turn to the aces for the earth 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.360
 clipper I love this one instead 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.910
 when it explodes it will generate earth 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.340
 random in the old Easter elementary school 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.870
 of 1.5.1 when the ear creeper 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.760
 exploded it generated a ball of earth in 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.380
 which we were enclosed this is a 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.790
 effect a little more normal because 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.500
 a ball of earth was a little bit 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.110
 strange while this clipper as you see 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.120
 we say that it destroys the earth and the 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.560
 let's say so random random 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.479
 I think it's a little bit more truthful 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.860
 the effect of this clipper same thing 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.240
 also for the magma creeper here 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.889
 in the old version 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.810
 meanwhile, this when he walks he leaves 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.340
 fire when it exploded also generated 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.650
 he a lava ball while this 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.450
 generates random lava that will do it anyway 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.010
 very, very bad of his after a 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.169
 moment and trolling things are not finished 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.940
 I came to God as you see the 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.200
 10 protection is not very effective with 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.030
 all these gray for you therefore must 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.100
 be careful later we have 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.200
 rever wrote this was the clipper that 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.030
 I liked it better because the earth was spinning 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.310
 so I'll show you 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.350
 ok what was below was above and 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.020
 this effect also remained unchanged 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.310
 so if I have to be below for example 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.140
 careful I have to be careful before I do 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.260
 destroy go 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.270
 ok if there was the stone la below 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.970
 stone came over while the earth 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.639
 went under practically turned the 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.350
 earth as you have seen so maybe there 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.360
 could also use to find gods 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.910
 materials here is what indeed you have 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.740
 seen therefore practically acts as 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.950
 I'm not sure how to define it anyway it turns 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.170
 the earth is as if it were from north to south 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.310
 he turns you understand the meaning 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.230
 perfect 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.000
 I hope you understood while she 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.860
 writes what it does is the last creeper 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.220
 I think it's the ugliest one when 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:21.910
 explodes practically generates snow then 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.490
 the adware will become snow while the water 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.530
 it will become exact ice just like that 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.150
 so guys the fashion of today was 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.590
 I'm really glad they have it 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.170
 updated even if it has not changed 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.400
 practically nothing just the ghost creeper 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:37.000
 which is an addition in my opinion is really 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.590
 really nice is the novelty of this mod 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.570
 I remind you to leave a nice like and 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.070
 500 I like to publish a new fashion 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.390
 subscribe to the channel to see 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.730
 finished more depressed fashions that will come out 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.340
 and I anticipate that the next fad will be 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.200
 referring to the digimon we see ourselves in a 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.650
 next video on high fashion mike 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.650
 hello everyone guys
