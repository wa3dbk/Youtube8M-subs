all you really need to do is learn the
foliage<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:16.859> begonia<00:00:17.369> it's<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.029> unique

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
foliage on begonia it's it's so unique

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.400 
foliage on begonia it's it's so unique
that<00:00:20.420> it's<00:00:21.420> relatively<00:00:21.900> easy<00:00:23.900> to<00:00:24.900> tell<00:00:25.199> just

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that it's relatively easy to tell just

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.470 
that it's relatively easy to tell just
simply<00:00:25.680> by<00:00:25.800> look<00:00:25.920> forward<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> top<00:00:27.150> are

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
simply by look forward so the top are

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.430 
simply by look forward so the top are
extremely<00:00:28.490> glossy<00:00:29.630> very<00:00:30.630> soft<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.980> very

plasticky feeling and rubbery Elmo sort
of<00:00:36.450> unique<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.989> then<00:00:37.440> there'll<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> dark

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
of unique and then there'll be a dark

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.600 
of unique and then there'll be a dark
green<00:00:38.910> sometimes<00:00:39.360> lighter<00:00:39.840> green<00:00:40.170> than<00:00:40.379> this

the<00:00:47.340> veins<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.710> begonia<00:00:49.710> leaves<00:00:50.039> will

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the veins on the begonia leaves will

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.160 
the veins on the begonia leaves will
always<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> lighter<00:00:51.180> color<00:00:51.510> than<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.989> leaf

always be a lighter color than the leaf

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.439 
always be a lighter color than the leaf
and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.010> flip<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.280> over<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.420> can

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and then you flip it over and you can

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.139 
and then you flip it over and you can
see<00:00:55.309> actually<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.670> trying<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> say

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
see actually what I was trying to say

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.670 
see actually what I was trying to say
with<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> impatience<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.199> kind<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.469> see

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
with the impatience you can kind of see

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.250 
with the impatience you can kind of see
the<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.879> almost<00:01:00.030> looks<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.930> know

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the it almost looks like this I know

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.549 
the it almost looks like this I know
it's<00:01:01.620> weird<00:01:02.030> you're<00:01:03.030> not<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.960> can't<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.379> them

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
it's weird you're not we can't see them

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.080 
it's weird you're not we can't see them
that<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> almost<00:01:05.519> looks<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.820> each

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that well but it almost looks like each

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.929 
that well but it almost looks like each
little<00:01:06.360> cell<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:07.110> outline<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:09.090> know<00:01:13.700> okay<00:01:14.700> so

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
little cell is outline you know okay so

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.890 
little cell is outline you know okay so
on<00:01:15.780> begonia<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.979> that's<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:17.549> easy

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
on begonia that's a that's a really easy

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.730 
on begonia that's a that's a really easy
characteristic<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.080> able<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> help<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
characteristic to be able to help to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.020 
characteristic to be able to help to
identify<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.520> well

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
identify it as well

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.120 
identify it as well
alright<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> foliage<00:01:22.470> shape<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:24.920> sort<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.979> rid

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
alright the foliage shape is sort of rid

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.520 
alright the foliage shape is sort of rid
of<00:01:26.220> form<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.610> almost<00:01:26.820> rounded<00:01:27.330> okay<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
of form it's almost rounded okay in that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.789 
of form it's almost rounded okay in that
way<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:29.640> again<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.180> not<00:01:30.240> got<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> hilt

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
way but then again it's not got the hilt

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.429 
way but then again it's not got the hilt
a<00:01:31.979> leaf<00:01:32.790> attachment<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.960> rather<00:01:34.170> it's

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
a leaf attachment but rather it's

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.810 
a leaf attachment but rather it's
attached<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.040> base<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.490> leaf<00:01:35.640> again

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
attached at the base of the leaf again

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.719 
attached at the base of the leaf again
okay<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.500> then<00:01:37.650> once<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.040> get<00:01:38.130> into<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.549> full

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
okay and then once you get into the full

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.550 
okay and then once you get into the full
are<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> flowers<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:41.670> flowers<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.560> very

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
are the flowers the flowers are very

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.520 
are the flowers the flowers are very
sort<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.979> bright<00:01:44.250> colors<00:01:44.840> typically<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.439> you

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
sort of bright colors typically so you

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.319 
sort of bright colors typically so you
can't<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.890> whites<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.579> see<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> pink<00:01:48.030> over

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
can't get whites and see the pink over

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.289 
can't get whites and see the pink over
here<00:01:48.600> almost<00:01:49.380> getting<00:01:49.619> into<00:01:49.770> reds<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.399> this

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
here almost getting into reds in this

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.530 
here almost getting into reds in this
way<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.990> always<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.680> yellow

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
way and then you always get this yellow

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.540 
way and then you always get this yellow
tuft<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:55.320> reproductive<00:01:56.159> structures

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
tuft of reproductive structures

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.120 
tuft of reproductive structures
ha<00:01:58.150> ha<00:01:59.760> and<00:02:00.760> then<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:02.380> lot<00:02:02.800> of<00:02:02.890> times<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.340> buds

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
ha ha and then a lot of times the buds

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.800 
ha ha and then a lot of times the buds
are<00:02:06.130> sort<00:02:06.430> of<00:02:07.619> well<00:02:09.180> these<00:02:10.180> structures<00:02:10.660> that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
are sort of well these structures that

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.000 
are sort of well these structures that
sort<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.200> subtend

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
sort of subtend

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.100 
sort of subtend
is<00:02:12.130> what<00:02:12.340> I'm<00:02:12.430> wanting<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.300> show<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
is what I'm wanting to show you the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.660 
is what I'm wanting to show you the
structures<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.710> sort<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.010> sub-10<00:02:15.490> the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
structures that sort of sub-10 the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.020 
structures that sort of sub-10 the
actual<00:02:16.060> bloom<00:02:16.590> are<00:02:17.590> almost<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.550> same<00:02:18.580> shape

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
actual bloom are almost the same shape

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:28.050 
actual bloom are almost the same shape
as<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.360> leaf<00:02:26.670> there's<00:02:27.670> another<00:02:27.880> little

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
as the leaf there's another little

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.970 
as the leaf there's another little
structure<00:02:28.480> down<00:02:28.660> there<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.080> subtends<00:02:29.800> the

begin to become less vigorous and send
out<00:02:55.600> shoots<00:02:56.050> that<00:02:56.920> there's<00:02:57.550> much<00:02:57.760> more<00:02:58.000> space

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
shoots and that's a problem because you

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.050 
shoots and that's a problem because you
want<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.520> bush<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.690> will<00:03:05.880> plant<00:03:06.880> to

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
to remain relatively ornamental okay so

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.660 
to remain relatively ornamental okay so
look<00:03:15.070> for<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.250> foliage<00:03:15.900> glossy<00:03:16.900> green<00:03:17.670> -
