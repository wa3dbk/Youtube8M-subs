00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.460
 a new video at tackles and how it works 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.680
 in the background probably too 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.590
 I can recognize it again today 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.349
 the new meta-tags booster and that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.139
 the second part of our open, so to speak 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.670
 days and yes I told her how 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.250
 I think so 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.390
 I believe that now after 30 posters 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.740
 to be left over , which I bought myself 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.109
 In this video we'll I guess 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.449
 only five open because of the movie video on 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.189
 10 opened and that was real 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.280
 really long and the upload was 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.140
 somehow also really long so me 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.050
 have somehow turned the clock at 14 and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.390
 that was the first time I think about it 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.940
 19:20 clock online 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.640
 but okay, we already say it consciously 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.699
 Just try to get one out of two 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 three four and five 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.039
 and yes the walls open again so I 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.780
 I'm really happy again 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.550
 I could use the new magic system 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.680
 I hardly wanted to wait 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.799
 Do not make the next animal tomorrow 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 but now just so great and seen 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.360
 I could not wait to whom you 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.180
 1 now and yes, I'll say it in the back 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.040
 there are 456 collection cards in front of the water 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.939
 available duos or body logos 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.090
 per two packs matchwinner one per 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:27.900
 8.58 small semitransparent in one package 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.840
 choir 181 pack patrick l in a pro 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.790
 56 packets and club 101 60 packets 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.299
 I believe the penalty everywhere 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.119
 the same prints five players plus 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.740
 desired project are namely then 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.740
 we open immediately loses the first 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.049
 I actually had it today 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.750
 not that actually quite like that 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.630
 enough not really then 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.399
 I once dom and nicolai mÃ¼ller 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.520

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.760

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.790

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.520
 a semi-transparent map on it 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.310
 then we here even have a 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.220
 club card and borussia 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.800

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.990

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.990

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.730
 Stefan Aigner So the magazines now 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.560
 about as they are not anymore 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.410
 so chosen are actually as smooth as 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.170
 so star player but that 's just it 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.900
 imprinted match in that way 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.450

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.170
 bit yes so the longing as should 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.540
 you say it either way who or 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.730
 so or scratched or no idea 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.690
 In any case, very nicely done 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.030

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:13.430

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:15.590

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.310
 if we open it this way 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.940
 Slowly get used to the booster 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.819

 but of course the tum then the fourth 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.709
 clarify the test 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:36.490
 because I have a semi-transparent map so 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:39.370
 I once reinert andre hahn 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.560
 property that is very good 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.139

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.910
 still lasogga of hsv am really very 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.680
 glad that we have so many hamburg maps 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.030
 because he thinks he will sign 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.650
 let's see 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.750
 and then I have one more 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.740
 semi-transparent map and captain 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.270
 Of course, noveski is very nice 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.340
 nice i know i gave the mainzer 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.280
 stadium already has it always 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:13.030
 look later and then I would 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:13.030
 the Open the last girl so 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:24.200
 turned around but okay then I once 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.120
 esswein toprak and schmiedebach and then 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.419
 Once I have the stadium you have 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:34.789
 already seen by cologne 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:39.080
 the rheinenergiestadium rhine energie 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:40.490
 exactly take the stadium for home advantage 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.229
 Let's go here and then we have 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.710
 probably still has a strong or 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:48.050
 what could that be 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:53.300
 heike midfield and we have julian 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:57.770
 taxer and max meier is a duo card 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:02.270
 Exactly creative you are very beautiful with the 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.919
 number 2 188 really cool right 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.410
 we almost have almost everything 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.890
 everything has been drawn up 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.600
 hat trick all club 100 but maybe 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.570
 we pull that 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.340
 love is still a map of such 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.430
 Join hermannstein once 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.100
 I still have this duo card here 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.230
 own pulled as matchwinner 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.690
 noveski as a transparent card or 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.790
 semi-transparent map borussia dortmund 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.660
 as club borussia mÃ¶nchengladbach as 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:34.240
 club logo and home advantage to say so 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.320
 a stadium exactly and I would say 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.730
 that 's it again from 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.470
 this video i hope like now 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:43.230
 leave it up there and we will be 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.230
 I think in the next part again
