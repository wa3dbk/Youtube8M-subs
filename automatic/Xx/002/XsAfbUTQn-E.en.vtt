00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 ok somehow today i have it at all 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.189
 do not mind the news corp 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.599
 so I do not know somehow I 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:20.730
 not right today you can not 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:23.340
 Who can call of duty plays 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.900
 be twice as happy until monday 8 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.730
 In the morning there are double 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.849
 points of experience and the whole course 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.710
 on xbox 360 playstation 3 wii and pc 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.110
 then who will launch the new one 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.480
 consoles quasi the upgrade picks up takes 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.070
 of course, then his statistics with so 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.170
 really good in things 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.540
 reviews does call of duty though 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.420
 just not the country so we say 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.110
 mid 70's range between 74 and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.520
 78 points eg on metacritic.com and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.230
 so deteriorated even 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.510
 once clearly opposite the two 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.000
 last part namely black ops 2 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 that still had a maximum of 83 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.140
 points retracted and modern warfare 3 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.719
 infinity was always two years ago 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.330
 yet there is one of them 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.400
 is called doug creutz by the crone and 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.470
 company that is and economic analysis 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.210
 company he says it's all completely 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.979
 no matter how the review assessments are 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.470
 The sales figures are call of duty 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.390
 poured not influence anyway 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.640
 Who is fan of the game is the purchase of 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.259
 without waiting for any tests 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.270
 he already had activision in 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.920
 apron claims they see each other completely 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.720
 sure you are with gold 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.390
 actually sell more copies 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.500
 would play as rockstar games by gta 5 times 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.500
 see if that works 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.780
 do you know linzer so great if 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.700
 It's not that bad either 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.800
 the games were not really cool 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.720
 that's enough for hollywood anyway 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.910
 to consider a film adaptation 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.590
 since 2007, there are actually the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.210
 planning that all on the canvas 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.470
 but it was always supposed to come 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.460
 rerun in hollywood and 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.979
 nobody wants to be so right 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.229
 deal but now dive two 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.780
 new rumors and that is the cyclists 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.760
 in conversation to play the nucleus that 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.590
 makes a bit more sense than that 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.150
 the production company millennium travels 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.340
 and millennium just got jÃ¶rn 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.900
 butler olympic made front then 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.550
 is such a movie where the white house of 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.080
 terrorists should not I have in 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.930
 plane I almost fell asleep 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.580
 Well, at least that's a second role 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.380
 namely a role of the lynch also 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.030
 these are suddenly blowing somehow 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.040
 Rumors of conversation 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.350
 if there is something in it we will 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.600
 certainly experienced surfers use is 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.070
 Felix Gary Gray is not the one now 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.020
 but most famous name has at least that way 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.590
 much like friday and the italian job 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.290
 made 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.650
 the script of kontrons birthday has 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.780
 kidman kate day to day wrote 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.640
 and kyle has actually got that 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.989
 script ovations shetty kills and the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.760
 really horny from me 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.500
 Well, if you are curious now like that 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.070
 Whole look on the canvas 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.690
 could 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.220
 Here is the good news we have 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.220
 already exclusive scenes from the film 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.240
 this mass does not remain 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:40.410
 giant theater damned every month 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:42.060
 again does not hurt and 6 after one 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.950
 the title to which most people 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.830
 for the next year is probably happy 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.780
 destiny of bungie the former halo 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.550
 Developer but the whole has at the moment 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.500
 still a rage because destiny 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.180
 he should not appear for the pc and 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.900
 that will probably stay that way for now 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.970
 because the community manager eric Eastern Railway 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.040
 said they are going to leave now 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.230
 no staff turn off one by one 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.940
 possible pc to develop because 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.160
 That would make the staff blanket for 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.620
 the console mount as much as you like 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.240
 thinning out that then no more 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.370
 the quality could hold you 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.799
 want to reach the beta for destiny 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.030
 is currently scheduled for the beginning of 2014 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.270
 then of course for playstation 3 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.400
 playstation 4 and xbox 360 and xbox one 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.290
 and the full game should be later in the game 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:33.930
 year comes a mobile phone rang 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:36.180
 mainz now it gets quite interesting 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.710
 I'm always a friend of studies 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.020
 especially from those who pro 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.370
 Video games are the prestigious max 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.500
 planck institut now has a new one 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.310
 published study and shows 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.140
 Playing increases brain capacity 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.520
 just say that it will be the 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.600
 brain areas enlarges the for 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.340
 spatial orientation memory formation 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.720
 strategic thinking and fine motor skills 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.370
 hands are responsible 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.410
 to find out they have 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.800
 scientist actually two months 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.860
 long the test persons every day 30 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.650
 playing super mario 64 for minutes 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.020
 let and the control group was allowed 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.310
 not play well, I was anyway 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.990
 not there but I would have guaranteed 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.270
 do not want to be in the control group 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.520
 Incidentally, it was interesting that the 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.610
 brain changes were ever more pronounced 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.440
 more fun the people had to play yes 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.970
 Of course the whole thing has a sense 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.010
 and purpose the researchers want now 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.020
 because of these findings about it 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.120
 then think about developing games 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.220
 People help the psychic 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.540
 there are exactly these areas in the 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.680
 Brain should be trained 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.840
 if you for example under 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.760
 schizophrenia suffers or under the 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.000
 post-traumatic stress disorder or 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.669
 Alzheimer's and dementia note pretty 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.870
 even for colin to christmas super 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:54.300
 buy mario 64 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.100
 lambo video game actually already had 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.540
 in october must appear then 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.010
 Nobody has moved so far 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.630
 Really heard and it is anyway 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.610
 questionable if the extra 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.310
 development time to spring where 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.600
 now new release date scheduled 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.970
 should bring anything at all because 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.460
 Fresh leases now became a gameplay 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.479
 trailer and the looks so grotto shit 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.870
 We do not want you out of them 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.870
 withhold 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.130
 especially bad are especially bad 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.380
 the bad body proportions the 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.690
 graphic that looks like playstation 2 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.090
 and if anyone else after that 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.800
 story should not exist yet 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.120
 only an original plot for that 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.650
 play it will be just the 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.520
 Events from the first three films 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.520
 retold 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:51.129
 you have it until the end of this news 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.750
 but it works, of course, directly 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.220
 continue either he looks yet again, 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.690
 news from last week if you have the 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.490
 missed or you look directly 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.680
 purely with our current talk about 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.669
 theme editions of games so 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.349
 for example, collector's editions 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.150
 limited editions, whatever they are 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.220
 saying something since wright it to 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.470
 pay what should because ideally there 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.020
 That's what we're discussing unread yours 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.940
 Comments before and beyond may 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.800
 of course, still put an abo 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.800
 Give thumbs up for the before approx
