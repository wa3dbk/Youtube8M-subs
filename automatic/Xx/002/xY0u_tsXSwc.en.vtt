00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.969
 Hi everyone! How are you? On the day of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.080
 I'm going to teach you how to do this today. 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:18.150
 only a good cup of tea is cool that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.410
 You do not need to knit to 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.769
 can do it 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.990
 Let's learn, what do you do for this? 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.920
 we will use the fabric on canvas 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.320
 heron 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.619
 for those who do not know this heron screen 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.180
 fabrics of well-spaced yarns used to 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.790
 have your embroidery 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.430
 available in white and beige and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.510
 easily found in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:50.039
 and sells dry goods per meter then 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:58.230
 I'll open the fabric on the counter and go 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:01:00.800
 fold in half and boy tip with 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.800
 tip 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.369
 done that I used a cover of a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.950
 another mold to be able to take the model 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.810
 because I want my mold kept in the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:23.759
 same size as the others they have at home 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:28.020
 I placed it on top and with the pen 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.170
 I'll scratch the four corners just to have 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.920
 a base from which to start and end 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.920
 my cover 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:50.939
 it is important to leave a margin 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.479
 sides and up is to be able to do 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.090
 finishing after 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:02.310
 now we learn the point I shove the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.399
 needle in the square and pull the thread to 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:11.250
 out 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:14.160
 boy well I see how much the pompoms 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.019
 my friend she will cover in my case 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.069
 make up small and covers only two 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.099
 little squares 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.840
 if not what you choose was higher 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.239
 it's just to see how many squares the copom 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.880
 will cover and skip the amount of 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.299
 corresponding squares in case I go 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.549
 Jump a square and I'll stick needles 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.549
 on the second and pull the wire 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:47.880
 I for a square in thread the needle in the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:50.970
 second and pulls the wire the more 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.010
 together with being more cute and handsome 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.889
 work will stay 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.540
 so it is important to let pigeons as well 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.540
 close together 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:07.650
 so let's go look for me again 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.370
 square needle thread in the second and 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.370
 pulled the wire 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.650
 for a square at last the needle in the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.930
 second and pulled the wire 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.349
 this is practically 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.549
 that most people know is 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.549
 super easy to do 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.019
 now I'll show you how to turn 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.909
 career is the same but on the side 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:47.450
 for a little square at least in the second and 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.450
 pulled the wire 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.940
 done, this is just to continue the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.760
 points in vertical jump a square 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:09.000
 thread the needle in the second and pulled the thread 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:17.220
 It looks like this for a little square at last. 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:20.220
 second and pulls the wire whenever went 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.349
 I 'll always turn around 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.349
 on the side and has no error 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.400
 to make it easier, I always 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.330
 left hand I'm holding the wire in 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.320
 low 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.570
 It helps me not to lose where I am 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.000
 doing and not the 9th line 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:49.530
 now I'll show you how to do it 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.660
 I'll get the tip of the new model and 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.660
 I'm going to tie it in the end, it's over 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:19.059
 it is important to let the pull sets 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:19.059
 well and I'll cut the leftover yarn 

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:24.249
 the fields closely together 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:37.159
 I'm going to stick needle in the little square I'm going 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:40.009
 pull the wire to the components that 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:44.330
 they are not overcrowded 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:45.499
 I'll pull a pompom to the side of the 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.199
 reverse 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:54.499
 only one the sun and the continuous the tip 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:59.349
 jumping the square by threading needles 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:06:03.729
 on the second and pulling on a square 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.729
 needle threading the second wire pulled and 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:09.379
 always finish the line, just do this 

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:14.179
 that work will be perfect do not 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:16.749
 It seemed to be fed and looks good. 

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:19.849
 right 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:21.740
 here is the cover already sewn myself 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.929
 sewing machine in the sewing machine and 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.399
 I put the zipper not perfect 

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:26.689
 because I'm not a seamstress but for 

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:28.399
 Who never sewed 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:31.579
 I thought with the result super good 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:35.509
 I the line see the sides and the zipper 

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:38.209
 then the machine scene is important 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.249
 always sew from the wrong side to the 

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:41.300
 finish is perfect and more 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:45.729
 professional 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.729
 When we see it, it's on the right side. 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:52.699
 I put a zipper the color of the lamp 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:55.129
 is well camouflaged with completing the 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.349
 cushion and put it on like this 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:00.709
 super cute fluffy 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:03.069
 I loved the result and you what?
