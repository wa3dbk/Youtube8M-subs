00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.580
 Y 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.850
 hello welcome healthy and lines in this 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.370
 tutorial will be taught how to paint from 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.740
 these nails splashed with blood for 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.770
 This newspaper will need one 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.730
 Straw adhesive tape and white enamel 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.680
 optical 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.789
 with the newspaper we cover 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.020
 surface on which we will work 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.020
 if spotted 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.110
 and we start by applying a layer of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.110
 white enamel let dry 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.900
 it's very likely like in my case for 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.290
 cover well you have to apply a second 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
 cap 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.040
 when you are well dry we proceed to 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.710
 cover the surroundings of the nail with 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.680
 adhesive tape for this we cut two 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.600
 chunks and we finally hit an eye 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.320
 true vertically the closest thing to the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.320
 possible nail 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.910
 on top of newspaper papers in 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.830
 some similar place we leave the doors 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.140
 of the red enamel forming a small 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.180
 puddle and submerge at the end of the straw 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.890
 in it until a membrane is formed 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.890
 paint that clogs the hole 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.620
 we bring the straw to the nail and blow 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.620
 Market Stall 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.240
 once dry we remove the adhesive tape 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.240
 and it's almost ready 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.459
 just make the places that the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.459
 adhesive tape would not protect and you're 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.730
 our nails are also finished 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.730
 until next time
