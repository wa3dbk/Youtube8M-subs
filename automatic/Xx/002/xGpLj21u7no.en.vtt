00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.010
 and I 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.680
 Hello, how about youtube friends? 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.870
 Your friend Luis and good in this 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.120
 video I bring you the screen logo of 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.160
 galaxy s 4 for our device 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.990
 android in this the screen is 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.980
 available the sizing works from 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.660
 android 4.0 onwards ok what's going 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.239
 to allow obviously since this is 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.430
 change the unlock mode of our 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.250
 device really can be that 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.379
 I have by default ok then what's going 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.760
 to do this is really application 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.670
 Well, it's not going to give us the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.949
 appearance of the galaxy s 4 screen 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.320
 in our device ok then it 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.730
 flame galaxy s 4g equal in the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.680
 descriptions would be leaving the link 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.809
 for you to download it ok 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.470
 then once you have installed 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.960
 manages to open 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.960
 there is the interface that brings this option 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.300
 it says in the galaxy s 4g that it's for 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.970
 activate or deactivate the once you already 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.340
 we have activated it because we are going to proceed 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.730
 to lock the device and we're going to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 check the screen ok then as we see 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.780
 or rather well 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.150
 okay 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.030
 It brings very nice effect like it has 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.070
 two two options that is the air but that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.620
 is what we tested at the beginning and the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.050
 second that is the alcohol that is this 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:44.150
 we touch unlock 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.150
 in water 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.660
 convinced already enough I did enough 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.010
 well the truth ok then and here we 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.580
 give some other options as 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.590
 customize we can change it now 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.840
 yes that the wallpaper we can 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.800
 choose one that we have in 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.800
 our gallery 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.259
 we can also avoid it you have a 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.780
 profile in the background we can change what 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.750
 what the company says here we can 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.970
 change and put something else like 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.100
 your 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.100
 they would like to put their name I do not know this 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.060
 we're not going to put louis and we're going to 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.760
 check it again 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.760
 and as you can see, it 's pretty low 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.120
 ok here we can also change what 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.880
 the clock is the bottom of the clock 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.520
 also and also what has been the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.810
 source to ok then this as well as them 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.280
 I say a pretty personalization 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.890
 pretty good as is available 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.320
 in the presto so I hope there will be 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.180
 liked the video and as I tell you it looks 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.180
 pretty pretty good apple 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.510
 and as I say then in the description to 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.170
 I'll leave the link for them to check 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.680
 and download it 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.480
 okay 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.890
 and well then here in the guarantees but 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.390
 you liked quite short video 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.340
 remember to subscribe to this channel 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.870
 android testing give us a like have 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.769
 if you liked this one 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.120
 video and see you in the next video ok 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.040
 it's normal to put this option on 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.040
 without service I do not know why but as 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.319
 I say this normal I do not know what is due p 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.730
 then we see a greeting to all and 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.969
 many times you may have seen this 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.969
 video
