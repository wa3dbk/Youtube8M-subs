00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
we're headed that way onto that antler

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.120 
we're headed that way onto that antler
and<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.450> next<00:02:21.570> spot<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.410> want<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.920> show

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
now I just left that south-facing slope

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.120 
now I just left that south-facing slope
where<00:02:42.440> yeah

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
where yeah

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.370 
where yeah
I<00:02:43.160> did<00:02:43.430> find<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.760> nice<00:02:43.940> five-point<00:02:44.690> elk<00:02:44.990> shed

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
I did find a nice five-point elk shed

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.050 
I did find a nice five-point elk shed
antler<00:02:45.770> I've<00:02:46.310> got<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.640> go<00:02:46.760> through<00:02:46.790> a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
antler I've got to go through a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.780 
antler I've got to go through a
north-facing<00:02:47.540> slope<00:02:48.200> hit<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.860> bottom<00:02:49.190> up<00:02:49.459> the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
north-facing slope hit the bottom up the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.280 
north-facing slope hit the bottom up the
next<00:02:50.120> steep<00:02:50.330> slope<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.780> get<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.170> that

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
next steep slope to get to that

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.010 
next steep slope to get to that
south-facing<00:02:51.590> slope<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:53.000> guess<00:02:53.209> what<00:02:53.480> that

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
south-facing slope and guess what that

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.500 
south-facing slope and guess what that
elk<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> area<00:02:54.860> they<00:02:55.370> do<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.880> same<00:02:56.150> thing

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
elk in the area they do the same thing

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.390 
elk in the area they do the same thing
when<00:02:57.080> they<00:02:57.260> want<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.650> get<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:58.010> another

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
when they want to get to another

when they want to get to another
south-facing<00:02:59.300> slope<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.440> eat<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:02.150> want<00:03:02.360> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
south-facing slope to eat so you want to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.780 
south-facing slope to eat so you want to
just<00:03:02.600> kind<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:03.050> poke<00:03:03.319> around<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.950> thick

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
just kind of poke around this thick

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.910 
just kind of poke around this thick
timber<00:03:05.209> sometimes<00:03:06.050> it's<00:03:06.230> gonna<00:03:06.350> have<00:03:06.650> deep

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
timber sometimes it's gonna have deep

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.190 
timber sometimes it's gonna have deep
snow<00:03:07.280> on<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.610> sometimes<00:03:08.150> it'll<00:03:08.540> be<00:03:08.600> bare<00:03:08.959> like

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
snow on it sometimes it'll be bare like

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.770 
snow on it sometimes it'll be bare like
this<00:03:09.530> do<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> little<00:03:10.400> crisscross<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.480> get<00:03:11.660> on

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
this do a little crisscross and get on

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.690 
this do a little crisscross and get on
some<00:03:12.019> trails<00:03:12.320> look<00:03:12.680> around<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.130> may<00:03:13.310> find<00:03:13.550> an

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
some trails look around you may find an

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.630 
some trails look around you may find an
elk<00:03:13.880> shed<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.600> when<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:14.900> hit<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.260> bottom<00:03:15.680> you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
elk shed and when you hit the bottom you

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.390 
elk shed and when you hit the bottom you
also<00:03:16.750> may<00:03:17.750> find<00:03:18.019> elk<00:03:18.440> antlers<00:03:18.980> down<00:03:19.160> there

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
also may find elk antlers down there

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.729 
also may find elk antlers down there
because<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.790> elk<00:03:20.150> are<00:03:20.360> coming<00:03:20.690> downhill<00:03:20.900> fast

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
because the elk are coming downhill fast

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.680 
because the elk are coming downhill fast
and<00:03:21.890> they<00:03:22.280> hit<00:03:22.550> that<00:03:22.760> bottom<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.540> it's

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
and they hit that bottom and it's

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.320 
and they hit that bottom and it's
jarring<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.530> them<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:25.069> an<00:03:25.190> antler<00:03:25.640> might<00:03:25.970> pop

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
jarring to them and an antler might pop

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.559 
jarring to them and an antler might pop
off<00:03:26.569> so<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.290> won't<00:03:27.590> find<00:03:27.860> as<00:03:28.130> many<00:03:28.730> antlers<00:03:29.360> in

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
off so you won't find as many antlers in

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.809 
off so you won't find as many antlers in
these<00:03:29.720> areas<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.920> will<00:03:31.220> find<00:03:31.519> the

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
these areas but you will find the

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.240 
these areas but you will find the
occasional<00:03:32.630> antler<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.380> that's<00:03:33.560> why<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:33.800> I

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
occasional antler and that's why I I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.400 
occasional antler and that's why I I
still<00:03:34.640> like<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.819> poke<00:03:35.120> around<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.750> north-facing

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
still like to poke around a north-facing

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.210 
still like to poke around a north-facing
slope<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.750> down<00:03:38.750> in<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.140> canyon<00:03:39.410> like<00:03:40.010> I'm

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
slope and down in the canyon like I'm

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.670 
slope and down in the canyon like I'm
doing<00:03:40.549> right<00:03:40.910> now<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.600> then<00:03:41.989> we're<00:03:42.140> off<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.260> a

doing right now and then we're off to a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.550 
doing right now and then we're off to a
