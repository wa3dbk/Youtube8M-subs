00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 all right 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.570
 since the lvbp we know that these 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.250
 heights most or the vast majority of 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.110
 you already know that they are the respawn 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.400
 if as you have to control them but 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.289
 it never hurts to make a small 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.090
 review of everything that should be known 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.680
 about them so to start I'm going 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.420
 to give an example where you can see 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.759
 very clearly how important it can 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.619
 get to be controlling a response well 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.689
 you are seeing on the screen one of the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.699
 maps that was played in the game of the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.499
 third day of the côte honor in the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 who played tell me against bray or ming 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:36.150
 that ended up finally if you remember with a 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.490
 result from 1 to 3 the initial situation 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.560
 of the party is the following on this map 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.120
 and four hot spots the first is 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.190
 in the central area as we are seeing 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.900
 the second on the month side is called that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.330
 because that 's where the flag is 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.490
 of a in the domain mode the third 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.380
 the badges and the room in the garage for 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.420
 analyze this move we are interested in the 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.980
 first and the second only so why 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.170
 now we're just going to look at these 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.820
 two also keep an eye on the answer 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.230
 red color and those green color that is 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.360
 where they are reappearing in this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.369
 moment each of the two teams and 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.170
 pay attention to the movement 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.480
 what the player who is marking is doing 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.130
 with a round orange color still 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.180
 there are 30 seconds left until the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.190
 next point 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.260
 and there is already a player moving 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.210
 moving towards that position because 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.890
 does that good because he wants his 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.780
 team reappears as close as possible 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.550
 from the following hard point number 2 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.380
 because the closer becomes your 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.570
 easier team will continue to add 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.280
 points at the beginning of the map tell me 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.810
 it started if we remember with advantage 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.729
 taking into account that the second point 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.650
 hot is very close to where they 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.470
 by default the game started 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.940
 reappear at the beginning of the game 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.500
 but in the absence of about 20 seconds the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.750
 over gaming player has already recovered 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.730
 the rest that previously belonged 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.080
 work therefore of Suarez and 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.430
 over gaming now is not to be taken away 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.470
 that respawn that comes to them also 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.479
 for at least one minute which is what 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.979
 lasts the hot spot the teams what 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.840
 what they do is send a player to the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.700
 back to occupy the entire area 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.710
 and defend the coal with only three 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.270
 more than enough players in this 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.640
 case considering how difficult it is 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.350
 It is usually to enter the problems for uber 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.060
 gaming now well in when the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.190
 player who was behind the whole 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.810
 covering the area on the right suárez 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.520
 that before I was busy defending the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.780
 Hot spot has to be given half 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.790
 back to try to end the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.800
 di Meglio players that have crept 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.720
 on the other hand if Suarez does not end with 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.790
 they over gaming will lose the respawn and 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.560
 the players will appear so and so far 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.420
 of the hot spot they're going to lose 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.430
 many points a lot of time running and 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.500
 surely give a few casualties to 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.959
 tell me in your failed attempt 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.520
 surely to enter front but yes 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.739
 what does Suarez get it go if he does 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.810
 a few casualties are enough for 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.430
 maintain that respawn accordingly to 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.170
 hot spot that there is totally to 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.480
 hands of the over gaming team and the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.290
 scoreboard shoots in your favor at the end 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.290
 they won the map
