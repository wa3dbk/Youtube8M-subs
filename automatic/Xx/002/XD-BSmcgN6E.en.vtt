00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
in the book of Acts and went back to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.470 
in the book of Acts and went back to
Jerusalem<00:02:47.380> as<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> way<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.160> establishing<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
Jerusalem as a way of establishing the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.600 
Jerusalem as a way of establishing the
Jews<00:02:50.020> there<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.560> Christianity<00:02:51.220> wasn't<00:02:51.459> a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
Jews there that Christianity wasn't a

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.670 
Jews there that Christianity wasn't a
cult<00:02:51.880> he<00:02:52.090> wasn't<00:02:52.420> throwing<00:02:52.660> aside<00:02:52.810> Judaism

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
cult he wasn't throwing aside Judaism

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.110 
cult he wasn't throwing aside Judaism
but<00:02:54.100> rather<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.459> Jesus<00:02:54.819> was<00:02:55.000> the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
but rather that Jesus was the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.790 
but rather that Jesus was the
fulfillment<00:02:55.239> of<00:02:55.720> all<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:56.050> this<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.770> that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
fulfillment of all of this so that

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.560 
fulfillment of all of this so that
certainly<00:02:57.190> wasn't<00:02:57.489> ashamed<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:58.030> Paul<00:02:58.209> but<00:02:58.420> in

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
certainly wasn't ashamed of Paul but in

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.900 
certainly wasn't ashamed of Paul but in
that<00:02:58.750> context<00:02:59.440> if<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.620> came<00:02:59.860> breezing<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:00.820> to

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
thing that I could have gotten into was

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.600 
thing that I could have gotten into was
a<00:05:56.050> whole<00:05:56.470> discussion<00:05:56.740> of<00:05:57.100> manuscript

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
a whole discussion of manuscript

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.700 
a whole discussion of manuscript
families<00:05:58.120> and<00:05:58.270> a<00:05:58.300> whole<00:05:58.540> discussion<00:05:58.900> of<00:05:59.350> of

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
families and a whole discussion of of

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.070 
families and a whole discussion of of
how<00:05:59.980> the<00:06:00.040> NASB<00:06:00.880> came<00:06:01.330> together<00:06:01.630> but<00:06:02.050> I

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
how the NASB came together but I

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.860 
how the NASB came together but I
realized<00:06:02.590> something<00:06:03.030> rather<00:06:04.030> than<00:06:04.180> standing

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
realized something rather than standing

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.110 
realized something rather than standing
for<00:06:05.260> what<00:06:05.380> I<00:06:05.410> was<00:06:05.680> comfortable<00:06:06.160> with<00:06:06.280> standing

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
for what I was comfortable with standing

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.630 
for what I was comfortable with standing
for<00:06:07.270> my<00:06:07.420> rights<00:06:07.750> when<00:06:08.620> in<00:06:08.740> Rome<00:06:08.950> I<00:06:09.190> had<00:06:09.430> to<00:06:09.520> do

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
for my rights when in Rome I had to do

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.720 
for my rights when in Rome I had to do
as<00:06:09.760> the<00:06:09.850> Romans<00:06:10.210> did<00:06:10.470> and<00:06:11.470> so<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:12.130> this<00:06:12.250> day<00:06:12.310> you

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
as the Romans did and so to this day you

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.160 
as the Romans did and so to this day you
know<00:06:12.880> we<00:06:13.090> teach<00:06:13.300> out<00:06:13.540> of<00:06:13.660> the<00:06:13.720> New<00:06:13.870> King<00:06:14.140> James

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
know we teach out of the New King James

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.870 
know we teach out of the New King James
Version<00:06:14.740> here<00:06:15.190> because<00:06:15.400> it<00:06:15.490> seems<00:06:15.700> like<00:06:15.850> a

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
Version here because it seems like a

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.850 
Version here because it seems like a
good<00:06:16.090> middle<00:06:16.390> ground<00:06:16.660> for<00:06:16.870> everybody<00:06:17.530> here

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
good middle ground for everybody here

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.560 
good middle ground for everybody here
not<00:06:18.520> because<00:06:18.760> I<00:06:18.790> think<00:06:18.940> the<00:06:19.210> New<00:06:19.330> King<00:06:19.540> James

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
not because I think the New King James

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.200 
not because I think the New King James
is<00:06:19.960> necessarily<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.590> better<00:06:21.100> translation<00:06:21.730> than

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
is necessarily a better translation than

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.060 
is necessarily a better translation than
the<00:06:22.300> new<00:06:22.450> American<00:06:22.900> Standard<00:06:23.050> I<00:06:23.590> think

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
the new American Standard I think

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.280 
the new American Standard I think
they're<00:06:24.190> both<00:06:24.310> excellent<00:06:24.730> translations<00:06:25.600> but

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.290 
they're both excellent translations but

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.020 
they're both excellent translations but
I<00:06:26.350> found<00:06:26.590> I<00:06:26.740> have<00:06:26.890> to<00:06:26.980> spend<00:06:27.220> a<00:06:27.310> lot<00:06:27.490> less<00:06:27.520> time

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
I found I have to spend a lot less time

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.940 
I found I have to spend a lot less time
explaining<00:06:28.600> why<00:06:28.750> I'm<00:06:29.260> teaching<00:06:29.650> out<00:06:29.770> of<00:06:29.800> the

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
explaining why I'm teaching out of the

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.000 
explaining why I'm teaching out of the
NASB<00:06:30.310> this<00:06:30.820> way<00:06:31.230> and<00:06:32.230> so<00:06:32.500> in<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:32.770> same<00:06:32.950> way

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
NASB this way and so in the same way

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.440 
NASB this way and so in the same way
what<00:06:33.310> Paul<00:06:33.520> was<00:06:33.670> saying<00:06:33.820> to<00:06:33.940> the<00:06:34.030> people<00:06:34.330> in

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450 
what Paul was saying to the people in

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.660 
what Paul was saying to the people in
Corinth<00:06:34.810> was<00:06:35.020> this<00:06:35.200> look<00:06:35.800> whether<00:06:36.370> your<00:06:36.520> head

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
Corinth was this look whether your head

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.340 
Corinth was this look whether your head
shaved<00:06:37.000> whether<00:06:37.270> your<00:06:37.420> hair's<00:06:37.660> long<00:06:37.930> really

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
shaved whether your hair's long really

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.690 
shaved whether your hair's long really
doesn't<00:06:38.680> matter<00:06:38.770> man<00:06:39.190> looks<00:06:39.430> on<00:06:39.550> the<00:06:39.610> outward

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
doesn't matter man looks on the outward

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.430 
doesn't matter man looks on the outward
appearance<00:06:40.000> but<00:06:40.720> the<00:06:40.750> Lord<00:06:40.840> looks<00:06:41.050> on<00:06:41.350> the

appearance but the Lord looks on the

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
to be somebody that distracts someone

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.170 
to be somebody that distracts someone
from<00:06:55.890> undivided<00:06:56.890> devotion<00:06:56.920> to<00:06:57.460> Jesus<00:06:57.640> Christ

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.430 
then we're fine and that's really what
Paul<00:07:01.990> was<00:07:02.200> getting<00:07:02.380> to<00:07:02.680> in<00:07:02.800> that<00:07:02.920> passage
