00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.920
 no no 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.030
 but that we are with bruno senna the boss 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.490
 commercial in you want to defeat a 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.210
 little bit about the brand that can 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.580
 say and generally clear to see the brand 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.490
 engine en movistar hay es es un marca 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.140
 British who is more or less 90 years old 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.900
 of history and has lamented European 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.670
 He was in Peru in the 70s and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.790
 basically now the ones are coming back 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.350
 two and a half years here in Peru with a lot 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.770
 strength but so that it is growing 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.020
 quite an average of 250 to 300 per 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.240
 annual growth is expected 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.890
 greater for this year that will run a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.420
 little with the market does not mark it now 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.580
 the products that come for let's say 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.220
 those of export what they bring to 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.510
 all of Latin America are produced in 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.400
 shanghai the design part is done 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.020
 in longbridge england but they are 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.790
 let's say in Shanghai those that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.470
 they are handled in england if they are made 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.229
 similar that turns out to be more like a 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.880
 it definitely steal mark 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.650
 now Chinese at the time a power 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.869
 especially in the technology part a 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.869
 very recognized brand the steel part 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.320
 this occasion of heaven 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.680
 right now 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.870
 arturo together with I am arturo and today 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.370
 we are testing 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.099
 in fire is a car that is quite 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.330
 well equipped on the inside has 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.340
 a touch screen 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.130
 as central panels that also serves 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.230
 to see divide they support divx so 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.659
 can they put a movie 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.140
 or videos at the top is more 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:40.230
 we have an audio and video port and a 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.030
 usb to play music from 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.769
 it works via bluetooth to grab the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.709
 phone would receive more share hands free 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.690
 that we can even control it with the 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.760
 helm there we also have the buttons 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.610
 to change park the elegance of 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.520
 the song for being called 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.080
 and change the sound source of the panel 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.840
 as you can see it also has the part 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.690
 digital where you see the temperature of 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.150
 gasoline the level of productions 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.490
 etcetera here we have only what I am going to 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.290
 do the air conditioning control 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.410
 the gear lever the cars 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.290
 automatic but we have overdrive for 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.240
 to be able to accelerate more and the interesting thing 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.690
 when we put retro in the car 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.510
 switch to a view to a rear camera 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.480
 that tells us when we are 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.250
 retreating or advancing in resume 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.130
 pretty useful price especially for the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.860
 People like me who have a good time 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.990
 apart we have as it said the gps and 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.450
 right now, it's just a test car 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.700
 is with maps I think that China has not 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.080
 been located to Peru but 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.540
 probably this was what the 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.420
 cars that are being sold in the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.040
 summary of your car quite comfortable 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.380
 quite broad also as you will see 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.430
 in the external outlets and right now 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.390
 can see the interiors 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.989
 and it's a car that's pretty good 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.920
 forward and how we got to see more shots 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.920
 in a few moments 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.919
 yes
