00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.220
 hi to all those llama babies who has to 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.930
 place how are you today I 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.550
 accompanied dahal doris and made a 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.010
 little video to explain how 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.840
 do mini are infinite heavy 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.300
 acosta and so I'll let go 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.900
 explain the little glitch so hi 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.980
 to all guys so like dude he 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.050
 explained we will try to make some 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.210
 heavy ammunition to infinity it's like 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.930
 the usual on copter especially when we 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.580
 trail 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.000
 I do not know at all, so I do not know 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.090
 can not explain it so the solution 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.910
 for that and to have an icebreaker 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.860
 compulsory after that you will empty 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.210
 all your heavy ammo currently 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.219
 I do not have it so it's easier 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.079
 me either so mike for you you shoot 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.210
 any request and if you not want 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.649
 to be next concerning the weapon 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.120
 main is the simplest that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.230
 others we both have the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.640
 raid gun 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.320
 what you do is go 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.449
 keep the equivalent of two chargers 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.500
 half ball in a little bit so 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.760
 that is, there are twelve balls in 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.460
 the charger we will keep one 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.180
 thirty we 'll empty everything else is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.180
 kept by valve 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:22.320
 quite fast with this language 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.030
 I have too much so here's more 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.580
 it's very simple to his business it's 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.520
 we will activate with mike ROPTIN soon 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.760
 that it is activated we are going to empty everything 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.170
 the rest of our balls for that to 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.580
 that last bullet shares pretty much 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.110
 at the same time as the panes head 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.670
 Then we will switch on our 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.740
 icebreakers and with the six balls of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.680
 broken ice we will kill the acolytes in 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.790
 priority is actually as you go 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.710
 to be able to see it every alcoholic 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.180
 who will show will leave us 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.690
 heavy ammunition in water better 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.060
 better activate the tatin yeah the head 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.300
 must translate the desires of all our 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.300
 balls of a very last ball 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.510
 as soon as we could 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:20.879
 dennis ritchie on the grill it's clear 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.409
 you take the ice cream and shell have 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:32.569
 tried they do not have as two it's 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:35.250
 more often frankly to do them 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.849
 dip to two pros so much more than 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.019
 flights 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:42.629
 yeah that 's business fingered the cargo hold 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.129
 to hire earlier here like that you 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.540
 can aim only one side 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:52.349
 actually two water towers and the choice of 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:54.140
 city basi dies we start again but 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.250
 our heart 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.400
 you do not see my screen but it's okay 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.400
 walk 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.200
 I've already seen a pac he says 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.170
 to have offered the only physical time 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.060
 in time if you quickly too fast balls 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.060
 they come back to avoid emissions 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.330
 so we get 30 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.629
 I do not like ok that's it and I'm going 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.890
 kill the other side so exactly when 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:29.000
 you will have right will be exactly like that 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.000
 in your back you're sure he's typing that 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.860
 but active it's good I do not know 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.860
 not yet in the 43 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.240
 we'll say 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.240
 31 deaths good 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.879
 pollution 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:13.560
 but papa groove and here's why I 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:19.970
 see nobody dies are all stuck at 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.970
 port more besides the dorna 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.250
 my bearing and chÃ¢tas pass well 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.320
 we are red again 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.150
 come is hoped in front of the dishes are 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.280
 heavy handed because I come from 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.450
 recover ok ok that's why he got me 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.790
 automatically given the fingers it's 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:51.490
 for that nicole when I learn that I 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.440
 see I was there were still 6 there 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.240
 deep down people if ever developed 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.910
 left of the greens but I have a bet 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.880
 price to help me directly in my 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:06.700
 suit so I have six teams and more 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:12.490
 one two three four 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:14.230
 so 7,8 here is a flesh so when 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.940
 not bad on the web 8 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.970
 I have my bazooka to load to the maximum 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.960
 and eight were still wearing so that's so 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.650
 these two methods there it is very well 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.610
 for for kraft will be difficult all 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.980
 that you always have ammo to 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.390
 every time you enter the room 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.860
 you can do it racist it works 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.260
 very well there are two because we get 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.850
 find that at the video at 2 and you told me 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.130
 that you have a market also for a contribution 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.900
 anything that they are at 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.940
 exploration in dark night they are ten 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.530
 days what normally is 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.160
 to walk for anything after I 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.750
 know exactly which systems 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.180
 makes such an issue 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.290
 so I 'm not saying the tellines he 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.630
 must be in the other places in 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:57.340
 force finished good what to expect 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.110
 handball and as soon as it starts on 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.800
 process goes everything starts to shoot and to 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.200
 practice clinical plan 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.760
 frightened so if you already have it there is 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.560
 time to change but if you lose the 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.150
 ammo by changing weapons down with 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.520
 since you shared the clan 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.660
 easily you have the plan for 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.690
 all the holidays were going to attack 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:24.640

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:25.990
 thank you for this beauty beach and ba ba la 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.050
 next time I tell you 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.280
 savings thanks to that especially we 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.120
 have more cartridges since well 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.200
 four weeks 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.010
