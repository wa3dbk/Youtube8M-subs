00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.460
 Yes ah 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:32.840
 4 I 'll try to talk to you about Koz today. 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.380
 First , 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.380
 Please float 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.600
 Let's do the knot, and we'll have ten chain noses. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.460
 1 2 3 4 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:53.410
 5 6 7 9 8 8 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:58.150
 After you have 10 10 passwords 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:03.160
 Next to the pillar nose . 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:07.090
 I want you to hang a chain on the 10th. 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.290
 Chain . I'll take a child here . 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.920
 Short dot 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.920
 No.2 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.410
 Membership 3 times 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.410
 I'm going to make a short nirvana. 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:38.080
 I wish I could show you all this , 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:41.440
 I'll show you how to cut the nose after a few swings. 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.860
 4 I have a short cut 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.360
 I turned off the sedan. Now I'm going to cut my nose. 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.800
 Even when you have a nose week, you need to score four wins. 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.800
 The product is turned upside down 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:01.830
 Co-founded pillar approach to chicken arc spot on the fact that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:07.640
 Once you walk , 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.640
 Before approaching the nose once, please put the needle back 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.489
 Then you have a total of three threads on the needle. 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.489
 I'm taking these three poems out at once. 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.750
 That 's it . 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.390
 Here you see the chain 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.599
 I see two holes in one. 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.970
 First needle 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:39.360
 Put the first gum again and wind up c. 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:45.330
 Next to that god out of a hole 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:49.950
 Put in front of approaching once again in front of the nostrils 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:54.090
 In addition to the seed also came following a Muhsin 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:59.060
 1 2 3 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.060
 Take out three at a time. 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.660
 That's right . 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.130
 I walked to the nose in front of him 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.130
 Take it out at once 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.510
 character 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.150
 maybe 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.250
 Give me the last one. 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.490
 And again at the end 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.830
 You georaseo us out 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.830
 In fact, 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:46.310
 10 things are going down to five here. 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.000
 It's too small to see . 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.950
 1 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:01.720
 2 3 4 5 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.720

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.819
 I got five less. 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.170
 I have a short 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:21.780
 I'll show you five criteria. 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.780
 Pillow 9, and knit it, spinning it. Korean style 1 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.470
 2 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.500
 3 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.270
 4 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.270
 Yes 

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:42.300
 5 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.300
 If you look like this, you'll know it's shrinking in half. 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.830
 So ah 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.500
