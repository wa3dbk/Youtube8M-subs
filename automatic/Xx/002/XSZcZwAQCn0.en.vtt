let's<00:03:57.360> have<00:03:57.660> a<00:03:57.690> look<00:03:57.960> in<00:03:58.230> detail<00:03:58.830> at<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.490> group

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
let's have a look in detail at the group

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.150 
let's have a look in detail at the group
and<00:04:00.090> we'll<00:04:00.630> take<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.110> through<00:04:01.440> bigger<00:04:02.010> by

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
and we'll take it through bigger by

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.700 
and we'll take it through bigger by
figure<00:04:02.580> so<00:04:02.970> we<00:04:03.000> danced<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.810> first<00:04:04.050> six<00:04:04.380> steps

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
figure so we danced the first six steps

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.950 
figure so we danced the first six steps
to<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.070> natural<00:04:05.490> turn<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.060> natural<00:04:06.630> pivot

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960
