the reason

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.450 
the reason
I<00:00:53.960> persevered<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.250> tried<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.580> win<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.360> world

I persevered and tried to win the world

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.340 
I persevered and tried to win the world
was<00:00:58.940> because<00:00:59.210> I<00:00:59.329> realized<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.960> was<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.170> only

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
was because I realized it was the only

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.880 
was because I realized it was the only
way<00:01:00.739> in<00:01:01.129> which<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:01.879> personally<00:01:02.840> would<00:01:03.110> get

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
way in which I personally would get

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.280 
way in which I personally would get
recognition<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:05.089> I<00:01:05.239> was<00:01:05.479> in<00:01:05.690> fact<00:01:05.840> someone

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
recognition that I was in fact someone

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.149 
recognition that I was in fact someone
who<00:01:06.500> had

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
who had

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:25.790 
who had
my<00:01:07.429> trade

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.740 

but<00:01:26.550> you<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> never<00:01:27.000> even<00:01:27.360> thought<00:01:27.690> about

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
but you see I never even thought about

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.860 
but you see I never even thought about
it<00:01:28.230> as<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.410> sport

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.870 

dance

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:51.780 

a<00:01:37.910> story

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.969 

the<00:01:52.790> presentation<00:01:53.570> of<00:01:53.659> them<00:01:53.930> it<00:01:54.290> seems<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.860> me

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
the presentation of them it seems to me

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.910 
the presentation of them it seems to me
was<00:01:55.220> so<00:01:55.430> without<00:01:55.790> substance

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.060 

to<00:01:59.040> create<00:01:59.600> choreography<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.810> skates<00:02:01.290> which

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
to create choreography on skates which

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.399 
to create choreography on skates which
does<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.610> some<00:02:02.850> actual<00:02:03.090> value<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.110> some

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
does have some actual value and some

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.800 
does have some actual value and some
real<00:02:04.650> interest<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.850> which<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.420> innovative

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
real interest and which is innovative

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.710 
real interest and which is innovative
it's<00:02:07.110> terribly<00:02:07.530> difficult

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
it's terribly difficult

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:26.610 
it's terribly difficult
it<00:02:09.050> was<00:02:09.229> always<00:02:09.410> my<00:02:09.680> aim<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.130> do<00:02:10.280> that

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.170 

sometimes<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.069> don't<00:02:27.250> even<00:02:27.370> know<00:02:27.640> what<00:02:27.819> skating

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
sometimes I don't even know what skating

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.539 
sometimes I don't even know what skating
is<00:02:28.299> myself<00:02:28.780> because<00:02:29.260> I've<00:02:30.010> been<00:02:30.340> analyzing

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
is myself because I've been analyzing

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.360 
is myself because I've been analyzing
but<00:02:31.480> other<00:02:31.629> people<00:02:32.080> have<00:02:32.200> been<00:02:32.319> analyzing<00:02:32.830> so

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
but other people have been analyzing so

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.880 
but other people have been analyzing so
much<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.500> they're<00:02:35.500> getting<00:02:35.739> so

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
much and so and they're getting so

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.059 
much and so and they're getting so
intellectual<00:02:36.610> about<00:02:36.849> it<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.390> whole

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
intellectual about it and the whole

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.770 
intellectual about it and the whole
and<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.519> sometimes<00:02:38.790> stop<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.420> think<00:02:39.599> well<00:02:39.689> you

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
and I sometimes stop and think well you

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.490 
and I sometimes stop and think well you
know<00:02:39.870> what<00:02:40.079> exactly<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.769> skating<00:02:41.549> and

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
know what exactly is skating and

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.250 
know what exactly is skating and
all<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.040> can<00:02:43.400> say<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.970> it's<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:44.990> very

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
all I can say is that it's it's a very

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.110 
all I can say is that it's it's a very
beautiful<00:02:45.590> form<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.400> movement

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
beautiful form of movement

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.890 
beautiful form of movement
which<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.660> think<00:02:47.959> has<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.170> great

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.660 

you<00:02:55.290> see<00:02:55.439> on<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.709> ice<00:02:55.829> we<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.069> move<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.549> way

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
you see on the ice we can move in a way

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.600 
you see on the ice we can move in a way
that<00:02:56.879> no<00:02:57.030> one<00:02:57.060> else<00:02:57.360> can

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
that no one else can

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.030 
that no one else can
has<00:02:58.700> built-in<00:02:59.390> properties<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.410> don't<00:03:00.650> exist

has built-in properties that don't exist
anywhere<00:03:01.490> else<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:02.150> get<00:03:02.300> anything<00:03:02.540> from<00:03:02.690> them

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
anywhere else to get anything from them

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.810 
anywhere else to get anything from them
we<00:03:03.260> have<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.620> dig<00:03:03.860> down<00:03:04.130> into<00:03:04.460> them<00:03:04.700> and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
we have to dig down into them and

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.100 
we have to dig down into them and
occasionally<00:03:05.120> smash<00:03:05.720> them<00:03:05.960> apart

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
occasionally smash them apart

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.610 
occasionally smash them apart
reexamine<00:03:07.920> look

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
reexamine look

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.250 
reexamine look
and<00:03:09.069> see<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.610> know<00:03:09.760> just<00:03:10.060> in<00:03:10.480> fact<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.959> there

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
and see you know just in fact is there

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.230 
and see you know just in fact is there
something<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.800> we<00:03:11.980> can<00:03:12.129> do<00:03:12.280> out<00:03:12.459> here<00:03:12.489> can

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
something that we can do out here can

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.530 
something that we can do out here can
through<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.810> air<00:03:15.930> or<00:03:16.440> through<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.950> space<00:03:17.640> but

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
through the air or through the space but

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.330 
through the air or through the space but

you see it's not ballet and it's not
anything<00:03:27.200> else<00:03:27.439> it's<00:03:28.189> a<00:03:28.280> form<00:03:28.549> entirely<00:03:28.909> in
