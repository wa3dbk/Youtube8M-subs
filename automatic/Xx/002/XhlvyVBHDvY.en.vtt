technique<00:00:14.670> called<00:00:15.289> soil<00:00:16.289> blocking<00:00:16.890> soil

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
technique called soil blocking soil

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.609 
technique called soil blocking soil
blocking<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.180> very<00:00:18.420> common<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.080> Europe<00:00:19.440> and

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
blocking is very common in Europe and

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.710 
blocking is very common in Europe and
there<00:00:19.859> are<00:00:19.980> many<00:00:20.130> benefits<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:21.180> example<00:00:21.600> you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
there are many benefits for example you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.419 
there are many benefits for example you
don't<00:00:21.810> have<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.080> spend<00:00:22.350> money<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.650> trays<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
don't have to spend money on trays and

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.310 
don't have to spend money on trays and
you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.970> reduce<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.449> risk<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.750> transplant

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
you can reduce the risk of transplant

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.529 
you can reduce the risk of transplant

little indentation in the soil block

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.669 
little indentation in the soil block
that's<00:01:24.270> where<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> seed<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
that's where the seed is going to go and

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.459 
that's where the seed is going to go and
that's<00:01:26.069> created<00:01:26.759> by<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.450> pins<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.259> the

blocks

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.580 

once<00:02:15.880> your<00:02:16.060> little<00:02:16.330> blocks<00:02:16.570> are<00:02:16.960> ready<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.350> pot

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
once your little blocks are ready to pot

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.320 
once your little blocks are ready to pot
up<00:02:17.830> just<00:02:18.460> pop<00:02:18.730> them<00:02:18.910> into<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.330> bigger<00:02:19.600> block

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
up just pop them into a bigger block

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.200 
up just pop them into a bigger block
like<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:23.250> when<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> comes<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.700> planting<00:02:25.120> your

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
like so when it comes to planting your

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.570 
like so when it comes to planting your
seeds<00:02:25.510> make<00:02:26.020> sure<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.380> only<00:02:26.530> put<00:02:26.860> one<00:02:27.160> seed

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
seeds make sure you only put one seed

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.310 
seeds make sure you only put one seed
per<00:02:28.030> block<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:31.210> can<00:02:31.390> either<00:02:31.510> pinch<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.050> soil

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
per block you can either pinch the soil

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.040 
per block you can either pinch the soil
over<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.830> seed<00:02:33.100> or<00:02:33.400> for<00:02:33.940> most<00:02:34.090> seeds<00:02:34.450> they

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
over the seed or for most seeds they

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.140 
over the seed or for most seeds they
will<00:02:35.260> germinate<00:02:35.470> just<00:02:35.950> fine<00:02:36.220> on<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.700> top<00:02:36.940> of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
will germinate just fine on the top of

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.870 
will germinate just fine on the top of
the<00:02:37.270> block<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.920> won't<00:02:39.160> need<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.340> water<00:02:39.610> your

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
the block you won't need to water your

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.730 
the block you won't need to water your
soil<00:02:40.150> blocks<00:02:40.450> for<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.780> first<00:02:40.990> three<00:02:41.320> days<00:02:41.500> or

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
soil blocks for the first three days or

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.310 
soil blocks for the first three days or
so<00:02:41.950> but<00:02:42.640> then<00:02:42.880> you'll<00:02:43.390> need<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.720> water<00:02:43.930> often

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
so but then you'll need to water often

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.790 
so but then you'll need to water often
but<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> little<00:02:45.580> tiny<00:02:45.910> bit<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:47.350> recommend

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
but a little tiny bit and I recommend

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.610 
but a little tiny bit and I recommend
using<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.490> fine<00:02:49.180> mist<00:02:49.510> nozzle<00:02:50.140> like<00:02:50.320> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
using a fine mist nozzle like the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.210 
using a fine mist nozzle like the
froggit<00:02:51.100> nozzle<00:02:51.730> or<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:52.000> hand<00:02:52.630> sprayer<00:02:53.220> make

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
froggit nozzle or a hand sprayer make

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.580 
froggit nozzle or a hand sprayer make
sure<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.550> water<00:02:54.820> all<00:02:55.150> sides<00:02:55.990> of<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.380> block

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
sure you water all sides of the block

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.950 
sure you water all sides of the block
the<00:02:57.490> blocks<00:02:57.790> on<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.120> edges<00:02:58.480> will<00:02:58.720> dry<00:02:58.930> out

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
the blocks on the edges will dry out

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.590 
the blocks on the edges will dry out
faster<00:02:59.880> if<00:03:00.880> you'd<00:03:01.120> like<00:03:01.240> more<00:03:01.420> information

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
faster if you'd like more information

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.200 
faster if you'd like more information
about<00:03:02.110> soil<00:03:02.560> blocking<00:03:03.130> then<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.880> recommend

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
about soil blocking then I recommend

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.170 
about soil blocking then I recommend
this<00:03:04.450> book<00:03:04.680> transplants<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.830> soil<00:03:06.100> blocks<00:03:06.460> so

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
this book transplants and soil blocks so

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.240 
this book transplants and soil blocks so
get<00:03:07.510> your<00:03:07.660> seat<00:03:07.900> started<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.620> grow<00:03:08.770> organic

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250
