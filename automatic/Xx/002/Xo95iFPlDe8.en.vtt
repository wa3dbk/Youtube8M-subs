00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello, Alexei Grapes 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.890
 and in this video tutorial I'll show you how 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.190
 burn windows image to disk using 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.980
 nero programs 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.650
 the easiest way is to click on 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.050
 image file with the right button and in the menu 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.650
 open with the help choose nero program 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:30.689
 burning rom 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:33.840
 click and open a dialog box 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.219
 write to disk here you need to make sure that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.410
 dvd selected 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.379
 they sit like windows 7 we will 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.750
 must write to dvd drive 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.190
 become ticked entry and finalized 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.050
 You can also check the disk and check 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.969
 data recorded to program 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.570
 reread recorded discs checked 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.620
 that everything is read soon I write to you 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.469
 I recommend to choose not the maximum if 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.750
 The disc supports for example 12x 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.549
 write speed maximum rate 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.470
 at 8 because with maximum recording 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.710
 then there may be read errors if 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.060
 disc is not very high quality after 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.570
 of how we all chose it 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.259
 just press the burn button and 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.570
 the program starts recording the disc by 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.909
 the end of the recording program will recalculate 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.960
 it and check that everything is read 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.520
 correct if you uncheck then 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.869
 the program will not check the disk and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.090
 finish your work faster if you have 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.479

 choose a program and choose nerves from 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.369

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.250

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.020
 I recommend running nerves express he 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:33.060

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:35.459
