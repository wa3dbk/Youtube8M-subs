00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.640
 At 3 o'clock 44 we were alerted to 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.280
 a roof fire open fire 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.839
 net-market 4 in kastel philippsring the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.449
 first incoming forces have so 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.420
 open roof chair noted for 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.540
 larger about 10 to 18 meters in the rear 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.370
 scope of delivery to this were 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.370
 direct user made a c-tube 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.930
 made as a teacher made the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.670
 Further forces after the war it became 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.040
 alarm level 2 was triggered 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.560
 Thus, the fire brigade 32 came 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.080
 also was from the street side 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.929
 then a turning made 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.720
 another office and february in the course of 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.250
 other employment activities were the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.110
 volunteer fire department used so 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.429
 have launched the sweeping attack 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.570
 In the end, there were a total of 13 2 gates 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.899
 two tailpipes 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.399
 we have a total of 48 employees 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.990
 place 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.960
 24 volunteer trees thereof six times 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.229
 operation from the ikea group and 24 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.229
 personnel 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.430
 yes after deleting that will be approx 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.660
 take two to three hours 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.310
 we are currently in contact with the 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.310
 market leader for further measures here 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.200
 So that's the relatively typical one 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.330
 typical drain for those building the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.280
 This is known to fire departments 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.630
 whole markets are so from the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.090
 connection 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.220
 correctly built, however, have the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.350
 ceiling construction all orf 0 that is 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.020
 no fire resistance once it's in 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.010
 sales area foreign goes the very 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.100
 fire directly on the roof construction 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.290
 Love here will be so-called situation 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.550
 the construction uses the in the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.170
 Connection areas the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.540
 connecting elements relatively quickly 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.000
 stop losing so relatively fast 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.160
 a piece is therefore to be expected 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.890
 even only the foreign country meets so the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.300
 cause will take 20 minutes after 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.200
 start an exciting clip of 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.200
 outgoing connection 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.940
 while the people of the country we already have 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.640
 the population warned the citizenship 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.870
 the glass according to smoke developments 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.800
 We asked the windows and doors 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.990
 to keep closed 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.270
 that was prompted by the police 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.250
 and accordingly made radio announcement 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.680
 police and city police and here 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.040
 support shutdowns far it 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.800
 going 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.160
 the large-scale shut-off times just the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.160
 operational activities 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.140
 if now the fire-nests are extinguished 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.950
 the company is given water stop that 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.320
 we still want to program for that 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.730
 Armed back drive the forces so 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.470
 that we get on the traffic blocks fast 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.700
 can release but if the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.990
 Repairs are completed 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.730
 we will secure the building 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.120
 together with the market leader around one 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.120
 saving measure 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.970
 So we are currently estimated at 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.410
 Building damage of about 1 million 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.450
 wanderers known it will be the 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.000
 determining the cause of the next day 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.000
 determine last have so far none
