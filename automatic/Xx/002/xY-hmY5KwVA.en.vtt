00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:06.100
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.620
 Nastya today again video on 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.560
 car theme now with us 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.990
 beginning of April as you can see the weather at all 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.910
 not spring but rather even when we 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.849
 arrived in Ukraine we are now on the way 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.070
 home such a straight winter fairy tale 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.730
 this is only a residual phenomenon 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.090
 so the whole forest is dumping 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.630
 white snow is very beautiful but the video is not about 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.910
 this video is about crossing the search 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 Ukrainian border by car 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.970
 registered registered 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.960
 more 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.480
 if you are a resident of Ukraine and 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.879
 be consular in their 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.460
 I told the previous videos what if 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.040
 resident of Ukraine in Polish 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.140
 Automotive decide in Ukraine but by 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.440
 transit rules it may not be 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.890
 more than 5 days if leaving through one and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.770
 same 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.829
 customs office or not more than 10 days 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.119
 if it broadcasts through different Burda if you 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.560
 driving for more than 5 10 days 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.570
 these rules make up some 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.550
 inconvenience because 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.280
 back and forth to dangle on the border 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.060
 if you have a bigger map 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.380
 hours of water or so much does not matter 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.250
 can apply to ukrainian 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.650
 consulate and become free to the competition 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.780
 Keer accounting I'm sorry I'm talking a little 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.620
 because maybe 1 this tired not 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.790
 spawned 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.340
 and therefore I can be a little bit wrong 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.290
 that's 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.440
 if you have consular registration they are in 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.510
 international passport that you stamp 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.780
 relevant and with these documents in 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.910
 When crossing the border, say that 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.090
 are consular and wanted 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.460
 would be able to transmit on this 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.830
 car in Ukraine is also here 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.310
 days a year by yourself will also need 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.560
 give two copies of the main page 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.619

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.649

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.959

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.480

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.670

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.860

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.630

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.799
 during the year 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.799

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.280
