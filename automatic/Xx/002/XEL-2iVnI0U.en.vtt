00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.719
 Minister here good technical and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 Today's video is teaching you the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.130
 make this magnetic plate super cool 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.160
 I saw this magnetic card on the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.900
 tse and the suit has to do is show 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.269
 for my follower 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.769
 That's what gives the video more I have 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.150
 to leave the fastest and the most 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.669
 complicated as possible 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.950
 there all the prices of the materials are 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.570
 will be listed here below that the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.370
 This information will also be the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.890
 I was down here then for sure. 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.469
 of an arrangement in the information box 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:50.010
 all this has to learn to do is only 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.620
 keep watching the video is good you 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.910
 will need a board of a board 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.129
 magnetic 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.289
 you can find this magnetic board 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.769
 in any carla house and in the case 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.350
 so for free, you go too. 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.810
 need a paper that is more 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.630
 be more resilient and in the case I got 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.180
 this book that own traffic glue 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.310
 normal and glue super bonder but at the end 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.530
 I ended up just wearing super super bonder 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.960
 a mini stand if you intend to 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.580
 hang the frame the makeup you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 hangs, or any other 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.660
 thing the magnet I recommend that it be the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.880
 thinner and more powerful 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.440
 It's good it 's time to start putting your 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.440
 you can choose from any 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.810
 size and drawing and then taking the 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.370
 chosen paper you will fold so that 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.180
 it is the same size as the board 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.180
 magnetic 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.610
 then just attach the magnetic plate 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.409
 with the paper in the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.270
 This was the hardest part because 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.890
 magnetic plate was not exactly the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.780
 frame size but paid off 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.970
 remember before closing check if the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.590
 on the other side the paper was 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.590
 no dents or anything like that 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.950
 and also before closing the wood he 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.630
 keep all the rivers up 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.690
 then just fit the wood that has already been 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.530
 comes with the frame and close all 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.720
 and that's how our 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.580
 magnetic 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.110
 so now you just have to choose the makeup 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.030
 that we will use and began to paste the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.560
 best way to shut down the makeup without 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.840
 have no contact with the super glue 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.870
 Bonder is putting the theme on the table pass 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.690
 glue then glue the makeup on 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.530
 It was the best technique I found without me. 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.200
 hurt 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.329
 good it's almost that, it's just you 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 put the makeup on the board 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.410
 magnetic 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.360
 magnet is superbom and super tough it 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.310
 It's so thin it does not even get in the way. 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.680
 the makeup after you want to take 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.810
 somewhere and it's so super 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.209
 resistant 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.060
 Good now if you want to hang your 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.410
 magnetic board you will need 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.870
 of those screw-up schools that I 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.579
 I think the best option and then it's just 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.940
 hang in your refrigerator or in your 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.769
 bathroom corners 3m are great though 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.989
 I recommend getting a little bigger 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.030
 because with taste I used not 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.940
 managed to hold on for a long time 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.799
 but how beautiful it is is a great 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.270
 way to save space because the 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.030
 step to faithful to your bench 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.730
 or if you prefer you can also 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:40.250
 let it lean against your wall and also 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:42.380
 It was super cute, good girls, then it was 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.440
 so with this magnetic board you can 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.580
 talk anything school stuff 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.810
 the makeup photos everything and gets super 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.150
 custom 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.040
 What can you do for a nursery? 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.980
 present with your friends now for 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.740
 The debut then if you want me to 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.110
 make it easy for yourself only tell 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.340
 video if you steal on new cheese channel 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.860
 subscribe 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.860
 so this is until the next video bye
