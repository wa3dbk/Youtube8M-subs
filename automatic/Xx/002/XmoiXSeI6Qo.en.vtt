here as you can see it clips into place
not<00:02:11.840> only<00:02:11.989> is<00:02:12.109> the<00:02:12.230> case

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
not only is the case

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.020 
not only is the case
comfortable<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.469> hold<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.829> the<00:02:13.920> hand<00:02:14.069> when

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
comfortable to hold in the hand when

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.690 
comfortable to hold in the hand when
it's<00:02:15.150> closed<00:02:15.450> but<00:02:15.659> actually<00:02:16.200> when<00:02:17.040> we<00:02:17.069> flip<00:02:17.519> it

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
it's closed but actually when we flip it

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.110 
it's closed but actually when we flip it
back<00:02:17.909> because<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.200> design<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:20.519> does<00:02:20.819> seem

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
back because of the design it does seem

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.809 
back because of the design it does seem
to<00:02:21.269> fold<00:02:21.540> all<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.780> way<00:02:21.900> back<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:23.340> doesn't<00:02:23.760> look

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
to fold all the way back it doesn't look

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.429 
to fold all the way back it doesn't look

open if you've got the year if phone
upside<00:02:42.090> down<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:43.109> be<00:02:43.230> very<00:02:43.409> annoying<00:02:43.680> if

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
upside down can be very annoying if

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.190 
upside down can be very annoying if
you've<00:02:44.340> got<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.549> flip<00:02:45.450> cover<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.989> keys

you've got a flip cover and a keys
popping<00:02:46.590> open<00:02:46.709> like<00:02:47.129> so<00:02:47.689> now<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:49.139> reason<00:02:49.319> it's

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
popping open like so now the reason it's

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.610 
popping open like so now the reason it's
called<00:02:50.090> aluminium<00:02:51.090> lined<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.840> because<00:02:52.379> on<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
called aluminium lined is because on the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.599 
called aluminium lined is because on the

there is a section of aluminium and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.909 
there is a section of aluminium and
that's<00:02:59.639> obviously<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.419> give<00:03:00.629> this<00:03:01.379> front

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919
