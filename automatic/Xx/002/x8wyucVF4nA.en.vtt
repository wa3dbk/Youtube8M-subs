00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
I think the basis for that is is a money

I think the basis for that is is a money

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
human genome project was a hugely

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.990 
human genome project was a hugely
expensive<00:01:24.960> project<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.710> talked<00:01:25.920> him<00:01:26.159> around

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
expensive project we talked him around

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.920 
expensive project we talked him around
2.7<00:01:27.990> billion<00:01:28.500> dollars<00:01:29.479> approximately<00:01:30.479> 13

years to complete hundreds and hundreds
of<00:01:33.780> people<00:01:34.170> involved<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> was<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> huge<00:01:36.119> huge

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
known adaptations of the Bushmen is that

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.290 
known adaptations of the Bushmen is that
they<00:02:23.140> can<00:02:23.200> survive<00:02:23.710> say<00:02:24.520> seven<00:02:24.760> days<00:02:25.060> at<00:02:25.210> a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
they can survive say seven days at a

they can survive say seven days at a
time<00:02:25.330> without<00:02:25.750> taking<00:02:26.350> in<00:02:26.470> water<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:27.790> a

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
time without taking in water it's a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.420 
time without taking in water it's a
biological<00:02:28.240> adaptation<00:02:29.020> which<00:02:29.860> has<00:02:30.070> occurred

biological adaptation which has occurred

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.060 
biological adaptation which has occurred
there<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.970> ability<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.390> store<00:02:31.780> water

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
there have the ability to store water

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.000 
there have the ability to store water
this<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.220> obviously<00:02:33.460> now<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.600> we<00:02:34.750> have<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
this is obviously now that we have the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.880 
this is obviously now that we have the
genetic<00:02:36.330> for<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.390> first<00:02:37.630> time<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.530> whole

basis to these adaptations it's in

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.980 
basis to these adaptations it's in
medical<00:02:47.890> research<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.640> new<00:02:48.850> DNA<00:02:49.330> variations

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
medical research that new DNA variations

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.220 
medical research that new DNA variations
will<00:02:50.260> be<00:02:50.410> most<00:02:50.680> useful<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:51.370> whole<00:02:52.360> new<00:02:52.690> insight

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
will be most useful a whole new insight

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.680 
will be most useful a whole new insight
into<00:02:53.590> disease<00:02:53.920> resistance<00:02:54.550> will<00:02:55.120> ultimately

well I kind of like to refer to like a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.650 
well I kind of like to refer to like a
book<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.840> in<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:09.070> past<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.580> had<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:10.090> great<00:03:10.450> big

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
book and in the past we had a great big

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.290 
book and in the past we had a great big
thinking<00:03:11.020> cyclopedia<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.820> was<00:03:13.030> based

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
thinking cyclopedia and that was based

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.280 
thinking cyclopedia and that was based
on<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:14.020> European<00:03:14.880> jinan<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.060> we've<00:03:16.900> been<00:03:17.050> using

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
on a European jinan and we've been using

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.100 
on a European jinan and we've been using
that<00:03:17.500> excited<00:03:18.070> media<00:03:18.489> very<00:03:18.790> successfully<00:03:19.570> to

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
that excited media very successfully to

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.979 
that excited media very successfully to
look<00:03:20.290> at<00:03:20.470> diseases<00:03:21.310> but<00:03:22.120> it's<00:03:22.360> been<00:03:22.540> limited

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
look at diseases but it's been limited

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.630 
look at diseases but it's been limited
because<00:03:23.440> we've<00:03:23.680> only<00:03:23.860> had<00:03:24.130> their<00:03:24.310> book<00:03:24.489> to

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
because we've only had their book to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.300 
because we've only had their book to
work<00:03:24.790> from<00:03:25.090> what<00:03:25.930> we<00:03:26.110> hope<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.350> our<00:03:26.680> study<00:03:27.100> in

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
work from what we hope that our study in

work from what we hope that our study in
now<00:03:27.459> offers<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.810> opens<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.380> door<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.830> the
