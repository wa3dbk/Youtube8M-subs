objectives now you can if you want to be

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.470 
objectives now you can if you want to be
completely<00:02:11.980> stealth<00:02:12.430> do<00:02:12.700> all<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.030> bonus

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.009 
objectives the option
objectives<00:02:15.129> rather<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:16.239> you<00:02:16.269> take<00:02:16.810> your<00:02:16.840> time

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
objectives rather and you take your time

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.589 
objectives rather and you take your time
you<00:02:17.590> can<00:02:17.980> probably<00:02:18.219> still<00:02:18.730> get<00:02:18.969> a<00:02:19.030> high<00:02:19.120> enough

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
you can probably still get a high enough

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.599 
you can probably still get a high enough
score<00:02:19.859> but<00:02:20.859> you're<00:02:20.980> not<00:02:21.129> going<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.400> get<00:02:21.519> as

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
score but you're not going to get as

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.000 
score but you're not going to get as
many<00:02:21.760> points<00:02:22.060> within<00:02:22.569> because<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.379> time<00:02:23.769> is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
many points within because the time is

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.800 
many points within because the time is
going<00:02:24.159> to<00:02:24.189> take<00:02:24.370> much<00:02:24.579> longer<00:02:24.969> and<00:02:25.209> time<00:02:25.420> gives

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
going to take much longer and time gives

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.580 
going to take much longer and time gives
you<00:02:25.989> a<00:02:26.019> huge<00:02:26.620> chunk<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.569> your<00:02:28.569> score<00:02:29.170> as<00:02:29.379> you'll

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
you a huge chunk of your score as you'll

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.610 
you a huge chunk of your score as you'll
see<00:02:29.769> at<00:02:29.859> the<00:02:29.920> end<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.459> results<00:02:31.180> screen

and<00:03:52.800> now<00:03:53.340> we<00:03:53.400> need<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.850> get<00:03:54.240> to<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.450> extraction

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
and now we need to get to the extraction

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.010 
and now we need to get to the extraction
point<00:03:55.319> now<00:03:55.890> there's<00:03:56.100> about<00:03:56.370> 15<00:03:57.300> or<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:57.720> maybe

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
point now there's about 15 or so maybe

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.980 
point now there's about 15 or so maybe
even<00:03:58.110> more<00:03:58.470> enemies<00:03:58.890> in<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.340> little<00:03:59.640> village

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
even more enemies in this little village

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.059 
even more enemies in this little village
so<00:04:00.990> when<00:04:01.200> you're<00:04:01.319> trying<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.650> get<00:04:01.800> here

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
so when you're trying to get here

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.680 
so when you're trying to get here
obviously<00:04:02.370> be<00:04:02.819> careful<00:04:02.850> if<00:04:03.270> you<00:04:03.360> take<00:04:03.540> the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
obviously be careful if you take the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.990 
obviously be careful if you take the
route<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.900> take<00:04:04.260> in<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.190> time<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.490> I<00:04:05.700> take

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
route I take in the time that I take

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.190 
route I take in the time that I take
because<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.330> path<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.780> always<00:04:06.900> going<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.140> be

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
because the path is always going to be

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.800 
because the path is always going to be
the<00:04:07.350> same<00:04:07.760> but<00:04:08.760> based<00:04:08.970> on<00:04:09.120> how<00:04:09.270> quickly<00:04:09.480> you

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
the same but based on how quickly you

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.750 
the same but based on how quickly you
get<00:04:10.020> will<00:04:10.650> determine<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.190> enemy's<00:04:11.580> location

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
get will determine the enemy's location

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.060 
get will determine the enemy's location
so<00:04:12.390> it<00:04:12.570> might<00:04:12.780> not<00:04:12.840> play<00:04:13.200> out<00:04:13.410> exactly<00:04:13.890> the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
so it might not play out exactly the

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.009 
so it might not play out exactly the
same<00:04:14.280> for<00:04:14.550> you<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:15.240> I'm<00:04:15.330> gonna<00:04:15.480> go<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:15.810> take

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
same for you so I'm gonna go and take

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.199 
same for you so I'm gonna go and take
him<00:04:16.169> run<00:04:16.440> over<00:04:16.470> I'd<00:04:17.280> be<00:04:17.340> careful<00:04:17.700> there<00:04:18.060> might

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
him run over I'd be careful there might

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.690 
him run over I'd be careful there might
be<00:04:18.239> some<00:04:18.480> enemies<00:04:18.840> off<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.290> right<00:04:19.700> it

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
be some enemies off to the right it

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.970 
be some enemies off to the right it
doesn't<00:04:20.850> seem<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.299> be<00:04:21.450> any<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:22.079> me<00:04:22.169> now<00:04:22.380> now

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
doesn't seem to be any for me now now

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.440 
doesn't seem to be any for me now now
we're<00:04:23.160> supposed<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.490> get<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.850> extraction

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
we're supposed to get to the extraction

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.540 
we're supposed to get to the extraction
point<00:04:24.690> now<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.200> game<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:26.010> automatically

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
point now the game is automatically

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.520 
point now the game is automatically
going<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:26.820> put<00:04:27.120> an<00:04:27.270> extraction<00:04:27.870> point<00:04:28.110> marker

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
going to put an extraction point marker

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.590 
going to put an extraction point marker
on<00:04:28.980> your<00:04:29.280> screen<00:04:29.610> we<00:04:29.850> don't<00:04:30.090> want<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.419> go<00:04:30.540> to

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
on your screen we don't want to go to

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.480 
on your screen we don't want to go to
that<00:04:30.810> we're<00:04:31.710> gonna<00:04:31.830> meet<00:04:32.040> what<00:04:32.190> they<00:04:32.280> call

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.420 
that we're gonna meet what they call
skulls<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.300> if<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.350> can<00:04:34.530> extract<00:04:35.220> yourself

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
skulls and if you can extract yourself

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.430 
skulls and if you can extract yourself
without<00:04:36.000> meeting<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.900> skulls<00:04:37.200> you'll

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
without meeting the skulls you'll

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.050 
without meeting the skulls you'll
actually<00:04:37.620> get<00:04:37.860> bonus<00:04:38.250> points<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:38.640> I'm<00:04:38.790> going

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
actually get bonus points so I'm going

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.550 
actually get bonus points so I'm going
into<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.390> menu<00:04:39.660> here<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:39.990> selecting<00:04:40.470> a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
into the menu here and selecting a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.300 
into the menu here and selecting a
different<00:04:40.940> landing<00:04:41.940> zone<00:04:42.620> and<00:04:43.620> this<00:04:43.980> is<00:04:44.130> gonna

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
different landing zone and this is gonna

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.730 
different landing zone and this is gonna
actually<00:04:44.490> get<00:04:44.820> me<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.000> five<00:04:45.660> thousand<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.320> bonus

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
actually get me a five thousand a bonus

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.440 
actually get me a five thousand a bonus
point<00:04:48.020> for<00:04:49.020> avoiding<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.680> skulls<00:04:50.300> one<00:04:51.300> of<00:04:51.390> the

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
point for avoiding the skulls one of the

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.260 
point for avoiding the skulls one of the
optional<00:04:51.900> objectives<00:04:52.669> so<00:04:53.669> at<00:04:53.730> this<00:04:53.820> point<00:04:54.000> we

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
optional objectives so at this point we

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.210 
optional objectives so at this point we
just<00:04:54.510> need<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.960> escape<00:04:55.470> there<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:55.860> someone

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
just need to escape there is someone

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.280 
just need to escape there is someone
that's<00:04:56.370> kind<00:04:56.669> of<00:04:56.820> sees<00:04:57.030> me<00:04:57.240> but<00:04:57.419> they<00:04:57.660> don't<00:04:57.990> so

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
that's kind of sees me but they don't so

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.940 
that's kind of sees me but they don't so
we're<00:04:58.470> good<00:04:58.710> there<00:04:58.890> on<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.100> combat<00:04:59.490> alerts

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
we're good there on the combat alerts

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.610 
we're good there on the combat alerts
again<00:05:01.950> really<00:05:02.520> focus<00:05:02.850> on<00:05:02.970> time<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.570> to<00:05:04.440> get

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
again really focus on time is to get

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.020 
again really focus on time is to get
your<00:05:04.740> ass<00:05:04.800> ring<00:05:05.130> because<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.490> is<00:05:05.669> going<00:05:05.880> to

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
your ass ring because that is going to

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.930 
your ass ring because that is going to
provide<00:05:06.740> almost<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.860> hundred<00:05:07.979> percent<00:05:08.190> of<00:05:08.700> the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
provide almost a hundred percent of the

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.190 
provide almost a hundred percent of the
s-rank<00:05:09.270> I<00:05:09.419> think<00:05:09.660> there's<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.900> couple<00:05:10.050> of

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
s-rank I think there's a couple of

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.710 
s-rank I think there's a couple of
missions<00:05:10.380> were<00:05:10.710> I<00:05:10.979> got<00:05:11.850> enough<00:05:12.180> points<00:05:12.360> just

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
missions were I got enough points just

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.380 
missions were I got enough points just
from<00:05:12.840> time<00:05:13.050> just<00:05:13.410> being<00:05:13.560> really<00:05:13.919> quick<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:15.270> get

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
from time just being really quick to get

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.670 
from time just being really quick to get
the<00:05:15.570> s<00:05:15.660> ring<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:18.360> here's<00:05:18.600> my<00:05:18.750> extraction<00:05:19.140> point

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
the s ring so here's my extraction point

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.760 
the s ring so here's my extraction point
I<00:05:19.770> put<00:05:20.180> up<00:05:21.180> up<00:05:21.419> my<00:05:21.540> buddy<00:05:21.750> here<00:05:22.020> on<00:05:22.140> the<00:05:22.229> horse<00:05:22.440> I

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
I put up up my buddy here on the horse I

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.010 
I put up up my buddy here on the horse I
got<00:05:23.310> to<00:05:23.400> take<00:05:23.550> them<00:05:23.669> off<00:05:23.850> and<00:05:24.060> put<00:05:24.390> him<00:05:24.600> into

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
got to take them off and put him into

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.370 
got to take them off and put him into
the<00:05:25.169> helicopter<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:27.870> that'll<00:05:28.200> actually

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
the helicopter and that'll actually

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.189 
the helicopter and that'll actually
complete<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.160> objective

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.290 

now<00:05:35.770> we're<00:05:35.949> going<00:05:36.099> to<00:05:36.159> hop<00:05:36.310> on<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.849> that<00:05:37.060> is

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
now we're going to hop on and that is

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.159 
now we're going to hop on and that is
going<00:05:37.599> to<00:05:38.039> end<00:05:39.039> the<00:05:39.340> end<00:05:40.029> the<00:05:40.689> mission<00:05:41.020> I'm

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
going to end the end the mission I'm

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.709 
going to end the end the mission I'm
going<00:05:41.349> to<00:05:41.409> get<00:05:41.560> the<00:05:41.710> s-rank<00:05:42.270> again<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.449> time

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
going to get the s-rank again the time
