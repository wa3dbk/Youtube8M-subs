go ahead and move out with these units I
realized<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.759> he<00:01:20.909> does<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.240> fact<00:01:21.270> take<00:01:21.960> this

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
realized that he does in fact take this

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.770 
realized that he does in fact take this
high<00:01:22.650> high<00:01:23.159> ground<00:01:23.430> orbital<00:01:23.820> command<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
high high ground orbital command so I

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.539 
high high ground orbital command so I
want<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> really<00:01:25.259> punish<00:01:25.530> him<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.250> I'm

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
want to really punish him for it and I'm

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
want to really punish him for it and I'm
going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.729> try<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.119> use<00:01:27.390> these<00:01:27.540> banshees<00:01:27.990> with

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
going to try to use these banshees with

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.749 
going to try to use these banshees with
these<00:01:28.350> huge<00:01:28.530> changes<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> push<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.520> lower

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
these huge changes to push on this lower

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.340 
these huge changes to push on this lower

these destructible rocks and he will in

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.240 
these destructible rocks and he will in
fact<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.750> able<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.380> siege<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.070> this

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
fact be able to just siege up on this

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.670 
fact be able to just siege up on this
high<00:01:38.460> ground<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.600> he<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.140> able<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.439> push

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
high ground and then he be able to push

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
high ground and then he be able to push
down<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:41.070> mighdal<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.670> my<00:01:42.240> orbital<00:01:42.600> command

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.240 
down on mighdal on my orbital command
down<00:01:43.170> over<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.770> that's<00:01:43.920> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> really

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
down over here so that's going to really

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
down over here so that's going to really
really<00:01:44.820> change<00:01:45.119> how<00:01:45.299> how<00:01:45.780> things<00:01:45.990> affect<00:01:46.110> me

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
really change how how things affect me

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.440 
really change how how things affect me
but<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> same<00:01:47.280> time<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.490> also<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:48.240> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
but at the same time I also have this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
but at the same time I also have this

patch coming in trying to take out these

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.340 
patch coming in trying to take out these
turrets<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.000> quickly<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.140> take<00:01:55.259> down

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350

these<00:01:55.500> currents<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.640> able<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.939> use

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
these currents I will be able to use

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.370 
these currents I will be able to use
these

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
these

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.170 
these
as<00:01:57.920> site<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:58.640> I'm<00:01:58.729> going<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.880> use<00:01:59.030> these

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
as site so I'm going to use these

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.760 
as site so I'm going to use these
panties<00:01:59.539> as<00:01:59.689> site<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.170> then<00:02:00.289> have<00:02:00.439> you<00:02:00.560> seen

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
panties as site and then have you seen

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.100 
panties as site and then have you seen
pushing<00:02:01.490> through<00:02:01.820> here<00:02:02.030> as<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:02.659> have<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.840> siege

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
pushing through here as we have a siege

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.499 
pushing through here as we have a siege
tank<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.560> some<00:02:04.189> Marines<00:02:04.490> trying<00:02:04.789> to<00:02:04.939> push<00:02:05.360> off

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509

tank and some Marines trying to push off
into<00:02:05.720> this<00:02:05.810> position<00:02:05.990> right<00:02:06.470> now<00:02:06.500> so<00:02:07.100> moving

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
into this position right now so moving

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.650 
into this position right now so moving
out<00:02:07.579> with<00:02:07.729> this<00:02:07.789> orbital<00:02:08.149> command<00:02:08.360> I'm<00:02:08.509> going

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
out with this orbital command I'm going

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.690 
out with this orbital command I'm going
to<00:02:08.720> transfer<00:02:09.050> all<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.229> my<00:02:09.380> SUVs<00:02:09.800> from<00:02:10.099> one<00:02:10.459> and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
to transfer all of my SUVs from one and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.900 
to transfer all of my SUVs from one and

one expansion place to another and then

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.100 
one expansion place to another and then
start<00:02:14.120> mining<00:02:14.360> out<00:02:14.599> of<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:14.780> particular

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
start mining out of this particular

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.570 
start mining out of this particular
location<00:02:15.349> going<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.800> go<00:02:15.920> ahead<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.190> move<00:02:16.400> this

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
location going to go ahead and move this

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.400 
location going to go ahead and move this
orbital<00:02:16.970> command<00:02:17.150> up<00:02:17.360> over<00:02:18.019> into<00:02:18.290> this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
orbital command up over into this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.640 
orbital command up over into this

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
position now for orbital command when

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.720 
position now for orbital command when
I'm<00:02:21.860> going<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.069> quickly<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.400> able<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.580> take

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
I'm going to quickly be able to take

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.160 
I'm going to quickly be able to take
down<00:02:22.819> most<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.269> these<00:02:23.390> additional<00:02:23.810> buildings

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.150 
down most of these additional buildings
and<00:02:24.290> now<00:02:24.349> I'm<00:02:24.410> going<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.590> try<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.709> take<00:02:24.830> down

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
and now I'm going to try to take down

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.790
