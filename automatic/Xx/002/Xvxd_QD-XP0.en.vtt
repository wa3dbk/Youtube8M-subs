sides<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.820> stuff<00:03:05.060> like<00:03:05.210> that<00:03:05.270> we're<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.930> little

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
sides and stuff like that we're a little

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.470 
sides and stuff like that we're a little
bit<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.610> browning<00:03:07.940> on<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.120> inside<00:03:08.450> of

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
bit of the the browning on the inside of

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.330 
bit of the the browning on the inside of
the<00:03:08.660> case<00:03:08.870> there<00:03:09.110> as<00:03:09.260> well<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.980> was<00:03:10.100> kind<00:03:10.310> of

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
the case there as well it was kind of

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.100 
the case there as well it was kind of
hard<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:10.640> see<00:03:10.880> in<00:03:11.000> this<00:03:11.030> light<00:03:11.180> but<00:03:11.630> what<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.900> do

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
hard to see in this light but what to do

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.710 
hard to see in this light but what to do
is<00:03:12.290> then<00:03:12.890> just<00:03:13.430> wrap<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.760> iphone<00:03:14.150> in<00:03:14.330> sewing

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
is then just wrap the iphone in sewing

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.600 
is then just wrap the iphone in sewing
on<00:03:14.840> safe<00:03:15.380> as<00:03:15.590> always<00:03:15.740> that<00:03:16.040> I've<00:03:16.130> got<00:03:16.310> screen

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
on safe as always that I've got screen

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.940 
on safe as always that I've got screen
shield<00:03:16.850> on<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.510> front<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:17.960> the<00:03:18.080> back<00:03:18.140> so

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
shield on the front and the back so

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.410 
shield on the front and the back so
we'll<00:03:19.160> see<00:03:19.340> if<00:03:19.370> this<00:03:19.610> fits<00:03:19.850> in<00:03:20.060> which<00:03:20.210> i'm<00:03:20.390> sure

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
we'll see if this fits in which i'm sure

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.230 
we'll see if this fits in which i'm sure
it<00:03:20.720> will<00:03:20.870> just<00:03:21.380> snap<00:03:21.620> straight<00:03:21.950> on<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.370> felt

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
it will just snap straight on I felt

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.640 
it will just snap straight on I felt
like<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.570> orange<00:03:23.720> would<00:03:23.990> go<00:03:24.110> quite<00:03:24.380> nicely

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
like the orange would go quite nicely

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.490 
like the orange would go quite nicely
with<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.150> black<00:03:26.150> iphone<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:27.110> as<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.350> can<00:03:27.470> see

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
with the black iphone and as you can see

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.290 
with the black iphone and as you can see
here<00:03:27.860> looks<00:03:28.100> really<00:03:28.460> stunning<00:03:28.760> on<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.060> phone

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
here looks really stunning on the phone

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.180 
here looks really stunning on the phone
I<00:03:29.540> think<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.200> orange<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.590> black<00:03:30.740> dude<00:03:30.950> go

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
I think the orange and the black dude go

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.949 
I think the orange and the black dude go
very<00:03:31.400> well<00:03:31.459> together<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.510> where<00:03:32.810> it's

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
very well together and where it's

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.690 
very well together and where it's
brushed<00:03:33.260> here<00:03:33.530> in<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:33.980> Matt<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.400> won't<00:03:34.580> as

impressed<00:04:01.820> in<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.150> case<00:04:02.360> it<00:04:02.540> really<00:04:02.660> does

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
impressed in this case it really does

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.479 
impressed in this case it really does
feel<00:04:03.110> high<00:04:03.290> quality<00:04:03.709> in<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:03.860> hand<00:04:04.070> I<00:04:04.220> really

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
feel high quality in the hand I really

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.220 
feel high quality in the hand I really
would<00:04:04.670> recommend<00:04:05.180> this<00:04:05.270> and<00:04:05.510> if<00:04:06.110> you're

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
would recommend this and if you're

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.780 
would recommend this and if you're
looking<00:04:06.500> for<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.770> snap<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.280> style<00:04:07.489> case

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
looking for a snap on the style case

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.120 
looking for a snap on the style case
doesn't<00:04:08.420> offer<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.989> most<00:04:09.020> in<00:04:09.530> drop

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
doesn't offer the most in drop

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.680 
doesn't offer the most in drop
protection<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.730> stuff<00:04:10.940> but<00:04:11.060> as<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.330> can<00:04:11.450> see

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
protection and stuff but as you can see

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.600 
protection and stuff but as you can see
actually<00:04:12.230> wraps<00:04:12.680> around<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:12.950> corners<00:04:13.400> here

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
actually wraps around the corners here

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.400 
actually wraps around the corners here
so<00:04:13.940> where<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.239> get<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:15.080> corners

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
so where you get and the corners

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.720 
so where you get and the corners
protector<00:04:15.860> which<00:04:16.010> is<00:04:16.190> obviously<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.549> most

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
protector which is obviously the most

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.240 
protector which is obviously the most
important<00:04:17.239> part<00:04:17.450> when<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:17.720> drop<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.140> I<00:04:18.290> think

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
important part when you drop it I think

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.099 
important part when you drop it I think
it<00:04:19.370> has<00:04:19.520> the<00:04:19.580> tiniest<00:04:20.330> lay<00:04:20.870> on<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.080> table

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
it has the tiniest lay on the table

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.500 
it has the tiniest lay on the table
design<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:21.980> it<00:04:22.580> feels<00:04:22.820> off<00:04:23.060> in<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.300> hand

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
design and it feels off in the hand

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.880 
design and it feels off in the hand
there<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:23.900> but<00:04:24.470> I<00:04:24.500> would<00:04:24.740> definitely

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
there and but I would definitely

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.740 
there and but I would definitely
recommend<00:04:25.100> this<00:04:25.550> one<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:26.120> definitely<00:04:26.480> go

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
recommend this one and definitely go

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.010 
recommend this one and definitely go
check<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:27.140> out<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.530> is<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.370> alar<00:04:28.790> go<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.240> you

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
check it out it is the alar go and you

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.420 
check it out it is the alar go and you
