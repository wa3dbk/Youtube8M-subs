00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 so let's go guys for a review 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.009
 molecular biology and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.519
 In this video I'll talk a little bit 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.679
 for you cell cycle cells 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.530
 mainly the cells 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.680
 mammalian right this cell cycle 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.310
 people can say that it is a cycle in which 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.100
 the cell is programmed to divide or 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.740
 either make a clone of yourself 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.920
 and for this event to occur we have 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.590
 some important steps that the cell 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.219
 you need to go through that promote your 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.989
 cell division which is then mitosis 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.570
 first of all we have to think about the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.540
 cell when she's not sharing a 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.030
 cell when it is not dividing it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.079
 is in a latent phase that we call 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.039
 phase 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.980
 g zero so that the cell exits this phase 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.920
 latency it needs to receive a 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.260
 external stimulus and this external stimulus 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.899
 can be various routes 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.390
 but at the end of the day we need 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.760
 activate a complex of molecules 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.500
 important for the cell to enter a 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.840
 cell cycle which is the phase g1 almost sg 2 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.630
 and mitosis so that the cell cycle 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.119
 if we can activate we must induce the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.350
 production disciplines disciplines 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.549
 dependent and that this early nasi 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.710
 depends on the production of what we call 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.810
 of retinoblastoma complex I'm not going 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.100
 this topic because the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.960
 a very extensive topic a path of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.900
 signaling but in a very 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.210
 general we have to activate the cyclical and 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.060
 then when those inclines are activated 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.110
 we set off a series of responses 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.530
 in the cell 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.509
 so that she can promote all the events there 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.540
 so she can split so first 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.119
 everything in stage g1 the cell begins to 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.090
 produce the proteins important for the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.420
 phase is whether the enzymes that go 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.790
 to promote dna replication after 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.950
 all the resins are ready 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.320
 we enter the phase s which is the phase where 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.600
 the genetic material will be duplicated and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.670
 We have all those events there. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.520
 opening of the prof have connection of the dna 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.740
 polymer information of the new tape both 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.560
 on the delayed tape as 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.220
 the delayed tape finally several processes 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.640
 as soon as the whole cell dna is 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.120
 replicated 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.130
 we have g2 stage that we have here the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.110
 increase in cell mass 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.090
 then this dna replication we have 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.150
 mass production of a series of 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.240
 proteins so that this cell of life 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.190
 these proteins between two cells 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.720
 after increasing its mass already produced 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.450
 amount of protein required 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.660
 then it enters the activation mechanism of the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.700
 victory mitosis we can divide into 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.400
 some phases with an internal phase rasi 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.510
 evidence of metal did in the phase and have 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.090
 new good 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.790
 basically in the interphase the initial phase 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.950
 victory where the cell is full of 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.230
 components there to promote this 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.440
 division and it goes to the next 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.810
 stage testing to where the dna he 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.990
 the entire chromatin is condensed. 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.980
 completely condensed so that it 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:16.070
 is exposed in the cell in a manner to 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.990
 where the mitotic spindles between us 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.510
 able to carry these 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.280
 chromosomes for the poles and then thereafter 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.790
 that it condenses all the chromosomes 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.290
 stay in the center of the cell that we 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.240
 we reached the stage of metastasis 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.600
 here we have the mitotic spindles 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.930
 among others they are aligned here with the 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.300
 duplicate chromosomes and from this 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.630
 alignment what will happen each pair 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.630
 of chromosomes will be pulled to the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.450
 poles of the cell that is in the analysis phase 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.110
 but when they are pulled into the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.620
 poles these chromosomes will deconstruct 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.540
 hand to structure the core exists all 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.020
 a complex event for that to happen 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.750
 and the cell goes physiognomy 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.960
 it will distribute its membrane and then 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.040
 this function we will have a new 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:13.340
 cell is when division ends 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.040
 cell phone we have a clone of the mother cell 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.470
 and you can look here in this framework 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.150
 amount of DNA we will have 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.040
 over a cell cycle 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.310
 so here in phase 1 we do not have a 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.490
 increased DNA mass per due 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.039
 of us are producing 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.039
 we need them at the stage s we go 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:35.660
 begin to produce continuously until the 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:38.759
 get 4 copies of each chromosome 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.060
 in the tetraploid fields a certain moment 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.130
 this in the condition of mitó zi in the phase g2 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.440
 we have the massive production of proteins 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.229
 and then in the condition of mitó ze 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.289
 this amount of dna reduces 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.160
 again to 2 ie we have become 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.280
 blogs 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.940
 then when it is finished in the 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:05.330
 then these cells become cells 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.330
 of blogs to the end of cell replication
