00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.169 

so<00:00:13.019> grab<00:00:13.380> your<00:00:13.410> polymer<00:00:13.920> clay<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.940> course

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
so grab your polymer clay and of course

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.760 
so grab your polymer clay and of course
this<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.509> going<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.690> be<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.020> body<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
this is going to be the body and the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.950 
this is going to be the body and the
spout<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.940> lot<00:00:18.090> easier<00:00:18.270> instead<00:00:18.810> of

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
spout so it's a lot easier instead of

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.769 
spout so it's a lot easier instead of
you<00:00:19.109> attaching<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> spout<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.699> body<00:00:20.910> so

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
you attaching the spout to the body so

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.570 
you attaching the spout to the body so
definitely<00:00:22.470> use<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.650> reference<00:00:22.890> picture<00:00:23.400> it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
definitely use a reference picture it

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.900 
definitely use a reference picture it
helps<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.060> lot<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.010> what<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.099> want<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.640> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
helps a lot and what you want to do is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.310 
helps a lot and what you want to do is
make<00:00:27.180> sure<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.570> get<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> body<00:00:28.019> right

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
make sure that you get the body right

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.920 
make sure that you get the body right
because<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> spout<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.609> easiest<00:00:30.000> part<00:00:35.930> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
because the spout is the easiest part so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.810 
because the spout is the easiest part so

piece of clay and place it right on top
of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.200> lid<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.400> should<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.970> set<00:01:09.299> so

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
of the lid and you should be all set so

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.719 
of the lid and you should be all set so

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.880 

now<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> hardest<00:01:15.270> part<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.290> charm<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
now the hardest part of this charm is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.950 
now the hardest part of this charm is
really<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> handle<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.659> very

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
really just the handle it's very

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.740 
really just the handle it's very
distinct<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.700> want<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.630> what

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
distinct so what you want to do and what

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.270 
distinct so what you want to do and what
you<00:01:21.840> want<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> start<00:01:22.229> off<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> noodle

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you want to start off with is a noodle

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.850 
you want to start off with is a noodle
and<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:24.180> course<00:01:24.420> create<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
and of course create that like that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.600 
and of course create that like that
small<00:01:26.310> swish<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:27.979> but<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> handle<00:01:29.460> is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
small swish and then but the handle is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.310 
small swish and then but the handle is
the<00:01:29.640> hardest<00:01:30.150> part<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:31.110> you're<00:01:31.229> gonna

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the hardest part and what you're gonna

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960 
the hardest part and what you're gonna
do<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.619> gonna<00:01:31.710> stick<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.759> have

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
do is gonna stick that on when you have

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.840 
do is gonna stick that on when you have
the<00:01:33.299> right<00:01:33.780> size<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.920> course<00:01:35.189> use<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the right size so of course use a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.730 
the right size so of course use a
reference<00:01:36.329> picture<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:37.049> can't<00:01:37.590> really

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
reference picture I can't really

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.499 
reference picture I can't really
describe<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.729> make<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> handle

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
describe to you how to make the handle

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.069 
describe to you how to make the handle
but<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:40.710> should<00:01:40.890> look<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
but this is what should look like and

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.960 
but this is what should look like and
when<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.140> fire<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.950> course<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> use

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
when you fire it of course if you use

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.670 
when you fire it of course if you use
three<00:01:45.180> colored<00:01:45.570> clay<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.229> totally<00:01:46.530> skip

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
three colored clay you can totally skip

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.069 
three colored clay you can totally skip
this<00:01:46.920> part<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.540> go<00:01:48.540> ahead<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.930> add<00:01:49.049> your

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
this part if not go ahead and add your

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.440 
this part if not go ahead and add your
base<00:01:49.380> colors<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.040> decided<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.610> go<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.180> black

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
base colors I decided to go with a black

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.710 
base colors I decided to go with a black
and<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:52.770> afterwards<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.820> went<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.329> with<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
and then afterwards I went in with the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.649 
and then afterwards I went in with the
gold<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.219> gold<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.399> hard<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.670> paint<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.149> so

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
gold and gold is hard to paint with so

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.899 
gold and gold is hard to paint with so
you<00:01:58.020> add<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.590> lot<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.860> layers<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.640> for<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
you add a lot of layers just for the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.870 
you add a lot of layers just for the
gold

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.069 

so<00:02:05.880> Aladdin<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.450> definitely<00:02:06.840> one<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> my
