for a walk here in the United States at

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.860 
for a walk here in the United States at
least<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> comes<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.649> NFA<00:00:44.210> items<00:00:45.210> hopefully

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
least as it comes to NFA items hopefully

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.150 
least as it comes to NFA items hopefully
that<00:00:46.079> changes<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> future<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.039> get

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that changes in the future and we get

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.799 
that changes in the future and we get
some<00:00:47.280> clarification<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> maybe<00:00:48.600> what

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
some clarification on it maybe what

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.619 
some clarification on it maybe what
SIG's<00:00:49.079> doing<00:00:49.379> here<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.680> gonna<00:00:49.860> lead<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.129> that

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
SIG's doing here is gonna lead to that

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.529 
SIG's doing here is gonna lead to that
so<00:00:52.160> basically<00:00:53.160> obviously<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.969> open<00:00:54.360> letter

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
so basically obviously the open letter

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.270 
so basically obviously the open letter
has<00:00:54.750> probably<00:00:55.170> heard<00:00:55.289> sig<00:00:55.649> sales<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.160> would

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
has probably heard sig sales I would

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
has probably heard sig sales I would
imagine<00:00:56.460> their<00:00:56.969> braces<00:00:57.719> program<00:00:58.020> selling<00:00:58.350> as

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
imagine their braces program selling as

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.810 
imagine their braces program selling as
well<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.649> people<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.070> afraid<00:00:59.250> they're<00:00:59.609> unsure

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
well as people are afraid they're unsure

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.819 
well as people are afraid they're unsure
of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> environment<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.530> sig<00:01:01.710> has

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
of the environment so the sig has

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.830 
of the environment so the sig has
responded<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.550> basically<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.690> they're

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
responded and basically what they're

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.370 
responded and basically what they're
saying<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:05.810> DTS<00:01:06.810> letter<00:01:07.049> they're<00:01:07.229> not

also Arkansan what confused by it so
again<00:01:12.060> I'm<00:01:12.150> gonna<00:01:12.240> read<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> second

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
again I'm gonna read here for a second

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.070 
again I'm gonna read here for a second
this<00:01:13.560> portion<00:01:14.070> comes<00:01:14.280> from<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> ATF's<00:01:15.600> letter

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
this portion comes from the ATF's letter

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.640 
this portion comes from the ATF's letter
so<00:01:17.180> they're<00:01:18.180> saying<00:01:18.420> ATF<00:01:18.900> hereby<00:01:19.229> confirms

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
so they're saying ATF hereby confirms

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.920 
so they're saying ATF hereby confirms
that<00:01:19.890> if<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.250> use<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.580> designed<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.600> assist

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that if you use this designed to assist

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.350 
that if you use this designed to assist
shooters<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.530> stabilizing<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.310> handgun<00:01:23.700> while

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
shooters and stabilizing a handgun while

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.870 
shooters and stabilizing a handgun while
shooting<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> single<00:01:25.560> hand<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.610> device

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
shooting with a single hand the device

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.399 
shooting with a single hand the device
is<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.240> considered<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.689> shoulder<00:01:27.990> stock<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
is not considered a shoulder stock and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.870 
is not considered a shoulder stock and
therefore<00:01:28.799> may<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.009> attached<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.579> handgun

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
therefore may be attached to a handgun

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.929 
therefore may be attached to a handgun
without<00:01:30.390> making<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.079> an<00:01:31.200> NFA<00:01:31.530> firearm<00:01:32.100> that's

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
without making it an NFA firearm that's

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.280 
without making it an NFA firearm that's
from<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> letter<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.570> keep<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.930> mind<00:01:34.140> they

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
from the letter but keep in mind they

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.840 
from the letter but keep in mind they
said<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.680> while<00:01:34.890> shouldering<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.759> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
said that while shouldering it if you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.819 
said that while shouldering it if you
put<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.270> brace<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.810> your<00:01:36.930> shoulder<00:01:37.290> that

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
put that brace in your shoulder that

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.230 
put that brace in your shoulder that
makes<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.340> legal<00:01:38.720> so<00:01:40.310> sig<00:01:41.310> writes<00:01:41.549> back

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
makes it legal so sig writes back

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.330

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so that's really obvious Lee there bone

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.399 
so that's really obvious Lee there bone
of<00:02:00.180> contention<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.960> with<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.200> lot<00:02:01.350> of

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
of contention as it is with a lot of

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.130 
of contention as it is with a lot of
citizens<00:02:02.159> out<00:02:02.310> there<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.390> somehow<00:02:03.840> I

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
citizens out there that this somehow I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.230 
citizens out there that this somehow I
think<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:04.979> instance<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> were<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> take<00:02:06.000> a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
think for instance if you were to take a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.789 
think for instance if you were to take a
pistol<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.899> put<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.200> your<00:02:07.290> shoulder<00:02:07.649> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
pistol and put it on your shoulder and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.130 
pistol and put it on your shoulder and
fire<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.220> an<00:02:08.520> actual<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.270> Glock<00:02:09.479> 17<00:02:09.959> would

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
fire it an actual like a Glock 17 would

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.780 
fire it an actual like a Glock 17 would
that<00:02:10.319> make<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.739> rifle<00:02:11.039> if<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.400> were<00:02:11.700> to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that make it a rifle if you were to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.550 
that make it a rifle if you were to
shoot<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.090> pistol<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.840> two<00:02:12.989> hands

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
shoot a pistol with two hands

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.000 
shoot a pistol with two hands
many<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.890> us<00:02:14.010> do<00:02:14.190> does<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.610> make<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:14.970> pay<00:02:15.239> s<00:02:15.630> BR

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
many of us do does that make it pay s BR

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.559 
many of us do does that make it pay s BR
so<00:02:17.010> those<00:02:17.190> are<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> kind<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.610> things<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:17.970> are

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
so those are the kind of things that are

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.830 
so those are the kind of things that are
very<00:02:18.599> confusing<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.069> say<00:02:20.459> wants

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
very confusing so say wants

very confusing so say wants
clarification<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.200> ultimately<00:02:22.470> I'm
