change is that the power button has

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.830 
change is that the power button has
actually<00:02:02.759> moved<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.210> top<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> phone

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.080 
actually moved from the top of the phone
to<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> right<00:02:04.890> side<00:02:05.310> next<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> SIM<00:02:06.060> card

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.660

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
to put it especially because we now have

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.490
