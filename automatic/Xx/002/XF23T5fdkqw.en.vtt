00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
if you want to see that now that we got

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.400 
if you want to see that now that we got
the<00:02:11.510> box<00:02:11.690> out<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.960> way<00:02:12.020> we<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.290> actually

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
the box out of the way we can actually

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.900 
the box out of the way we can actually
take<00:02:12.710> a<00:02:12.770> look<00:02:12.950> at<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.069> unit<00:02:13.340> see<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.640> yellow

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
take a look at the unit see the yellow

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.360 
take a look at the unit see the yellow
trim<00:02:14.209> on<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.690> camera<00:02:15.110> bezel<00:02:15.440> there<00:02:15.650> at<00:02:15.920> yellow

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
trim on the camera bezel there at yellow

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.130 
trim on the camera bezel there at yellow
trim<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.730> also<00:02:17.000> duplicated<00:02:17.540> on<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.780> volume

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
trim is also duplicated on the volume

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.860 
trim is also duplicated on the volume
keys<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:19.220> decided<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.819> go<00:02:19.970> for<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.360> white

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
keys and I decided to go for a white

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.460 
keys and I decided to go for a white
face<00:02:21.319> plate<00:02:21.650> instead<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.520> black<00:02:23.470> figuring

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
face plate instead of the black figuring

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.470 
face plate instead of the black figuring
that<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.680> black<00:02:24.890> would<00:02:25.100> clash<00:02:25.340> with<00:02:25.370> blue<00:02:26.060> and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
that the black would clash with blue and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
that the black would clash with blue and
hopefully<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:26.959> made<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.290> right<00:02:27.440> decision

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
hopefully I made the right decision

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.280 
hopefully I made the right decision
there<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.820> interesting<00:02:29.390> first<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.200> all

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
there it is interesting first of all

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.570 
there it is interesting first of all
it's<00:02:30.380> interesting<00:02:30.590> how<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.040> unit<00:02:31.340> looks

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
it's interesting how this unit looks

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.730 
it's interesting how this unit looks
with<00:02:32.240> gunner<00:02:32.480> optics<00:02:32.840> on<00:02:32.990> let's<00:02:33.260> go<00:02:33.500> ahead<00:02:33.650> and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
with gunner optics on let's go ahead and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.790 
with gunner optics on let's go ahead and
take<00:02:33.890> those<00:02:34.070> off<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:35.110> now<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.650> actually

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
take those off and now I can actually

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.280 
take those off and now I can actually
see<00:02:36.980> there<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.580> not<00:02:37.850> much<00:02:38.330> contrast<00:02:39.080> between

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
see there is not much contrast between

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.210 
see there is not much contrast between
the<00:02:39.680> yellow<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:41.209> white<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:42.709> boy<00:02:42.980> it

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
the yellow and the white but boy it

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.220 
the yellow and the white but boy it
really<00:02:43.550> pops<00:02:43.820> nicely<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:44.959> feel<00:02:45.200> I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
really pops nicely in the this feel I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.930 
really pops nicely in the this feel I
was<00:02:45.470> worried<00:02:45.739> about<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:46.010> back<00:02:46.190> cover<00:02:46.489> feeling

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
was worried about the back cover feeling

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.720 
was worried about the back cover feeling
different<00:02:47.650> considering<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.769> lacks<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.130> that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
different considering it lacks that that

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.330 
different considering it lacks that that
we've<00:02:50.000> finished<00:02:50.540> but<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.709> doesn't<00:02:52.100> it's<00:02:52.250> just

other experience not necessarily because

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.050

the<00:03:39.739> colors<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.100> chose<00:03:40.280> but<00:03:40.820> because<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.959> know

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
the colors I chose but because you know

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.979 
the colors I chose but because you know

casing or a skin I mean probably do a
scan<00:03:48.769> but<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:48.980> wouldn't<00:03:49.160> look<00:03:49.280> very<00:03:49.340> good<00:03:49.519> you

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480

scan but it wouldn't look very good you
know<00:03:50.600> or<00:03:50.780> anything<00:03:50.930> like<00:03:51.079> that<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.260> mean<00:03:51.470> these

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.750

know that I like the blue I like the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.920 
know that I like the blue I like the
yellow<00:03:57.829> I<00:03:58.160> wish<00:03:58.850> that<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.180> had<00:03:59.299> had<00:03:59.329> more<00:03:59.720> than

yellow I wish that I had had more than

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.420

two<00:04:00.200> choices<00:04:00.470> for<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.860> faceplate<00:04:01.280> because

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
two choices for the faceplate because

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.069 
two choices for the faceplate because
I'm<00:04:01.519> not<00:04:01.640> sure<00:04:01.940> I<00:04:01.970> love<00:04:02.360> this<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.870> white

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
I'm not sure I love this the white

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.620 
I'm not sure I love this the white
faceplate<00:04:03.560> on<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:03.769> device<00:04:04.010> but<00:04:04.820> aside<00:04:05.570> from

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
faceplate on this device but aside from

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.860 
faceplate on this device but aside from
that<00:04:05.840> mild<00:04:06.799> bit<00:04:07.190> of<00:04:07.340> concern<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:08.060> think<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.720> would

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
that mild bit of concern I think I would

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.920 
that mild bit of concern I think I would
be<00:04:08.959> pretty<00:04:09.230> happy<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:10.310> open<00:04:10.700> up<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.390> box<00:04:11.630> to

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
be pretty happy to open up the box to

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.860 
be pretty happy to open up the box to
find<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.320> phone<00:04:12.530> like<00:04:13.519> this<00:04:13.549> because<00:04:14.239> I<00:04:14.269> like<00:04:14.660> my

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
find a phone like this because I like my

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.159 
find a phone like this because I like my
own<00:04:15.019> design

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169
