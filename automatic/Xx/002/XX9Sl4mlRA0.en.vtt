00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
peva X trooper case um one of the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.570 
peva X trooper case um one of the
original<00:01:21.369> newer<00:01:22.369> cases<00:01:22.880> from<00:01:23.119> up<00:01:23.390> Eva<00:01:24.310> this<00:01:25.310> is

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
original newer cases from up Eva this is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.520 
original newer cases from up Eva this is
what<00:01:26.000> or<00:01:26.179> was<00:01:26.600> my<00:01:26.929> first<00:01:27.229> build<00:01:27.500> and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
what or was my first build and

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.469 
what or was my first build and
considering<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:31.159> really<00:01:32.060> didn't<00:01:32.300> have<00:01:32.450> a

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
considering that I really didn't have a

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.899 
considering that I really didn't have a
clue<00:01:32.780> what<00:01:33.229> I<00:01:33.440> was<00:01:33.679> really<00:01:33.979> doing<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:36.640> yeah<00:01:37.640> you

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
clue what I was really doing so yeah you

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.309 
clue what I was really doing so yeah you
know<00:01:38.030> it's<00:01:38.240> one<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.479> those<00:01:38.630> trial<00:01:38.929> and<00:01:39.080> errors

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
know it's one of those trial and errors

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.790 
know it's one of those trial and errors
but<00:01:39.500> anyway<00:01:39.740> get<00:01:40.340> down<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.300> one<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.229> them<00:01:42.349> the

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
but anyway get down to one of them the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.270 
but anyway get down to one of them the
point<00:01:43.069> is<00:01:43.450> it's<00:01:44.450> an<00:01:44.660> open<00:01:44.989> case<00:01:45.200> which<00:01:46.069> is

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
point is it's an open case which is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.760 
point is it's an open case which is
really<00:01:46.580> good<00:01:46.789> but<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:47.599> allows<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:48.170> lot<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.470> dust

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
really good but it allows a lot of dust

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.940 
really good but it allows a lot of dust
and<00:01:49.129> so<00:01:49.610> because<00:01:50.390> of<00:01:50.539> this<00:01:50.629> I'm<00:01:51.140> having<00:01:51.679> a<00:01:51.770> lot

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
and so because of this I'm having a lot

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.580 
and so because of this I'm having a lot
of<00:01:51.979> dust<00:01:52.369> issues<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:53.569> a<00:01:53.780> fairly<00:01:54.200> new

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
of dust issues it's a fairly new

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.369 
of dust issues it's a fairly new
computer<00:01:55.429> so<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.030> really<00:01:56.629> should<00:01:56.959> not<00:01:57.140> have

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:57.379 
computer so I really should not have

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:00.900 
computer so I really should not have
this<00:01:57.619> does<00:01:57.979> problem<00:01:58.399> in<00:01:59.390> fact<00:01:59.750> I'm<00:02:00.080> actually

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
this does problem in fact I'm actually

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.600 
this does problem in fact I'm actually
tearing<00:02:01.910> off<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.300> sides<00:02:02.539> and<00:02:02.950> cleaning<00:02:03.950> it

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
tearing off the sides and cleaning it

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.119 
tearing off the sides and cleaning it
out<00:02:04.849> by<00:02:05.179> vacuuming<00:02:05.720> out<00:02:06.019> the<00:02:06.289> inside<00:02:06.619> quite

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
out by vacuuming out the inside quite

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.850 
out by vacuuming out the inside quite
often<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.179> really<00:02:09.019> ridiculous<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.739> me

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
often and it's really ridiculous to me

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.930 
often and it's really ridiculous to me
so<00:02:10.729> even<00:02:11.660> with<00:02:12.080> adding<00:02:12.590> filter<00:02:13.040> fan<00:02:13.489> filters

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
so even with adding filter fan filters

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.509 
so even with adding filter fan filters
and<00:02:14.239> everything<00:02:14.300> else<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:15.650> still<00:02:15.950> just<00:02:16.370> to

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
and everything else is still just to

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.410 
and everything else is still just to
open<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.330> dust<00:02:17.690> magnet<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:20.120> know<00:02:20.239> I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
open as a dust magnet and you know I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.080 
open as a dust magnet and you know I
love<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.989> design<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.860> people<00:02:22.310> did<00:02:22.489> really<00:02:22.519> good

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
love the design a people did really good

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.290

it's just to open I just have a lot of
dust<00:02:26.540> issues<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:28.940> um<00:02:29.739> I'm<00:02:30.739> gonna<00:02:30.980> leave<00:02:31.900> go

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
dust issues and so um I'm gonna leave go

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.089 
dust issues and so um I'm gonna leave go
away<00:02:33.019> from<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.650> peva

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
away from a peva

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
anyway it's just unfortunate I do have

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.730 
anyway it's just unfortunate I do have
the<00:03:31.030> app<00:03:31.300> Eva<00:03:32.790> was<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:33.970> 750<00:03:34.810> watt<00:03:35.290> power<00:03:35.650> supply

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
the app Eva was it 750 watt power supply

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.340 
the app Eva was it 750 watt power supply
and<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.970> lights<00:03:37.150> up<00:03:37.300> green<00:03:37.360> which<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.080> really

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
and it lights up green which is really

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.040 
and it lights up green which is really
cool<00:03:38.820> but<00:03:39.820> then<00:03:40.300> again<00:03:40.450> I'm<00:03:41.260> running<00:03:41.680> an<00:03:41.800> NZXT

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
cool but then again I'm running an NZXT

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.840 
cool but then again I'm running an NZXT
sentry<00:03:44.250> mix<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:46.140> 6<00:03:47.140> channel<00:03:47.850> fan

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
sentry mix it's a 6 channel fan

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.930 
sentry mix it's a 6 channel fan
controller<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:51.330> it's<00:03:52.330> 50<00:03:52.959> watts<00:03:53.260> per<00:03:53.770> channel

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
controller and it's 50 watts per channel

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.240 
controller and it's 50 watts per channel
which<00:03:54.940> is<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.209> bit<00:03:55.600> too<00:03:55.840> much<00:03:56.020> for<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:57.070> power

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
which is a bit too much for the power

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.360 
which is a bit too much for the power
supply<00:03:57.550> and<00:03:58.000> running<00:03:59.010> everything<00:04:00.010> that's

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
supply and running everything that's

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.280 
supply and running everything that's
running<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:01.770> yeah<00:04:02.770> sometimes<00:04:03.610> my<00:04:04.030> fans<00:04:04.300> cut

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
running so yeah sometimes my fans cut

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.490 
running so yeah sometimes my fans cut
off<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.770> turn<00:04:06.430> back<00:04:06.610> on<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:08.020> don't<00:04:08.140> know<00:04:08.380> if

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
off and turn back on and I don't know if

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.350
