00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:02.040
 In this movie 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.480
 While viewing the rendered image 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.270
 Set as an exception 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.839
 The company's 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:09.519
 Configuration 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.519
 In addition, we set up more expensively together 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.619
 Let's refer to this image 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.170
 This picture is with the light system 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.450
 Haigle katherine- 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.150
 Effective non-payment of president 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.109
 There is an image of the appearance 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.890
 You can check the appearance of the building 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.210
 Background or 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.260
 When I look at the environment etc. I am very retired 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.990
 Check the building as an image 2 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.480
 It seems like a main force 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.850
 It becomes an image in the field 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.120
 Next, check this viewport rendered image 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.340
 let's do it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.380
 this 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.610
 In the image 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.620
 Expression of sunlight 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.600
 It is called the perspective of the air 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.870
 A sense of closeness 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.950
 Clearly 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.950
 I will set the settings to express 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.920
 Station buildings 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.430
 In the set state 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.930
 I have an average year 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.870
 If you confirm this sunlight, the expression as it is issued is 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.250
 It has been 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.260
 Smiling mentalray that I regret 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.750
 To the supervisor of the menu in the park 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.670
 This kind of expression is because it is an enemy 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.670
 It will be possible 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.240
 Like making a coin of this yen called air perspective 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.430
 Representation is the aerial perspective of the daylight system 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.370
 By 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.080
 It will be possible 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.520
 First of all, let's confirm the environment of the rendering menu. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.960
 As we offer Sky from My Page in Oni 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.640
 With trappen drop 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.250
 Again 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.250
 Offers 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.730
 This changes the origin of the physical sky population 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.730
 Will be able to 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.459
 Here is the BOJ Securities Co., Ltd. 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.690
 The parameters to change the settings are different 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.670
 This scale is said to be after relocation 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.300
 Also by the setting of this setting the grass of sunlight 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.890
 It can be confirmed by one side that it is changed in real time 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.049
 This makes it easy to express sunlight 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.099
 It will be possible 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.819
 Against the background 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:22.929
 It is called sky 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.539
 We provide image images 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.999
 This image is gracekelly 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.999
 To express that 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.169
 There is enough image 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.519
 In this way, lena Rina and the shaman are just ahead 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.949
 It will be referred to 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:43.549
 Sunlight is also expressed or another expression 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.399
 Let's check this image 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.249
 It's a sum rendered from around the glitch 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:52.779
 But 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.129
 Motion blur is expressed 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.129
 This motion blur is also from the effect of the camera 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.259
 By fusing in the heat 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.139
 It will be possible 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.129
 For this motion blur 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.439
 In real time 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.439
 It will be possible to check on the keyboard 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.919
 Click this preview icon 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.789
 By 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.869
 It is this camera view 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.579
 Moving day 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.669
 It will be possible to check the back effect 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.269
 Even people who can not usually motion Burano 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.489
 Itself 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.260
 It takes more time for the normal train than the image 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.809
 Like this 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.669
 On the other hand by being able to confirm bra on the way 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:37.540
 Moreover 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.260
 Check the image of the feeling when it leads to shortening 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.189
 let's do it 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.209
 Because this is hot 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.659
 It will be modern 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.149
 Unpopularity of this whole new 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.149
 Competing with glass-expression such as reflection 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.089
 Thereby 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:56.049
 Of the appearance while referring to Nakano image 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.049
 It will be possible to check the image 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:00.469
 Mental ray
