00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
it's pretty big but well would that be

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.139

think so so I made it Jason for he says
pocket<00:00:52.680> knife<00:00:53.329> here<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:56.989> you<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.020> it's

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
pocket knife here it is you see it's

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.090 
pocket knife here it is you see it's
nice<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.620> tiny<00:00:59.960> hahaha

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.859 

it<00:01:05.100> features<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> full<00:01:05.880> length<00:01:06.119> machete<00:01:06.689> blade

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
it features a full length machete blade

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.480 
it features a full length machete blade
and<00:01:08.570> also<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.020> using<00:01:10.710> some<00:01:10.920> rubber<00:01:11.159> what

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and also it is using some rubber what

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.620 
and also it is using some rubber what
else<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.570> keep<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.470> locked<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.360> very

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
else to keep it locked so this is very

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.149 
else to keep it locked so this is very
strong<00:01:15.930> rubber<00:01:16.140> bands<00:01:17.150> that<00:01:18.920> keep<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> in

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
strong rubber bands that keep it in

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.990 
strong rubber bands that keep it in
place<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.680> completely<00:01:23.189> locking<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.970> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
place it is not completely locking so I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
place it is not completely locking so I
can<00:01:24.299> carry<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.110> Germany<00:01:25.530> legally<00:01:25.920> without

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
can carry it in Germany legally without

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.190 
can carry it in Germany legally without
any<00:01:26.460> permission<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.270> same<00:01:27.509> rubber<00:01:27.780> powered

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
any permission the same rubber powered

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080 
any permission the same rubber powered
lever<00:01:28.409> also<00:01:28.829> keeps<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> blade<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.790> closed

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
lever also keeps the blade in closed

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.109 
lever also keeps the blade in closed
position<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:32.729> falling

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
position like this so it's not falling

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.109 
position like this so it's not falling
open<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> advantage<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.430> over<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
open so the advantage of this over a

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
open so the advantage of this over a
nominal<00:01:36.509> machete<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.049> clap<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.500> quite<00:01:37.710> clear

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
nominal machete is clap it's quite clear

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.899 
nominal machete is clap it's quite clear
this<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.960> hold<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.909> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
this one if you hold it like this the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
this one if you hold it like this the
year<00:01:42.119> speed<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> tip<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> machete<00:01:43.710> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
year speed of the tip of the machete is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.520 
year speed of the tip of the machete is
rather<00:01:44.490> slow<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.350> this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
rather slow but if you do it like this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.429 
rather slow but if you do it like this
then<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.549> course<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.509> tip<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.079> much<00:01:49.229> faster

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
then of course the tip is so much faster

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.149 
then of course the tip is so much faster
also<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:51.509> could<00:01:51.689> hit<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.560> opponent<00:01:52.979> from<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
also you could hit your opponent from a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.690 
also you could hit your opponent from a
far<00:01:53.460> longer<00:01:53.670> distance<00:01:54.560> but<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.490> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
far longer distance but then it is a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.950 
far longer distance but then it is a
very<00:01:57.270> compact<00:01:57.750> weapon<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.060> first<00:02:00.479> test<00:02:00.719> is

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
very compact weapon so the first test is

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.139 
very compact weapon so the first test is
this<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> has<00:02:02.579> turned<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.969> or

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
