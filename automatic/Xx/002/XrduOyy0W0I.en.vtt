a<00:00:27.960> little<00:00:28.170> tip<00:00:28.470> about<00:00:28.710> time<00:00:29.010> if<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.150> are<00:00:30.330> using

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
a little tip about time if you are using

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.590 
a little tip about time if you are using
dried<00:00:31.260> thyme<00:00:31.590> use<00:00:32.160> 1/3<00:00:32.399> less<00:00:33.090> than<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.420> would

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
dried thyme use 1/3 less than you would

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.479 
dried thyme use 1/3 less than you would
if<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.140> recipe<00:00:34.320> called<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:34.860> fresh<00:00:35.190> thyme

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
if the recipe called for fresh thyme

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.700 
if the recipe called for fresh thyme
because<00:00:36.059> dried<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.600> much<00:00:36.809> more<00:00:37.020> potent<00:00:37.500> so

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
because dried is much more potent so

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.030 
because dried is much more potent so
just<00:00:37.890> something<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.190> remember<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.829> are

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
just something to remember so we are

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.400 
just something to remember so we are
going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.430> talk<00:00:41.640> today<00:00:41.670> about<00:00:42.210> chopping<00:00:43.140> time

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
going to talk today about chopping time

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.110 
going to talk today about chopping time
and<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.160> would<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.640> when<00:00:44.850> you're<00:00:45.000> going

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and you would do this when you're going

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.360 
and you would do this when you're going
to<00:00:45.210> actually<00:00:45.570> leave<00:00:45.809> time<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.620> recipe<00:00:46.950> so

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to actually leave time in a recipe so

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.770 
to actually leave time in a recipe so
you're<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:47.940> adding<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.360> sprig<00:00:48.629> in

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you're not just like adding a sprig in

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
you're not just like adding a sprig in
taking<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.289> after<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.309> doing

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
taking it out after but if you're doing

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.569 
taking it out after but if you're doing
like<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> sauce<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.600> stew<00:00:52.289> some<00:00:53.100> sort<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.340> baked

dish<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.230> would<00:00:55.320> need<00:00:55.469> two

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
dish that's when you would need two

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.350 
dish that's when you would need two
chopped<00:00:55.920> thyme<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.550> let<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> stay<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.059> there

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360

this<00:01:29.030> if<00:01:29.420> this<00:01:29.630> like<00:01:29.840> very<00:01:30.080> soft<00:01:30.560> part<00:01:31.430> of<00:01:31.549> the

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
this if this like very soft part of the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.160 
this if this like very soft part of the
SEM<00:01:31.880> still<00:01:32.180> still<00:01:32.600> stays<00:01:32.780> on<00:01:32.899> that's

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
SEM still still stays on that's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.560 
SEM still still stays on that's
perfectly<00:01:33.530> fine<00:01:33.770> it's<00:01:34.190> just<00:01:34.280> really<00:01:34.610> like<00:01:34.880> the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
perfectly fine it's just really like the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.420 
perfectly fine it's just really like the
woody<00:01:35.869> kind<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.409> snappy<00:01:36.710> bottom<00:01:37.159> that<00:01:37.340> you

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
woody kind of snappy bottom that you

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.880 
woody kind of snappy bottom that you
don't<00:01:37.640> want<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:37.880> have<00:01:38.090> any<00:01:38.270> part<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.890> when

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
don't want to have any part of when

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.590 
don't want to have any part of when
you're<00:01:40.039> actually<00:01:40.340> putting<00:01:40.549> it<00:01:40.729> into<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:41.149> recipe

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
you're actually putting it into a recipe

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.840 
you're actually putting it into a recipe
and<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.899> will<00:01:41.990> stay<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:42.200> there<00:01:42.470> as<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:43.549> can<00:01:43.700> see

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
and it will stay in there as you can see

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.910 
and it will stay in there as you can see
the<00:01:43.970> leaves<00:01:44.210> are<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:44.750> small<00:01:45.140> there's<00:01:45.799> really

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
the leaves are so small there's really

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.350 
the leaves are so small there's really
not<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.159> lot<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.580> chopping<00:01:46.789> that<00:01:47.119> you'll<00:01:47.270> be

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
not a lot of chopping that you'll be

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.580 
not a lot of chopping that you'll be
