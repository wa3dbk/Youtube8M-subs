00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
ball so just try to push roll the dough

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.550 
ball so just try to push roll the dough
together<00:02:52.370> like<00:02:53.360> this<00:02:55.239> let's<00:02:56.239> get<00:02:56.630> off<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
together like this let's get off the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.809 
together like this let's get off the
dulcimer<00:02:58.220> play<00:02:59.799> there<00:03:00.799> we<00:03:00.920> go<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:01.310> now<00:03:01.670> you're

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
dulcimer play there we go and now you're

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.900 
dulcimer play there we go and now you're
going<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.209> try<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.540> roll<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.049> into<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.380> ball<00:03:03.910> it

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
going to try to roll it into a ball it

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.000 
going to try to roll it into a ball it
is<00:03:05.269> pretty<00:03:05.660> sticky<00:03:06.049> so<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.440> can<00:03:06.680> put<00:03:06.829> a<00:03:06.889> little

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
is pretty sticky so you can put a little

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.390 
is pretty sticky so you can put a little
bit<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.250> flour<00:03:07.519> on<00:03:07.760> your<00:03:07.790> hands<00:03:08.239> if<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:08.480> want

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
bit of flour on your hands if you want

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.240 
bit of flour on your hands if you want
there<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.670> go<00:03:11.980> think<00:03:12.980> it's<00:03:13.160> pretty<00:03:13.609> good<00:03:15.250> let's

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
there we go think it's pretty good let's

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.050 
there we go think it's pretty good let's
put<00:03:16.430> this<00:03:16.730> into<00:03:17.380> six<00:03:18.380> smaller<00:03:18.829> balls<00:03:19.160> or<00:03:19.549> 12

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
put this into six smaller balls or 12

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.940 
put this into six smaller balls or 12
but<00:03:20.329> I'm<00:03:20.720> going<00:03:21.049> to<00:03:21.109> do<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.230> six<00:03:21.530> because<00:03:21.709> it

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
but I'm going to do a six because it

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.550 
but I'm going to do a six because it
will<00:03:22.069> be<00:03:22.160> very<00:03:22.310> small<00:03:22.730> if<00:03:22.970> that's<00:03:23.209> 12<00:03:23.569> so<00:03:24.350> just

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
will be very small if that's 12 so just

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.759 
will be very small if that's 12 so just
split<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:24.829> in<00:03:25.100> half<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:26.090> split<00:03:27.019> those<00:03:27.290> halves

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
split it in half and split those halves

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:35.030 
split it in half and split those halves
into<00:03:28.160> another<00:03:28.609> half<00:03:29.380> like<00:03:30.380> that

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.990 

Wow<00:03:36.040> oh<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:37.300> guess<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:37.780> couldn't<00:03:38.580> add<00:03:39.580> them

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
Wow oh I guess it couldn't add them

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.470 
Wow oh I guess it couldn't add them
they're<00:03:41.280> divided<00:03:42.280> up<00:03:42.490> into<00:03:42.520> six<00:03:43.030> smaller

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
they're divided up into six smaller

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.600 
they're divided up into six smaller
girls<00:03:43.840> now<00:03:44.680> we're<00:03:44.740> just<00:03:44.860> going<00:03:45.069> to<00:03:45.340> try<00:03:45.550> to
