strategy for her now Virginia what she's

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.420 
strategy for her now Virginia what she's
fallen<00:00:09.480> out<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.929> she's<00:00:10.500> lost<00:00:10.710> five<00:00:11.040> games

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
fallen out of it she's lost five games

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:19.490 
fallen out of it she's lost five games
in<00:00:11.640> a<00:00:11.700> row

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.190 

we'll<00:00:19.769> see<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.429> is<00:00:20.580> definitely

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.990 

and<00:00:26.440> it<00:00:26.620> would<00:00:26.770> take<00:00:27.010> really<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.370> miracle<00:00:27.850> of

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
and it would take really a miracle of

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.690 
and it would take really a miracle of
inspiration<00:00:28.750> I<00:00:28.900> think<00:00:28.930> to<00:00:29.440> get<00:00:30.070> her<00:00:30.250> back<00:00:30.460> on<00:00:30.670> a

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
inspiration I think to get her back on a

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.440 
inspiration I think to get her back on a
level<00:00:31.029> and<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:33.250> game<00:00:33.580> she<00:00:33.850> could<00:00:34.120> she<00:00:34.330> could

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
level and this game she could she could

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:49.990 
level and this game she could she could
explode<00:00:34.930> on<00:00:35.170> this<00:00:35.350> game

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.390 

you<00:00:50.450> know<00:00:50.570> she's<00:00:50.780> got<00:00:50.930> nothing<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.560> lose<00:00:52.010> at

you know she's got nothing to lose at
this<00:00:52.550> stage<00:00:52.880> Jana<00:00:53.680> she<00:00:54.680> knows<00:00:54.890> what's<00:00:55.460> been

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700

this stage Jana she knows what's been
winning<00:00:55.970> her<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:57.140> points<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.040> keep<00:00:58.309> coming<00:00:58.700> in

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
and trust herself and that think about

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.469 
and trust herself and that think about
the<00:01:02.300> score<00:01:02.540> because<00:01:02.870> it's<00:01:03.020> only<00:01:03.500> one<00:01:03.770> break

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479

winner

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.120 

maybe<00:01:11.840> she's<00:01:12.110> better<00:01:12.380> Jana<00:01:12.710> when<00:01:12.920> she's

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
maybe she's better Jana when she's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.459 
maybe she's better Jana when she's
behind<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.789> no<00:01:14.000> she<00:01:14.810> can't<00:01:15.049> be<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.259> a

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
behind you no she can't be in a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.499 
behind you no she can't be in a
situation<00:01:15.710> where<00:01:16.399> she's<00:01:16.640> gonna<00:01:16.700> be<00:01:16.850> accused

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
situation where she's gonna be accused

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.170 
situation where she's gonna be accused
of<00:01:17.719> letting<00:01:17.869> it<00:01:18.170> slip<00:01:18.500> from<00:01:18.770> her

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.180 

assuming<00:01:24.960> she<00:01:25.110> wins<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.500> game<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.040> next

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
assuming she wins this game the next

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:38.690 
assuming she wins this game the next
game<00:01:26.370> is<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:27.090> critical<00:01:27.690> one

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.940 

I<00:01:41.330> think<00:01:42.330> Stephie<00:01:42.689> should<00:01:42.900> try<00:01:43.110> very<00:01:43.560> hard<00:01:43.650> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I think Stephie should try very hard to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.070 
I think Stephie should try very hard to
win<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> point<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.150> game<00:01:45.390> though<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.960> know

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
win a point in this game though you know

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.469 
win a point in this game though you know
it's<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> momentum<00:01:47.970> changed<00:01:48.360> on

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
it's just that the momentum changed on

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.389 
it's just that the momentum changed on
you<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> matter<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.500> game<00:01:49.710> well<00:01:50.189> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you in the matter of one game well to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.100 
you in the matter of one game well to
service<00:01:50.820> winner<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.509> strong<00:01:51.810> game

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
yeah I think tucks the net right away I

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.670 
yeah I think tucks the net right away I
always<00:03:21.940> think<00:03:22.300> when<00:03:22.390> you're<00:03:22.690> serving<00:03:22.960> at<00:03:23.230> 5-3

always think when you're serving at 5-3

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:34.309 
always think when you're serving at 5-3
you've<00:03:23.800> got<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.070> have<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.220> plan<00:03:24.640> even

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.229 

about<00:03:35.040> what<00:03:35.249> you're<00:03:35.400> going<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.670> do<00:03:35.909> because

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
about what you're going to do because

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.690 
about what you're going to do because
then<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.569> gives<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.959> something<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.700> keep

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
then that gives you something to keep

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.309 
then that gives you something to keep
your<00:03:38.909> mind<00:03:39.980> keenly<00:03:40.980> focused<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.670> some<00:03:42.510> simple

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
your mind keenly focused on some simple

your mind keenly focused on some simple
things<00:03:43.769> basic<00:03:44.219> things<00:03:44.489> rather<00:03:44.760> than<00:03:44.939> just

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
things basic things rather than just

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.809 
things basic things rather than just
