00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
in the commentary you might notice that

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.999 
in the commentary you might notice that
I'm<00:06:12.020> playing<00:06:12.229> search-and-destroy

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:13.009 
I'm playing search-and-destroy

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:14.909 
I'm playing search-and-destroy
I<00:06:13.190> don't<00:06:13.789> normally<00:06:13.909> play<00:06:14.270> search-and-destroy

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
I don't normally play search-and-destroy

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.980 
I don't normally play search-and-destroy
I'm<00:06:15.919> also<00:06:16.130> using<00:06:16.340> the<00:06:16.580> scar<00:06:16.820> which<00:06:17.090> is<00:06:17.270> like<00:06:17.870> I

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
I'm also using the scar which is like I

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.860 
I'm also using the scar which is like I
said<00:06:18.199> in<00:06:18.349> my

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
said in my

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.290 
said in my
my<00:06:19.110> analysis<00:06:19.950> videobomb<00:06:20.760> when<00:06:21.030> the<00:06:21.120> game

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
my analysis videobomb when the game

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.360 
my analysis videobomb when the game
first<00:06:21.540> came<00:06:21.660> out<00:06:21.930> I<00:06:22.230> used<00:06:23.070> it<00:06:23.220> in<00:06:23.340> combat

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
first came out I used it in combat

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.040 
first came out I used it in combat
training<00:06:23.970> and<00:06:24.210> I<00:06:24.300> knew<00:06:24.480> it<00:06:24.540> was<00:06:24.660> gonna<00:06:24.780> be<00:06:24.870> a

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
training and I knew it was gonna be a

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.800 
training and I knew it was gonna be a
beast<00:06:25.530> of<00:06:25.710> a<00:06:25.800> gun<00:06:25.980> and<00:06:26.280> besides<00:06:26.640> the<00:06:26.820> an-94<00:06:27.600> I

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
beast of a gun and besides the an-94 I

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.010 
beast of a gun and besides the an-94 I
think<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.230> scar<00:06:28.470> is<00:06:28.650> is<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.670> best<00:06:29.880> gun<00:06:30.150> best

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
think the scar is is the best gun best

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.010 
think the scar is is the best gun best
assault<00:06:31.350> rifle<00:06:31.710> for<00:06:31.760> how<00:06:32.760> I<00:06:32.790> how<00:06:33.390> I<00:06:33.420> work<00:06:33.810> it's

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
assault rifle for how I how I work it's

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.960 
assault rifle for how I how I work it's
got<00:06:34.170> a<00:06:34.200> lot<00:06:34.380> of<00:06:34.530> damage<00:06:34.710> a<00:06:35.130> little<00:06:35.640> bit<00:06:35.850> of<00:06:35.910> a

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
got a lot of damage a little bit of a

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.370 
got a lot of damage a little bit of a
low<00:06:36.090> clip<00:06:36.330> size<00:06:36.510> and<00:06:36.690> I<00:06:36.720> think<00:06:36.930> it<00:06:37.020> reloads

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
low clip size and I think it reloads

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.710 
low clip size and I think it reloads
faster<00:06:37.920> in<00:06:38.130> this<00:06:38.310> game<00:06:38.550> even<00:06:39.000> without<00:06:39.420> fast

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
faster in this game even without fast

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.640 
faster in this game even without fast
mag<00:06:39.990> so<00:06:41.300> if<00:06:42.300> you<00:06:42.480> if<00:06:42.720> you<00:06:42.840> don't<00:06:43.140> already<00:06:43.470> know

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
mag so if you if you don't already know

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.650 
mag so if you if you don't already know
that<00:06:43.800> you<00:06:44.130> should<00:06:44.310> probably<00:06:44.610> you<00:06:45.480> should

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
that you should probably you should

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.470 
that you should probably you should
