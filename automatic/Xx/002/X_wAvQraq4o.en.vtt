LS motor in it that's rated at 340 so
does<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.369> mean<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.640> jump<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> fast

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
does that mean we can jump it as a fast

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.570 
does that mean we can jump it as a fast
enough<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.630> jump<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:22.920> fast<00:00:23.310> enough

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
enough to jump it's it's not fast enough

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.400
