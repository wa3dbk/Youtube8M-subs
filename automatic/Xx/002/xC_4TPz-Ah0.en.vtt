00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
okay in all the aspects like

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.470 
okay in all the aspects like
hypothyroidism<00:01:00.940> diabetes<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.210> all<00:01:02.300> that

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
hypothyroidism diabetes to all that

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.270 
hypothyroidism diabetes to all that
sorts<00:01:02.749> of<00:01:02.809> things<00:01:02.960> she<00:01:03.710> didn't<00:01:03.890> have<00:01:04.010> any<00:01:04.190> of

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
sorts of things she didn't have any of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.490 
sorts of things she didn't have any of
those<00:01:04.430> but<00:01:04.879> numbers<00:01:05.480> that<00:01:05.690> were<00:01:05.840> off<00:01:06.080> were<00:01:06.320> her

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
those but numbers that were off were her

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.930 
those but numbers that were off were her
liver<00:01:06.770> numbers<00:01:07.190> which<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.580> think<00:01:07.760> basically

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
liver numbers which I think basically

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.510 
liver numbers which I think basically
were<00:01:08.240> like<00:01:08.390> eight<00:01:09.220> alts<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.700> one<00:01:11.330> other<00:01:11.510> one

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
were like eight alts and one other one

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.560 
were like eight alts and one other one
they<00:01:13.520> have<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.790> do<00:01:13.880> with<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.060> liver<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.390> the

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
they have to do with the liver and the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.600 
they have to do with the liver and the
alt<00:01:15.170> was<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.530> one<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:15.800> was<00:01:15.890> like<00:01:16.070> triple<00:01:16.580> the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
alt was the one that was like triple the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.270 
alt was the one that was like triple the
amount<00:01:17.060> was<00:01:17.330> supposed<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.900> be<00:01:18.050> so<00:01:18.950> they<00:01:19.070> called

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
amount was supposed to be so they called

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.710 
amount was supposed to be so they called
me<00:01:19.400> back<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.640> they<00:01:20.000> wanted<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.300> schedule<00:01:20.480> her

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
me back and they wanted to schedule her

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.230 
me back and they wanted to schedule her
for<00:01:20.780> an<00:01:21.350> ultrasound<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:22.340> we<00:01:22.460> went<00:01:22.580> back<00:01:22.730> a<00:01:22.910> few

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
except for the liver and so they did

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.870 
except for the liver and so they did
find<00:01:45.080> some<00:01:45.350> things<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.680> they<00:01:45.920> think<00:01:45.980> could

find some things that they think could

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.240 
find some things that they think could
be<00:01:47.030> an<00:01:47.120> issue<00:01:47.270> in<00:01:47.630> her<00:01:47.750> liver<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.290> they<00:01:49.010> did

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250

have wrote down the words because you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.240 
have wrote down the words because you
know<00:02:12.380> how<00:02:12.470> like<00:02:12.680> when<00:02:12.860> you're<00:02:12.980> getting

information

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.110 
information
one<00:02:16.939> time<00:02:17.409> I<00:02:18.409> there<00:02:19.129> was<00:02:19.249> a<00:02:19.310> word<00:02:19.549> it<00:02:19.790> was<00:02:19.909> to

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
one time I there was a word it was to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.819 
one time I there was a word it was to
really<00:02:20.390> long<00:02:20.659> words<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.319> was<00:02:21.439> like<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> age

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
really long words and I was like a age

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.069 
really long words and I was like a age
and<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.099> G<00:02:22.280> but<00:02:22.519> basically<00:02:23.359> what<00:02:23.599> he<00:02:23.810> thinks

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
and a G but basically what he thinks

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.869 
and a G but basically what he thinks
this<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:25.069> rest<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.489> liver<00:02:25.670> looks

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
this is the rest of the liver looks

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.399 
this is the rest of the liver looks
normal<00:02:26.299> with<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.599> area<00:02:26.810> right<00:02:27.019> here<00:02:27.079> looks

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
normal with this area right here looks

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.739 
normal with this area right here looks
like<00:02:27.469> a<00:02:27.590> flower<00:02:27.939> the<00:02:28.939> area<00:02:29.269> in<00:02:29.359> the<00:02:29.420> middle<00:02:29.480> and

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:29.749 
like a flower the area in the middle and

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.509 
like a flower the area in the middle and
then<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.930> pockets<00:02:30.349> around<00:02:30.469> it<00:02:30.859> are<00:02:30.980> what<00:02:31.310> look

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
then the pockets around it are what look

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.819 
then the pockets around it are what look
abnormal<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.389> he<00:02:32.959> thinks<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.439> this<00:02:33.590> is

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
abnormal and he thinks that this is

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.190 
abnormal and he thinks that this is
cancer<00:02:34.459> with<00:02:34.849> some<00:02:35.359> pockets<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.840> blood<00:02:36.170> around

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
cancer with some pockets of blood around

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.099 
cancer with some pockets of blood around
it<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.700> he<00:02:37.819> said<00:02:37.879> he<00:02:38.239> wouldn't<00:02:38.450> be<00:02:38.659> able<00:02:38.780> to

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
it and he said he wouldn't be able to

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.440 
it and he said he wouldn't be able to
tap<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:39.950> find<00:02:40.579> out<00:02:40.730> for<00:02:40.909> sure<00:02:40.939> and<00:02:41.359> it

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
tap it to find out for sure and it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.849 
tap it to find out for sure and it
wasn't<00:02:41.750> anything<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.230> he<00:02:42.379> thought<00:02:42.590> could<00:02:42.709> be

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
wasn't anything that he thought could be

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.209 
wasn't anything that he thought could be
removed<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:44.510> at<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:44.989> point<00:02:45.469> because<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:46.069> her

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:46.219 
removed so at this point because of her

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.399 
removed so at this point because of her
age<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.459> weight<00:02:46.939> it<00:02:47.329> would<00:02:47.959> be<00:02:48.139> something

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
age and weight it would be something

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.199 
age and weight it would be something
that<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:49.760> would<00:02:49.879> just<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:51.879> make<00:02:52.879> her<00:02:53.120> as

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
that we would just have to make her as

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.959 
that we would just have to make her as
comfortable<00:02:53.269> as<00:02:53.870> possible<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.650> not<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.370> let

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:55.969 
comfortable as possible and not and let

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.750 
comfortable as possible and not and let
them<00:02:56.150> know<00:02:56.180> if<00:02:56.480> there<00:02:56.659> are<00:02:56.689> any<00:02:56.750> changes<00:02:57.760> and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
them know if there are any changes and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.280 
them know if there are any changes and
it<00:02:59.269> was<00:02:59.359> something<00:02:59.629> along<00:02:59.719> the<00:02:59.900> lines<00:03:00.109> of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
it was something along the lines of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.270 
it was something along the lines of
hyper<00:03:01.000> polish<00:03:02.000> scholar<00:03:02.689> sam<00:03:03.169> roll<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:04.040> don't

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
hyper polish scholar sam roll I don't

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.429 
hyper polish scholar sam roll I don't
know<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.849> was<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.269> really<00:03:05.750> really<00:03:05.930> long<00:03:06.109> words

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
know it was to really really long words

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.080 
know it was to really really long words
and<00:03:06.560> by<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.680> point<00:03:06.889> we've<00:03:07.639> been<00:03:07.790> in<00:03:07.909> there

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
and by this point we've been in there

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.220 
and by this point we've been in there
and<00:03:08.269> trying<00:03:08.449> to<00:03:08.540> keep<00:03:08.629> trying<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:08.989> kids

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
and trying to keep trying to the kids

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.220 
and trying to keep trying to the kids
but<00:03:09.889> basically<00:03:10.069> what<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.370> amounts<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.760> is

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
but basically what it amounts to is

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.309 
but basically what it amounts to is
cancer<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:12.469> liver<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:13.840> it's<00:03:14.840> apparently

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
cancer in the liver so it's apparently

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.229 
cancer in the liver so it's apparently
fairly<00:03:15.739> I'm<00:03:15.829> normal<00:03:16.159> for<00:03:16.340> cats<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:16.730> he<00:03:17.000> said

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
fairly I'm normal for cats and he said

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.240 
fairly I'm normal for cats and he said
that<00:03:17.389> it<00:03:17.480> really<00:03:17.689> was<00:03:17.780> not<00:03:18.079> a<00:03:18.260> good<00:03:18.469> diagnosis

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
that it really was not a good diagnosis

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.729 
that it really was not a good diagnosis
and<00:03:19.579> he<00:03:20.419> said<00:03:20.629> especially<00:03:20.840> because<00:03:21.109> she<00:03:21.470> just

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
and he said especially because she just

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.309 
and he said especially because she just
dropped<00:03:22.009> so<00:03:22.220> much<00:03:22.400> weight<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.870> know<00:03:24.019> could<00:03:24.199> be

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
dropped so much weight you know could be

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.469 
dropped so much weight you know could be
a<00:03:24.349> very<00:03:24.560> bad<00:03:24.739> sign<00:03:25.069> however<00:03:25.370> he<00:03:26.120> was<00:03:26.239> fairly

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
a very bad sign however he was fairly

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.780 
a very bad sign however he was fairly
optimistic<00:03:26.689> he<00:03:27.319> said<00:03:27.530> all<00:03:28.489> we<00:03:28.699> could

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
optimistic he said all we could

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.099 
optimistic he said all we could
basically<00:03:29.000> do<00:03:29.299> at<00:03:29.389> this<00:03:29.449> point<00:03:29.540> was<00:03:29.810> take<00:03:29.989> her

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
basically do at this point was take her

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.069 
basically do at this point was take her
home<00:03:30.290> make<00:03:30.590> as<00:03:30.709> comfortable<00:03:31.220> as<00:03:31.310> possible<00:03:31.340> and

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
home make as comfortable as possible and

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.929 
home make as comfortable as possible and
he<00:03:33.079> really<00:03:33.319> couldn't<00:03:33.650> give<00:03:33.919> a<00:03:33.949> time<00:03:34.340> length<00:03:34.639> as

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
he really couldn't give a time length as

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.030 
he really couldn't give a time length as
far<00:03:35.209> as<00:03:35.329> she<00:03:35.659> could<00:03:35.780> live<00:03:35.989> weeks<00:03:36.650> she<00:03:36.889> could

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
far as she could live weeks she could

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.830 
far as she could live weeks she could
live<00:03:37.189> months<00:03:37.549> she<00:03:37.699> could<00:03:37.849> live<00:03:38.030> years<00:03:38.569> like

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
live months she could live years like

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.050 
live months she could live years like
this<00:03:39.079> so<00:03:39.919> we<00:03:40.310> just<00:03:40.459> had<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.669> be<00:03:40.790> as<00:03:40.879> optimistic

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
this so we just had to be as optimistic

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.499 
this so we just had to be as optimistic
as<00:03:41.659> possible<00:03:42.669> she's<00:03:43.669> a<00:03:43.729> little<00:03:43.849> bit<00:03:44.000> older<00:03:44.299> cat

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:44.509 
as possible she's a little bit older cat

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.289 
as possible she's a little bit older cat
I<00:03:44.689> mean<00:03:44.870> she's<00:03:45.109> at<00:03:45.319> least<00:03:45.530> 12<00:03:45.919> years<00:03:46.159> old<00:03:46.400> she

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
I mean she's at least 12 years old she

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.270 
I mean she's at least 12 years old she
might<00:03:47.540> be<00:03:47.750> she<00:03:48.139> probably<00:03:48.349> is<00:03:48.590> older<00:03:49.009> than<00:03:49.040> that

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
might be she probably is older than that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.259 
might be she probably is older than that
because<00:03:49.519> I<00:03:49.729> got<00:03:49.909> her<00:03:50.030> as<00:03:50.150> an<00:03:50.239> adult<00:03:50.829> so<00:03:52.150> we<00:03:53.150> just

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
because I got her as an adult so we just

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.749 
because I got her as an adult so we just
had<00:03:53.389> to<00:03:53.479> basically<00:03:54.069> let<00:03:55.069> them<00:03:55.220> know<00:03:55.370> if<00:03:55.489> we<00:03:55.579> see

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:55.759 
had to basically let them know if we see

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.339 
had to basically let them know if we see
any<00:03:55.909> changes<00:03:56.359> and<00:03:56.569> that's<00:03:56.720> kind<00:03:57.049> of<00:03:57.139> like<00:03:57.290> the

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
any changes and that's kind of like the

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.780 
any changes and that's kind of like the
update<00:03:57.799> so<00:03:58.129> the<00:03:59.120> vet<00:04:00.189> strongly<00:04:01.189> believes<00:04:01.549> that

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
update so the vet strongly believes that

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.789 
update so the vet strongly believes that
it's<00:04:01.939> this<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.479> really<00:04:02.989> wish<00:04:03.259> I<00:04:03.379> knew<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.530> name

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
it's this I really wish I knew the name

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.379 
it's this I really wish I knew the name
but<00:04:04.189> a<00:04:05.439> certain<00:04:06.439> type<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.709> cancer<00:04:07.069> that<00:04:07.310> is<00:04:08.000> not

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
but a certain type of cancer that is not

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.679 
but a certain type of cancer that is not
very<00:04:08.419> common<00:04:09.229> and<00:04:09.620> it's<00:04:10.250> in<00:04:10.430> her<00:04:10.579> liver<00:04:10.790> and

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 
very common and it's in her liver and

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.509 
very common and it's in her liver and
it's<00:04:11.840> apparently<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.889> know<00:04:13.009> there's<00:04:13.340> no

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
it's apparently you know there's no

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.009 
it's apparently you know there's no
medicine<00:04:13.879> or<00:04:14.150> anything<00:04:14.299> that<00:04:14.659> you<00:04:14.719> can<00:04:14.870> give

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
medicine or anything that you can give

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.370 
medicine or anything that you can give
her<00:04:15.759> but<00:04:16.759> I<00:04:17.030> mean<00:04:17.509> we're<00:04:17.659> gonna<00:04:17.810> be<00:04:17.989> optimistic

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
her but I mean we're gonna be optimistic

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.770 
her but I mean we're gonna be optimistic
because<00:04:18.769> you<00:04:19.699> know<00:04:19.820> they<00:04:20.090> didn't<00:04:20.359> give<00:04:20.479> us<00:04:20.509> any

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
because you know they didn't give us any

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.480 
because you know they didn't give us any
sort<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.019> time<00:04:21.199> length<00:04:21.440> but<00:04:21.650> like<00:04:22.070> they<00:04:22.250> didn't

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
sort of time length but like they didn't

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.560 
sort of time length but like they didn't
say<00:04:22.610> we<00:04:22.759> don't<00:04:22.880> think<00:04:23.120> she's<00:04:23.240> going<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.419> make

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
say we don't think she's going to make

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.850 
say we don't think she's going to make
it<00:04:23.630> more<00:04:23.810> than<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.080> few<00:04:24.229> weeks<00:04:24.440> or<00:04:24.620> anything

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
it more than a few weeks or anything

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.560 
it more than a few weeks or anything
like<00:04:24.889> that<00:04:25.010> so<00:04:25.880> we're<00:04:26.000> going<00:04:26.120> to<00:04:26.210> hope<00:04:26.300> for<00:04:26.389> the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
like that so we're going to hope for the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.500 
like that so we're going to hope for the
best<00:04:26.719> and<00:04:27.020> hope

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
best and hope

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.280 
best and hope
she<00:04:27.960> has<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.470> nice<00:04:28.680> long<00:04:28.890> life<00:04:29.130> still<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:30.290> will

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
she has a nice long life still and will

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.650 
she has a nice long life still and will
let<00:04:31.470> him<00:04:31.530> know<00:04:31.620> if<00:04:31.860> we<00:04:32.010> see<00:04:32.250> major<00:04:32.910> changes<00:04:33.060> but

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
let him know if we see major changes but

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.110 
let him know if we see major changes but
that's<00:04:33.810> how<00:04:33.930> they<00:04:34.080> sent<00:04:34.320> his<00:04:34.410> home<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:35.120> that's

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
that's how they sent his home so that's

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.670 
that's how they sent his home so that's
kind<00:04:36.300> of<00:04:36.330> our<00:04:36.450> update<00:04:36.780> it's<00:04:37.050> kind<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.500> bummer

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
kind of our update it's kind of a bummer

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.680 
kind of our update it's kind of a bummer
but<00:04:38.040> I<00:04:38.280> just<00:04:39.030> wanted<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.330> give<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.480> guys<00:04:39.570> a

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
but I just wanted to give you guys a

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.810 
but I just wanted to give you guys a
quick<00:04:39.960> update<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.930> cat<00:04:42.930> cancer<00:04:43.820> they

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
quick update and it is cat cancer they

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.750 
quick update and it is cat cancer they
they<00:04:45.330> think<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.930> guess<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.920> reason<00:04:47.100> he<00:04:47.460> said<00:04:47.640> he

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
they think I guess the reason he said he

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.190 
they think I guess the reason he said he
couldn't<00:04:48.030> tap<00:04:48.240> into<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.600> fluid<00:04:48.840> which<00:04:49.080> I'm

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
couldn't tap into the fluid which I'm

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.420 
couldn't tap into the fluid which I'm
assuming<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.740> reason<00:04:50.010> why<00:04:50.100> they<00:04:50.250> would<00:04:50.400> want

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
assuming the reason why they would want

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.160 
assuming the reason why they would want
to<00:04:50.640> do<00:04:50.730> that<00:04:50.760> is<00:04:51.000> so<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.240> confirm<00:04:51.780> that<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.140> is

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
to do that is so to confirm that it is

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.100 
to do that is so to confirm that it is
but<00:04:53.100> for<00:04:53.760> whatever<00:04:53.910> reason<00:04:54.150> he<00:04:54.660> said<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:54.990> he

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
but for whatever reason he said that he

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.900 
but for whatever reason he said that he
wouldn't<00:04:55.320> be<00:04:55.470> able<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.920> because<00:04:56.460> of<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.640> area

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
wouldn't be able to because of the area

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.390 
wouldn't be able to because of the area
that<00:04:57.000> it's<00:04:57.150> in<00:04:57.240> or<00:04:57.360> whatnot<00:04:57.510> so<00:04:57.660> we<00:04:58.400> just

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
that it's in or whatnot so we just

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.770 
that it's in or whatnot so we just
basically<00:04:59.550> have<00:04:59.880> to<00:04:59.970> go<00:05:00.060> off<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.300> ultrasound

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
basically have to go off the ultrasound

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.750 
basically have to go off the ultrasound
pictures<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.380> just<00:05:02.190> hope<00:05:02.280> for<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.460> best<00:05:02.520> at

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
pictures and just hope for the best at

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.420 
pictures and just hope for the best at
this<00:05:02.820> point<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:03.240> that's<00:05:03.480> our<00:05:03.660> Luna<00:05:03.840> update<00:05:04.430> but
