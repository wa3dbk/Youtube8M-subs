00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.600 

okay<00:00:01.230> now<00:00:01.380> that<00:00:01.410> we<00:00:01.680> have<00:00:01.709> the<00:00:02.070> neural<00:00:02.429> map

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay now that we have the neural map

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.200 
okay now that we have the neural map
generated<00:00:03.360> we<00:00:03.929> can<00:00:04.080> also<00:00:04.230> use<00:00:04.560> Z<00:00:05.130> mapper<00:00:05.370> to

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
generated we can also use Z mapper to

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.410 
generated we can also use Z mapper to
generate<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:07.020> cavity<00:00:07.919> map<00:00:08.160> so<00:00:08.880> we'll<00:00:09.150> go<00:00:09.269> back

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
generate a cavity map so we'll go back

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.350 
generate a cavity map so we'll go back
into<00:00:09.719> our<00:00:10.139> Z<00:00:10.469> plug-in<00:00:10.920> go<00:00:11.370> into<00:00:11.610> Z<00:00:11.790> mapper<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
into our Z plug-in go into Z mapper and

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.570 
into our Z plug-in go into Z mapper and
you<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:13.500> three<00:00:13.799> settings<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.340> play<00:00:14.460> with

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
you have three settings that play with

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.490 
you have three settings that play with
cavity<00:00:14.880> maps<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.240> coverage<00:00:15.690> blur<00:00:16.170> and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
cavity maps you have coverage blur and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.130 
cavity maps you have coverage blur and
your<00:00:16.949> intensity<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.090> if<00:00:18.180> i<00:00:18.270> turn<00:00:18.359> my<00:00:18.630> intensity

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
your intensity so if i turn my intensity

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.000 
your intensity so if i turn my intensity
up<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.770> i<00:00:20.490> hit<00:00:20.720> create<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.840> cavity<00:00:22.289> map<00:00:22.500> we're

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
up and i hit create a cavity map we're

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.800 
up and i hit create a cavity map we're
now<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> create<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.029> black<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.750> white

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
now going to create a black and white

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.250 
now going to create a black and white
scale<00:00:25.670> map<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.180> details<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> cracks

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
scale map of the details of the cracks

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.519 
scale map of the details of the cracks
and<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.949> noise<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.150> particular<00:00:30.990> cliff

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and the noise that the particular cliff

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.880 
and the noise that the particular cliff
mesh<00:00:31.830> has<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:35.570> this<00:00:36.570> map<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.020> extremely

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
mesh has on it this map is extremely

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.580 
mesh has on it this map is extremely
useful<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.430> Mayas<00:00:39.390> mental<00:00:39.960> ray<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.500> the

useful in Mayas mental ray for the
diffuse<00:00:41.010> Channel<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.090> there<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.360> go<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:42.899> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
diffuse Channel so there we go we have a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.200 
diffuse Channel so there we go we have a
cavity<00:00:43.200> map<00:00:43.590> now<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> use<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
cavity map now that we can use in the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.389 
cavity map now that we can use in the

some my noise here that i have here i
can<00:00:51.780> go<00:00:51.840> ahead<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:51.989> play<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.410> intensity

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
can go ahead and play with my intensity

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
can go ahead and play with my intensity
or<00:00:52.949> my<00:00:53.190> coverage<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.730> i<00:00:53.760> drop<00:00:54.030> my<00:00:54.059> intensity

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
or my coverage so i drop my intensity

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.160 
or my coverage so i drop my intensity

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.900 
level and hit create create a map as you
see<00:00:58.350> i'm<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> lose<00:00:58.739> some<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.370> noise

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
see i'm going to lose some of that noise

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
see i'm going to lose some of that noise
and<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.449> i<00:01:00.600> drop<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> my<00:01:01.289> coverage<00:01:01.680> as

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and if i drop some of my coverage as

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.759 
and if i drop some of my coverage as
well<00:01:02.690> i'm<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> lose<00:01:04.110> most<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.530> that

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
well i'm going to lose most on that

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.340 
well i'm going to lose most on that
cavity<00:01:05.129> as<00:01:05.339> i<00:01:06.000> keep<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.450> down<00:01:06.750> down<00:01:07.110> these

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
cavity as i keep going down down these

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.789 
cavity as i keep going down down these
these<00:01:08.100> two<00:01:08.369> sliders<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:09.409> cavity<00:01:10.409> blur<00:01:10.619> will

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
these two sliders now cavity blur will

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.859 
these two sliders now cavity blur will
also<00:01:11.070> blower<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.670> map<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.299> haven't<00:01:12.540> found<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
also blower your map I haven't found the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.020 
also blower your map I haven't found the
need<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.500> jump<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.580> lot<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
need to really jump up a lot with a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.600 
need to really jump up a lot with a
cavity<00:01:15.450> blur<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> would<00:01:16.439> recommend<00:01:16.710> mostly

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
cavity blur so I would recommend mostly

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.950 
cavity blur so I would recommend mostly
playing<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:17.970> your<00:01:18.090> cavity<00:01:18.450> coverage<00:01:18.810> your

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
playing with your cavity coverage your

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
playing with your cavity coverage your
cavity<00:01:19.350> intensity<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.549> we'll<00:01:20.670> put<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.850> back

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
cavity intensity so we'll put that back

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.490 
cavity intensity so we'll put that back
up<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> level<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
up to a level that I like so it's a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.550 
up to a level that I like so it's a
little<00:01:25.680> too<00:01:25.890> much<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.290> another

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
little too much right there so another

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.770 
little too much right there so another
great<00:01:28.710> thing<00:01:29.009> about<00:01:29.130> cavity<00:01:29.610> maps<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.450> can

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
great thing about cavity maps is I can

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.050 
great thing about cavity maps is I can
bake<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.259> cavity<00:01:31.650> map<00:01:31.890> into<00:01:32.400> my<00:01:32.549> normal<00:01:32.610> map

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
bake this cavity map into my normal map

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.840 
bake this cavity map into my normal map
so<00:01:33.810> because<00:01:34.439> my<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.770> cavity<00:01:35.250> intensity<00:01:35.729> in

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so because my in cavity intensity in

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.539 
so because my in cavity intensity in
coverage<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.479> up<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.560> hit<00:01:37.740> create<00:01:38.100> normal

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
coverage are up if I hit create normal

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.840 
coverage are up if I hit create normal
map<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> actually<00:01:40.049> bake<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
map it's going to actually bake in the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.480 
map it's going to actually bake in the
normal<00:01:42.210> map<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.659> cavity<00:01:43.049> intensity<00:01:43.619> which

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
normal map the cavity intensity which

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.240 
normal map the cavity intensity which
can<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.850> extremely<00:01:45.240> useful<00:01:45.710> for<00:01:46.710> rendering

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
can be extremely useful for rendering

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.810 
can be extremely useful for rendering
quicker<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.939> Maya<00:01:48.479> however<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.759> purposes<00:01:50.759> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
quicker in Maya however for purposes of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090 
quicker in Maya however for purposes of
rendering<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.659> quality<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.200> prefer<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
rendering and get quality I prefer to

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.649 
rendering and get quality I prefer to
keep<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.399> file<00:01:53.579> separate<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.240> keep<00:01:54.420> my

keep the file separate and keep my
normal<00:01:55.020> maps<00:01:55.200> over<00:01:55.590> from<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.829> cavity<00:01:56.219> map<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:57.090> i

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
normal maps over from a cavity map so i

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.370 
normal maps over from a cavity map so i
can<00:01:57.329> play<00:01:57.509> with<00:01:57.630> different<00:01:57.840> settings<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
can play with different settings and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.810 
can play with different settings and
different<00:01:58.680> options<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> displacement

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
different options with the displacement

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.300 
different options with the displacement
map<00:01:59.969> normal<00:02:00.420> map<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.810> cavity<00:02:01.200> map<00:02:01.409> gives<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
map normal map and cavity map gives you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.490 
map normal map and cavity map gives you
more<00:02:02.490> freedom<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.939> more<00:02:03.000> flexibility<00:02:03.659> so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
more freedom and more flexibility so

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.020 
more freedom and more flexibility so
there<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.009> there's<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.490> normal<00:02:05.850> map

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
there you have it there's a normal map

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.740 
there you have it there's a normal map
with<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:07.079> cavity<00:02:07.619> map<00:02:07.799> baked<00:02:08.129> into<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.720> i

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
with a cavity map baked into it so i

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.360 
with a cavity map baked into it so i
just<00:02:09.989> want<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.200> get<00:02:10.349> though<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.950> our<00:02:11.069> county

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
just want to get though just our county

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.890 
just want to get though just our county
maps<00:02:11.550> let<00:02:11.730> me<00:02:11.819> generate<00:02:12.300> our<00:02:12.420> cavity<00:02:12.750> map

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
maps let me generate our cavity map

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.330 
maps let me generate our cavity map
again

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
again

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.780 
again
so<00:02:14.120> once<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.870> done<00:02:14.900> generating<00:02:15.790> again

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
so once this is done generating again

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.059 
so once this is done generating again
once<00:02:17.000> we<00:02:17.060> hit<00:02:17.269> exit<00:02:17.780> out<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:17.989> our<00:02:18.470> Z<00:02:18.830> mapper

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
once we hit exit out of our Z mapper

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.430 
once we hit exit out of our Z mapper
we're<00:02:19.489> going<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.730> have<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.239> file<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:21.050> we<00:02:21.200> can

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
we're going to have a file that we can

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.130 
we're going to have a file that we can
then<00:02:21.709> export<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.700> save<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.510> as<00:02:23.599> a<00:02:23.629> cavity

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
then export and save that as a cavity

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.430 
then export and save that as a cavity
map<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.830> be<00:02:24.980> used<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.610> mental<00:02:26.360> ray<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.349> we're

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
map to be used in mental ray so we're

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.600 
map to be used in mental ray so we're
almost<00:02:27.560> done<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.680> there's<00:02:30.860> my<00:02:30.980> cavity<00:02:31.400> map

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
almost done so there's my cavity map

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.100 
almost done so there's my cavity map
once<00:02:32.239> I<00:02:32.360> exit<00:02:33.010> here's<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.160> map<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.790> have

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
once I exit here's the map I that I have

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.809 
once I exit here's the map I that I have
which<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.140> really<00:02:36.500> nice<00:02:36.680> map<00:02:36.980> we're<00:02:37.610> going<00:02:37.730> to

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
which is really nice map we're going to

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.059 
which is really nice map we're going to
go<00:02:37.879> ahead<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.269> export<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:39.019> we're<00:02:39.830> going<00:02:39.920> to

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
go ahead and export this we're going to

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.559 
go ahead and export this we're going to
save<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.400> as<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.580> tiff<00:02:40.849> remember<00:02:41.330> i'm<00:02:41.420> going

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
save this as a tiff remember i'm going

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.600 
save this as a tiff remember i'm going
to<00:02:41.629> call<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.870> cavity<00:02:42.290> map<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.340> i'm<00:02:43.430> going<00:02:43.519> to

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
to call this cavity map and i'm going to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.150 
to call this cavity map and i'm going to
save<00:02:43.879> over<00:02:44.120> top<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.390> other<00:02:44.569> file<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.290> now<00:02:46.099> we

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
save over top the other file and now we

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.160 
save over top the other file and now we
have<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.519> cavity<00:02:46.819> map<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.450> can<00:02:47.569> be<00:02:47.690> used<00:02:47.959> in

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
have a cavity map that can be used in

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.940 
have a cavity map that can be used in
mental<00:02:48.530> ray<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:48.980> diffuse<00:02:49.579> channel
