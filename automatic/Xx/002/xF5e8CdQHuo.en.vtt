thing<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> bridge<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.180> came<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
thing was the bridge that came with it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.550 
thing was the bridge that came with it
was<00:01:15.930> too<00:01:16.590> short<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.689> see<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> just

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
was too short so if you see there I just

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.010 
was too short so if you see there I just
got<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> business<00:01:20.700> card<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.570> cut<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.810> up

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
got a business card and I just cut it up

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
got a business card and I just cut it up
and<00:01:22.170> made<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:23.189> know<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.520> made<00:01:23.670> some<00:01:23.850> shims

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and made you know just made some shims

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090 
and made you know just made some shims
to<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> bridge<00:01:24.930> high<00:01:25.320> enough<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.890> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
to get the bridge high enough so that it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
to get the bridge high enough so that it
would<00:01:26.220> get<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> strings<00:01:27.180> above<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
would get the strings above the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.710 
would get the strings above the
fingerboard<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.090> likewise<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:31.369> the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
fingerboard like that likewise the the

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.810 
fingerboard like that likewise the the
tuning<00:01:33.720> pegs<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.500> too<00:01:35.070> large<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.610> can

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
tuning pegs are too large you can

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.819 
tuning pegs are too large you can
probably<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.270> pretty<00:01:36.659> big<00:01:36.900> gaps<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.590> there

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
probably see pretty big gaps in there

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.370 
probably see pretty big gaps in there
instead<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.790> trying<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> fit<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> pegs<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.170> just

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
instead of trying to fit the pegs I just

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.850 
instead of trying to fit the pegs I just
ran<00:01:40.650> them<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.979> there<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.619> strings<00:01:43.619> in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
ran them in there to get the strings in

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.980 
ran them in there to get the strings in
tune<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:45.689> would<00:01:46.159> obviously<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.490> spruce<00:01:47.990> some

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
tune the would obviously not spruce some

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.980 
tune the would obviously not spruce some
kind<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.759> composite<00:01:50.759> wood<00:01:51.409> of<00:01:52.409> some<00:01:53.159> kind<00:01:53.990> top

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
kind of composite wood of some kind top

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.929 
kind of composite wood of some kind top
looks<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.350> whole<00:01:55.500> lot<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.009> back<00:01:56.189> I'm

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
looks a whole lot like the back I'm

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.069 
looks a whole lot like the back I'm
sending<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.600> back<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.049> thicker<00:01:59.540> that<00:02:00.540> way<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
sending the back is thicker that way the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.230 
sending the back is thicker that way the
strings<00:02:01.439> are<00:02:01.770> some<00:02:01.979> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
strings are some kind of you know the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.030 
strings are some kind of you know the
kind<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.479> look<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.630> dominant<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.950> know

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
kind of look like dominant you know

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.089 
kind of look like dominant you know
they're<00:02:05.189> very<00:02:05.840> thin<00:02:06.840> gauge<00:02:07.140> strings<00:02:07.710> very

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
they're very thin gauge strings very

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.710 
they're very thin gauge strings very
thin<00:02:08.340> sounding<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.910> course<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.360> probably

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
thin sounding of course that's probably

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.010 
thin sounding of course that's probably
may<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.200> something<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> violin

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
may have something to do with the violin

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.510 
may have something to do with the violin
as<00:02:13.020> well

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520

this bow here now let's kind of like it

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.490 
this bow here now let's kind of like it
might<00:02:56.870> be<00:02:57.020> real<00:02:57.200> horsehair<00:02:58.720> it's<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.990> heavy<00:03:00.260> bow

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
might be real horsehair it's a heavy bow

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.770 
might be real horsehair it's a heavy bow
I'll<00:03:00.740> put<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:00.980> on<00:03:01.070> my<00:03:01.280> scale<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.120> comes<00:03:02.540> in

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
I'll put it on my scale and it comes in

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.350 
I'll put it on my scale and it comes in
just<00:03:03.020> to<00:03:03.110> touch<00:03:03.290> over<00:03:03.620> 70<00:03:04.070> grams<00:03:04.370> which<00:03:05.330> is

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
just to touch over 70 grams which is

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.200 
just to touch over 70 grams which is
more<00:03:05.780> like<00:03:05.990> a<00:03:06.020> viola<00:03:06.650> bow<00:03:06.980> even<00:03:07.490> though<00:03:07.640> it's

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
more like a viola bow even though it's

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.740
