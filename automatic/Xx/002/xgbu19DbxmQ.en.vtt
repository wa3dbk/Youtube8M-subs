00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
contrary motion you learn about

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.380 
contrary motion you learn about
technique<00:01:53.560> development<00:01:54.069> I've<00:01:54.369> got<00:01:54.549> a<00:01:54.579> really

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
technique development I've got a really
