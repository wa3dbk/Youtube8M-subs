 and continued channel + the train 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.680
 azerbaijan the cut what we are going to use we go to this plantation 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.710
 six months old 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.790
 normally what has been recommended to do before the four 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.019
 years be for things to be better quality 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.329
 however for the present example example we are going to use them well 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.380
 establishes actc we observe well 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.999
 in this company internal part of the plant 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.460
 we use the pruning shears we put to disinfect with chlorinated water 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.439
 to be able to ask to avoid that there is no veto income of bacteria 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 adn to cut the plant whose permanent exercise 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.940
 we selected 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540
 this picture that are a little beyond 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.250
 to be happy to our time of how are the things that are the profile 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.500
 with all the surroundings 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.090
 the artist 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.320
 specifically 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.440
 is implicate 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.870
 we invent 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.000
 everyone 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.130
 sprouts 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.130
 morals 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.120
 everything that includes 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.070
 part of the matches 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.160
 cupertino fruits 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.780
 and we believe that some couples and approximately 35 centimeters 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 for now 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.799
 what is sought is to have a stamp approximately one centimeter thick 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.190
 about 30 to 35 centimeters in diameter 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.700
 have an interview between those of us who are talking about topics that are going to 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.870
 produce or more 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.720
 they are where they will keep above in the bag 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.500
 and this animal must be below in the bag in the presence of soil 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.290
 to be able to allow the rahim jan system in the farc 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.080
 here we tell this 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.080
 iniesta 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.330
 this part martín also what we can and this what we are going to take 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.520
 on the way back to do the seeding novel reflects sexually by these 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.200
 the plant in a week 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.340
 we are not talking produces apart from the five months old 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.450
 for about ten more months 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.509
 by the way is that the president of the fmc are the verbal altercations against 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.980
 social exclusion 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.360
 the plant in the final section but not public 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.489
 pekin 15 mar the president of the main event 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.499
 starts again naively 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.759
 equally in b 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.989
 and has been formed by frame 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.309
 here you call a plant in high production capacity struggles 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.669
 a moment of the film 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.239
 we are talking about the train 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.489
 add ex woman 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.489
 the general also discussed the issue of club gib 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.189
 confirming the young singer in Cádiz where the credential is 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.519
 plant cultivation 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.499
 We will be talking about the outcome of the plant could be delivering between 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:43.609
 25 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.549
 and 30 kilos of fruit 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.839
 during a goal and the months of production 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.689
 in the particularity of this crop is that it has 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:52.929
 all the states 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:54.109
 developmental 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.179
 read before these results next week people are excited 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:59.759
 a car 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.880
 one of the points that grows the most 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.519
 yes no and they and then 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.189
 much smaller 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.499
 is inside the prd 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.039
 a growth that 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.349
 floral buttons that are about to open 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.290
 this allows us to have collection for sale 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.049
 8 every 15 days continuously improving the income of the 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.330
 farmers who enter this type of crop 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.639
 let's talk about a second process percent higher than today 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.259
 a process called sustaining was accomplished in a cell 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:33.289
 the sspdf centered in a dozen corresponding centers 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.930
 Finally, a series of cultural tasks that are very important for the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.629
 city 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.340
 successfully the ban 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.449
 the head of the fed 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:46.209
 we are going to give then support of the working world what is important is how 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.369
 fertilization 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:50.799
 the control of pests and diseases pruning the cardinal 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.889
 before the post that zelaya harvest and post-harvest 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:08.269
 It is very important because they claim us a single type of crops as in 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.690
 now the monoculture has its risks 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.200
 not only because a plague or disease can arrive in time that a 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.509
 price in the incident an explosion in the product 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:18.750
 3 if you download a 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.480
 a price 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.830
 call banana a coffee there can be another crop as not what can we 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.180
 help sustain those losses a little bit in case they refuse to 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.360
 give there is not a flow is more dynamic an English club the most dynamic for 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.350
 the farmer this can have income by 6 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.200
 after these incidents the texts of the 15 months are in harvest per square 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.719
 they are starting to produce too 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:42.340
 its functions 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.140
 five minutes after five and a half months since he was also admitted 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.730
 recently box 5th a lot of these is that instant the community nor in 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.020
 dreams montilla feminine in its later substitution 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.290
 is the product of a logical process that makes it a more tolerant species 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.919
 low temperatures 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.749
 another of its qualities in resistance the different pests that affect this 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:07.779
 fruit 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:12.400
 for coffee farmers this has been an important productive alternative and 

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:16.149
 complements its economic income in times when there is no harvest of 

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.189
 coffee 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.740
 Young Mulder Londoño Farmers of Bethlehem of Umbria explains us the 

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:25.120
 benefits you have had with this new crop 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.830
 but if europe the annual average presented p two things 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.219
 First 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:32.680
 in the economic 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.100
 the economic one because it is as well explained by the people of the cooperative in 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.089
 few days and equal coffee 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:44.029
 us the coffee growers 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.229
 the collapse of income 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.430
 and through the pipelines the pp has become an excellent alternative 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.909
 so that our family 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.650
 Well, in 2003 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.710
 to the return of corruption 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.199
 we will see the impact that the cooperative cox camps has had and the cultivation of the 1 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.169
 jungle type in the development of coffee families the municipality of 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.710
 Bethlehem of umbria in risaralda 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.089
 in everything that 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:14.449
 we pretend that we were going to make a draft text not having to go back 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.770
 university set 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.159
 the complaints of those that already exist sectors that lack it 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:22.919
 the manager of the company 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.930
 oscar something to be to the country 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.000
 highly qualified endings the patient 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.560
 john so many by the conduits argues that in his meeting where he

 the charges against him 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.500
 so that rural communities to improve their income that generates

 Between people

 the results of the regional ones of being accompanied 

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:59.309
 for example the football club
