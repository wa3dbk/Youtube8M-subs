00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.699 
it's kind of weird because I'm usually
in<00:03:50.400> there<00:03:50.670> giving<00:03:50.820> them<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.150> bubble<00:03:51.480> bath

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
in there giving them a bubble bath

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.380 
in there giving them a bubble bath
that's<00:03:52.709> one<00:03:52.980> of<00:03:53.100> these<00:03:53.250> disadvantages<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.150> the

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
that's one of these disadvantages of the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.000 
that's one of these disadvantages of the
bubbles<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.170> you<00:03:55.230> don't<00:03:55.440> find<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.769> poop

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
bubbles is that you don't find the poop

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.400 
bubbles is that you don't find the poop
until<00:03:56.870> bubbly<00:03:59.660> and<00:04:00.660> by<00:04:01.049> then<00:04:01.230> I've<00:04:01.380> been
