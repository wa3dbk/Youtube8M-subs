we're<00:00:54.780> supporting<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.469> first<00:00:56.250> structure<00:00:56.670> we

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
we're supporting this first structure we

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.600 
we're supporting this first structure we
actually<00:00:57.660> created<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.920> want<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.460> have

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
actually created a they want to have

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.350 
actually created a they want to have
interest<00:01:00.030> sleep<00:01:00.390> around<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.790> main<00:01:02.790> structure

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
interest sleep around the main structure

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.929 
interest sleep around the main structure
to<00:01:03.840> cannot<00:01:04.199> overhang<00:01:04.859> the<00:01:06.619> overlapped<00:01:07.619> a

to cannot overhang the overlapped a

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.709 
to cannot overhang the overlapped a
regular<00:01:09.709> base<00:01:10.709> so<00:01:11.459> it's<00:01:11.609> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.759> be<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.149> night

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
regular base so it's going to be a night

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.779 
regular base so it's going to be a night
for<00:01:12.959> around<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.889> half<00:01:14.069> because<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.520> the

going<00:01:59.069> to<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.159> full<00:01:59.789> support<00:02:00.240> now<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.380> this

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
going to be full support now in this

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.850 
going to be full support now in this
side<00:02:02.240> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.780> also<00:02:04.170> full

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
side going to be you know also full

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.679 
side going to be you know also full
supported<00:02:05.369> when<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.329> we're<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
supported when this I we're going to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.170 
supported when this I we're going to
leave<00:02:07.319> the<00:02:07.530> space<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:10.160> kitchen<00:02:11.160> sink<00:02:11.610> but

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
leave the space for the kitchen sink but

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.520 
leave the space for the kitchen sink but
you<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.510> me<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> lot<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.230> space<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you see me you have a lot of space to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.089 
you see me you have a lot of space to
work<00:02:13.830> with<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.870> really<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.769> strong

work with and it's really in a strong

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.520 
work with and it's really in a strong
for<00:02:17.670> all<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.819> way<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.150> play<00:02:18.480> for<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.140> concrete

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
for all the way to play for the concrete

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.520 
for all the way to play for the concrete
and<00:02:19.709> whenever<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.069> country<00:02:20.430> comes<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:21.530> here

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and whenever the country comes in here

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.620 
and whenever the country comes in here
gotta<00:02:22.950> jump<00:02:23.190> some<00:02:23.400> rebar<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:24.120> around<00:02:24.330> if<00:02:24.480> you

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
more country than we put the finishing

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.949 
more country than we put the finishing
with<00:02:34.650> piles<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.819> half<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.630> if<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.780> notice

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
with piles of half but if you notice

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.960 
with piles of half but if you notice
this<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.590> going<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.950> help<00:02:38.099> too<00:02:38.430> much<00:02:38.610> paint<00:02:38.849> a

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
this is going to help too much paint a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.259 
this is going to help too much paint a
structured<00:02:39.420> strong<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.060> nice<00:02:42.060> and

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
structured strong so this is nice and

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.009 
structured strong so this is nice and
straight<00:02:42.630> level<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.829> is<00:02:43.890> level<00:02:44.190> as<00:02:44.430> well<00:02:44.459> and

main sewer lines you know here I'll show
you<00:03:17.390> here<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.690> day<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.500> pump<00:03:19.799> power<00:03:20.010> hold

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
you here is the day the pump power hold

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.770 
you here is the day the pump power hold
on<00:03:20.959> we<00:03:21.959> say<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.670> nice<00:03:23.670> little<00:03:23.849> pump<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.510> got

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
on we say a nice little pump that got

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.220 
on we say a nice little pump that got
pump<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.230> water<00:03:25.260> out<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.920> sink<00:03:27.230> because

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
pump the water out of the sink because

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.649 
pump the water out of the sink because
the<00:03:28.859> proper<00:03:29.190> ventilation<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:30.060> Inlet<00:03:30.510> where

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
the proper ventilation and Inlet where

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.089 
the proper ventilation and Inlet where
the<00:03:30.930> old<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.170> waste<00:03:31.409> water<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.709> going<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.920> come

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
the old a waste water is going to come

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.599 
the old a waste water is going to come
in<00:03:32.340> an<00:03:32.700> Audi<00:03:32.879> how<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:35.040> put<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.370> together

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
in an Audi how to put this together

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.160 
in an Audi how to put this together
another<00:03:36.060> give<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.359> perspective<00:03:36.569> since<00:03:36.989> you

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
another give a perspective since you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.289 
another give a perspective since you
have<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.590> water<00:03:38.040> higher<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:39.000> mean<00:03:39.180> the

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
have the water higher I mean the

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.440 
have the water higher I mean the
waistline<00:03:39.720> higher<00:03:40.079> than<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.430> pump<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:42.389> need

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
waistline higher than the pump you need

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.819 
waistline higher than the pump you need
to<00:03:42.569> put<00:03:42.810> something<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.349> fully<00:03:43.560> checked

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
to put something that is fully checked

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.300 
to put something that is fully checked
out<00:03:44.099> in<00:03:44.609> a<00:03:45.030> check<00:03:45.329> valve<00:03:45.540> but<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.079> does<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:47.129> that

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
out in a check valve but it does is that

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.490 
out in a check valve but it does is that
it<00:03:47.370> allows<00:03:47.609> those<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.299> shoal<00:03:48.750> water<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.319> go

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
it allows those the shoal water to go

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.250 
it allows those the shoal water to go
away<00:03:50.159> but<00:03:50.849> not<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.150> come<00:03:51.359> in<00:03:51.389> so<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.870> don't

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
away but not to come in so you don't

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.199 
away but not to come in so you don't
have<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.829> much<00:03:52.980> water<00:03:53.159> here<00:03:53.549> it's<00:03:54.000> going<00:03:54.150> to

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
have that much water here it's going to

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.030 
have that much water here it's going to
be<00:03:54.299> on<00:03:54.420> your<00:03:54.540> system<00:03:54.989> but<00:03:55.650> it's<00:03:55.739> not<00:03:55.769> going<00:03:55.950> to

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
be on your system but it's not going to

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.740 
be on your system but it's not going to
be<00:03:56.129> in<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.310> pump<00:03:56.549> so<00:03:56.849> whatever<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.569> just

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
be in the pump so whatever you just

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.059 
be in the pump so whatever you just
close<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.049> water<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.410> going<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.590> run<00:03:58.829> away<00:03:58.949> and

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
close the water is going to run away and

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.129 
close the water is going to run away and
every<00:03:59.430> time<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.609> turn<00:03:59.849> the<00:04:00.030> water<00:04:00.180> on<00:04:00.329> is<00:04:00.959> that

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
every time you turn the water on is that

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.099 
every time you turn the water on is that
a<00:04:01.169> go<00:04:01.349> poor<00:04:02.129> store<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.699> outside<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.690> obviously

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
a go poor store the outside so obviously

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.229 
a go poor store the outside so obviously
we're<00:04:04.290> gonna<00:04:04.379> put<00:04:04.620> some<00:04:04.829> some<00:04:05.489> power<00:04:05.760> into<00:04:06.090> it

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
we're gonna put some some power into it

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.089 
we're gonna put some some power into it
powerful<00:04:07.199> your<00:04:07.470> your<00:04:08.000> regular<00:04:09.000> sink<00:04:09.359> hey<00:04:10.199> you

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
powerful your your regular sink hey you

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.800 
powerful your your regular sink hey you
know<00:04:12.680> pump<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.120> also<00:04:15.120> power<00:04:15.449> for<00:04:15.690> the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
know pump and also power for the

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.050 
know pump and also power for the
refrigerator<00:04:16.349> and<00:04:16.590> extra<00:04:17.160> outlet<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:17.729> people

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
refrigerator and extra outlet so people

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.629 
refrigerator and extra outlet so people
can<00:04:18.209> plug<00:04:18.419> in<00:04:18.570> stop<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.169> think<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:20.010> know<00:04:20.310> crew

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
can plug in stop and think you know crew

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.790 
can plug in stop and think you know crew
for<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.570> know<00:04:21.660> use<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.989> blender<00:04:22.169> or<00:04:22.530> whatever

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
for you know use the blender or whatever

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.439 
for you know use the blender or whatever
it<00:04:22.979> is<00:04:23.070> while<00:04:23.669> they're<00:04:23.910> in<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> outdoor

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
it is while they're in the outdoor

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.140 
it is while they're in the outdoor
kitchen<00:04:24.590> so<00:04:25.590> again<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.400> system<00:04:26.760> will<00:04:26.940> have<00:04:27.120> a

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
kitchen so again the system will have a

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.450 
kitchen so again the system will have a
ventilation<00:04:27.720> line<00:04:28.080> obviously<00:04:28.800> as<00:04:29.250> a

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
ventilation line obviously as a

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.550 
ventilation line obviously as a
ventilation<00:04:29.940> is<00:04:30.180> called<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.570> prevent<00:04:31.320> or

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
ventilation is called a prevent or

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.710 
ventilation is called a prevent or
Stewart<00:04:32.010> vent<00:04:32.220> this<00:04:32.940> thing<00:04:33.120> allows<00:04:33.389> air<00:04:33.690> to

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
Stewart vent this thing allows air to

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.370 
Stewart vent this thing allows air to
come<00:04:34.139> in<00:04:34.820> whenever<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:36.090> use<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.479> so<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.050> the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
come in whenever you use it so so the

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.430 
come in whenever you use it so so the
system<00:04:38.010> actually<00:04:38.210> will<00:04:39.210> will<00:04:39.599> drain<00:04:40.139> properly

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
system actually will will drain properly

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.719 
system actually will will drain properly
and<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:42.330> know

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
and you know

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.549 
and you know
owl<00:04:42.849> which<00:04:43.389> is<00:04:43.539> you<00:04:43.930> know<00:04:43.960> temper<00:04:44.349> on<00:04:44.439> the

outdoor valves open and you have to have
a<00:05:09.460> shower<00:05:09.729> valve<00:05:10.120> inside<00:05:10.479> the<00:05:10.629> house<00:05:10.839> or

a shower valve inside the house or

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.129 
a shower valve inside the house or
somewhere<00:05:11.889> where<00:05:12.159> it's<00:05:12.339> nice<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.550> insulated

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139

somewhere where it's nice and insulated
so<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.650> five<00:05:15.309> jumpers<00:05:15.699> i'm<00:05:16.210> using<00:05:16.389> this<00:05:16.779> case

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
so the five jumpers i'm using this case

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.129 
so the five jumpers i'm using this case
something<00:05:17.379> called<00:05:17.589> x<00:05:17.979> and<00:05:18.309> x<00:05:19.270> is<00:05:19.569> actually

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
something called x and x is actually

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.249 
something called x and x is actually
flexible<00:05:20.680> pipe<00:05:20.889> and<00:05:21.719> really<00:05:22.719> useful<00:05:23.139> in

a lot because it is flexible enough that
you<00:05:31.330> know<00:05:31.449> you<00:05:31.569> can<00:05:31.719> play<00:05:31.839> around<00:05:32.020> with<00:05:32.319> it

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
you know you can play around with it

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.499 
you know you can play around with it
then<00:05:32.649> in<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:33.210> clamps<00:05:34.210> and<00:05:34.360> all<00:05:34.419> the

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
then in the clamps and all the

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.119 
then in the clamps and all the
temperature<00:05:34.960> I<00:05:35.139> show<00:05:35.289> you<00:05:35.349> later<00:05:35.559> how<00:05:35.710> it<00:05:36.009> is

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
temperature I show you later how it is

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.429 
temperature I show you later how it is
but<00:05:36.819> he<00:05:36.999> sees<00:05:37.419> it<00:05:37.569> from<00:05:37.689> work<00:05:37.839> with<00:05:38.050> better

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:38.439 
but he sees it from work with better

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:41.040 
but he sees it from work with better
than<00:05:38.649> copper<00:05:39.129> or<00:05:39.399> PVC<00:05:39.819> that<00:05:40.149> is<00:05:40.270> a<00:05:40.479> little<00:05:40.809> more

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
than copper or PVC that is a little more

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.739 
than copper or PVC that is a little more
rough<00:05:41.289> and<00:05:41.319> steep<00:05:42.029> so<00:05:43.029> that's<00:05:43.419> pretty<00:05:43.659> much

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:43.749 
rough and steep so that's pretty much

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:47.820 
rough and steep so that's pretty much
about<00:05:44.469> this<00:05:44.889> this<00:05:46.319> countertop<00:05:47.319> and<00:05:47.499> how<00:05:47.649> is

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
about this this countertop and how is

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.260 
about this this countertop and how is
the<00:05:47.919> work<00:05:48.159> later<00:05:48.430> on<00:05:48.610> a<00:05:48.639> children<00:05:49.060> and<00:05:49.180> our

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
the work later on a children and our

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.289 
the work later on a children and our
digital<00:05:49.719> work<00:05:49.930> perfect
