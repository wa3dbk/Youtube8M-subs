in<00:00:41.680> this<00:00:42.680> video<00:00:42.980> we'll<00:00:43.220> talk<00:00:43.370> about<00:00:43.430> the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
in this video we'll talk about the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.990 
in this video we'll talk about the
chokers<00:00:44.230> what<00:00:45.230> are<00:00:45.380> they<00:00:45.500> for<00:00:45.730> how<00:00:46.730> are<00:00:46.910> they

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
chokers what are they for how are they

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.860 
chokers what are they for how are they
made<00:00:47.270> how<00:00:48.170> do<00:00:48.230> we<00:00:48.500> use<00:00:48.740> them<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:52.720> portable<00:00:53.720> winch

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
made how do we use them a portable winch

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.140 
made how do we use them a portable winch
we<00:00:54.110> offer<00:00:54.260> two<00:00:54.650> different<00:00:54.680> models<00:00:55.160> there's<00:00:56.060> a

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
we offer two different models there's a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.240 
we offer two different models there's a
chain<00:00:56.480> Joker<00:00:56.900> that<00:00:57.080> most<00:00:57.590> people<00:00:57.950> know<00:00:58.129> about

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
chain Joker that most people know about

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.370 
chain Joker that most people know about
but<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:02.600> also<00:01:02.780> have<00:01:03.140> a<00:01:03.379> rope<00:01:03.680> choker

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 
but we also have a rope choker

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.780 
but we also have a rope choker
this<00:01:06.380> one<00:01:06.650> is<00:01:06.800> more<00:01:06.950> particular<00:01:07.220> because<00:01:07.640> it's

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
this one is more particular because it's

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.359 
this one is more particular because it's
made<00:01:07.970> out<00:01:08.119> of<00:01:08.150> a<00:01:08.330> very<00:01:09.140> high<00:01:09.650> quality<00:01:09.710> fiber

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
made out of a very high quality fiber

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.609 
made out of a very high quality fiber
it's<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.150> plastic<00:01:11.390> fiber<00:01:11.810> but<00:01:12.080> it's<00:01:12.229> actually

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
it's a plastic fiber but it's actually

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.420 
it's a plastic fiber but it's actually
one<00:01:12.770> of<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:13.010> strongest<00:01:13.490> fiber<00:01:13.790> in<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.240> world

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
one of the strongest fiber in the world

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.810 
one of the strongest fiber in the world
bow<00:01:17.430> chokers<00:01:17.910> offer<00:01:18.150> similar<00:01:18.920> specs<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
bow chokers offer similar specs but the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.430 
bow chokers offer similar specs but the
difference<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.600> main<00:01:21.810> difference<00:01:21.870> actually

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
difference the main difference actually

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.710 
difference the main difference actually
is<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.890> weight<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.570> made

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
is the weight because this one is made

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.770 
is the weight because this one is made
of<00:01:24.750> plastic<00:01:25.730> it's<00:01:26.730> a<00:01:27.000> lot<00:01:27.270> lighter<00:01:27.570> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
of plastic it's a lot lighter so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.720 
of plastic it's a lot lighter so
according<00:01:28.620> to<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.010> need<00:01:29.160> to<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.490> for

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
according to what you need to do for

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.790 
according to what you need to do for
instance<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:30.360> you're<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> hunter<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.620> might

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
instance if you're a hunter you might

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.830 
instance if you're a hunter you might
walk<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.130> long<00:01:32.430> distance<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:33.120> your<00:01:33.150> equipment

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
walk a long distance with your equipment

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.060 
walk a long distance with your equipment
so<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.050> don't<00:01:34.290> want<00:01:34.440> to<00:01:34.530> carry<00:01:34.710> much<00:01:35.040> weight

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
so you don't want to carry much weight

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
so you don't want to carry much weight
this<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.120> might<00:01:36.300> be<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.600> perfect<00:01:36.810> fit<00:01:37.260> for

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
this one might be the perfect fit for

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.600 
this one might be the perfect fit for
you<00:01:38.480> they<00:01:39.480> both<00:01:39.690> come<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.230> steel<00:01:41.040> rod<00:01:41.310> at<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you they both come with steel rod at the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120 
you they both come with steel rod at the
end<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.120> you're<00:01:42.330> able<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:42.990> under<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> log<00:01:43.800> or

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
end so you're able to go under a log or

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.580 
end so you're able to go under a log or
through<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> nose<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> skidding<00:01:45.210> cone

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
through the nose of the skidding cone

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.050 
through the nose of the skidding cone
when<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.710> buy<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> choker<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.610> comes<00:01:47.820> from

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
when you buy a choker and it comes from

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.050 
when you buy a choker and it comes from
our<00:01:48.210> shop<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.780> rod<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.800> pretty<00:01:50.370> straight<00:01:50.730> what

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
our shop the rod is pretty straight what

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.150 
our shop the rod is pretty straight what
we<00:01:51.180> suggest<00:01:51.660> it<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.950> can

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
we suggest it that is that you can

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.280 
we suggest it that is that you can
actually<00:01:53.910> bend<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.900> knee<00:01:55.080> a<00:01:55.110> little

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
actually bend it on your knee a little

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.890 
actually bend it on your knee a little
bit<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.890> will<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.370> easier<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.210> go<00:01:57.330> under<00:01:57.720> the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
bit so it will be easier to go under the

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.290 
bit so it will be easier to go under the
log<00:01:58.080> with<00:01:58.260> it<00:01:58.410> all<00:01:58.980> you<00:01:59.160> need<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.490> do<00:02:02.060> all<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
log with it all you need to do all you

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.500 
log with it all you need to do all you
need<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.690> is<00:02:03.840> put<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.650> this<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.130> then

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
need to do is put it like this and then

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.050 
need to do is put it like this and then
bend<00:02:06.510> it<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.690> that<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.410> by<00:02:08.070> giving<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.610> this

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
bend it like that so by giving it this

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.540 
bend it like that so by giving it this
kind<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.390> shape<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:10.230> will<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.710> lot<00:02:10.920> easier<00:02:11.100> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
kind of shape it will be a lot easier to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.570 
kind of shape it will be a lot easier to
use<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.890> difference<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.720> see<00:02:15.990> also<00:02:16.580> on

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
use the difference that you see also on

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.580 
use the difference that you see also on
the<00:02:18.000> two<00:02:18.180> models<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.810> one<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.380> equipped

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the two models is that one is equipped

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.280 
the two models is that one is equipped
with<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.830> c<00:02:20.130> hook<00:02:20.370> which<00:02:21.060> allows<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.930> put

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
with a c hook which allows you to put

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.310 
with a c hook which allows you to put
this<00:02:22.560> hook<00:02:23.160> anywhere<00:02:23.820> on<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> chain<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:25.230> we

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
this hook anywhere on the chain so we

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.280 
this hook anywhere on the chain so we
don't<00:02:25.530> have<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.920> go<00:02:26.070> through<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> hole<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:28.080> use

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
don't have to go through a hole to use

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.910 
don't have to go through a hole to use
it<00:02:28.500> as<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.400> one<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:29.880> an<00:02:30.090> eye<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:31.770> in

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
it as for this one it's an eye so in

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.740 
it as for this one it's an eye so in
this<00:02:32.100> case<00:02:32.370> when<00:02:33.030> you're<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.360> use<00:02:33.540> it

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
this case when you're going to use it

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.229 
this case when you're going to use it
you<00:02:33.959> will<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.560> go<00:02:34.709> through<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.489> eye<00:02:35.520> to

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
you will have to go through the eye to

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.730 
you will have to go through the eye to
choke<00:02:36.510> your<00:02:36.690> log<00:02:37.100> like<00:02:38.100> this

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.600 

as<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.350> length<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:44.040> strength<00:02:44.370> of

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
as for the length and the strength of

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.050 
as for the length and the strength of
each<00:02:44.820> models<00:02:45.360> they<00:02:46.080> both<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.610> length<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.850> two

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
each models they both have length of two

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.080 
each models they both have length of two
point<00:02:48.300> one<00:02:48.480> meter<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:49.410> one<00:02:49.710> is<00:02:49.950> about<00:02:50.100> 5000

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
point one meter this one is about 5000

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.200 
point one meter this one is about 5000
kilogram<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.920> break<00:02:52.920> point<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:53.820> one<00:02:54.030> is

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
kilogram of break point and this one is

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.040 
kilogram of break point and this one is
up<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.840> 7,000<00:02:55.710> kilo<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.100> break<00:02:56.340> point<00:02:57.020> okay<00:02:58.020> so

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
up to 7,000 kilo of break point okay so

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.410 
up to 7,000 kilo of break point okay so
now<00:02:58.320> let's<00:02:58.590> see<00:02:58.770> how<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:58.950> use<00:02:59.130> them<00:02:59.640> it's

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
now let's see how to use them it's

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.110 
now let's see how to use them it's
actually<00:03:00.600> pretty<00:03:01.080> simple<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.700> first<00:03:02.940> thing

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
actually pretty simple the first thing

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.540 
actually pretty simple the first thing
you<00:03:03.210> need<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.390> do<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.870> use<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:04.800> steel<00:03:05.040> rod<00:03:05.250> to

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
you need to do is use this steel rod to

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.420 
you need to do is use this steel rod to
go<00:03:05.670> under<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.240> log<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.710> just<00:03:10.920> pull<00:03:11.190> on

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
go under the log then you just pull on

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.950 
go under the log then you just pull on
your<00:03:11.940> chain<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.650> after<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.180> use<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.660> C

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
your chain and after that you use the C

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.520 
your chain and after that you use the C
hook<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:20.250> attach<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.110> chain<00:03:22.320> like

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
hook and you attach it to the chain like

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.010 
hook and you attach it to the chain like
this<00:03:22.730> it's<00:03:23.730> really<00:03:23.970> important<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.600> have<00:03:24.750> the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
this it's really important to have the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.690 
this it's really important to have the
opening<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.710> hook<00:03:25.890> towards<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.520> back

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
opening of the hook towards the back

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.340 
opening of the hook towards the back
because<00:03:26.970> your<00:03:27.300> choker<00:03:27.570> is<00:03:27.720> gonna<00:03:27.930> pull<00:03:28.200> in

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
because your choker is gonna pull in

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.190 
because your choker is gonna pull in
this<00:03:28.500> direction<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:32.810> once<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.960> choker

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
this direction like that once the choker

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.990 
this direction like that once the choker
chain<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:34.800> position<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.460> need<00:03:35.820> to

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
chain is in position you just need to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.410 
chain is in position you just need to
put<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.330> skidding<00:03:36.570> cone<00:03:38.000> there's<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.090> video

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
put the skidding cone there's a video

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.150 
put the skidding cone there's a video
about<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.810> product<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.770> see<00:03:41.010> as

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
about that product that you can see as

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.610 
about that product that you can see as
well<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:42.510> again<00:03:43.050> using<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.800> steel<00:03:44.640> rod<00:03:45.620> you

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
well so again using the steel rod you

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.240 
well so again using the steel rod you
just<00:03:46.830> go<00:03:47.010> through<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.580> nose<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.060> cone

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.930 

then<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.400> push<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.790> cone<00:03:54.150> on<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.720> lock<00:03:55.940> like

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
then you push the cone on the lock like

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.300 
then you push the cone on the lock like
this<00:03:59.450> after<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.620> take<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.800> hook<00:04:02.010> at<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.190> end

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
this after that take the hook at the end

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.080 
this after that take the hook at the end
of<00:04:02.520> your<00:04:02.640> rope<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.900> simply<00:04:04.350> insert<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:05.070> into<00:04:05.880> a

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
of your rope and simply insert it into a

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.070 
of your rope and simply insert it into a
chain<00:04:06.390> link<00:04:08.030> lock<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.210> in<00:04:09.360> position<00:04:09.510> and

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
chain link lock it in position and

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.230 
chain link lock it in position and
you're<00:04:10.770> ready<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.130> go<00:04:11.280> all<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.850> need<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.120> do

you're ready to go all you need to do

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.540 
you're ready to go all you need to do
left<00:04:12.480> is<00:04:12.720> go<00:04:12.900> back<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.350> winch<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.860> pull

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
left is go back to the winch and pull

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.380 
left is go back to the winch and pull
your<00:04:14.700> log

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.330 

and<00:04:18.390> now<00:04:18.959> let's<00:04:19.200> see<00:04:19.350> how<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.530> install<00:04:19.950> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
and now let's see how to install the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.600 
and now let's see how to install the
Rope<00:04:20.550> choker<00:04:21.770> again<00:04:22.770> with<00:04:23.010> this<00:04:23.160> steel<00:04:23.400> rod

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
Rope choker again with this steel rod

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.400 
Rope choker again with this steel rod
you<00:04:23.880> just<00:04:24.120> go<00:04:24.240> under<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.810> log<00:04:27.140> but<00:04:28.140> in<00:04:28.260> this

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
you just go under the log but in this

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.260 
you just go under the log but in this
case<00:04:28.650> like<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:28.920> said<00:04:29.280> earlier<00:04:29.610> since<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.150> an

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
case like I said earlier since it's an

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.090 
case like I said earlier since it's an
eye<00:04:30.420> you<00:04:30.840> need<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.110> go<00:04:31.260> through<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.620> eye<00:04:31.650> and

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
eye you need to go through the eye and

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.910 
eye you need to go through the eye and
then<00:04:32.580> choke<00:04:32.910> your<00:04:33.060> tree<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:36.500> little<00:04:37.500> trick<00:04:37.770> is

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
then choke your tree a little trick is

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.550 
then choke your tree a little trick is
that<00:04:37.950> if<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.880> need<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.090> turn<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.200> log<00:04:40.410> when

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
that if you need to turn the log when

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.740 
that if you need to turn the log when
you're<00:04:40.710> gonna<00:04:40.860> pull<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.310> because<00:04:42.030> it's<00:04:42.210> stuck

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
you're gonna pull it because it's stuck

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.530 
you're gonna pull it because it's stuck
or<00:04:42.930> something<00:04:43.080> like<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.740> can<00:04:44.090> put<00:04:45.090> the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
or something like that you can put the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.870 
or something like that you can put the
choker<00:04:45.990> in<00:04:46.260> another<00:04:47.130> direction<00:04:47.580> like<00:04:47.850> this

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
choker in another direction like this

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.120 
choker in another direction like this
and<00:04:48.390> then<00:04:48.510> when<00:04:48.690> you're<00:04:48.810> gonna<00:04:48.990> pull<00:04:49.290> it's

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
and then when you're gonna pull it's

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.820 
and then when you're gonna pull it's
gonna<00:04:50.370> roll<00:04:50.610> like<00:04:50.880> this<00:04:51.290> that<00:04:52.290> might<00:04:52.500> come<00:04:52.680> in

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
gonna roll like this that might come in

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.140 
gonna roll like this that might come in
to<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.070> once<00:04:53.220> in<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.400> while<00:04:54.920> then<00:04:55.920> just<00:04:56.790> put<00:04:57.000> the

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
to you once in a while then just put the

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.560 
to you once in a while then just put the
skidding<00:04:57.480> cone<00:05:00.980> again<00:05:01.980> through<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:02.970> nose<00:05:03.360> of

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
skidding cone again through the nose of

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.660 
skidding cone again through the nose of
the<00:05:03.690> cone<00:05:03.900> with<00:05:04.110> this<00:05:04.350> rod<00:05:09.050> inserting<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.110> cone

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
the cone with this rod inserting a cone

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.090 
the cone with this rod inserting a cone
and<00:05:11.670> here<00:05:11.940> you<00:05:12.060> only<00:05:12.180> have<00:05:12.480> three<00:05:12.930> links<00:05:13.290> so

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
and here you only have three links so

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.800 
and here you only have three links so
it's<00:05:14.250> important<00:05:14.730> to<00:05:14.880> use<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.090> one<00:05:15.450> that<00:05:15.630> is<00:05:15.780> in

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
it's important to use the one that is in
