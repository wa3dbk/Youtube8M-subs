00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.520
 to me 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.760
 speaks good guys all you here erick 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.740
 critically yes I'll start my 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.480
 video of today asking for forgiveness for hesitation 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.160
 in yesterday's video because I know that 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.579
 audited a piece of shit I had to stick it 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.470
 video so I think that today the provi 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.720
 hanging out with someone decent audible 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.330
 although my voice will not be prettier 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.710
 Come on, let's go. 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.480
 I talked about what is the video of 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.780
 today's video is about five 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.860
 villains deserve a great game itself 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.839
 most of them end up dying 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.000
 eventually some stage of the game in 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.530
 some stage of the series but they deserved 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.120
 a game even to tell a little 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.510
 plus the story of them that are in 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.590
 In some cases villains end up having 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.390
 more prominent than their own 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.000
 main characters the games 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.100
 well come on then now our first 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.289
 villain in question is the general orlando 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.840
 guilhon it is certain that the son of 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.369
 bitch already won one of them and crystal but I 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.250
 I think he's such a fucking character 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.320
 that he deserved an extended version one 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.000
 complete game nor do they actually enjoy 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.560
 that the black box that is working on 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.050
 your new shape who knows they could 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.990
 also enjoy to show more 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.720
 details of that part of the profits 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.560
 eating tail 12 of the core and the rest of the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.539
 human confederations there ends 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.130
 beyond what is a great opportunity to 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.869
 show a little more of your own 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.060
 society of the crazy ones, right? 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.670
 so I think it would look pretty good 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.429
 another visit from the world of this 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.399
 character is liking the front is not 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.009
 do not even know the jewelry is the second 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.880
 today's character are the likes of 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:53.509
 because they are the two most 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.479
 of history and no one knows why. 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.399
 none about them because they hate one 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.020
 little because they want to chase 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.789
 I think these would be very issues 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.179
 relevant to be explained in theft 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.640
 our third villain today is the sef 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.830
 everyone who is a remake of fame 17 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.650
 but what would be very interesting 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.720
 instead of a remake the game only on the 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.370
 sex with his story, we already 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.470
 had school daycare that spoke a little 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.870
 about him is but he ended up addressing 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.819
 zac I think it would be sensational so 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.439
 looks smart and would shut up 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.250
 everyone who is late remake was 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.709
 out of 7 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.819
 if they put ff as a character 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.640
 main long 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.200
 the fourth auction today is a wildcard is 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.719
 one of the most charismatic characters in the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.760
 story and who ended up winning a whore 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.189
 popularity thanks to flash 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.010
 but even before he already has many 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.170
 stories musician in comics with a 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.180
 deadly joke or else the batman himself 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.329
 arkham asylum and mark if it is 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.709
 Smashing cow time they also though 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.689
 from evolution to dung 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.939
 but I think a game like joker is 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:58.069
 to be well shaped even more within the 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.840
 universe of the ark things 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.269
 closing our list we have one of the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.930
 more sadistic villains in history than I 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.849
 go if you're a big son of a bitch who 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.639
 torture you theory during the 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.409
 whole game but you do not know so much 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.989
 thing that happens to him during the 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.540
 game then it will be interesting to see 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.150
 how he came to power before the 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.400
 43 events revive a bit like it 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.739
 it goes completely crazy that the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.370
 example of what the actual guide itself 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.599
 box now made with psycho edge before 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.159
 showing some background story 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.079
 the sweet river the jec and how he turned the 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.229
 reduction of the IRC that until then was only 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.359
 jec good galera is the stay for here short 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.919
 subscribe to comments favorite 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.419
 I liked my boy bike 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:46.359
 divan of the painting, right? 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:46.359
 but that's it folks see until next time
