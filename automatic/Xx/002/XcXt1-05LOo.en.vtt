lot of different improvements and ways
to<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.279> around<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:29.910> also<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.359> better<00:00:30.810> way

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050

the three different exits out of every
single<00:00:45.570> base<00:00:45.750> there<00:00:46.079> really<00:00:46.469> shouldn't<00:00:46.680> be

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
single base there really shouldn't be

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.200 
single base there really shouldn't be
any<00:00:47.010> problems<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.789> we're<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> go<00:00:48.149> ahead

now<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.930> speeds<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.069> about<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
now this speeds you up to about a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.949 
now this speeds you up to about a
hundred<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.700> seventy<00:02:09.060> five<00:02:09.149> percent<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.750> your

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
hundred and seventy five percent of your

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.960 
hundred and seventy five percent of your
normal<00:02:10.560> speed<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.280> almost<00:02:11.430> twice<00:02:11.940> as

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
normal speed so it's almost twice as

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.240 
normal speed so it's almost twice as
fast<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.690> far<00:02:13.470> as<00:02:13.590> running<00:02:13.890> go

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
fast as far as running go

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.400 
fast as far as running go
is<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.940> game<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.630> really<00:02:15.930> nice

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
the best way to do it is obviously going

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.570 
the best way to do it is obviously going
to<00:02:47.880> be<00:02:48.170> hiding<00:02:49.170> them<00:02:49.350> somewhere<00:02:49.950> special<00:02:50.220> so

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
to be hiding them somewhere special so

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.340 
to be hiding them somewhere special so
let's<00:02:50.760> go<00:02:50.940> ahead<00:02:50.970> we're<00:02:51.780> going<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.959> choose

let's go ahead we're going to choose

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.070 
let's go ahead we're going to choose
this<00:02:52.380> loadout<00:02:53.150> okay<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.360> we're<00:02:54.930> going<00:02:55.050> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
this loadout okay and we're going to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.560 
this loadout okay and we're going to
rock<00:02:55.320> out<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.590> our<00:02:55.860> base<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.340> honestly<00:02:57.180> every

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
rock out of our base and honestly every

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.120 
rock out of our base and honestly every
single<00:02:57.900> base<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.290> every<00:02:58.530> single<00:02:58.680> map<00:02:58.920> has

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
single base in every single map has

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.190 
single base in every single map has
three<00:02:59.400> exits<00:02:59.760> there's<00:03:00.180> two<00:03:00.390> exits<00:03:00.810> up<00:03:00.959> here

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
three exits there's two exits up here

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.680 
three exits there's two exits up here
and<00:03:01.320> there's<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.190> here<00:03:02.459> again<00:03:02.940> with<00:03:03.510> these

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
and there's one here again with these

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.780 
and there's one here again with these
walls<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.290> block<00:03:04.620> any<00:03:04.920> bullets<00:03:05.340> from<00:03:05.459> going

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
walls that block any bullets from going

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.120 
walls that block any bullets from going
through<00:03:06.030> them<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.390> then<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.650> your<00:03:07.680> base

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
through them and then you have your base

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.820 
through them and then you have your base
camp<00:03:08.550> turrets<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.570> really<00:03:10.020> based<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.470> people

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
camp turrets that really based on people

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.290 
camp turrets that really based on people
if<00:03:10.950> they<00:03:11.100> get<00:03:11.280> too<00:03:11.459> close<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.090> should<00:03:12.270> have

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
if they get too close so you should have

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.900 
if they get too close so you should have
a<00:03:12.480> fairly<00:03:12.930> safe<00:03:13.230> exit<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.800> begin<00:03:14.070> with<00:03:14.250> let's

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
a fairly safe exit to begin with let's

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.280 
a fairly safe exit to begin with let's
go<00:03:15.030> ahead<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.180> drop<00:03:15.420> out<00:03:15.600> here<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.050> i'm<00:03:16.140> going

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
go ahead and drop out here and i'm going

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.160 
go ahead and drop out here and i'm going
to<00:03:16.350> show<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.590> why<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.880> spawn<00:03:18.360> point<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
to show you why the spawn point is the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.470 
to show you why the spawn point is the
greatest<00:03:19.560> way<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.130> get<00:03:20.700> your<00:03:20.820> team<00:03:21.060> out<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.420> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
greatest way to get your team out of the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.509 
greatest way to get your team out of the
base<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:22.380> be<00:03:22.560> one<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.040> most<00:03:23.220> useful

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
base to be one of the most useful

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.259 
base to be one of the most useful
players<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.269> can<00:03:24.420> be<00:03:24.570> on<00:03:24.750> your<00:03:24.810> team<00:03:25.320> so

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
players that you can be on your team so

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.460 
players that you can be on your team so
again<00:03:27.269> what<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.630> allows<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.320> do<00:03:28.440> is

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
again what this allows you to do is

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.170 
again what this allows you to do is
spawn<00:03:29.010> anywhere<00:03:29.519> on<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.760> map<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.090> you

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
spawn anywhere on the map that you

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.330 
spawn anywhere on the map that you
decide<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:30.870> i<00:03:30.900> hit<00:03:31.080> right<00:03:31.350> on<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.650> d-pad<00:03:31.799> once

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
decide so i hit right on the d-pad once

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.220 
decide so i hit right on the d-pad once
i<00:03:32.459> have<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.640> selected<00:03:32.940> as<00:03:33.330> my<00:03:33.510> secondary<00:03:33.959> perk

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
i have it selected as my secondary perk

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.740 
i have it selected as my secondary perk
and<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.830> can<00:03:34.980> see<00:03:35.190> i<00:03:35.370> can<00:03:35.670> press<00:03:35.850> r2<00:03:36.150> to

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
and you can see i can press r2 to

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.690 
and you can see i can press r2 to
construct<00:03:37.200> my<00:03:37.350> spawn<00:03:37.620> beacon<00:03:37.799> anywhere<00:03:38.489> that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
construct my spawn beacon anywhere that

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.660 
construct my spawn beacon anywhere that
I'd<00:03:38.790> like<00:03:39.060> now<00:03:39.870> as<00:03:40.110> far<00:03:40.620> as<00:03:40.739> advice<00:03:41.100> goes<00:03:41.430> I

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
I'd like now as far as advice goes I

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.330 
I'd like now as far as advice goes I
would<00:03:41.910> put<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.959> plant<00:03:43.230> or<00:03:43.470> something<00:03:43.560> of

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
would put it in a plant or something of

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
would put it in a plant or something of
that<00:03:44.370> nature<00:03:44.519> because<00:03:44.970> if<00:03:45.090> you're<00:03:45.209> on<00:03:45.299> the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
that nature because if you're on the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.910 
that nature because if you're on the
other<00:03:45.420> team<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.720> you're<00:03:45.930> running<00:03:46.019> by<00:03:46.290> there's

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
other team and you're running by there's

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.710 
other team and you're running by there's
not<00:03:47.070> going<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.250> be<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.370> name<00:03:47.640> over<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.660> you

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
not going to be a name over it so you

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.289 
not going to be a name over it so you
can't<00:03:49.049> even<00:03:49.260> see<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.829> right<00:03:50.250> it's<00:03:50.640> very<00:03:50.970> well

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
can't even see it right it's very well

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.020 
can't even see it right it's very well
hidden<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:51.810> there<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.850> because<00:03:53.850> they're

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
hidden in there and because they're

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.120 
hidden in there and because they're
easily<00:03:54.180> destroyed<00:03:54.720> hiding<00:03:55.350> them<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.860> best

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
easily destroyed hiding them is the best

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.699

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
what a spawn beacon does and then we're

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.939 
what a spawn beacon does and then we're
going<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.050> call<00:04:30.169> it<00:04:30.199> quits<00:04:30.409> on<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:30.770> because

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.649 
that and see what happens now if you
look<00:04:48.860> I'm<00:04:49.099> right<00:04:49.759> near<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.210> middle<00:04:50.449> of<00:04:50.569> the

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
look I'm right near the middle of the

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.360 
look I'm right near the middle of the
map<00:04:50.840> outside<00:04:51.379> in<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.560> park<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:51.919> again<00:04:52.219> you

map outside in the park and again you

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.309 
map outside in the park and again you
can<00:04:52.400> just<00:04:53.090> barely<00:04:53.389> see<00:04:53.599> that<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.199> enemy

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
can just barely see that so the enemy

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.959 
can just barely see that so the enemy
