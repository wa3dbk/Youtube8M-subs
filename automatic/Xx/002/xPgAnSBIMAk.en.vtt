00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.230
 I represent Japan Communist Party 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.660
 Road revenue exception law 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.290
 We will debate against the re-decision of the proposed amendments 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:13.579
 Government and ruling party 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:14.909
 April 30 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:16.169
 Such as gasoline tax 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.509
 Revive the provisional tax rate 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.470
 Tax Special Measures Act 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.819
 Re-vote after considering it not to be in the upper house 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.599
 I wish I could not go there historically 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.360
 It will reach 2 trillion 600 billion yen 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.019
 By tax increase 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.090
 Gasoline price 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.390
 The price has been raised sharply by Â¥ 1,130 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.690
 From the moment 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.150
 bu food products 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.420
 Opening of products etc 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.990
 Of daily necessities 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.920
 Add companies to price hikes 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.180
 In the national life 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.360
 Gives great anxieties and techniques 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.680
 I will not give back nominations of the people and alone 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.280
 The attitude of the Fukuda Cabinet 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.730
 Absolutely unacceptable 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.170
 Cabinet support rate 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.780
 It is natural that it dropped sharply to the 10% level 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.570
 Ignoring Muniel's will 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.640
 To the Fukuda Cabinet 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.480
 I can not afford to give government 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.160
 The government and the ruling party sincerely accept that it is the overwhelming voice of the people 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.170
 Should be 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.550
 in spite of 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.020
 It was rejected at the last meeting of the House of Councilors 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.670
 Road specific revenue source special bill 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.860
 I am trying to vote again 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.979
 More than once 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.510
 Even twice 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.760
 Repeat Robo 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.010
 Many Germans have gone to basara 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.790
 Attitude to ignore public opinion 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.790
 In particular, they have to be scattered and buried 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.320
 In the first place 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.159
 Of this time 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.350
 Robot wax 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.909
 There is no reason for re-voting of the Financial Resources Special Law amendment draft 1. 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.860
 This special bill 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.130
 Basic policy of Prime Minister Fukuda's generalization of financial resources from fiscal 2009 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.990
 Contradictory 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.560
 Road specific revenue source 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.619
 Re-voted the special bill to maintain for 10 years 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.220
 while doing 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.190
 Why did you go there for a year 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.990
 If you do not vote again 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.840
 Specific resources do not weather 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.780
 As it is 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.249
 It seems to be able to become general revenue source 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.309
 the government 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:13.309
 today's 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:14.679
 Cabinet decision 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:18.109
 We say that we secure the law revision of general revenue from the next fiscal year 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:18.639
 But 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.819
 that is 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.249
 Rule of road specific resources system 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.919
 In addition to the wording that it does not apply from 2009 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.429
 Not too much 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:28.980
 At the decision of the Diet 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.069
 It is a problem in itself to limit the laws to be organized by cabinet decision 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.249
 It will not be in charge unless the bill is amended 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.030
 Successive governments 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.370
 Repeated cabinet decisions to achieve general revenue and so on 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.879
 While 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.690
 That 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.519
 I am really doing it 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.519
 People should never forget this fact 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.859
 the government 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.559
 Local road maintenance if the bill is not passed 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.909
 Temporary grant of 700 billion yen 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.539
 It has been re-voted-909 that it can not be allocated to the provinces 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.159
 This temporary grant is 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.610
 Specific revenue system 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.419
 It is based on the premise 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.669
 Under General Funding from the General 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.899
 If not reviewed 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.439
 Certainly many local governments 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.209
 It is urgently required that it will not be difficult to cut local financial resources. 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.449
 But to excuse it 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.609
 It is to continue specific financial resources 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.189
 I can not forgive you 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.409
 It is good thing to do grant tax measures 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.690
 Furthermore, by making the special bill re-vote 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.959
 Contradictions take off one after another 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.490
 Tuition fee for road maintenance 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.369
 The main item of the total amount 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:41.299
 The bill is 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.749
 Article 5 paragraph 5 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:46.569
 It is prescribed that the tuition fee of the road maintenance for 10 years is decided by the Cabinet 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.519
 doing 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.750
 If you decide the 10-year tuition fee for road maintenance 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.949
 We will secure road resources beforehand 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.010
 For the government ruling party decision 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.189
 Include when we advance road maintenance judged to be really necessary 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.959
 It is rare 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.940
 Continue road maintenance 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.030
 Isn't it mean to go ahead with priority 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.189
 Aiming for General Funding 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.189
 I can not but say that he is a bad guy 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:15.569
 Road medium-term plan plan is 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:16.609
 10 years 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.099
 I say it will be five years 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.120
 that is 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.180
 What is different from before 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.599
 Nothing is revealed 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.939
 Current mid-term plan 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.779
 It was a plan that canceled the new construction of the expressway 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:33.629
 14,000 kilometers of high standard highway 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.620
 Local high standard road of approximately 7,000 kilometers 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.129
 Further ahead 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.809
 Including strait crossing road 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:42.189
 There is a lot of planning 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.009
 There is no limit 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.740
 Expressway priority 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.280
 Now that road policy is the obstacle to generalization 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.740
 It is done 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.529
 From such a road policy 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.409
 Mainly on maintenance and management of life roads familiar to residents 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.860
 To switch to road policy 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.099
 Sought 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.939
 Successive LDP politics have been pillars of land policy 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.979
 We should warm up politics fundamentally by expressway construction entrance 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.289
 Is 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.289
 Finally 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.370
 Road specific revenue source 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.069
 Urgent Success for People's Life 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:18.750
 According to priority 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.960
 anything 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.740
 Make it usable 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.580
 A fundamental change in the way tax is used 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.620
 Is 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.849
 Pointed out above 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.150
 Of road finance exception law revision bill 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.500
 I am a lantern who opposes the bank to re-vote
