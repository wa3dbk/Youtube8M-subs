your<00:03:36.040> soldering<00:03:36.489> station<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:39.870> with<00:03:40.870> any<00:03:41.140> tip

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
your soldering station and with any tip

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.400 
your soldering station and with any tip
and<00:03:42.220> make<00:03:42.880> sure<00:03:43.030> your<00:03:43.209> tip<00:03:43.480> whenever<00:03:44.140> you're

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
and make sure your tip whenever you're

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.670 
and make sure your tip whenever you're
soldering<00:03:44.950> anything<00:03:45.580> is<00:03:47.580> liquid<00:03:48.580> solder<00:03:49.680> on

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
soldering anything is liquid solder on

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.740 
soldering anything is liquid solder on
it<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.849> we're<00:03:52.000> going<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.150> be<00:03:52.269> removing<00:03:52.660> the

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
it is we're going to be removing the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.199 
it is we're going to be removing the
wires<00:03:52.930> now<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.730> just<00:03:54.760> takes<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.180> minute

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
wires now and it just takes a minute

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:05.039 
wires now and it just takes a minute
make<00:03:55.840> sure<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:58.260> you<00:04:00.420> desolder<00:04:03.630> don't<00:04:04.630> yank

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
make sure that you desolder don't yank

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:13.830 
make sure that you desolder don't yank
off<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:08.099> your<00:04:09.099> points<00:04:09.989> because<00:04:10.989> you<00:04:11.109> can<00:04:12.840> pull

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
off the your points because you can pull

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:22.260 
off the your points because you can pull
off<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:14.079> contacts

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.290 

on<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.080> board<00:04:24.900> ok<00:04:25.900> we<00:04:26.050> have<00:04:26.229> that<00:04:26.530> off<00:04:27.340> next

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
on the board ok we have that off next

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.390 
on the board ok we have that off next
thing<00:04:28.449> we're<00:04:28.569> going<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:28.720> do<00:04:29.039> is<00:04:30.039> we<00:04:30.190> have<00:04:30.280> to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
thing we're going to do is we have to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.110 
thing we're going to do is we have to
bridge<00:04:31.830> those<00:04:32.830> areas<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.610> we've<00:04:33.759> cut

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
bridge those areas that we've cut

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.300 
bridge those areas that we've cut
previously<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:35.110> just<00:04:35.830> use<00:04:35.949> a<00:04:35.979> piece<00:04:36.280> of

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
previously I just use a piece of

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:47.879 
previously I just use a piece of
resistor<00:04:37.150> wire<00:04:39.629> and<00:04:43.500> bit<00:04:44.500> of<00:04:44.620> solder<00:04:46.770> hold<00:04:47.770> it

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
resistor wire and bit of solder hold it

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.189 
resistor wire and bit of solder hold it
in<00:04:47.979> place<00:04:48.159> and<00:04:50.220> make<00:04:51.220> sure<00:04:51.659> that<00:04:52.659> you<00:04:52.870> get<00:04:52.960> all

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
in place and make sure that you get all

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:58.680 
in place and make sure that you get all
three<00:04:53.530> points<00:04:53.770> soldered<00:04:54.479> on<00:04:55.479> there<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:57.690> one

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
three points soldered on there and one

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.990 
three points soldered on there and one
more<00:04:58.900> little<00:04:59.050> piece<00:04:59.380> where<00:05:00.340> we<00:05:00.610> didn't<00:05:00.880> have

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
more little piece where we didn't have

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.070 
more little piece where we didn't have
any<00:05:01.240> wires<00:05:01.539> cut<00:05:01.979> just<00:05:02.979> drop<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.280> on<00:05:03.610> there

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
any wires cut just drop that on there

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.020 
any wires cut just drop that on there
inside<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.380> two<00:05:05.590> sides<00:05:08.220> OOP<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.909> was<00:05:10.000> a

inside of the two sides OOP that was a

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:23.420 
inside of the two sides OOP that was a
piece<00:05:10.180> of<00:05:10.240> Sutter

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.460 

and<00:05:24.110> make<00:05:25.110> sure<00:05:25.140> that<00:05:25.650> both<00:05:25.830> sides<00:05:26.130> are

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
and make sure that both sides are

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:35.150 
and make sure that both sides are
soldered<00:05:28.940> okay<00:05:33.830> looks<00:05:34.830> like<00:05:34.950> a<00:05:35.010> nice

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
soldered okay looks like a nice

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.590 
soldered okay looks like a nice
