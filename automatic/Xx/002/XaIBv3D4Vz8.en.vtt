00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
I'm going to be demonstrating just a

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.940 
I'm going to be demonstrating just a
wooden<00:01:02.800> dowel<00:01:03.129> it's<00:01:03.730> a<00:01:03.820> copper<00:01:04.059> pipe<00:01:04.800> cut<00:01:05.800> at

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
wooden dowel it's a copper pipe cut at

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.300 
wooden dowel it's a copper pipe cut at
an<00:01:06.070> angle<00:01:06.180> squeezed<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.360> flat<00:01:08.039> cut<00:01:09.039> a<00:01:09.070> hole<00:01:09.280> on

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
an angle squeezed it flat cut a hole on

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.219 
an angle squeezed it flat cut a hole on
the<00:01:09.460> top<00:01:09.580> for<00:01:10.180> rule<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:11.080> wax<00:01:12.960> bullets<00:01:13.960> if<00:01:14.110> you

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
the top for rule of wax bullets if you

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.260 
the top for rule of wax bullets if you
will<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.710> put<00:01:14.890> it<00:01:14.979> in<00:01:15.039> there<00:01:15.399> and<00:01:15.700> just<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:16.060> bulb

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
will to put it in there and just a bulb

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.359 
will to put it in there and just a bulb
holding<00:01:16.750> it<00:01:16.840> on<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.680> don't<00:01:17.860> want<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.070> glue<00:01:18.190> it

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
holding it on you don't want to glue it

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.219 
holding it on you don't want to glue it
on<00:01:18.549> because<00:01:19.000> it<00:01:19.119> is<00:01:19.150> going<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.510> get<00:01:19.600> warm<00:01:20.020> and

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
on because it is going to get warm and

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.260 
on because it is going to get warm and
it<00:01:20.290> break<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.619> glue<00:01:20.830> bond<00:01:21.040> so<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.000> really

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
it break the glue bond so the really

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.800 
it break the glue bond so the really
important<00:01:22.810> thing<00:01:22.960> is<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.790> shape<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.299> and<00:01:25.450> to

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
important thing is to to shape it and to

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.039 
important thing is to to shape it and to
make<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:26.770> fit<00:01:27.010> your<00:01:27.040> style<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.390> copper<00:01:28.960> is

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
make it fit your style the copper is

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.690 
make it fit your style the copper is
kind<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.350> soft<00:01:29.619> when<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:29.950> begin<00:01:30.159> forming<00:01:30.580> it

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
kind of soft when you begin forming it

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.760 
kind of soft when you begin forming it
which<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:31.030> kind<00:01:31.930> of<00:01:32.049> good<00:01:32.259> because<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:32.590> makes

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
which is kind of good because it makes

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.690 
which is kind of good because it makes
it<00:01:32.890> easy<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.250> cut

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
it easy to cut

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.820 
it easy to cut
in<00:01:34.000> fact<00:01:34.180> I<00:01:34.330> cut<00:01:34.540> this<00:01:34.689> top<00:01:34.930> out<00:01:35.170> with<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.500> pair

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
in fact I cut this top out with a pair

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.190 
in fact I cut this top out with a pair
of<00:01:35.860> scissors<00:01:36.520> believe<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.180> or<00:01:37.240> not<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.900> copper

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
of scissors believe it or not the copper

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.620 
of scissors believe it or not the copper
is<00:01:38.259> very<00:01:38.290> soft<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:38.920> very<00:01:38.979> thin<00:01:39.460> but<00:01:40.360> as<00:01:40.479> you

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
is very soft and very thin but as you

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.390 
is very soft and very thin but as you
form<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.140> as<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.409> heat<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:41.710> repeatedly<00:01:42.340> it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
form it as you heat it repeatedly it

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.460 
form it as you heat it repeatedly it
actually<00:01:42.850> work<00:01:43.000> hardens<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.689> it<00:01:44.259> gets

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
actually work hardens and it gets

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.240 
actually work hardens and it gets
towards<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:45.009> not<00:01:45.390> too<00:01:46.390> soft<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.930> use<00:01:47.140> as<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.380> as<00:01:48.159> a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
towards a not too soft to use as a as a

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.899 
towards a not too soft to use as a as a
tool<00:01:48.640> just<00:01:49.570> press<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.079> wax<00:01:50.740> cartridge<00:01:51.250> in<00:01:51.490> and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
tool just press the wax cartridge in and

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.969 
tool just press the wax cartridge in and
what<00:01:52.900> I'm<00:01:52.960> going<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.170> do<00:01:53.259> is<00:01:53.350> heat<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.560> up<00:01:53.770> here

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
what I'm going to do is heat it up here

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.719 
what I'm going to do is heat it up here
for<00:01:54.009> just<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.400> few<00:01:55.710> seconds<00:01:56.710> maybe<00:01:59.189> maybe<00:02:00.189> 30

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
for just a few seconds maybe maybe 30

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.960 
for just a few seconds maybe maybe 30
seconds<00:02:01.299> once<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:01.659> get<00:02:01.869> it<00:02:01.990> warm<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.970> the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
seconds once you get it warm and the

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.690 
seconds once you get it warm and the
copper<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.780> heated<00:02:05.409> evenly<00:02:05.740> it'll<00:02:06.250> stay<00:02:06.460> warm

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
copper is heated evenly it'll stay warm

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.270 
copper is heated evenly it'll stay warm
for<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.119> pretty<00:02:07.299> good<00:02:07.390> while<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.600> it's<00:02:10.600> not

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
for a pretty good while and so it's not

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.620 
for a pretty good while and so it's not
you<00:02:12.280> don't<00:02:12.430> have<00:02:12.549> to<00:02:12.700> heat<00:02:12.850> as<00:02:13.000> frequently<00:02:13.540> as

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
you don't have to heat as frequently as

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.560 
you don't have to heat as frequently as
you<00:02:13.780> might<00:02:13.959> think<00:02:15.120> so

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
you might think so

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.770 
you might think so
we'll<00:02:17.019> see<00:02:17.260> what<00:02:17.440> we<00:02:17.560> got<00:02:17.739> going<00:02:18.570> see<00:02:19.570> if<00:02:19.660> he

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
we'll see what we got going see if he

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.050 
we'll see what we got going see if he
lacks<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.350> trickled<00:02:20.739> into<00:02:20.890> which<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.430> has

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
lacks is trickled into which it has

always<00:05:05.870> think<00:05:06.110> safety<00:05:06.320> first<00:05:07.360> as<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.510> can<00:05:08.630> see

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
always think safety first as you can see

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.500 
always think safety first as you can see
I<00:05:09.260> was<00:05:09.620> going<00:05:09.770> trying<00:05:09.980> to<00:05:10.070> run<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.730> wax

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
I was going trying to run the the wax

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.690 
I was going trying to run the the wax
out<00:05:11.780> for<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.170> so<00:05:12.380> you<00:05:12.440> see<00:05:12.770> how<00:05:12.920> much<00:05:13.130> wax<00:05:13.430> it

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
out for you so you see how much wax it

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.360 
out for you so you see how much wax it
really<00:05:13.970> does<00:05:14.150> hold<00:05:14.450> I<00:05:14.930> don't<00:05:15.890> know<00:05:16.010> if<00:05:16.220> I'm

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
really does hold I don't know if I'm

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.030 
really does hold I don't know if I'm
going<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.640> be<00:05:16.850> able<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.530> shoot<00:05:18.530> a<00:05:18.650> long<00:05:18.830> enough

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
going to be able to shoot a long enough

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.900 
going to be able to shoot a long enough
video<00:05:19.370> to<00:05:19.640> show<00:05:19.820> you<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:20.180> because<00:05:21.730> I'm<00:05:22.730> only

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
video to show you that because I'm only

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.230 
video to show you that because I'm only
about<00:05:23.620> halfway<00:05:24.620> through<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:25.190> wax<00:05:25.400> I<00:05:25.760> loaded

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
about halfway through the wax I loaded

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.270 
about halfway through the wax I loaded
so<00:05:26.450> you<00:05:26.870> can<00:05:27.530> see<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:29.660> would<00:05:30.440> take<00:05:30.650> a<00:05:30.680> long<00:05:30.980> time

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
so you can see it would take a long time

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.810 
so you can see it would take a long time
on<00:05:31.520> monotonous<00:05:32.350> dripping<00:05:33.350> and<00:05:33.820> line-drawing

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
on monotonous dripping and line-drawing

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.020 
on monotonous dripping and line-drawing
and<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.840> don't<00:05:35.900> want<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.320> run<00:05:36.700> running<00:05:37.700> into<00:05:37.910> the

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
and I don't want to run running into the

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.900
