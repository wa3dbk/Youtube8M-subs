00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that we saw on the front so anyway let's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.730 
that we saw on the front so anyway let's
get<00:01:05.880> let's<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> box<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.590> take

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
get let's get it out of the box and take

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.149 
get let's get it out of the box and take
a<00:01:07.770> look<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.780> removing<00:01:10.170> everything<00:01:10.560> out<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
a look so removing everything out of the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.120 
a look so removing everything out of the
box<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:11.850> some<00:01:12.180> hard<00:01:12.830> styrofoam<00:01:13.830> as

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
box we get some hard styrofoam as

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.090 
box we get some hard styrofoam as
protectant<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.630> monitor<00:01:15.990> itself<00:01:16.320> we

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
protectant for the monitor itself we

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.539 
protectant for the monitor itself we
also<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.270> quick<00:01:19.140> set-up<00:01:19.710> guide<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.520> that

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
also get a quick set-up guide here that

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.160 
also get a quick set-up guide here that
kind<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.119> folds<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.680> like<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.950> poster<00:01:24.170> should

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
kind of folds out like a poster should

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.260 
kind of folds out like a poster should
be<00:01:25.290> pretty<00:01:25.500> self-explanatory<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
be pretty self-explanatory really and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.270 
be pretty self-explanatory really and
then<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:28.110> doesn't<00:01:28.470> show<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> front

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
then it doesn't show this on the front

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.700 
then it doesn't show this on the front
of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> box<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.030> definitely<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.140> dual

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
of the box but this definitely is a dual

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.929 
of the box but this definitely is a dual
USB<00:01:32.250> 2.0<00:01:33.290> converter<00:01:34.290> over<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.950> we've<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.280> data

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
USB 2.0 converter over so we've got data

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.520 
USB 2.0 converter over so we've got data
and<00:01:36.240> power<00:01:36.450> coming<00:01:36.960> through<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.439> then

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and power coming through here and then

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.289 
and power coming through here and then
some<00:01:37.829> extra<00:01:38.009> power<00:01:38.460> coming<00:01:38.909> through<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
some extra power coming through this

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.039 
some extra power coming through this
second<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.579> one<00:01:41.600> probably<00:01:42.600> won't<00:01:42.689> be

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
second one so one probably won't be

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.719 
second one so one probably won't be
enough<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> why<00:01:43.649> they<00:01:43.860> added<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.310> second<00:01:44.670> one

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
enough is why they added this second one

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.649 
enough is why they added this second one
for<00:01:44.909> some<00:01:45.119> extra<00:01:45.450> juice<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:46.680> also<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
for some extra juice we also get a

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.080 
for some extra juice we also get a
driver<00:01:48.659> disc<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.909> also

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
driver disc here so or you can also

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.960 
driver disc here so or you can also
double<00:01:51.960> check<00:01:51.990> online<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.460> make<00:01:53.579> sure<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
double check online and make sure you

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.179 
double check online and make sure you
have<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.390> newest<00:01:55.140> driver<00:01:55.470> which<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.890> never<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
have the newest driver which is never a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.850 
have the newest driver which is never a
bad<00:01:56.399> idea<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.939> any<00:01:57.090> kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.680> piece<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
bad idea for any kind of piece of

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.300 
bad idea for any kind of piece of
hardware<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.610> then<00:02:00.170> we<00:02:01.170> get<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.680> monitor

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
hardware and then we get the monitor

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.080 
hardware and then we get the monitor
itself

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.999 

and<00:02:08.710> protective

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.020 
box we've got the AOC logo here you get
the<00:02:26.900> reflection<00:02:27.350> off<00:02:27.760> then<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.360> back<00:02:29.630> I

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
the reflection off then on the back I

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.949 
the reflection off then on the back I
can<00:02:32.030> see<00:02:33.220> we've<00:02:34.220> got<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.790> USB<00:02:35.390> connector

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
can see we've got the USB connector

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:43.660 
can see we've got the USB connector
there<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:37.000> well<00:02:38.000> as<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:40.930> little<00:02:41.930> arm<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:43.370> help

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
there as well as the little arm to help

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.720 
there as well as the little arm to help
support<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:45.620> that's<00:02:45.860> kind<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.310> nice<00:02:46.489> it

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
support it so that's kind of nice it

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.250 
support it so that's kind of nice it
kind<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:46.940> tucks<00:02:47.209> in<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.630> I'm<00:02:47.720> guessing<00:02:48.110> it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
kind of tucks in and I'm guessing it

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
kind of tucks in and I'm guessing it
must

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
must

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.750 
must
oh<00:02:49.340> yeah<00:02:50.239> okay<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.410> rotates<00:02:51.860> for<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.280> portrait

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
oh yeah okay it rotates for a portrait

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.130 
oh yeah okay it rotates for a portrait
or<00:02:53.060> landscape

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.990 

anyway<00:02:57.140> let's<00:02:57.440> I'll<00:02:58.160> get<00:02:58.340> all<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.489> plastic

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
anyway let's I'll get all the plastic

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.180 
anyway let's I'll get all the plastic
off<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.209> let's<00:02:59.780> see<00:03:00.020> let's<00:03:00.320> plug<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:00.980> into<00:03:01.100> my

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
off and let's see let's plug it into my

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.860 
off and let's see let's plug it into my
laptop<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.730> see<00:03:01.970> how<00:03:02.090> well<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.360> works

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
laptop and see how well it works

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.460 
laptop and see how well it works
so<00:03:03.830> before<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:04.190> hook<00:03:04.520> it<00:03:04.640> up<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.150> get<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.720> turned

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
so before I hook it up and get it turned

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.800 
so before I hook it up and get it turned
on<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:07.010> wanted<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.730> show<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.600> a

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
on I wanted to show that this is a

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.060 
on I wanted to show that this is a
extremely<00:03:09.650> glossy<00:03:11.140> monitor<00:03:12.140> as<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.470> can<00:03:12.830> tell

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
extremely glossy monitor as you can tell

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.509 
extremely glossy monitor as you can tell
here<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:14.510> very<00:03:14.780> reflective<00:03:15.080> so<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.280> may

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
here it is very reflective so that may

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.789 
here it is very reflective so that may
or<00:03:16.730> may<00:03:16.910> not<00:03:16.940> change<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.170> way<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.350> feel<00:03:18.769> about

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
or may not change the way you feel about

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.550 
or may not change the way you feel about
it<00:03:19.250> but<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:19.790> just<00:03:19.910> definitely<00:03:20.299> wanted<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.989> to

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
it but I just definitely wanted to to

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.910 
it but I just definitely wanted to to
point<00:03:21.799> that<00:03:21.980> out<00:03:22.040> before<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.970> continued<00:03:23.920> okay

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
point that out before I continued okay

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.300 
point that out before I continued okay
so<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.280> plugged<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.239> in<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:27.080> my<00:03:27.260> laptop<00:03:27.530> here<00:03:28.130> and

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
so I plugged it in to my laptop here and

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.380 
so I plugged it in to my laptop here and
it<00:03:28.970> instantly<00:03:29.540> is<00:03:30.110> started<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.180> download<00:03:32.180> the

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
it instantly is started to download the

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.430 
it instantly is started to download the
correct<00:03:32.840> drivers<00:03:33.650> from<00:03:34.160> Windows<00:03:34.610> Update<00:03:35.440> then

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
correct drivers from Windows Update then

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.009 
correct drivers from Windows Update then
I'm<00:03:36.560> using<00:03:36.799> Windows<00:03:37.160> 7<00:03:37.580> is<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.600> operating

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
I'm using Windows 7 is the operating

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.050 
I'm using Windows 7 is the operating
system<00:03:39.110> here<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.220> automatically<00:03:40.700> started

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
system here so it automatically started

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.490 
system here so it automatically started
downloading<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:41.780> also<00:03:41.900> wanted<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.260> point

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500

downloading and I also wanted to point
out<00:03:42.709> too<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:43.190> did<00:03:43.850> not<00:03:44.090> need<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.959> use<00:03:45.260> both<00:03:45.650> USB

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
out too I did not need to use both USB

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.509 
out too I did not need to use both USB
cables<00:03:47.150> as<00:03:47.299> well<00:03:47.510> -<00:03:47.810> some<00:03:48.470> older<00:03:48.830> systems<00:03:49.310> that

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
cables as well - some older systems that

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.850 
cables as well - some older systems that
didn't<00:03:49.820> have<00:03:50.030> much<00:03:50.420> power<00:03:51.049> coming<00:03:51.470> out<00:03:51.650> of<00:03:51.769> the

am<00:04:04.700> recording<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:06.049> video<00:04:07.000> playing<00:04:08.000> on<00:04:08.329> the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
am recording a video playing on the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.930 
am recording a video playing on the
monitor<00:04:09.019> and<00:04:09.049> this<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.590> video<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.190> did<00:04:10.310> a

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
monitor and this is a video that I did a

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.720 
monitor and this is a video that I did a
while<00:04:11.450> back<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.110> CPU<00:04:12.860> cooler

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
while back on a CPU cooler

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.870 
while back on a CPU cooler
and<00:04:13.930> on<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.200> stiller<00:04:15.560> parts<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.310> video<00:04:16.459> I

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
and on the stiller parts of the video I

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.270 
and on the stiller parts of the video I
can<00:04:17.329> see<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.720> colors<00:04:18.109> are<00:04:18.139> real<00:04:18.530> nice<00:04:18.799> the

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
can see the colors are real nice the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.550 
can see the colors are real nice the
brightness<00:04:19.790> is<00:04:19.970> excellent<00:04:20.600> on<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.959> but<00:04:21.200> man

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
brightness is excellent on it but man

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.790 
brightness is excellent on it but man
motion<00:04:22.190> is<00:04:22.370> just<00:04:22.400> not<00:04:23.270> doing<00:04:23.870> well<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:24.380> think

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
motion is just not doing well I think

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.700 
motion is just not doing well I think
the<00:04:25.460> refresh<00:04:25.820> rate<00:04:25.970> must<00:04:26.419> not<00:04:26.660> be<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.350> great

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
the refresh rate must not be that great

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.090 
the refresh rate must not be that great
my<00:04:28.700> definitely<00:04:29.240> my<00:04:29.450> laptop<00:04:30.380> monitor<00:04:30.800> which<00:04:30.979> is

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
it so much easier to do work so I

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.879 
it so much easier to do work so I
definitely<00:05:01.910> would<00:05:02.330> recommend<00:05:02.389> it<00:05:03.050> in<00:05:03.260> that

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
definitely would recommend it in that

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.010 
definitely would recommend it in that
respect<00:05:04.460> but<00:05:04.729> just<00:05:05.300> don't<00:05:05.540> pick<00:05:05.780> it<00:05:05.900> up

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
respect but just don't pick it up

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.690

like<00:05:10.729> that<00:05:11.120> unless<00:05:11.630> you're<00:05:12.290> ok<00:05:12.620> with<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:13.010> not

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
like that unless you're ok with it not

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.450 
like that unless you're ok with it not
quite<00:05:13.790> you<00:05:14.750> know<00:05:14.780> looking<00:05:15.290> very<00:05:15.710> well<00:05:16.160> and

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
quite you know looking very well and

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.300 
quite you know looking very well and
clipping<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.360> being<00:05:18.020> blurry<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:18.830> ghosting

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310

and<00:05:19.460> stuff<00:05:19.700> like<00:05:19.910> that<00:05:20.210> so<00:05:20.479> anyway<00:05:21.139> that's<00:05:21.530> my

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
and stuff like that so anyway that's my

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.510 
and stuff like that so anyway that's my
thoughts<00:05:22.580> here<00:05:23.300> on<00:05:23.479> video<00:05:24.020> playback<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:25.250> even

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
thoughts here on video playback and even

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.600 
thoughts here on video playback and even
making<00:05:26.240> it<00:05:26.360> you<00:05:26.930> know<00:05:27.050> smaller<00:05:27.440> it<00:05:28.130> obviously

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
making it you know smaller it obviously

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.029 
making it you know smaller it obviously
doesn't<00:05:28.970> really<00:05:29.330> help<00:05:29.600> that<00:05:30.169> much<00:05:30.350> it<00:05:30.740> helps

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
doesn't really help that much it helps

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.860 
doesn't really help that much it helps
maybe<00:05:31.310> a<00:05:31.460> little<00:05:31.729> bit<00:05:31.970> just<00:05:32.210> because<00:05:32.270> it's<00:05:32.720> a

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
maybe a little bit just because it's a

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.320 
maybe a little bit just because it's a
it's<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.229> smaller<00:05:33.590> field<00:05:34.280> of<00:05:34.460> view<00:05:34.669> there<00:05:35.000> but

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
it's a smaller field of view there but

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.469 
it's a smaller field of view there but
still<00:05:35.810> don't<00:05:36.710> recommend<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:37.310> for<00:05:37.520> video<00:05:37.639> so

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
still don't recommend it for video so

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.430 
still don't recommend it for video so
anyway<00:05:38.870> let's<00:05:39.380> get<00:05:39.979> on<00:05:40.039> with<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:40.550> ending<00:05:41.440> so

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
anyway let's get on with the ending so

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.980 
anyway let's get on with the ending so
here<00:05:42.620> I<00:05:42.650> am<00:05:42.770> going<00:05:43.460> into<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.090> wrap-up<00:05:44.419> of<00:05:44.840> the

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
here I am going into the wrap-up of the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.659 
here I am going into the wrap-up of the
review<00:05:45.350> and<00:05:45.380> I<00:05:45.590> realized<00:05:46.130> that<00:05:46.340> I<00:05:46.490> don't

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
review and I realized that I don't

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.020 
review and I realized that I don't
believe<00:05:47.419> that<00:05:47.450> I<00:05:47.780> mentioned<00:05:48.560> any

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
believe that I mentioned any

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.400 
believe that I mentioned any
specifications<00:05:50.030> here<00:05:50.240> so<00:05:50.600> we'll<00:05:51.229> go<00:05:51.380> ahead

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
specifications here so we'll go ahead

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.409 
specifications here so we'll go ahead
and<00:05:51.620> get<00:05:51.919> those<00:05:52.130> out<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.550> way<00:05:52.580> even<00:05:53.270> though

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
and get those out of the way even though

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.570 
and get those out of the way even though
it<00:05:53.690> is<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:54.020> end<00:05:54.169> of<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.350> video<00:05:54.590> but<00:05:55.190> we've<00:05:55.370> got

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
it is the end of the video but we've got

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.260 
it is the end of the video but we've got
a<00:05:55.610> 16<00:05:56.240> inch<00:05:56.450> screen<00:05:56.810> size<00:05:57.080> here<00:05:57.500> which<00:05:58.270> 15.6

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
a 16 inch screen size here which 15.6

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.180 
a 16 inch screen size here which 15.6
inches<00:05:59.599> is<00:05:59.780> viewable<00:06:00.229> it<00:06:00.530> is<00:06:00.860> the<00:06:01.039> LED

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
inches is viewable it is the LED

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.529 
inches is viewable it is the LED
backlight<00:06:01.820> light<00:06:02.060> we<00:06:02.180> talked<00:06:02.389> about

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
backlight light we talked about

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.320 
backlight light we talked about
obviously<00:06:02.870> widescreen<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.580> resolution

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
obviously widescreen the resolution

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.890 
obviously widescreen the resolution
there<00:06:05.539> is<00:06:06.280> 1366<00:06:07.280> by<00:06:07.400> 768<00:06:08.650> we've<00:06:09.650> got<00:06:09.889> a<00:06:09.919> 16

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
there is 1366 by 768 we've got a 16

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.800 
there is 1366 by 768 we've got a 16
millisecond<00:06:11.900> response<00:06:12.200> time<00:06:12.770> as<00:06:13.310> well<00:06:14.240> there

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
millisecond response time as well there

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.290 
millisecond response time as well there
to<00:06:15.460> say<00:06:16.460> it<00:06:16.639> claims<00:06:17.000> it<00:06:17.270> can<00:06:17.300> do<00:06:18.550> 262<00:06:19.550> thousand

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
to say it claims it can do 262 thousand

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.649 
to say it claims it can do 262 thousand
colors<00:06:20.780> so<00:06:21.740> that's<00:06:22.070> definitely<00:06:22.520> not<00:06:23.060> on<00:06:23.390> the

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:23.659 
colors so that's definitely not on the

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:25.149 
colors so that's definitely not on the
top<00:06:23.930> end<00:06:24.169> of<00:06:24.289> that<00:06:24.500> either

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
top end of that either

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.550 
top end of that either
but<00:06:26.030> anyway

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
but anyway

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.920 
but anyway
I<00:06:27.590> said<00:06:27.950> it's<00:06:28.160> pretty<00:06:28.490> cool<00:06:28.760> for<00:06:29.300> a<00:06:29.330> cheap

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
I said it's pretty cool for a cheap

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.900 
I said it's pretty cool for a cheap
little<00:06:30.230> secondary<00:06:30.950> monitor<00:06:31.250> for

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
little secondary monitor for

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.180 
little secondary monitor for
productivity<00:06:32.540> wise<00:06:32.960> and<00:06:33.350> I<00:06:33.770> would<00:06:34.010> definitely

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
productivity wise and I would definitely

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.780 
productivity wise and I would definitely
highly<00:06:34.700> recommend<00:06:34.910> it<00:06:35.570> for<00:06:35.600> that<00:06:35.900> I<00:06:36.580> used<00:06:37.580> it

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
highly recommend it for that I used it

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.379 
highly recommend it for that I used it
for<00:06:38.030> about<00:06:38.150> a<00:06:38.300> week<00:06:38.810> on<00:06:39.110> and<00:06:39.590> off<00:06:39.710> during<00:06:40.160> the

for about a week on and off during the

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.640 
for about a week on and off during the
shooting<00:06:41.389> of<00:06:41.510> the<00:06:41.720> different<00:06:42.110> parts<00:06:42.410> of<00:06:42.530> this

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
shooting of the different parts of this

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.930 
shooting of the different parts of this
video

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
video

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.900 
video
I<00:06:44.000> even<00:06:44.480> traveled<00:06:45.169> with<00:06:45.350> it<00:06:45.380> via<00:06:45.950> airplane<00:06:46.550> and

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
I even traveled with it via airplane and

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.280 
I even traveled with it via airplane and

it as you can see it still works even

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.020 
it as you can see it still works even
though<00:06:51.440> you<00:06:51.650> know<00:06:51.889> luggage<00:06:52.400> gets<00:06:52.639> bumped

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.260 
though you know luggage gets bumped
around<00:06:53.300> quite<00:06:53.570> a<00:06:53.600> bit<00:06:53.720> what<00:06:54.470> I<00:06:54.500> use<00:06:54.830> -<00:06:55.270> actually

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
around quite a bit what I use - actually

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.850 
around quite a bit what I use - actually
it<00:06:56.720> doesn't<00:06:56.960> come<00:06:57.230> with<00:06:57.380> any<00:06:57.410> kind<00:06:57.770> of

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
it doesn't come with any kind of

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.810 
it doesn't come with any kind of
protector<00:06:58.400> for<00:06:58.669> it<00:06:58.790> so<00:06:59.030> I<00:06:59.240> just<00:06:59.419> bought<00:06:59.840> a<00:07:00.820> 15.6

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
protector for it so I just bought a 15.6

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.500 
protector for it so I just bought a 15.6
inch<00:07:02.120> laptop<00:07:03.310> carrying<00:07:04.310> case<00:07:04.550> or<00:07:04.850> sleeve<00:07:05.270> I

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:05.510 
inch laptop carrying case or sleeve I

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.240 
inch laptop carrying case or sleeve I
guess<00:07:05.720> rather<00:07:05.990> put<00:07:06.560> it<00:07:06.680> in<00:07:06.770> that<00:07:06.950> laptop

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
guess rather put it in that laptop

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.120 
guess rather put it in that laptop
sleeve<00:07:07.850> and<00:07:08.180> it<00:07:08.300> protected<00:07:08.840> it<00:07:08.960> just<00:07:09.320> fine<00:07:09.650> so

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.130 
sleeve and it protected it just fine so

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.280 
sleeve and it protected it just fine so
