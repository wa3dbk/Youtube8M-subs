00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
a Commonwealth diving is still a fairly

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.000 
a Commonwealth diving is still a fairly
high<00:00:59.720> standards<00:01:00.320> you<00:01:00.410> know<00:01:00.440> Canada<00:01:00.770> and

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
high standards you know Canada and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.299 
high standards you know Canada and
Australia<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.700> England<00:01:01.790> just<00:01:02.030> play<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:02.810> off
