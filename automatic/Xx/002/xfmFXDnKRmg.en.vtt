hey developing a good gun mount is

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.960 
hey developing a good gun mount is
crucial<00:00:23.259> if<00:00:23.380> you<00:00:23.439> want<00:00:23.740> to<00:00:23.980> be<00:00:24.099> a<00:00:24.130> consistently

good<00:00:25.090> performer<00:00:30.809> imagine<00:00:31.809> again<00:00:32.079> that<00:00:32.529> I'm

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
good performer imagine again that I'm

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.979 
good performer imagine again that I'm
going<00:00:32.920> to<00:00:33.040> shoot<00:00:33.219> a<00:00:33.370> target<00:00:33.640> to<00:00:34.149> 12<00:00:34.420> o'clock

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.299 

let's<00:00:37.989> pretend<00:00:38.410> that<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.680> target<00:00:39.129> is<00:00:39.250> a

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
let's pretend that the target is a

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.729 
let's pretend that the target is a
little<00:00:39.640> bit<00:00:39.760> above<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.059> horizon<00:00:40.360> and<00:00:40.930> I<00:00:41.500> want

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
little bit above the horizon and I want

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.010 
little bit above the horizon and I want
you<00:00:41.829> to<00:00:41.950> imagine<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:42.700> line<00:00:42.940> going<00:00:43.450> from<00:00:43.570> my<00:00:43.989> eye

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
you to imagine a line going from my eye

you to imagine a line going from my eye
to<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.070> target<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:47.260> bead<00:00:47.500> of<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.800> gun

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
be mounted in the so called shoulder

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.420 
be mounted in the so called shoulder
pocket<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:58.330> is<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:59.410> area<00:02:59.769> between<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.270 
collarbone and the shoulder joint well
ideally<00:03:04.329> yes<00:03:04.780> but<00:03:05.440> I've<00:03:05.560> noticed<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.100> lot<00:03:06.130> of

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
ideally yes but I've noticed a lot of

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.699 
ideally yes but I've noticed a lot of
good<00:03:06.549> shots<00:03:06.850> do<00:03:07.510> mount<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.930> gun<00:03:08.079> a<00:03:08.140> little<00:03:08.260> bit

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
good shots do mount the gun a little bit

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.100 
good shots do mount the gun a little bit
further<00:03:09.070> out<00:03:09.269> almost<00:03:10.269> on<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.510> shoulder

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
further out almost on the shoulder

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.190 
further out almost on the shoulder
what's<00:03:12.070> definitely<00:03:12.730> wrong<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.840> allow<00:03:14.140> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
what's definitely wrong is to allow the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.220 
what's definitely wrong is to allow the
gun<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:15.040> mount<00:03:15.280> on<00:03:15.489> your<00:03:15.549> arm<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.780> will<00:03:16.989> cause

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
gun to mount on your arm that will cause

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.380 
gun to mount on your arm that will cause
you<00:03:17.440> all<00:03:17.709> sorts<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.220> problems<00:03:18.459> with<00:03:18.880> bruising

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
you all sorts of problems with bruising

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.150 
you all sorts of problems with bruising
and<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.930> won't<00:03:20.140> be<00:03:20.290> able<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.590> develop<00:03:21.040> a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
and you won't be able to develop a

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.850 
and you won't be able to develop a
consistent<00:03:21.549> gun<00:03:22.030> mount<00:03:22.299> if<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.930> adopt<00:03:23.290> that

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
consistent gun mount if you adopt that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.660 
consistent gun mount if you adopt that
technique<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:28.480> see<00:03:28.690> people<00:03:29.079> sometimes<00:03:29.670> with

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
technique you see people sometimes with

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.210 
technique you see people sometimes with
the<00:03:30.790> gun<00:03:30.940> resting<00:03:31.450> their<00:03:32.400> disastrous<00:03:34.500> one<00:03:35.500> two
