00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.010
 bring to your attention a car 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.709
 global system signal suppressor 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.540
 gps positioning device data 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.460
 designed to protect your 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.800
 vehicle from lowering with 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.380
 using various instruments defining 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.180
 GPS satellite coordinates on frequency 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.119
 gps l1 range from 1500 to 1600 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.950
 megahertz 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.390
 the device is very easy to operate for 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.700
 you will not need to use it 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.440
 special knowledge and skills 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.149
 plugging the jammer into the cigarette lighter 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.699
 car device generates 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.160
 radio interference in a given frequency range 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.679
 and thereby suppresses device communication 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.120
 satellite tracking gps making 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.160
 impossible to determine your 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.530
 location and tracking 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.210
 gps vehicle travel 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.219
 navigators gps bugs radius suppression 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.379
 reaches 10-15 meters 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.899
 it is quite enough for blocking 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.690
 gps trackers installed passenger and 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.970
 even a truck is also worth 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.770
 note that suppressor food can 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.680
 be carried on as from a 12 volt 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.510
 onboard network of a car such 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.860
 onboard network of trucks with 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.970
 24 volts during operation 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.670
 gps jammer 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.040
 cannot use gps navigators 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.530
 however, the operation of other electronic 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.510
 devices and means of communication such as 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.830
 as a mobile phone or computer 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.170
 The device does not affect in many 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.120
 modern gps bug definitions 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.070
 location is not only 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.770
 using gps system 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.050
 but also over cellular channels therefore 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.150
 to suppress such gps trackers 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.750
 gps suppressor should be used 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.030
 together with gsm suppressor 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.150
 sale purchase and use 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.310
 gps gsm suppressor to ensure 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.650
 personal safety and within your 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.150
 private property does not contradict 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.220
 current legislation 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.810
 however, it is worth remembering that you do not have 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.440
 rights through various means 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.330
 suppress hamper access 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.260
 communication and navigation services to third parties 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.600
 in common areas in the kit 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.120
 supplies include a suppressor with removable 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.360
 antenna instruction and spare 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.360
