00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.250
 video easy secret slimming number 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.780
 six how to strain less and burn 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.580
 fat 2 times more 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.140
 what to do in case of failures today I want you 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.460
 tell as with a little 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.590
 load intensity 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.869
 that is, to avoid shortness of breath 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.740
 dizziness side pain and other 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.779
 troubles 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.420
 who are so obstructed by the beginning of the journey 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.399
 man who decided to lose weight throw off 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.579
 overweight at least twice a 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.380
 perhaps much faster than without 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.989
 physical exertion or when 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.640
 short but very intense 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.789
 big type of fast running 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.890
 power loads that you may not 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.739
 can while carry out because of the big 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.289
 its own weight and other intense 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.210
 sports 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.579
 also you will learn how with him the minimum 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.010
 training intensity burn exactly 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.500
 fat which exercise is better 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.840
 just burns fat and once that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.540
 do if you suddenly broke down and ate 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.290
 something that shouldn't have been done yet sometimes 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.290
 a decent amount 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.840
 very good helper in the fight against odd 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.509
 by weight 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.970
 this aerobic load run jump rope 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.580
 fast walking rowing swimming and so 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.090
 further aerobic exercise with low 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.890
 intensity for example brisk walking 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.590
 uses energy as fuel 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.990
 the cheapest source is our accumulated 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.369
 fat with more intense workouts 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.040
 for example when running 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.610
 our body can already use energy 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.710
 carbohydrates that we are not very profitable we 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.500
 occupy this intimacy ie go 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.320
 fast they run in this case of energy 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.439
 less spent but the same 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.740
 energy we need and therefore we increase 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.189
 load duration to burn 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.100
 its more and for people with large 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.630
 weight running can be general 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.439
 contraindicated as it goes very 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.750
 heavy load on the knee joints 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.899
 aerobic exercise pulse must be in 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.510
 120 and 160 beats per minute 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.959
 quick step or with all 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.769
 not back but a long time 40-80 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.989
 minutes you need to increase the intensity 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.840
 gradually, for example, we first go 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.069
 quick step 20 minutes a day and a week 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.650
 30 minutes a day 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.760
 a week later we increase to 40 and 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.040
 so by analogy, then I like earlier 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.920
 I got up at 5-6 am and walked down the street 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.349
 side of the center and every day was held on 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.120
 stop further and eventually became 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.060
 go decently by distance 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.220
 kilometers for 10 and back already drove on 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.010
 transport is desirable to engage 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.109
 physical activity every day take 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.620
 in the habit then the result will see 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:58.230
 much earlier many try to find 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.590
 excuse for yourself just nothing 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.420
 do and live like they used to but if 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.790
 you decide to change something in your 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.400
 As a result , it is worth changing. 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.099
 something and their actions do not have to 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.379
 say that you have no opportunity for 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.720
 you can always walk outdoors even if 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.260
 rain you can buy a rain coat and rubber 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.379
 boots and so on I remember walking in the rain 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.370
 you can walk to work or with 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:30.720
 work for example a ride on transport and 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.910
 I think there are other opportunities too 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.989
 if you have the opportunity to attend 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.739
 gym 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.150
 there are no problems at all 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.129
 modern simulators have everything 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.620
 necessary indicators of type how many 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.500
 have gone the distance how much they spent 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.299
 calories and how much pulse you can 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.609
 twist is great to engage on 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.650
 elliptical trainers and walk on 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.530
 about an hour treadmill 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.849
 then there will be strength and you can still 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:03.150
 longer and there to power simulators 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.760
 not far for something not ideal for any 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.010
 parts of your body by the way power 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.290
 simulators are also a very good option but 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:17.010
 this is another long topic as well 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.400
 helps rope approximately 15-20 minutes in 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.090
 day 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.520
 but this is for those whose weight does not exceed 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.690
 80 kilograms because when jumping is 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.260
 asus load 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:33.150
 then you have enough to swing the press for hours 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.120
 since you heard on tv that 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.820
 it works locally on the belly you are fat 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.100
 can not burn as fat 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.350
 goes all over the body evenly and 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.590
 calorie energy when swinging the press 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.020
 spend very little the biggest 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.310
 calorie-burning energy consumer 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.770
 fat is legs so the activity of legs is 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.840
 and there is the shortest path to success 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.820
 that is, to slimming the whole body is still very 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.910
 interesting topic and many questions 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.880
 come about breakdowns or what to do 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.130
 if suddenly broke by the way very good 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.620
 method when you suddenly relaxed 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.080
 or broke off that is allowed suddenly 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.140
 yourself what's on your food plan 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.780
 you should not have been no need to sit and 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.240
 see yourself on your deed so you only 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.930
 spoil your nerves but nothing 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.560
 change 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.900
 and lose weight this will not start on dac 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.600
 be responsible for your actions and 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.510
 You can for example go for an hour walk 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.480
 quick step into some of the most 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.810
 it is interesting for you to side only immediately 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.260
 or on the same day in the evening 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.669
 for example if a breakdown occurred at work 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.950
 it helps a lot 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.530
 the organism itself will want less then 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.570
 eat something delicious sweet 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.840
 or fat because will know 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.669
 what awaits him payback for their actions as well 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.650
 as our body does not want much 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.020
 strain that is over time you 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.830
 absolutely calmly will look at any
