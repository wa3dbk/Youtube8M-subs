00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
do is we're going to open up horizon I

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.770 
do is we're going to open up horizon I
mean<00:01:49.710> sorry<00:01:49.950> Mario<00:01:50.299> we're<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> open<00:01:51.630> up

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
mean sorry Mario we're going to open up

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.580 
mean sorry Mario we're going to open up
Mario<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:54.689> splash<00:01:54.930> screen<00:01:54.990> will<00:01:55.409> pop<00:01:55.560> up

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
Mario and the splash screen will pop up

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.160 
Mario and the splash screen will pop up
and<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.119> don't<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.450> these<00:01:57.600> two<00:01:57.750> programs

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
and if you don't have these two programs

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.740 
and if you don't have these two programs
already<00:01:58.350> I'll<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> link<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.299> underbar

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
already I'll have a link in the underbar

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.959 
already I'll have a link in the underbar
probably<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> direct<00:02:01.530> download<00:02:01.729> so<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.820> can

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
probably a direct download so you can

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.959 
probably a direct download so you can
just<00:02:03.119> download<00:02:03.659> those<00:02:04.079> without<00:02:04.439> even

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
just download those without even

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.649 
just download those without even
worrying<00:02:05.969> about<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
worrying about it

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.859 
worrying about it
so<00:02:07.899> once<00:02:08.200> Monty<00:02:08.619> was<00:02:08.830> opened<00:02:09.369> up<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:10.539> go<00:02:10.810> to

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
so once Monty was opened up you go to

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.410 
so once Monty was opened up you go to
this<00:02:11.170> big<00:02:11.530> M<00:02:11.709> up<00:02:11.890> here<00:02:12.160> you're<00:02:13.090> going<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.239> click
