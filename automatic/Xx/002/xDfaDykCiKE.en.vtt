just see there's a glue line in the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.810 
just see there's a glue line in the
middle<00:00:27.539> there<00:00:27.810> still<00:00:28.279> but<00:00:29.279> that'll<00:00:29.550> all<00:00:29.609> get

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
middle there still but that'll all get

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.880 
middle there still but that'll all get
sanded<00:00:30.179> out<00:00:30.240> right<00:00:31.019> now<00:00:31.199> that's<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
sanded out right now that's about a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.150 
sanded out right now that's about a
thickness<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.520> about<00:00:33.020> 170<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.230> want<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> get

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
thickness of about 170 I want to get

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.760 
thickness of about 170 I want to get
that<00:00:35.309> right<00:00:35.489> now<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.880> about<00:00:36.030> 110<00:00:36.600> 120<00:00:37.260> I'll

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that right now in to about 110 120 I'll

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.150 
that right now in to about 110 120 I'll
stop<00:00:38.520> when<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.790> feels<00:00:38.969> right<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:41.040> gonna

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
stop when it feels right so it's gonna

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.250 
stop when it feels right so it's gonna
be<00:00:41.340> noisy<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.360> put<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.840> won't<00:00:43.050> talk<00:00:43.230> much

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
be noisy so you put I won't talk much

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.760 
be noisy so you put I won't talk much
during<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:45.050> sanding<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.320> I'll<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.620> show

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
during the sanding and I'll just show

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.090 
during the sanding and I'll just show
you<00:00:46.829> how<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.710> piece<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
you how I do because the the piece of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490 
you how I do because the the piece of
wood<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.579> wider<00:00:50.850> than<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> sander<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.320> have

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
wood is wider than the sander so I have

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:02.720 
wood is wider than the sander so I have
to<00:00:52.680> flip<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.660> go<00:01:01.430> first<00:01:02.430> put<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
to flip it so here we go first put the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
to flip it so here we go first put the
dust<00:01:02.879> collector<00:01:03.180> on

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:17.840 

then<00:01:09.750> I'll<00:01:09.900> wind<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.409> down<00:01:10.580> too

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.140 

that's<00:01:18.850> right<00:01:19.030> about<00:01:19.270> there

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:02:08.419 

I'm<00:01:23.810> pretty<00:01:24.170> fast

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.599 

putting<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> through<00:02:09.390> twice<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:10.049> that<00:02:10.609> gets

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:11.609 
putting it through twice like that gets

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.520 
putting it through twice like that gets
rid<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.849> any<00:02:12.090> ridges<00:02:12.599> it's<00:02:12.959> still<00:02:13.140> nice<00:02:13.319> and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
rid of any ridges it's still nice and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.949 
rid of any ridges it's still nice and
flat<00:02:13.709> all<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.950> way<00:02:14.010> across<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:15.450> reason<00:02:15.870> that

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
flat all the way across the reason that

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.660 
flat all the way across the reason that
is<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.170> because<00:02:16.469> I<00:02:16.650> spent<00:02:17.129> a<00:02:17.189> lot<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.370> time

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
is is because I spent a lot of time

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.470 
is is because I spent a lot of time
throwing<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:18.719> the<00:02:18.900> drum<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.530> sander<00:02:20.480> that

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
throwing up the drum on this sander that

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.789 
throwing up the drum on this sander that
took<00:02:21.659> a<00:02:21.689> long<00:02:21.900> while<00:02:22.109> to<00:02:22.140> get<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.439> right<00:02:22.620> but

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
took a long while to get it right but

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.030 
took a long while to get it right but
now<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.129> great<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.500> I'm<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.829> go<00:02:25.950> ahead

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
now it's great so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.080 
now it's great so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:26.250> wind<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.639> down<00:02:26.819> at<00:02:27.920> 1/8<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.159> a<00:02:29.250> turn<00:02:29.459> at<00:02:30.030> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and wind that down at 1/8 of a turn at a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.210 
and wind that down at 1/8 of a turn at a
time<00:02:30.180> which<00:02:31.079> is<00:02:31.230> equal<00:02:31.650> to

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.220 

one<00:02:35.760> hundred<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.300> twenty<00:02:36.510> eighth<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:37.020> an<00:02:37.110> inch

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
one hundred and twenty eighth of an inch

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.640 
one hundred and twenty eighth of an inch
each<00:02:37.650> each<00:02:38.490> step<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.540> really<00:02:40.320> don't<00:02:40.470> want<00:02:40.590> to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
each each step I really don't want to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:59.360 
each each step I really don't want to
burn<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.010> word<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.490> want<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.700> go<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.850> first

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.540 

oh<00:03:00.019> there<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.050> have<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:04.129> stopped<00:03:05.129> sandy

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
oh there you have it I stopped sandy

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:14.710 
oh there you have it I stopped sandy
right<00:03:05.910> around<00:03:09.709> 100,000<00:03:13.099> actually<00:03:14.099> that's<00:03:14.220> 96

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
right around 100,000 actually that's 96

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.869 
right around 100,000 actually that's 96
97<00:03:16.129> so<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:18.360> feels<00:03:18.629> about<00:03:18.870> right<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.349> me<00:03:19.379> there

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
97 so it feels about right to me there

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:31.580 
97 so it feels about right to me there
it's<00:03:20.879> uh<00:03:22.069> it<00:03:23.069> has<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> nice<00:03:28.400> nice<00:03:29.400> ring<00:03:30.349> and<00:03:31.349> it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
it's uh it has a nice nice ring and it

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.930 
it's uh it has a nice nice ring and it
feels<00:03:32.150> about<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.540> right<00:03:33.750> stiffness<00:03:34.819> just<00:03:35.819> a

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
feels about the right stiffness just a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.380 
feels about the right stiffness just a
little<00:03:36.239> flex<00:03:37.160> no<00:03:38.160> one<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.700> now<00:03:39.090> I'm<00:03:39.180> going<00:03:39.329> to

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
little flex no one that now I'm going to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.270 
little flex no one that now I'm going to
sand<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.930> through<00:03:40.349> through<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.890> grits<00:03:41.069> up

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
sand that through through the grits up

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.970 
sand that through through the grits up
to<00:03:41.430> 220<00:03:41.940> here<00:03:42.060> right<00:03:42.209> now<00:03:42.329> on<00:03:43.049> both<00:03:43.230> sides<00:03:43.590> and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
to 220 here right now on both sides and

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.069 
to 220 here right now on both sides and
then<00:03:44.700> it'll<00:03:45.150> be<00:03:45.329> ready<00:03:45.480> for<00:03:46.340> cutting<00:03:47.340> out<00:03:47.549> and

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
then it'll be ready for cutting out and

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.920 
then it'll be ready for cutting out and
bracing<00:03:49.079> we've<00:03:49.709> got<00:03:49.920> my<00:03:50.180> six-inch<00:03:51.180> random

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
bracing we've got my six-inch random

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.830 
bracing we've got my six-inch random
orbital<00:03:52.290> sander<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.890> use<00:03:53.640> this<00:03:55.400> abra<00:03:56.840> a

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
orbital sander I use this abra a
