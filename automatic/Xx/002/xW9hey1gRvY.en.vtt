00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
faster I think it's all rifles only two

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.420 
faster I think it's all rifles only two
three<00:01:10.380> four<00:01:10.710> shots<00:01:11.040> maybe<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.840> takes

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
three four shots maybe and this takes

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.070 
three four shots maybe and this takes
five<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.610> six<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.360> four<00:01:15.750> shots

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
five or six and it was like four shots

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.190 
five or six and it was like four shots
to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.350> head<00:01:16.670> or<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:17.820> least<00:01:17.970> maybe<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.049> just

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
to the head or at least maybe I just

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.950 
to the head or at least maybe I just
wasn't<00:01:19.320> hitting<00:01:19.619> home<00:01:19.890> all<00:01:20.189> 4<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.640> his<00:01:20.759> head

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
wasn't hitting home all 4 on his head

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
wasn't hitting home all 4 on his head
but<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.020> could<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.259> sworn<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.920> took<00:01:23.100> three

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
but I could have sworn it it took three

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.630 
but I could have sworn it it took three
or<00:01:23.970> four<00:01:24.270> shots<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.110> them<00:01:25.610> which<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
or four shots to them which is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.219 
or four shots to them which is
definitely<00:01:27.270> ridiculous<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.900> kind<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
definitely ridiculous for kind of

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
weird my my screen I they look kind of

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.149 
weird my my screen I they look kind of
weird<00:02:04.039> as<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.429> is<00:02:04.520> now<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:06.740> doesn't<00:02:07.039> look<00:02:07.100> that

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
weird as it is now it doesn't look that

bad<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:07.550> I'm<00:02:07.610> running<00:02:07.819> but<00:02:08.149> I'm<00:02:08.269> just<00:02:08.360> walking

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
bad and I'm running but I'm just walking

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.910 
bad and I'm running but I'm just walking
around<00:02:08.720> i<00:02:08.959> think<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.229> scope<00:02:09.470> was<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.679> little

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
around i think the scope was a little

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.500 
around i think the scope was a little
too<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:11.060> puts<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.510> portal<00:02:12.049> tall<00:02:13.209> on<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.360> gun

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
too so puts this portal tall on the gun

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.670 
too so puts this portal tall on the gun
doesn't<00:02:14.959> seem<00:02:15.319> like<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.650> fits<00:02:17.410> as<00:02:18.410> they<00:02:18.560> get

Mike<00:03:11.390> my<00:03:11.690> guess<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:12.110> going<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.410> be<00:03:12.500> something

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
Mike my guess is going to be something

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.430 
Mike my guess is going to be something
like<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:12.860> Search<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.250> Destroy<00:03:14.140> type<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.290> game

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
like a Search and Destroy type of game

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.290 
like a Search and Destroy type of game
rolled<00:03:15.830> up<00:03:15.920> for<00:03:15.980> sure<00:03:16.100> where<00:03:16.850> there's<00:03:17.030> like<00:03:17.180> no

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
rolled up for sure where there's like no

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.910

respawns<00:03:17.750> or<00:03:17.930> anything<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:18.380> don't<00:03:18.620> know<00:03:18.740> I

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
respawns or anything I don't know I

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.490 
respawns or anything I don't know I
guess<00:03:19.040> it's<00:03:19.280> really<00:03:19.850> really<00:03:20.240> think<00:03:20.480> taking<00:03:21.410> a

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
guess it's really really think taking a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.840 
guess it's really really think taking a
wild<00:03:21.680> guess<00:03:21.770> this<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.400> because<00:03:22.580> it's<00:03:22.700> only

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
wild guess this is because it's only

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.370 
wild guess this is because it's only
really<00:03:22.970> game<00:03:23.750> mode<00:03:23.930> they<00:03:24.050> don't<00:03:24.200> have

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
really game mode they don't have

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.040 
really game mode they don't have

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
pretty ridiculous even though they do

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.150 
pretty ridiculous even though they do

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
geometry around well not so much new

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.650 
geometry around well not so much new

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
playing but it's still ridiculous though

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.550 
playing but it's still ridiculous though
it's<00:04:41.320> like<00:04:41.410> why<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:43.090> telling<00:04:43.450> me<00:04:43.570> all<00:04:44.440> the

I don't get that and the problem of that

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.150

this<00:05:23.980> pumpkin<00:05:24.400> upon<00:05:24.580> this<00:05:24.640> ridiculous<00:05:25.410> know

this pumpkin upon this ridiculous know

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
this pumpkin upon this ridiculous know
which<00:05:27.430> is<00:05:27.550> actually<00:05:27.669> most<00:05:27.970> of<00:05:28.120> them<00:05:28.240> so<00:05:28.360> I

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
which is actually most of them so I

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.180 
which is actually most of them so I
guess<00:05:28.570> it's<00:05:28.750> not<00:05:28.870> a<00:05:28.930> really<00:05:29.169> district<00:05:29.770> script

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.880 

I<00:06:02.070> don't<00:06:02.820> mind<00:06:03.090> if<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.330> maps<00:06:03.540> you<00:06:04.380> know<00:06:04.500> if<00:06:04.770> it

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
I don't mind if the maps you know if it

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.120 
I don't mind if the maps you know if it
switches<00:06:05.160> teams<00:06:06.380> it<00:06:07.380> should<00:06:07.560> also<00:06:07.680> switched

spawns<00:06:09.000> I<00:06:09.740> mean<00:06:10.740> that's<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:10.980> whole<00:06:11.040> point<00:06:11.280> of

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
spawns I mean that's the whole point of

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.720 
spawns I mean that's the whole point of
having<00:06:11.520> a<00:06:12.980> special<00:06:13.980> in<00:06:14.130> these<00:06:14.280> maps<00:06:14.490> are<00:06:14.610> so

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
having a special in these maps are so

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.940 
having a special in these maps are so

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
easy to spawn camp it's almost like why

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.500 
easy to spawn camp it's almost like why
like<00:06:17.250> why<00:06:17.550> he<00:06:17.610> would<00:06:17.790> you<00:06:17.880> not<00:06:18.060> switch<00:06:18.330> the

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
like why he would you not switch the

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.810 
like why he would you not switch the
spark<00:06:18.810> between<00:06:19.020> rounds<00:06:19.500> you<00:06:20.430> switch<00:06:20.640> the

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
spark between rounds you switch the

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.250 
spark between rounds you switch the

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
teams they didn't switch his phone so we

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.430
