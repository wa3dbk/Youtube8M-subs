the right to keep arms is unlikely to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.420 
the right to keep arms is unlikely to

Virginia also set to take up this issue

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.600 
Virginia also set to take up this issue
so<00:02:24.660> as<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.260> said<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.680> showdown<00:02:26.160> will<00:02:26.400> likely

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
so as you said the showdown will likely

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.490 
so as you said the showdown will likely
end<00:02:26.760> up<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.420> Supreme<00:02:27.810> Court<00:02:28.110> Megan<00:02:28.380> and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
end up in the Supreme Court Megan and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.140 
end up in the Supreme Court Megan and
here's<00:02:28.680> why<00:02:28.830> that's<00:02:29.100> key<00:02:29.430> because<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.790> Court

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
here's why that's key because the Court

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.910 
here's why that's key because the Court
of<00:02:30.240> course<00:02:30.720> has<00:02:30.990> ruled<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.560> Second<00:02:31.890> Amendment

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
of course has ruled the Second Amendment

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.820 
of course has ruled the Second Amendment
protects<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.880> right<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.360> own<00:02:33.390> guns<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.350> that

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
protects the right to own guns and that

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.860 
protects the right to own guns and that
state<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.459> local<00:02:36.150> government<00:02:36.630> should

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
state and local government should

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.290 
state and local government should
recognize<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.680> right<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.970> Supreme

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
recognize that right but the Supreme

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.380 
recognize that right but the Supreme
Court<00:02:39.660> has<00:02:39.930> not<00:02:40.320> yet<00:02:40.740> ruled<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.430> rights<00:02:42.120> to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
Court has not yet ruled on rights to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.350 
Court has not yet ruled on rights to
carry<00:02:42.690> guns<00:02:42.780> outside<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.670> home<00:02:45.000> and

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
carry guns outside of the home and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.229 
carry guns outside of the home and
that's<00:02:46.020> where<00:02:46.500> this<00:02:46.830> decision<00:02:47.430> boils<00:02:47.790> down<00:02:47.850> to

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
that's where this decision boils down to

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.449 
that's where this decision boils down to
keep<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.570> mind<00:02:48.780> eight<00:02:49.050> million<00:02:49.709> Americans
