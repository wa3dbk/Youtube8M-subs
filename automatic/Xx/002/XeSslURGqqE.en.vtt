of

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.680 
of
you<00:02:13.500> know<00:02:13.700> example<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:14.970> working<00:02:15.300> out<00:02:15.450> it's

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
you know example for working out it's

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.620 
you know example for working out it's
just<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.890> don't<00:02:17.160> do<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.850> feel<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.480> I'm

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
just I just don't do it I feel like I'm

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.120 
just I just don't do it I feel like I'm
a<00:02:18.690> lazy<00:02:18.960> person<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.620> don't<00:02:19.830> know

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
a lazy person I don't know

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.770 
a lazy person I don't know
so<00:02:20.340> I've<00:02:20.610> had<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.790> start<00:02:21.060> working<00:02:21.330> out<00:02:21.390> daily

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
so I've had to start working out daily

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.300 
so I've had to start working out daily
or<00:02:21.960> else<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.200> lose<00:02:22.350> points<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.890> if<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.070> don't

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
or else I lose points and if you don't

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.890 
or else I lose points and if you don't
if<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.850> consistently<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.450> these<00:02:24.540> points<00:02:24.810> for

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
if you consistently do these points for

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.790 
if you consistently do these points for
something<00:02:25.170> each<00:02:25.290> day<00:02:25.440> you're<00:02:25.620> gonna<00:02:25.680> be

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
something each day you're gonna be

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.490 
something each day you're gonna be
really<00:02:26.070> behind<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.270> decided<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.840> do<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> free

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.150 
had I think but I'm doing Cosmo body
which<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> really<00:02:49.410> similar<00:02:49.620> thing<00:02:49.950> it's

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
which is a really similar thing it's

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.340 
which is a really similar thing it's
basically<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:51.060> account<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.840> create<00:02:52.170> and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
basically this account you create and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.260 
basically this account you create and
it's<00:02:52.470> made<00:02:52.710> by<00:02:52.790> Cosmopolitan<00:02:53.790> magazine<00:02:53.820> and

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
it's made by Cosmopolitan magazine and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.880 
it's made by Cosmopolitan magazine and
it's<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.660> really<00:02:54.810> good<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.440> first<00:02:55.650> one<00:02:55.770> is

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
it's just really good the first one is

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.500 
it's just really good the first one is
free<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.130> then<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.370> think<00:02:56.520> it's<00:02:56.640> 995<00:02:57.120> after<00:02:57.420> so

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
free and then I think it's 995 after so

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.330 
free and then I think it's 995 after so
I'm<00:02:57.570> giving<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.110> try<00:02:58.140> before<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.800> try<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.130> like

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
I'm giving it a try before I try to like

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.580
