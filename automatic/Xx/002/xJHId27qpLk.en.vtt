 today he kept telling me about safe driving in the previous installments we have 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.039
 seen as they are a correct driving position 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.519
 and how to best use the steering wheel pedals 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.859
 what only the director of the safe driving school tells us today 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.300
 Sardinia Today we will see how to set a safe trajectory on the road followed 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.900
 the trajectory is a curve 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.520
 the trajectory is the setting we have with the steering wheel in a cure 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 each curve to a store trajectory 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.690
 in each curve it is a trajectory 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.880
 the safe trajectory can be identified in three essential points 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.880
 the attack the rope that the exit 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.030
 the attack is the moment when we are going to act on the crown of 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.030
 steering wheel setting it traitors 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.020
 the rope and the most internal point of the curve are the moments in which we can 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.330
 re-open slightly grease the steering wheel realignment 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.470
 coming out the moments in which we will meet again in the wheel and perfectly 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 sorted 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.330
 to raise a correct driving position was to move the trajectories during 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.810
 driving is essential especially on days like this 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.250

 on the front of the road safety designer 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.690
 we will continue to talk about safe driving in the next episodes
