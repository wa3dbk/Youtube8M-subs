00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.470
 to lead the terminal 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.250
 in my case they put all the data here 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.370
 which determines the request codes and a 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.900
 problem to locate it and to 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.689
 little time as you can see I 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.599
 they had sent at twelve- fifteen 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.340
 the morning and at least fourth already had a 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.430
 mail where new instructions for 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.989
 release because they are very simple 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.450
 activities instructions to help the 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.629
 mobile with this maine that is such and 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.540
 here does not have the instructions turn on 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.760
 the terminal with a card that is not 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.140
 the network 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.750
 the mark of the pin and once 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:10.790
 I do not know if he's going to ask us for a code 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.100
 release if we put it we see the 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.890
 button that appears unlock and in my 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.840
 case was correctly measured 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.359
 if it brings a problem I will finally have 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.350
 to continue with these with these 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.980
 previous instructions has been that I 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.790
 step there has not been any 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.790
 no problem 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.740
 for this 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.740
 are reforms show a little the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.740
 finished 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.030
 Well, we understand the terminal 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.129
 our to add to 6 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.050
 to show now how 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.919
 how to perform the instructions that we 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:58.229
 have guided motors and to release the 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.229
 terminal we understand 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.969
 to take a cum 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.780
 tear 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:09.650
 although he will ask us 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.270
 the pin code remember that you have to 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.270
 turn on the phone already with the card 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.220
 with the card without let's say with a 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.220
 card without it being different 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.890
 different than a different operator 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.890
 is linked to the phone 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.259
 we wait for him to ask us 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.259
 the cream code 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:48.509
 you are going to ask us to introduce it 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.509
 again 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.120
 we're 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.280
 and then how will this 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.850
 screen on this screen simply 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.370
 we have to enter the code that has 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.979
 sent to doctors and the code of 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.960
 unlocking we introduce it we give to 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:17.969
 unlock button 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.030
 and automatically the terminal will be 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.040
 is unlocked 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.710
 and fully operational 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.000
 for any sim card of any 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.580
 operator 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.129
 that we want 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.289
 introduce in it then with this 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:37.479
 we finished him 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.479
 the tutorial I hope that this helps
