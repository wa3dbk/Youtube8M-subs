00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.660
 and that started to scream 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.200
 but then go out to the field and 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.000
 in another place sincerely nothing to live 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.000
 A) Yes 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.970
 and the fact of going out to the field and seeing all 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.680
 those people 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.420
 in the part that wants paper that 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.170
 shouts 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.010
 that not for a second in it 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.010
 although 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.870
 people from behind scream and yell and well that 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.160
 I made it a 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.160
 let's take us 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.840
 I was angry at a boy who 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.880
 another day he said by mouth that mouth has 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.990
 attitude copera I was that I am and is 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.620
 true also of playing more 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.390
 experience that we 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.670
 but if the other day I do not make you a 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.060
 court that when san lorenzo did not do the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.060
 2 to 1 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.930
 I played the mouth court winning 2 to 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.460
 0 and people mouth 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.860
 it fell on him 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.310
 then sometimes I think people 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.869
 wrong 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.689
 I think it's time that more 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.610
 we need those three to a sector 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.460
 of a plant began to sing against 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.740
 and the rest the reach began to sing to 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.960
 please and to me that sincerely touched me 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.729
 because I liked to contemplate and has started 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.470
 to bother that people are singing in 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.530
 against 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.000
 He has come back in four and started to 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.970
 sing against and the rest of the people 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.830
 he did not raise that attitude but he is not 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.940
 recriminates listening to the moment when 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.820
 we need you more 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.490
 well if you go back I think sometimes 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.369
 it's a matter of ironing little influence 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.650
 quite sometimes when one feels the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.480
 permanent breath and everyone reacts 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.880
 says that every boy is going 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.700
 come on we have to react that 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.160
 they put when they felt silence trapped 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.080
 very large function was also felt 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.080
 after the court out there too 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.810
 I do not remember I was on the court and 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.849
 when when they really say that the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.409
 I trembled 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.079
 there and I are my legs that are 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.340
 trembling and looked at the pieces of paper 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.830
 they did like this 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.060
 and I'm not the people of that year and it 's very 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.060
 strong is not easy 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.760
 mouth mouth 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.930
 has a 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.060
 a mystic in the cup that I think 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.860
 none very little team has it and I 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.950
 I said to vocalize in to play with fear is 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.140
 incredible has a respect that goes from 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.500
 to be respect happens to be fear and you 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.500
 I do not know 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:35.140
 and there I am sitting to listen to you 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:37.000
 moved everything to the court 15 minutes from m4 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.160
 control respect media by defender 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.920
 sporting that takes 2000 people with 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.080
 a stadium of 15,000 or 10,000 but 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.610
 the same 2000 arrives first mouth salons the 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.530
 stadium the people on one side of the 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:56.310
 already develop on the other side to put that 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.310
 it feels that the myth is true 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.620
 a game of the players 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.259
 above 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.259
