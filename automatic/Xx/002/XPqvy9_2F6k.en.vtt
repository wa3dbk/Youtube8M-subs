00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.049
 the analysis reading course of 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:08.650
 texts as the name suggests is a course 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:11.320
 which is essentially based on a look 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.020
 determined with respect to the text 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.180
 literary when it is written or when 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.519
 is a reader who spends a lot of time 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.259
 Reading is learning that the 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.179
 literary text has a surface and 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.279
 has a background all text has its 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.579
 own radiography has its own 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.429
 mechanisms this course is on track and 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.829
 in its theoretical aspect to learn to 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.220
 train us to read from a certain 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.700
 way 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.040
 we take texts basically stories but 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.070
 we also get into the field of 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.560
 chronic of the terrain of the micro - story of 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.780
 the essay novel but basically 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.790
 we are within the scope of 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.850
 story we start with classic authors 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.160
 we include contemporary authors 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.230
 we even include oriental authors 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.579
 and the analysis model to get closer 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.280
 to reading these texts again 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.870
 unique model we rely precisely on 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.600
 the operating mechanisms of each 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.850
 text and we try to see what's behind 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.250
 the surface of each text and why 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.890
 each text is effective the course also 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.810
 has its practical component oriented 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.940
 in the theoretical classes the writing of 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.770
 texts according to the techniques that 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.810
 we have verified the course has a 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.600
 component and is the possibility of having 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.850
 in guest classes as we work 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.189
 diverse narrative and diverse genres 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.009
 ways of d 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.810
 relate technically to the text 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.720
 I have the possibility to invite and what 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.790
 I make expert authors in micro-story 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.189
 expert authors in chronicles 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.439
 journalistic or in profile of personages 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.869
 and these authors who have a work of 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.850
 proven quality come to class and have 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.670
 an exchange that goes from your 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.340
 personal experience as writers with 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.340
 the work of one of his own texts 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.100
 to their theoretical knowledge or the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.100
 things that they can contribute in their training 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.659
 in the writing of the genre that in the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.130
 which are specialized 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.420
 this is a peculiar component of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.729
 workshop that enriches I believe the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.039
 diversity and the multi-dimensional approach 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.039
 let's say the contents to be analyzed
