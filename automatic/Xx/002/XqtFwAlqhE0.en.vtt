00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.120 
seems to be very slightly faster i would
say<00:02:14.600> but<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.630> major<00:02:15.900> improvement<00:02:16.290> because<00:02:16.739> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
say but a major improvement because the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.949 
say but a major improvement because the
phone<00:02:17.310> was<00:02:17.340> initially<00:02:18.060> faster<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.540> begin<00:02:18.810> with

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
phone was initially faster to begin with

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.070 
phone was initially faster to begin with
and<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:20.280> haven't<00:02:20.610> noticed<00:02:20.790> any<00:02:21.180> bigger<00:02:21.510> changes

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and I haven't noticed any bigger changes

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.770 
and I haven't noticed any bigger changes
in<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.319> camera<00:02:22.709> yet<00:02:22.950> maybe<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.060> algorithms

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
in the camera yet maybe the algorithms

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.710 
in the camera yet maybe the algorithms
Alvin<00:02:25.110> improve<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.970> yes<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.150> shot<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.540> short

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
Alvin improve and yes the shot to short

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.890 
Alvin improve and yes the shot to short
time<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.440> slightly<00:02:29.310> faster<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.600> we're<00:02:30.780> so

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
time is slightly faster and we're so

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.920 
time is slightly faster and we're so
slightly<00:02:31.140> faster<00:02:31.470> i<00:02:31.680> would<00:02:31.830> say<00:02:32.660> used<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.780> take

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
slightly faster i would say used to take

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.509 
slightly faster i would say used to take
three<00:02:34.200> seconds<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.000> now<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.269> like<00:02:37.070> 12<00:02:38.070> and

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
three seconds and now it's like 12 and

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.920 
three seconds and now it's like 12 and
yeah<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.090> takes<00:02:39.239> two<00:02:39.570> seconds

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
yeah that it takes two seconds

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.920 
yeah that it takes two seconds
approximately<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:41.519> that's<00:02:42.330> cool<00:02:44.269> any<00:02:45.269> kind<00:02:45.720> of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
approximately so that's cool any kind of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.870 
approximately so that's cool any kind of
an<00:02:46.230> improvement<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.920> an<00:02:47.190> improvement<00:02:47.459> right

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
an improvement is an improvement right

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.210 
an improvement is an improvement right
so<00:02:50.880> that's<00:02:51.239> pretty<00:02:51.450> much<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.739> what<00:02:52.950> we

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
so that's pretty much it this is what we

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.759 
so that's pretty much it this is what we
observed<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:53.880> far<00:02:53.910> with<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.989> Lumia<00:02:55.319> denim<00:02:55.500> of
