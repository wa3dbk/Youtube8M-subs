00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.540
 now want to keep moving forward i'm going to show you with 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.620
 using networks the three counterattackers facing the blocking the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.599
 more promising yes we are using this with a talent today and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.670
 up to 29 euros on this side this type of blockage or that we could 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.039
 do the other side or rather tidy ground peugeot will now 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.250
 still does a duty of humility with his hand for children woerth l 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.740
 history the first against attack France hopes to close a block 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.110
 if you do not opt ​​for the agadir agreement and the developer's garrard 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.809
 with me he can have a knife in this mass in the other the mail us 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.449
 we will not make sense at this stage training 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.879
 so that I attack she will understand that we know them supporters shirt 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.609
 in the same company he will be lifted 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.180
 and that the cost does not reach it 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.250
 but we will try to be decided next to me all that supposes 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.620
 so the first counter-attacked and the exorcist cut 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.609
 the king who is not blocking 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.939
 the second to launch his voice to erect the fad toward our goal we 

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:02.069
 let's attack the new attacking leaders so I'll send them with 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:05.430
 the four points is for you to see it well I attack for that I send 

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:08.570
 cold leaders it's both in mid-June 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.130
 this time it's a good exercise to get ahead of the muscle memory it comes 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.000
 to get control of body movements 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.560
 like based on many years of experience I believe that most 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.180
 criminals exhale untrained soldiers for bordeaux just a 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.979
 belief there are many soldiers who do not have these 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.530
 knowledgeable in the matter most of us will call meetings 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.370
 this blockage she evokes the report 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.030
 if you train against this type of problem I assure you antoine 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.439
 would progress a lot 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.869
 get your partner out to learn how to do blockages 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:45.740
 the story 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.090
 the first counterattack tell 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.700
 scm he redirected to another goal the third is not it yet 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.950
 that we call an invasion with the hands 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.380
 no doubt some call him his ideas 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.670
 but I like the term invasion because we are literally for a 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.450
 titanic work
