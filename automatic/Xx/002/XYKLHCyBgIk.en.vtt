well this conference is unique in a it's

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.129 
well this conference is unique in a it's
it's<00:00:11.549> every<00:00:11.790> four<00:00:12.000> years<00:00:12.330> it's<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.629> big<00:00:12.840> thing

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
it's every four years it's a big thing

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.660

and<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.379> brings<00:00:13.559> together<00:00:13.830> scientists<00:00:14.520> from

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
and it brings together scientists from

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.640 
and it brings together scientists from
all<00:00:14.940> over<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.330> world<00:00:15.510> in<00:00:15.809> pretty<00:00:16.380> large

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
all over the world in pretty large

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.230 
all over the world in pretty large
concentrations<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.759> a<00:00:17.820> meeting<00:00:18.029> like

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
concentrations I have a meeting like

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.790 
concentrations I have a meeting like
this<00:00:18.450> with<00:00:19.730> people<00:00:20.730> all<00:00:21.300> over<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.660> world

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
this with people all over the world

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.550 
this with people all over the world
sharing<00:00:22.800> experiences<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.669> ideas<00:00:23.759> I<00:00:24.320> guess<00:00:25.320> is

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
sharing experiences and ideas I guess is

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.280 
sharing experiences and ideas I guess is
a<00:00:25.590> really<00:00:25.890> unique<00:00:26.430> opportunity<00:00:26.790> and<00:00:27.599> in

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
a really unique opportunity and in

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.229 
a really unique opportunity and in
particular<00:00:28.739> being<00:00:29.250> held<00:00:29.489> here<00:00:29.790> in<00:00:29.820> Southeast

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
particular being held here in Southeast

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.760 
particular being held here in Southeast
Asia<00:00:30.360> so<00:00:30.509> you<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> large<00:00:30.989> Southeast<00:00:31.439> Asian

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
Asia so you have a large Southeast Asian

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.970 
Asia so you have a large Southeast Asian
contingent<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.750> those<00:00:33.750> folks<00:00:34.020> now<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.530> can

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
contingent and those folks now can can

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.520 
contingent and those folks now can can
learn<00:00:35.250> from<00:00:35.719> the<00:00:36.719> people<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.140> work<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
learn from the people that work in the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.990 
learn from the people that work in the
Caribbean<00:00:37.950> or<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> work<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> Red<00:00:38.730> Sea<00:00:38.969> or

Caribbean or the work in the Red Sea or

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.880 
Caribbean or the work in the Red Sea or
as<00:00:39.210> work<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.900> coast<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.230> Africa<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
as work on like the coast of Africa and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.740 
as work on like the coast of Africa and
that's<00:00:41.610> interesting<00:00:45.110> Indonesia<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> unique

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
that's interesting Indonesia is a unique

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.920 
that's interesting Indonesia is a unique
part<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.870> our<00:00:49.020> planet<00:00:49.560> because<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> its

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
part of our planet because of its

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.510 
part of our planet because of its
geologic<00:00:51.930> history<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.620> its<00:00:52.800> oceanographic

geologic history in its oceanographic
history<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:55.050> essentially<00:00:56.040> a<00:00:56.070> sheltered

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
history it is essentially a sheltered

history it is essentially a sheltered
backwater<00:00:57.240> that<00:00:57.570> evolution<00:00:58.140> has<00:00:58.290> occurred<00:00:58.620> in

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
backwater that evolution has occurred in

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:11.140 
backwater that evolution has occurred in
for<00:00:59.630> millions<00:01:00.630> and<00:01:00.870> millions<00:01:01.290> of<00:01:01.440> years

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.149 

it<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.330> called<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> Coral<00:01:13.020> Triangle<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.950> is

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it is called the Coral Triangle this is

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.450 
it is called the Coral Triangle this is
kind<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.820> center<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> diversity<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.740> most

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
kind of the center of diversity for most

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.270 
kind of the center of diversity for most
marine<00:01:17.790> Marine<00:01:18.720> groups<00:01:19.049> including<00:01:19.920> fishes

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
marine Marine groups including fishes

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.730 
marine Marine groups including fishes
and<00:01:20.520> corals<00:01:20.940> and<00:01:21.119> crustaceans<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.960> sponges

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and corals and crustaceans and sponges

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.720 
and corals and crustaceans and sponges
etc

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.110 

we<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.480> over<00:01:28.350> 500<00:01:28.620> coral<00:01:29.250> species<00:01:29.490> running

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
we have over 500 coral species running

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.120 
we have over 500 coral species running
around<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.540> Indonesia<00:01:30.960> where<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.710> compared<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
around in Indonesia where as compared to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
around in Indonesia where as compared to
the<00:01:32.280> Caribbean<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.060> example<00:01:33.810> there's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the Caribbean for example there's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.130 
the Caribbean for example there's
there's<00:01:35.010> I<00:01:35.100> believe<00:01:35.790> 80<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.270> some<00:01:36.510> odd<00:01:36.660> species

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
there's I believe 80 or some odd species

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.990 
there's I believe 80 or some odd species
there<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.620> quite<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.370> large<00:01:38.700> difference

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
there so quite a large difference

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.180 
there so quite a large difference
between<00:01:39.270> maybe<00:01:39.690> two<00:01:40.290> five<00:01:40.500> hundred<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.010> some

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
between maybe two five hundred and some

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:53.930 
between maybe two five hundred and some
odd<00:01:49.550> fish<00:01:50.550> bombing<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.720> way<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.580> cheaply<00:01:53.580> and

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
odd fish bombing is a way to cheaply and

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.000 
odd fish bombing is a way to cheaply and
easily<00:01:54.150> get<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.660> lot<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.990> fish<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.530> there's<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
easily get a lot of fish if there's a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.980 
easily get a lot of fish if there's a
big<00:01:56.190> school<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.760> area<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.570> started

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
big school in the area and it started

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.389 
big school in the area and it started
after<00:01:58.200> World<00:01:58.680> War<00:01:58.800> two<00:01:59.340> with<00:02:01.130> dynamite<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
after World War two with dynamite and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.800 
after World War two with dynamite and
now<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.119> most<00:02:03.720> fishermen<00:02:04.200> use<00:02:05.570> models<00:02:06.570> that

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
now the most fishermen use models that

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.600 
now the most fishermen use models that
they<00:02:06.930> pack<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.410> mixture<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.890> fertilizer

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
they pack with a mixture of fertilizer

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.960 
they pack with a mixture of fertilizer
and<00:02:09.030> kerosene<00:02:09.540> and<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.739> they<00:02:10.890> pack<00:02:11.820> this

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
and kerosene and so they pack this

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.330 
and kerosene and so they pack this
mixture<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.570> bottle<00:02:12.870> put<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> fuse<00:02:14.070> in<00:02:14.250> it

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
mixture in the bottle put a fuse in it

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.790 
mixture in the bottle put a fuse in it
light<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.390> throw<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.930> into<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.290> school<00:02:16.680> of

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
light it and throw it into a school of

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.760 
light it and throw it into a school of
fish<00:02:17.070> you'll<00:02:17.940> have<00:02:18.090> guys<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.360> boats<00:02:18.810> with<00:02:19.440> at

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
fish you'll have guys in boats with at

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.770 
fish you'll have guys in boats with at
least<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.070> few<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.430> mascar<00:02:20.910> or<00:02:21.090> goggles<00:02:21.450> on

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
least a few with mascar or goggles on

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.080 
least a few with mascar or goggles on
they'll<00:02:22.320> locate<00:02:22.590> schooling<00:02:23.190> fishes<00:02:23.610> visually

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
they'll locate schooling fishes visually

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.360 
they'll locate schooling fishes visually
and<00:02:24.239> then<00:02:24.750> they<00:02:24.900> throw<00:02:25.230> an<00:02:25.470> explosive<00:02:26.070> into

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
and then they throw an explosive into

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.449 
and then they throw an explosive into
the<00:02:26.610> school<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:30.260> when<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.350> bomb<00:02:31.530> explodes<00:02:32.130> it

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
the school and when the bomb explodes it

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.370 
the school and when the bomb explodes it
destroys<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.570> swim<00:02:33.780> bladder<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
destroys the the swim bladder and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.620 
destroys the the swim bladder and
basically<00:02:35.130> kills<00:02:35.489> fish<00:02:35.760> if<00:02:35.970> not<00:02:36.120> stuns<00:02:36.480> them

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
basically kills fish if not stuns them

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
problem but the big problem is that the

look there's no living coral it's all

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.009

that<00:03:29.799> there's<00:03:29.980> been<00:03:30.129> so<00:03:30.430> much<00:03:30.760> blasting<00:03:34.019> when

that there's been so much blasting when

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.539 
that there's been so much blasting when
you<00:03:35.080> talk<00:03:35.260> about<00:03:35.379> how<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.680> curb<00:03:36.010> destructive

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
you talk about how to curb destructive

you talk about how to curb destructive
fishing<00:03:36.670> practices<00:03:36.849> I<00:03:37.420> think<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.780> lot<00:03:37.930> of

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
fishing practices I think that a lot of

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.250 
fishing practices I think that a lot of
NGOs<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.549> various<00:03:39.790> programs<00:03:40.329> they<00:03:41.079> feel

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
NGOs and and various programs they feel

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.720 
NGOs and and various programs they feel
sorry<00:03:41.560> for<00:03:41.650> these<00:03:41.950> people<00:03:42.310> they<00:03:42.400> said<00:03:42.610> well

there's a starving fisherman and they're
forced<00:03:44.590> into<00:03:44.709> doing<00:03:45.099> that<00:03:45.220> so<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.060> only<00:03:46.090> real

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
forced into doing that so the only real

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.050
