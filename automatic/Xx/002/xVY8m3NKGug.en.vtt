00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.220
 what's up kids like nothing a video 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.250
 quick to show you a pretty thing 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.200
 interesting 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.150
 if you realize you have always talked about 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.730
 what part of the album soma and always said 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.510
 that there was a half where the finger is 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.220
 you have to be a half of the soma disk and 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.349
 that the other then fell through the aquarium 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.760
 and that we did not find it because 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:29.250
 mysteriously appeared as is here 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.900
 but just as he has returned as is 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.940
 you suspect this is the cave of the 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.670
 government here and this here and it's 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.739
 probably it stayed below then 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.170
 some area out there from below and at 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.850
 have been excavating the goby 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.039
 check out a partial soma disk 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.309
 as you realize the reproduction had 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.410
 success and it was divided into two that I already told you 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.210
 that part of it had worked for the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.460
 another one too so we already have two 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.839
 discs or more because I already tell you that 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.839
 Soma disc was not born overnight 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.899
 so fix 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.180
 there you can see that it is in a good place already 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.689
 I tell you that it has appeared mysteriously 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.689
 I have placed 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.670
 what am I seeing here 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.520
 kids 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.400
 to overturn the heart because look 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.260
 that one shrimp in there is another 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.230
 prawn and hand 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.760
 a good behavior to see if we get it to 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.840
 appreciate well 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.929
 see what's there 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.640
 I almost died of fright say week 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.820
 death a shrimp was already was already 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.700
 super super super worried it turns out that 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.560
 He has moved and we bermuda for nothing 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.690
 He said he already has is already watered down 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.430
 he already has eggs 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.790
 so the thing worked well 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.820
 it turns out that the exoskeleton changes 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.610
 his would get his hand and take it out but 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.610
 I am too lazy eye gives me a lot of laziness 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.170
 Well what I'll do I get lazy by 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.920
 that is that I have to stain everything and I 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.920
 I was going to go right now 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.409
 what laziness what laziness come let's go to 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.250
 do everything for the videos but 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.250
 this means of training 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.010
 to avoid a lot of things here the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.219
 panels everything is that it is not easy to put the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.219
 hand 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.620
 but good everything is to show you some 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.620
 good video let's try to take out 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.370
 Where is 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.470
 what will happen we lost what is 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.990
 below the gender filia 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.840
 to remove it or filia very carefully 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.650
 because it is stressing right away 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.650
 closes 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.640
 and here we can see the change of the prawn 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.960
 this is what I wanted to be taught not 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.330
 is that she is dead you have already seen the 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.330
 two if we have the change 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.160
 we are going to take it out 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.380
 there we have it then nothing 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.590
 there is always something interesting in the 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.590
 marine aquarium 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.690
 I'm going to cut already with one hand as nothing 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.690
 guys until the next video
