00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.470 
hopeful Roger it's best to let it cool
and<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:18.440> cooling<00:04:18.890> process<00:04:19.090> helps<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.299> to

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
and the cooling process helps it to

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.940 
and the cooling process helps it to
thicken<00:04:20.780> so<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:21.169> can<00:04:21.320> put<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.650> in<00:04:21.829> the

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
thicken so you can put that in the

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.580 
thicken so you can put that in the
refrigerator<00:04:22.220> for<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:23.270> couple<00:04:23.840> of<00:04:23.870> hours<00:04:24.320> and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
refrigerator for a couple of hours and

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.560 
refrigerator for a couple of hours and
once<00:04:25.010> that<00:04:25.250> starts<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.790> thicken<00:04:25.970> a<00:04:26.150> little<00:04:26.180> bit

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
once that starts to thicken a little bit

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.800 
once that starts to thicken a little bit
you'll<00:04:26.810> see<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.940> new<00:04:29.120> cyllage<00:04:29.480> of<00:04:29.660> it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
you'll see it the new cyllage of it

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.310 
you'll see it the new cyllage of it
comes<00:04:30.140> out<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.910> same<00:04:32.210> process<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:32.930> you

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
comes out and the same process that you

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.090 
comes out and the same process that you
use<00:04:33.560> for<00:04:33.950> flaxseed<00:04:34.910> gel<00:04:35.680> you're<00:04:36.680> going<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.919> use

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
use for flaxseed gel you're going to use

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.010 
use for flaxseed gel you're going to use
four<00:04:37.340> marshmallowy<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.390> they're<00:04:38.570> all<00:04:38.750> the

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
four marshmallowy so they're all the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.400 
four marshmallowy so they're all the
same<00:04:39.050> families<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.919> only<00:04:40.220> exception<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:42.320> the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
same families the only exception to the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.370 
same families the only exception to the
process<00:04:42.950> is<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.880> aqua<00:04:44.360> water<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.840> aqua<00:04:45.140> water

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
process is the aqua water the aqua water

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.409 
process is the aqua water the aqua water
you<00:04:45.620> want<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.980> leave<00:04:46.190> in<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.550> refrigerator<00:04:46.580> to

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
you want to leave in the refrigerator to

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.080 
you want to leave in the refrigerator to
bind<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:49.180> water<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.600> that<00:04:50.750> museology<00:04:51.790> part<00:04:52.790> so

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
bind the water to that museology part so

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.450 
bind the water to that museology part so
that<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.510> can<00:04:53.720> use<00:04:54.350> that<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.770> separate<00:04:55.220> and

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
that you can use that to separate and

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.070 
that you can use that to separate and
populous<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:57.290> watery<00:04:57.790> by-product<00:04:58.790> of

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
populous the watery by-product of

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.190 
populous the watery by-product of
flaxseed<00:05:00.080> marshmallow<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:01.280> okra<00:05:01.820> water<00:05:02.270> is

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
flaxseed marshmallow and okra water is

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:11.950 
flaxseed marshmallow and okra water is
very<00:05:03.620> good<00:05:04.120> usage<00:05:05.120> for<00:05:05.660> popping<00:05:06.350> your<00:05:06.800> locks

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.999 

so<00:05:12.960> these<00:05:13.229> are<00:05:13.470> my<00:05:13.590> notes

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
so these are my notes

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.189 
so these are my notes
actually<00:05:14.490> we<00:05:14.759> talked<00:05:15.090> with<00:05:15.389> some<00:05:15.690> flaxseed

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
actually we talked with some flaxseed

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.779 
actually we talked with some flaxseed
and<00:05:16.350> approached<00:05:16.889> my<00:05:17.340> child

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
and approached my child

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.210 
am having a fracture that I've popped
all<00:05:32.699> of<00:05:33.000> those<00:05:33.150> locks<00:05:33.509> I<00:05:33.840> just<00:05:34.229> go<00:05:34.440> in<00:05:34.650> like<00:05:35.069> a

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
all of those locks I just go in like a

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.790 
all of those locks I just go in like a
fan<00:05:36.380> and<00:05:37.380> one<00:05:38.479> separate<00:05:39.479> each<00:05:39.599> lock<00:05:39.930> like<00:05:40.289> that

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
fan and one separate each lock like that

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.890 
fan and one separate each lock like that
see<00:05:41.220> if<00:05:41.280> I<00:05:41.460> experience<00:05:42.000> any<00:05:42.150> pulling<00:05:42.479> or

see if I experience any pulling or

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.159 
see if I experience any pulling or
tugging<00:05:43.070> and<00:05:44.360> I'll<00:05:45.360> do<00:05:45.630> that<00:05:45.660> for<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.050> entire

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169
