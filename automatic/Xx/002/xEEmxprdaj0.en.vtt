Wolffe<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.870> simulation<00:00:03.870> released<00:00:04.350> in<00:00:04.640> 1994

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
Wolffe the simulation released in 1994

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.840 
Wolffe the simulation released in 1994
this<00:00:05.999> is<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.270> wolf<00:00:06.990> simulator<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:08.430> game<00:00:08.730> will

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
this is a wolf simulator this game will

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.520 
this is a wolf simulator this game will
have<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.059> playing<00:00:09.330> as<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> wolf<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.110> attempts

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
have you playing as a wolf and attempts

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.200 
have you playing as a wolf and attempts
to<00:00:10.560> simulate<00:00:10.890> what<00:00:11.220> it<00:00:11.310> would<00:00:11.400> be<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.640> to<00:00:12.090> be

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
to simulate what it would be like to be

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.940 
to simulate what it would be like to be
a<00:00:12.240> wolf<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.780> first<00:00:13.020> thing<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.320> mention<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.770> it

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
a wolf the first thing to mention is it

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.590 
a wolf the first thing to mention is it
has<00:00:14.100> a<00:00:14.130> lot<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.400> wolf<00:00:14.640> facts<00:00:15.030> for<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.450> learn

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
has a lot of wolf facts for you to learn

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.390 
has a lot of wolf facts for you to learn
from<00:00:15.900> from<00:00:16.230> their<00:00:16.379> hunting<00:00:16.650> techniques<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
from from their hunting techniques and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400 
from from their hunting techniques and
social<00:00:17.820> circles<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.449> even<00:00:18.660> does<00:00:18.779> comparisons

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
social circles it even does comparisons

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.019 
social circles it even does comparisons
to<00:00:19.560> humans<00:00:19.919> so<00:00:20.099> some<00:00:20.460> really<00:00:20.759> cool

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
to humans so some really cool

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.970 
to humans so some really cool
information<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.839> here<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.349> there's<00:00:22.560> two<00:00:22.769> modes

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
information on here so there's two modes

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.399 
information on here so there's two modes
to<00:00:23.279> choose<00:00:23.310> from<00:00:23.579> the<00:00:23.999> scenario<00:00:24.659> mode<00:00:24.960> or<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:25.409 
to choose from the scenario mode or the

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.140 
to choose from the scenario mode or the
simulation<00:00:26.070> now<00:00:26.279> there's<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.550> lot<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.939> things

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
simulation now there's a lot of things

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.729 
simulation now there's a lot of things
your<00:00:27.300> wolf<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.839> here<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.380> survived

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739

take care of now scenario mode is just
essentially<00:00:53.969> ignitions

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
essentially ignitions

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.630 
essentially ignitions
for<00:00:54.839> instance<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.469> mission<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.039> find<00:00:56.370> water

to<00:00:56.850> drink<00:00:57.120> within<00:00:57.480> 12<00:00:57.750> hours<00:00:57.929> hmm<00:00:58.679> sounds

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
to drink within 12 hours hmm sounds

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.770 
to drink within 12 hours hmm sounds
simple<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.789> went<00:00:59.999> around<00:01:00.089> trying<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> find<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
simple so I went around trying to find a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.959 
simple so I went around trying to find a
waterhole<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> chopper<00:01:02.160> flies<00:01:02.429> over<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
waterhole then a chopper flies over and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:03.840 
waterhole then a chopper flies over and
shoots<00:01:03.600> me

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
shoots me

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.050

cub so I attempted to locate the cub I
first<00:01:31.170> tried<00:01:31.440> howling<00:01:35.900> then<00:01:36.900> while<00:01:37.050> traveling

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
first tried howling then while traveling

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560 
first tried howling then while traveling
I<00:01:37.650> used<00:01:37.830> my<00:01:37.980> sense<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.460> smell<00:01:38.730> to<00:01:38.760> find<00:01:39.120> him<00:01:39.330> now

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
I used my sense of smell to find him now

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.420 
I used my sense of smell to find him now
along<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:39.990> way<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.140> ran<00:01:40.410> into<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.620> lone<00:01:40.980> wolf<00:01:41.250> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
along the way I ran into a lone wolf and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.220 
along the way I ran into a lone wolf and
he<00:01:41.730> didn't<00:01:41.970> join<00:01:42.150> me<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.510> a<00:01:42.570> pack<00:01:42.870> he<00:01:43.050> just

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
he didn't join me in a pack he just

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.960 
he didn't join me in a pack he just
started<00:01:43.800> following<00:01:44.070> me<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.670> thought<00:01:44.910> that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
started following me and I thought that

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060 
started following me and I thought that
was<00:01:45.180> pretty<00:01:45.390> neat<00:01:45.510> and<00:01:45.870> finally<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.350> located<00:01:46.860> my

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
was pretty neat and finally I located my

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.610 
was pretty neat and finally I located my
missing<00:01:47.460> cub<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.240> some<00:01:48.660> really<00:01:48.810> fun<00:01:49.110> scenarios

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
missing cub so some really fun scenarios

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.740 
missing cub so some really fun scenarios
here<00:01:49.800> in<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.280> simulation<00:01:50.970> mode<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.480> kind<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
here in the simulation mode it's kind of

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.660 
here in the simulation mode it's kind of
like<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> free<00:01:52.440> play<00:01:52.680> mode<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.280> try<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
like a free play mode you just try to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.340 
like a free play mode you just try to
survive<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.540> thankfully<00:01:54.990> keep<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
survive and you can thankfully keep the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.380 
survive and you can thankfully keep the
human<00:01:55.980> hunters<00:01:56.280> low<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.030> join<00:01:57.180> more

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
human hunters low so you can join more

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.090 
human hunters low so you can join more
of<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.600> game<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.050> hunting<00:01:58.530> with<00:01:58.560> my<00:01:58.770> pack

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
of the game I was hunting with my pack

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
of the game I was hunting with my pack
and<00:01:59.370> we<00:01:59.430> were<00:01:59.550> trying<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.120> take<00:02:00.300> down<00:02:00.360> out

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and we were trying to take down out

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.990 
and we were trying to take down out
buffaloes<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.650> I<00:02:01.920> guess<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.490> weren't<00:02:02.610> strong

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
buffaloes but I guess we weren't strong

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.940 
buffaloes but I guess we weren't strong
enough<00:02:03.060> yet<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.720> most<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.320> time<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.800> me

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
enough yet so most of the time just me

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.950 
enough yet so most of the time just me
and<00:02:05.100> my<00:02:05.190> pack<00:02:05.430> rush<00:02:05.820> scavenging<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:06.720> dead

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
and my pack rush scavenging for dead

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.930 
and my pack rush scavenging for dead
animals<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.530> live<00:02:07.680> off<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.790> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
animals to live off of it's a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.880 
animals to live off of it's a
frustrating<00:02:09.450> game<00:02:09.600> some<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> things<00:02:10.770> I

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
frustrating game some of the things I

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.500 
frustrating game some of the things I
didn't<00:02:11.070> like<00:02:11.130> were<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.640> invisible<00:02:12.240> walls

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
didn't like were the invisible walls

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.600 
didn't like were the invisible walls
they<00:02:12.810> could<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.050> just<00:02:13.200> put<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.380> box<00:02:13.920> Cayden<00:02:14.459> or

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
they could have just put a box Cayden or

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.860 
they could have just put a box Cayden or
something<00:02:15.000> there<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.600> didn't<00:02:15.810> really

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
something there and it didn't really

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.900 
something there and it didn't really
appear<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.350> could<00:02:16.530> attack<00:02:17.070> humans<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.760> this

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
appear you could attack humans in this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.660 
appear you could attack humans in this
and<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.690> simulation<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.590> should<00:02:20.130> be<00:02:20.250> able<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
and in a simulation I should be able to

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.430 
and in a simulation I should be able to
especially<00:02:21.360> one<00:02:21.510> that's<00:02:21.660> shooting<00:02:21.989> at<00:02:22.260> me<00:02:22.410> I

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
especially one that's shooting at me I

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.199 
especially one that's shooting at me I
mean<00:02:22.709> come<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.400> overall<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.970> pretty

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
mean come on so overall this is a pretty

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.060 
mean come on so overall this is a pretty
enjoyable<00:02:24.510> simulator<00:02:25.200> with<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> large<00:02:25.770> amount

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
enjoyable simulator with a large amount

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.560 
enjoyable simulator with a large amount

of scenarios to choose from in a free
play<00:02:27.780> mode<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.170> will<00:02:28.350> keep<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.650> busy<00:02:28.680> for

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
play mode this will keep you busy for

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.710 
play mode this will keep you busy for
quite<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.340> bit<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.700> you'll<00:02:30.209> probably<00:02:30.360> come<00:02:30.660> out

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
quite a bit and you'll probably come out

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.300 
quite a bit and you'll probably come out
having<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.170> better<00:02:31.320> appreciation<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:32.070> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
having a better appreciation for a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.040 
having a better appreciation for a
four-legged<00:02:32.910> hunter<00:02:33.209> friend<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.720> there<00:02:33.930> you

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
four-legged hunter friend so there you

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.530 
four-legged hunter friend so there you
have<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.230> wolf<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.010> simulation<00:02:35.730> thanks<00:02:36.360> for

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
have it wolf the simulation thanks for

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.420 
have it wolf the simulation thanks for
watching

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430
