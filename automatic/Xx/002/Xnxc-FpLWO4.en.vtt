and sweet and say that the unshrinking

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.790 
and sweet and say that the unshrinking
your<00:02:13.459> sweater<00:02:13.880> method<00:02:14.330> did<00:02:14.720> not<00:02:14.959> work<00:02:15.260> for<00:02:15.680> me

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
your sweater method did not work for me

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.089 
your sweater method did not work for me
I'm<00:02:16.400> sure<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.209> was<00:02:17.360> probably<00:02:17.800> operator<00:02:18.800> error

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
I'm sure it was probably operator error

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.050 
I'm sure it was probably operator error
and<00:02:19.630> not<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.959> actual<00:02:21.590> method<00:02:22.099> used<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:22.790> had

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
and not the actual method used I had

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.600 
and not the actual method used I had
never<00:02:23.239> tried<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.870> before<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.590> seems<00:02:25.310> simple

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
never tried this before it seems simple

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.990 
never tried this before it seems simple
enough<00:02:25.819> but<00:02:26.830> my<00:02:27.830> sweaters<00:02:28.280> are<00:02:28.459> still<00:02:28.700> shrunk

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
enough but my sweaters are still shrunk

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.820 
enough but my sweaters are still shrunk
luckily<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.720> can<00:02:29.870> still<00:02:30.200> wear<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.590> sweater

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
luckily I can still wear the sweater

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.250 
luckily I can still wear the sweater
it's<00:02:31.489> just<00:02:31.819> more<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.360> bracelet<00:02:32.959> length

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
it's just more of a bracelet length

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.800 
it's just more of a bracelet length
sleeve<00:02:33.680> instead<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.489> long<00:02:34.700> sleeve<00:02:35.150> now<00:02:35.480> and

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
sleeve instead of a long sleeve now and

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.320 
sleeve instead of a long sleeve now and
the<00:02:36.769> blue<00:02:37.190> one<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.610> really<00:02:37.940> didn't<00:02:38.180> show

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
the blue one that I really didn't show

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.940 
the blue one that I really didn't show
much<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.989> video<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.799> had

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
much of in the video because I had

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.979 
much of in the video because I had
already<00:02:40.160> done<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.910> one<00:02:41.150> before<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.540> started

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
already done that one before I started

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.080 
already done that one before I started
recording<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.709> can<00:02:43.190> still<00:02:43.670> wear<00:02:43.850> it

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
recording I can still wear it

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.780 
recording I can still wear it
it<00:02:44.299> just<00:02:44.540> doesn't<00:02:44.780> hit<00:02:45.260> below<00:02:46.160> my<00:02:46.580> waist

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
it just doesn't hit below my waist

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.500 
it just doesn't hit below my waist
anymore<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.720> hits<00:02:48.049> right<00:02:48.890> at<00:02:49.190> my<00:02:49.430> waist<00:02:49.700> so

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
anymore it hits right at my waist so

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.600 
anymore it hits right at my waist so
it's<00:02:51.410> not<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.830> have<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.040> throw<00:02:52.130> them<00:02:52.459> away

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
it's not like I have to throw them away

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.479 
it's not like I have to throw them away
or<00:02:52.790> anything<00:02:53.420> they're<00:02:53.900> just<00:02:53.930> not<00:02:54.860> back<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.400> the

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
or anything they're just not back to the

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.070 
or anything they're just not back to the
way<00:02:55.580> they<00:02:55.760> were<00:02:55.790> before<00:02:56.060> which<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.569> what<00:02:57.019> I

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
way they were before which is what I

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.920 
way they were before which is what I
expected<00:02:57.830> from<00:02:58.069> what<00:02:58.549> I<00:02:58.580> saw<00:02:58.940> in<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.299> video<00:02:59.540> it

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
expected from what I saw in the video it

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.110 
expected from what I saw in the video it
might<00:03:00.170> work<00:03:00.319> for<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.739> if<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.459> want<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.849> go

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
might work for you if you want to go

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.030 
might work for you if you want to go
ahead<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.540> try<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:03.440> couldn't<00:03:03.769> get<00:03:03.980> it

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
ahead and try it I just couldn't get it

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.610 
ahead and try it I just couldn't get it
to<00:03:04.220> work<00:03:04.250> for<00:03:04.430> me
