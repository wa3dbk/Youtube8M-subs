this is sort of that this is just as

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.490 
this is sort of that this is just as
dangerous<00:03:22.280> as<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.670> regular<00:03:23.000> one<00:03:23.319> that's<00:03:24.319> like<00:03:24.470> a

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
dangerous as a regular one that's like a

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.250 
dangerous as a regular one that's like a
pocketknife<00:03:25.569> it's<00:03:26.569> just<00:03:26.690> something<00:03:26.959> a<00:03:26.989> little
