00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.710 

okay<00:00:09.830> and<00:00:10.130> so<00:00:10.670> what<00:00:10.820> we're<00:00:10.970> looking<00:00:11.000> at<00:00:11.300> is<00:00:11.450> the

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.720 
okay and so what we're looking at is the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.020 
okay and so what we're looking at is the
Taliban<00:00:12.440> lead<00:00:12.800> change<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:13.490> we're<00:00:13.700> just<00:00:13.820> going

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
Taliban lead change and we're just going

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.610 
Taliban lead change and we're just going
to<00:00:14.090> do<00:00:14.180> it<00:00:14.270> in<00:00:14.360> a<00:00:14.420> straight<00:00:14.870> line<00:00:14.900> so<00:00:15.470> we're

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
to do it in a straight line so we're

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.680 
to do it in a straight line so we're
going<00:00:15.770> from<00:00:15.920> warm<00:00:16.220> Telemark<00:00:16.730> to<00:00:17.210> the<00:00:17.330> other<00:00:17.450> in

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
going from warm Telemark to the other in

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.750 
going from warm Telemark to the other in
a<00:00:18.050> straight<00:00:18.350> line<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.250> reason<00:00:19.520> we<00:00:19.610> do

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
a straight line and the reason we do

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.519 
a straight line and the reason we do
this<00:00:19.940> is<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:20.210> it<00:00:20.480> can<00:00:20.630> get<00:00:20.720> our<00:00:20.900> balance<00:00:21.140> right

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
this is so it can get our balance right

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.890 
this is so it can get our balance right
and<00:00:21.830> we<00:00:22.400> can<00:00:22.550> get<00:00:22.700> our<00:00:22.820> posture<00:00:23.300> right<00:00:23.420> I'm

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
and we can get our posture right I'm

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.240 
and we can get our posture right I'm
working<00:00:24.110> on<00:00:24.350> a<00:00:24.410> lot<00:00:24.650> of<00:00:24.770> different<00:00:25.130> elements

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
working on a lot of different elements

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.280 
working on a lot of different elements
the<00:00:26.180> Telemark<00:00:26.540> elite<00:00:26.750> changes<00:00:27.140> one<00:00:27.260> thing

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
the Telemark elite changes one thing

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.750 
the Telemark elite changes one thing
that<00:00:27.590> we<00:00:27.650> actually<00:00:27.770> work<00:00:28.100> with<00:00:28.130> upper<00:00:28.640> end

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
that we actually work with upper end

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.850 
that we actually work with upper end
Telemark<00:00:29.210> is<00:00:29.330> as<00:00:29.510> well<00:00:29.690> as<00:00:29.840> beginners<00:00:30.289> because

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
Telemark is as well as beginners because

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.470 
Telemark is as well as beginners because
it<00:00:31.010> will<00:00:31.130> sort<00:00:31.430> people's<00:00:31.850> problems<00:00:32.270> out<00:00:32.450> in

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
it will sort people's problems out in

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.810 
it will sort people's problems out in
theory<00:00:33.050> will<00:00:33.290> identify<00:00:33.500> a<00:00:33.950> lot<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.400> different

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
theory will identify a lot of different

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.760 
theory will identify a lot of different
issues<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:35.809> what<00:00:35.960> we're<00:00:36.080> looking<00:00:36.110> for<00:00:36.500> mainly

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
issues so what we're looking for mainly

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.799 
issues so what we're looking for mainly
on<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.010> Telemark<00:00:37.520> elite<00:00:37.730> changes<00:00:38.210> is<00:00:38.449> for

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
on the Telemark elite changes is for

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.799 
on the Telemark elite changes is for
nice<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:39.860> smooth<00:00:40.220> up<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:40.820> down<00:00:41.000> movement<00:00:41.210> and

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
nice and smooth up and down movement and

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.540 
nice and smooth up and down movement and
we're<00:00:41.930> looking<00:00:42.170> for<00:00:42.350> equal<00:00:42.830> weight<00:00:43.070> pressure

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
we're looking for equal weight pressure

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:55.660 
we're looking for equal weight pressure
on<00:00:43.850> both<00:00:44.089> skis

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.130 

awesome<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.000> how<00:00:57.240> I<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.450> of<00:00:57.570> demo<00:00:57.840> of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
awesome so that's how I kind of demo of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.530 
awesome so that's how I kind of demo of
what<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.530> should<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.830> trying<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> achieve<00:00:59.610> come

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
what we should be trying to achieve come

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.360 
what we should be trying to achieve come
on<00:01:00.660> false<00:01:00.900> actually<00:01:01.410> happen<00:01:01.740> and<00:01:01.890> people<00:01:02.160> do

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
on false actually happen and people do

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.490 
on false actually happen and people do
is<00:01:02.550> they'll<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.360> wobble<00:01:03.810> especially<00:01:04.410> on

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
is they'll have a wobble especially on

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.560 
is they'll have a wobble especially on
the<00:01:04.620> rear<00:01:04.830> ski<00:01:05.160> which<00:01:05.880> tends<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.300> indicate

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the rear ski which tends to indicate

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
the rear ski which tends to indicate
that<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.140> enough<00:01:07.350> weight<00:01:07.560> pressure

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that there's not enough weight pressure

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.590 
that there's not enough weight pressure
on<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.370> so<00:01:08.520> we're<00:01:08.670> looking<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.030> equal<00:01:09.390> weight

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
on it so we're looking for equal weight

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.780 
on it so we're looking for equal weight
and<00:01:09.810> pressure<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.260> both<00:01:10.530> skis<00:01:10.800> they<00:01:11.370> get<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> bit

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and pressure on both skis they get a bit

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.310 
and pressure on both skis they get a bit
of<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.940> wobble<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.360> back<00:01:12.510> foot<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:13.170> need

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
of a wobble on the back foot just need

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
of a wobble on the back foot just need
to<00:01:13.410> apply<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> bit<00:01:14.250> more<00:01:14.430> pressure<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> ski

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
to apply a bit more pressure as a ski

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.970 
to apply a bit more pressure as a ski
goes<00:01:15.540> backwards<00:01:16.080> okay

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.090 

you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.250 

another<00:01:30.090> common<00:01:30.450> problem<00:01:30.480> to<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.960> people

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
another common problem to get people

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.620 
another common problem to get people
step<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.770> or<00:01:31.920> sequential<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.330> instead<00:01:33.510> of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
step in or sequential and so instead of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.990 
step in or sequential and so instead of
doing<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.930> smooth<00:01:34.409> movement<00:01:35.100> they're<00:01:35.700> actually

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
doing a smooth movement they're actually

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.340 
doing a smooth movement they're actually
just<00:01:36.030> stepping

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.950 

you

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.930 

they're<00:01:48.590> coming<00:01:48.890> from<00:01:49.010> other<00:01:49.250> people<00:01:49.580> those

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
they're coming from other people those

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.870 
they're coming from other people those
staff<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.420> do<00:01:50.540> also<00:01:51.050> just<00:01:51.320> grouch<00:01:52.010> amounts<00:01:52.460> max

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
staff to do also just grouch amounts max

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.120 
staff to do also just grouch amounts max
walking<00:01:53.360> which<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:53.720> just<00:01:53.990> forward<00:01:54.680> back

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
walking which is just forward back

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:10.029
