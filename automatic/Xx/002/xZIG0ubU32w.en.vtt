00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
are spaces that we're calling

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.240 
are spaces that we're calling
neighborhoods<00:01:17.729> what<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.830> wide

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
neighborhoods what that is is a wide

those teachers can work together to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.219 
those teachers can work together to
integrate<00:01:38.820> learning<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:40.020> bring

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
integrate learning and they can bring

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.410

that we think that it's coming up so
something<00:03:46.519> that<00:03:46.640> we<00:03:46.760> think<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:47.060> really

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
something that we think is really

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.229 
something that we think is really
important<00:03:47.900> as<00:03:48.830> we<00:03:49.040> move<00:03:49.250> through<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:50.060> other

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
important as we move through the other

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.990 
important as we move through the other

just<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.840> small<00:03:54.320> amount<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.130> bleachers<00:03:55.610> which

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
just a small amount of bleachers which

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.240 
just a small amount of bleachers which
we<00:03:56.090> think<00:03:56.269> will<00:03:56.390> be<00:03:56.600> really<00:03:56.630> helpful<00:03:57.140> as<00:03:57.470> kids

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250
