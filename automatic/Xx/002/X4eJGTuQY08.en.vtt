00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
with 90 separate nationalities I think

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.679 
with 90 separate nationalities I think
the<00:01:26.229> maximum<00:01:26.439> in<00:01:26.829> a<00:01:26.889> people<00:01:27.249> class<00:01:27.579> of<00:01:27.789> 400<00:01:28.600> is

the maximum in a people class of 400 is

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.179 
the maximum in a people class of 400 is
40<00:01:28.990> people<00:01:29.170> from<00:01:29.439> one<00:01:29.590> country<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:30.069> that's

40 people from one country and that's

as<00:02:24.500> far<00:02:24.650> as<00:02:24.709> integration<00:02:25.190> is<00:02:25.280> concerned<00:02:25.670> I

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
as far as integration is concerned I

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.600 
as far as integration is concerned I
think<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.209> first<00:02:26.420> year<00:02:26.660> study<00:02:26.930> groups<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
think is the first year study groups the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.949 
think is the first year study groups the
school<00:02:28.880> seems<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.239> make<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.390> conscious<00:02:29.840> effort

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
school seems to make a conscious effort

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.900 
school seems to make a conscious effort
to<00:02:30.140> make<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.470> an<00:02:30.530> extremely<00:02:31.010> diverse<00:02:31.250> study

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
to make it an extremely diverse study

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.789 
to make it an extremely diverse study
group<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.510> my<00:02:32.630> study<00:02:32.900> group<00:02:33.140> nobody<00:02:33.680> was

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
group so in my study group nobody was

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.949 
group so in my study group nobody was
from<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.100> same<00:02:34.220> country<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.660> think<00:02:35.720> those

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
from the same country and I think those

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.809 
from the same country and I think those
two<00:02:36.140> things<00:02:36.380> go<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.920> long<00:02:37.190> way<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.459> making<00:02:37.640> sure

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
two things go a long way in making sure

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.490 
two things go a long way in making sure
that<00:02:37.970> there's<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.330> there's<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:39.019> lot<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.260> internal

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
that there's a there's a lot of internal

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.140 
that there's a there's a lot of internal
bonding<00:02:39.950> coming<00:02:40.370> from<00:02:40.489> India<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:40.940> your

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
bonding coming from India and your

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.460 
bonding coming from India and your
professional<00:02:41.630> experience<00:02:41.690> around<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.319> world

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
professional experience around the world

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.479 
professional experience around the world
do<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.739> feel<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.069> what<00:02:43.190> you're<00:02:43.370> learning

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
do you feel that what you're learning

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.880 
do you feel that what you're learning
here<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:44.180> then<00:02:44.630> applicable<00:02:45.049> for<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.590> global

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
here is then applicable for the global

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.559 
here is then applicable for the global
economy<00:02:45.980> could<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.610> go<00:02:46.700> anywhere<00:02:47.090> would<00:02:47.480> you

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
economy could you go anywhere would you

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.199 
economy could you go anywhere would you
ever<00:02:47.690> be<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.519> think<00:02:49.519> we<00:02:49.610> could<00:02:49.760> go<00:02:49.880> anywhere

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
ever be a I think we could go anywhere

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.150 
ever be a I think we could go anywhere
and<00:02:50.599> I<00:02:50.720> think<00:02:50.900> partly<00:02:51.200> just<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.590> LDS<00:02:51.920> brand

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
and I think partly just the LDS brand

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.009 
and I think partly just the LDS brand
helps<00:02:52.459> as<00:02:52.580> well<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.510> think<00:02:53.720> what<00:02:53.900> they

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
helps as well and I think what they

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.310 
helps as well and I think what they
teach<00:02:54.230> in<00:02:54.739> today's<00:02:55.160> globalized<00:02:55.640> world<00:02:56.060> is

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
teach in today's globalized world is

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.170 
teach in today's globalized world is
extremely<00:02:57.320> useful<00:02:57.500> for<00:02:57.820> operating<00:02:58.820> anywhere

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
extremely useful for operating anywhere

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.420 
extremely useful for operating anywhere
in<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.359> world<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.690> LBS<00:03:00.590> again<00:03:00.859> because<00:03:01.250> it's

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
in the world and LBS again because it's

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.069 
in the world and LBS again because it's
more<00:03:01.579> connected<00:03:02.030> as<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.540> know<00:03:02.630> London<00:03:02.840> has<00:03:03.049> a

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
more connected as you know London has a

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.349 
more connected as you know London has a
longer<00:03:03.440> history<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:04.000> involvement<00:03:05.000> with

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
longer history of involvement with

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.150 
longer history of involvement with
Africa<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:05.780> Asia<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.140> things<00:03:06.350> like<00:03:06.470> this<00:03:06.650> so

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
Africa and Asia and things like this so

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.470 
Africa and Asia and things like this so
there's<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.370> lot<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.640> focus<00:03:07.850> on<00:03:08.060> what's<00:03:08.239> going

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
there's a lot of focus on what's going

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.910 
there's a lot of focus on what's going
on<00:03:08.600> in<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.019> BRIC<00:03:09.230> countries<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.829> the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
on in the BRIC countries in the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.259 
on in the BRIC countries in the
developing<00:03:10.340> world<00:03:10.579> in<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.790> emerging<00:03:11.120> world

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
developing world in the emerging world

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.270 
developing world in the emerging world
as<00:03:11.420> well<00:03:11.569> so<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.170> do<00:03:12.319> think<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.859> makes<00:03:13.010> you

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
as well so I do think that it makes you

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.729 
as well so I do think that it makes you
ready<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.450> go<00:03:14.569> anywhere<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.079> world<00:03:15.109> was

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
ready to go anywhere in the world was

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.050 
ready to go anywhere in the world was
there<00:03:15.890> ever<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.100> moment<00:03:16.220> when<00:03:16.549> you<00:03:16.640> thought<00:03:16.819> you

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
there ever a moment when you thought you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.559 
there ever a moment when you thought you
know<00:03:17.150> gosh<00:03:17.329> what<00:03:18.019> have<00:03:18.109> I<00:03:18.200> done<00:03:18.380> why<00:03:18.590> am<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:18.829> here

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
know gosh what have I done why am I here

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.780 
know gosh what have I done why am I here
yes<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.900> think<00:03:21.769> most<00:03:21.980> people<00:03:22.280> go<00:03:22.400> through<00:03:22.670> it

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
yes I think most people go through it

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.879 
yes I think most people go through it
for<00:03:22.819> me<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:23.540> was<00:03:23.810> near<00:03:24.139> the<00:03:24.380> middle<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.769> the

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
for me it was near the middle of the

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.559 
for me it was near the middle of the
first<00:03:25.130> year<00:03:25.370> or<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.880> end<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.209> first<00:03:26.420> year

news or rejections or some you know walk
in<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:33.950> you're<00:03:34.280> like<00:03:34.420> did<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.540> just<00:03:35.750> spend<00:03:36.049> two

in and you're like did I just spend two

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.990 
in and you're like did I just spend two
years<00:03:36.319> because<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:37.069> already<00:03:37.310> had<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.459> great<00:03:37.639> job

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
years because I already had a great job

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.699 
years because I already had a great job
I<00:03:38.150> was<00:03:38.269> already<00:03:38.480> working<00:03:38.750> why<00:03:39.380> am<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:39.650> doing

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
I was already working why am I doing

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.080 
I was already working why am I doing
this<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:40.250> think<00:03:40.370> for<00:03:40.579> me<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:40.970> was<00:03:41.060> a

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
this so I think for me that was a

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.910 
this so I think for me that was a
there's<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.870> period<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.260> two<00:03:42.410> or<00:03:42.440> three<00:03:42.680> weeks

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
there's a period of two or three weeks

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.740 
there's a period of two or three weeks
of<00:03:43.130> is<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.910> right<00:03:44.030> choice<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.540> make

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
of is this the right choice that I make

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.420 
of is this the right choice that I make
the<00:03:44.870> right<00:03:44.900> choice<00:03:45.019> but<00:03:45.829> in<00:03:45.980> hindsight<00:03:46.130> I

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
the right choice but in hindsight I

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.949 
the right choice but in hindsight I
think<00:03:46.609> it's<00:03:46.880> it's<00:03:47.120> an<00:03:47.269> absolutely<00:03:47.660> excellent

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
think it's it's an absolutely excellent

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.360 
think it's it's an absolutely excellent
choice<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.650> think<00:03:48.829> everybody<00:03:49.160> goes

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
choice and I think everybody goes

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.940 
choice and I think everybody goes
through<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:50.200> confusion<00:03:51.200> for<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.590> couple<00:03:51.889> of

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
through that confusion for a couple of

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.590 
through that confusion for a couple of
weeks<00:03:52.130> during<00:03:52.250> an<00:03:52.639> MBA<00:03:52.940> do<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:53.329> have<00:03:53.450> any

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
weeks during an MBA do you have any

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.820 
weeks during an MBA do you have any
advice<00:03:54.079> from<00:03:54.380> your<00:03:54.560> ex

advice from your ex
to<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.160> plane<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.640> school<00:03:55.880> that<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.900> you

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
to the plane to the school that that you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.230 
to the plane to the school that that you
could<00:03:57.200> share<00:03:57.470> with<00:03:57.680> potential<00:03:58.280> applicants

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240

you<00:04:02.240> know<00:04:02.360> be<00:04:02.540> honest<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:03.140> think<00:04:03.710> if<00:04:03.920> there's<00:04:04.040> a

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
you know be honest I think if there's a

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.470 
you know be honest I think if there's a
lot<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.310> pressure<00:04:04.550> when<00:04:04.820> we<00:04:04.910> are<00:04:05.000> applying<00:04:05.180> to

lot of pressure when we are applying to

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.680 
lot of pressure when we are applying to
sort<00:04:05.690> of<00:04:05.750> exaggerate<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:07.270> try<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.330> tell<00:04:08.600> the

sort of exaggerate and try to tell the
school<00:04:08.780> what<00:04:09.080> they<00:04:09.230> want<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.500> hear<00:04:09.710> which<00:04:10.010> is

school what they want to hear which is

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.740 
school what they want to hear which is
really<00:04:10.400> not<00:04:10.670> practical<00:04:11.180> at<00:04:11.270> least<00:04:11.450> as<00:04:11.570> far<00:04:11.630> as

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
really not practical at least as far as

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.780 
really not practical at least as far as
the<00:04:11.930> lbs<00:04:12.290> is<00:04:12.440> concerned<00:04:12.800> definitely<00:04:13.610> talk

the lbs is concerned definitely talk

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.520 
the lbs is concerned definitely talk
about<00:04:13.820> what<00:04:14.180> you've<00:04:14.330> done<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.690> for<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:15.410> most

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
about what you've done and for the most

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.650 
about what you've done and for the most
part<00:04:15.800> you've<00:04:15.920> probably<00:04:16.100> done<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.489> lot<00:04:16.730> and<00:04:16.970> make

part you've probably done a lot and make

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.320 
part you've probably done a lot and make
it<00:04:17.870> as<00:04:18.370> rounded<00:04:19.370> as<00:04:19.459> possible<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.060> think<00:04:20.090> one<00:04:20.299> of

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
it as rounded as possible I think one of

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.120 
it as rounded as possible I think one of
the<00:04:20.450> beauties<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.780> lbs<00:04:21.200> is<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:21.890> they're<00:04:22.010> not

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
the beauties of lbs is that they're not

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.800 
the beauties of lbs is that they're not
only<00:04:22.400> looking<00:04:22.520> at<00:04:22.880> academic<00:04:23.060> or<00:04:23.570> work

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
only looking at academic or work

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.600 
only looking at academic or work
experience<00:04:24.320> they're<00:04:24.500> also<00:04:24.890> genuinely

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
experience they're also genuinely

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.030 
experience they're also genuinely
interested<00:04:26.120> in<00:04:26.210> what<00:04:26.390> you<00:04:26.540> do<00:04:26.690> around<00:04:27.620> these

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
interested in what you do around these

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.950 
interested in what you do around these
two<00:04:28.250> aspects<00:04:28.730> of<00:04:28.820> your<00:04:28.910> personal<00:04:29.270> life<00:04:29.330> so<00:04:29.930> I

think if you could sort of encompass
that<00:04:31.370> in<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.730> entire<00:04:31.910> package<00:04:32.470> that'll

extremely<00:04:54.980> kind<00:04:55.400> when<00:04:55.580> it<00:04:55.610> comes<00:04:55.850> to<00:04:56.030> Lea

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
extremely kind when it comes to Lea

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.740 
extremely kind when it comes to Lea
tuition<00:04:57.080> payments<00:04:57.530> as<00:04:57.710> personal<00:04:58.190> experience

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
tuition payments as personal experience

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.970 
tuition payments as personal experience
and<00:04:59.750> I<00:04:59.870> think<00:04:59.900> that<00:05:00.169> there's<00:05:00.410> also<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.680> lot<00:05:00.890> of

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
and I think that there's also a lot of

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.680 
and I think that there's also a lot of
opportunity<00:05:01.610> in<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:02.000> City<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.240> London<00:05:02.419> to

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
opportunity in the City of London to

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.930 
opportunity in the City of London to
make<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> lot<00:05:03.260> of<00:05:03.290> money<00:05:03.550> one<00:05:04.550> of<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.730> things

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
make a lot of money one of the things

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.370 
make a lot of money one of the things
that<00:05:05.120> I've<00:05:05.210> noticed<00:05:05.510> is<00:05:05.630> more<00:05:05.870> secondaries

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
that I've noticed is more secondaries

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.930 
that I've noticed is more secondaries
for<00:05:06.530> example<00:05:06.860> are<00:05:06.950> doing<00:05:07.130> part-time<00:05:07.400> jobs

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
for example are doing part-time jobs

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.240 
for example are doing part-time jobs
apart<00:05:08.360> from<00:05:08.570> their<00:05:08.750> summer<00:05:08.990> internships<00:05:09.620> so

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
apart from their summer internships so

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.130 
apart from their summer internships so
if<00:05:10.400> finance<00:05:10.910> is<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.150> major<00:05:11.330> issue<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:11.810> think

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
if finance is the major issue I think

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.290 
if finance is the major issue I think
that<00:05:12.290> there<00:05:12.470> are<00:05:12.550> multiple<00:05:13.550> avenues<00:05:13.669> to

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
that there are multiple avenues to

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.530 
that there are multiple avenues to
reduce<00:05:15.110> that<00:05:15.530> pain<00:05:15.950> if<00:05:16.220> not<00:05:16.430> eliminate<00:05:17.060> itself

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
reduce that pain if not eliminate itself

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.600 
reduce that pain if not eliminate itself
