hello my name is iris I'm 29 years old

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.440 
hello my name is iris I'm 29 years old
and<00:00:36.890> I<00:00:37.130> am<00:00:37.160> from<00:00:37.550> Mexico

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
and I am from Mexico

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.600 
and I am from Mexico
I<00:00:38.480> think<00:00:39.020> Vancouver<00:00:39.440> is<00:00:39.560> so<00:00:39.740> very<00:00:40.040> special

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
I think Vancouver is so very special

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.790 
I think Vancouver is so very special
because<00:00:40.880> I<00:00:41.330> have<00:00:41.600> never<00:00:41.870> seen<00:00:42.230> another<00:00:42.500> place

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
because I have never seen another place

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.970 
because I have never seen another place
where<00:00:43.220> city<00:00:44.000> life<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:44.630> nature<00:00:44.960> is<00:00:45.380> so<00:00:45.710> close

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
where city life and nature is so close

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.720 
where city life and nature is so close
to<00:00:46.010> each<00:00:46.220> other

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
to each other

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.020 
to each other
I<00:00:50.440> think<00:00:51.440> Kaplan<00:00:51.770> has<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.160> base<00:00:52.370> location<00:00:52.910> in

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
I think Kaplan has the base location in

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.820 
I think Kaplan has the base location in
Vancouver<00:00:53.450> because<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:53.960> writing<00:00:54.230> downtown

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
Vancouver because it's writing downtown

Vancouver because it's writing downtown
and<00:00:55.340> it's<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:55.640> close<00:00:55.970> to<00:00:56.000> all<00:00:56.450> the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
and it's so close to all the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.900
