00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.150 
well look at that I wasn't paying any
attention<00:02:53.390> put<00:02:54.110> my<00:02:54.260> foot<00:02:54.470> down<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.680> bit<00:02:54.920> and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
attention put my foot down a bit and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.530 
attention put my foot down a bit and
we're<00:02:55.400> doing<00:02:55.490> three<00:02:55.850> thousand<00:02:56.270> six<00:02:56.390> hundred

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.540 

let's<00:03:24.940> see<00:03:25.150> how<00:03:25.420> agile<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:26.110> is<00:03:26.400> before<00:03:27.400> but

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
let's see how agile it is before but

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.339 
let's see how agile it is before but
then<00:03:27.700> degraded<00:03:27.819> people<00:03:28.480> sometimes<00:03:28.930> on<00:03:29.140> boats

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
then degraded people sometimes on boats

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.960 
then degraded people sometimes on boats
this<00:03:29.590> small<00:03:29.860> there's<00:03:30.069> a<00:03:30.130> big<00:03:30.340> difference<00:03:30.760> in

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
this small there's a big difference in

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.280 
this small there's a big difference in
turning<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.630> left<00:03:31.780> or<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.170> right

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
turning to the left or the right

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.170 
turning to the left or the right
depending<00:03:32.830> on<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.340> way<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.640> propellers<00:03:34.060> are

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
depending on the way the propellers are

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.960 
depending on the way the propellers are
rotating

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
rotating

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.339 
rotating
incidentally<00:03:36.970> it's<00:03:37.330> always<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.140> right

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
incidentally it's always to the right

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.870 
incidentally it's always to the right
when<00:03:38.709> there's<00:03:38.920> just<00:03:38.980> one<00:03:39.400> engine

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
when there's just one engine

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.520 
when there's just one engine
so<00:03:40.090> tends<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.510> keep<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.750> boat<00:03:40.930> going<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:41.410> one

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
so tends to keep the boat going in one

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.559 
so tends to keep the boat going in one
direction<00:03:41.739> but<00:03:42.489> also<00:03:42.640> makes<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.120> difficult<00:03:43.300> to

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
direction but also makes it difficult to

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:51.509 
direction but also makes it difficult to
turn<00:03:43.810> back<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:50.380> don't<00:03:50.709> get<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:51.010> feeling<00:03:51.190> here

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
turn back I don't get that feeling here

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.530 
turn back I don't get that feeling here
though<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:52.330> rudder<00:03:52.569> is<00:03:52.810> always<00:03:53.260> easy

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
though the rudder is always easy

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.729 
though the rudder is always easy
probably<00:03:55.540> because<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.959> balance<00:03:56.319> they<00:03:56.470> found

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
probably because the balance they found

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.500 
probably because the balance they found
between<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.130> hull<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.730> tubeless<00:03:58.150> is

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
between the hull and the tubeless is

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.120 
between the hull and the tubeless is
ideal

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.790 

well<00:04:02.880> if<00:04:03.060> it's<00:04:03.210> balanced<00:04:03.570> why<00:04:04.230> not<00:04:04.410> push<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.680> to

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
well if it's balanced why not push it to

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.880 
well if it's balanced why not push it to
the<00:04:04.830> max

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
the max

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.280 
the max

honey<00:04:27.870> what<00:04:28.800> don't<00:04:29.010> thought<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.730> like<00:04:30.360> this

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
honey what don't thought it I like this

23 knots so I think we can say you can

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.610 
23 knots so I think we can say you can
have<00:04:37.710> fun<00:04:38.010> even<00:04:38.340> without<00:04:38.640> a<00:04:38.820> boat<00:04:39.090> license

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620

consume much petrol how much are here

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.230 
consume much petrol how much are here
you<00:04:45.390> ask<00:04:46.070> well<00:04:47.070> if<00:04:47.310> you're<00:04:47.460> good<00:04:47.700> with<00:04:47.850> petrol

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
you ask well if you're good with petrol

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.960 
you ask well if you're good with petrol
and<00:04:48.420> trim<00:04:48.600> balance<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:50.220> can<00:04:50.370> even<00:04:50.520> get<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:50.850> up

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
and trim balance you can even get it up

00:04:50.970 --> 00:05:00.939
