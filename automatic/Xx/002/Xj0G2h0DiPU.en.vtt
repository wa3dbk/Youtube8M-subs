00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
very important to kind of spread the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.550 
very important to kind of spread the
word<00:00:13.980> about<00:00:14.360> bellybutton<00:00:15.360> hygiene<00:00:16.109> because

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
word about bellybutton hygiene because

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.760 
word about bellybutton hygiene because
not<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> lot<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.730> people<00:00:18.119> really<00:00:18.900> give<00:00:19.650> it

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
not a lot of people really give it

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.849 
not a lot of people really give it
importance<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:21.119> kind<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.859> something

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
importance and it's kind of something

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.700 
importance and it's kind of something
that<00:00:23.300> we<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.330> don't<00:00:24.600> really<00:00:24.900> care<00:00:25.590> about

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that we just don't really care about

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.400 
that we just don't really care about
because<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.760> don't<00:00:27.750> know<00:00:27.810> our<00:00:27.930> belly<00:00:28.080> buttons

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
because I don't know our belly buttons

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.279 
because I don't know our belly buttons
are<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.740> out<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> way<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> guess<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:31.170> never

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
are so out of the way I guess we never

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.830 
are so out of the way I guess we never
really<00:00:31.920> use<00:00:32.130> them<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.460> anything<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.780> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
really use them for anything and so I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.020 
really use them for anything and so I
guess<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.469> forget<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:35.010> they<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.579> get

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
guess we can forget that they do get

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.330 
guess we can forget that they do get
dirty<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.710> important<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.160> clean

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
dirty and that it is important to clean

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.680 
dirty and that it is important to clean
them<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.700> any<00:00:38.940> other<00:00:39.180> part<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.510> your<00:00:39.570> body

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
them like any other part of your body

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.860 
them like any other part of your body
typically<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.680> type<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> video<00:00:41.750> shows<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
typically this type of video shows the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.299 
typically this type of video shows the
person<00:00:43.079> cleaning<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.710> their<00:00:43.829> belly<00:00:44.010> button

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
person cleaning out their belly button

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.160 
person cleaning out their belly button
but<00:00:44.940> I'm<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.899> just

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
but I'm not going to do that just

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.979 
but I'm not going to do that just
because<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:47.190> any<00:00:47.730> months<00:00:48.030> pregnant<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> so

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
because I'm any months pregnant and so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.110 
because I'm any months pregnant and so
the<00:00:49.620> belly<00:00:49.800> button<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.430> right<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.850> an

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.389 
the belly button I have right now is an
Audi<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.840> there's<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.649> no<00:00:52.890> point<00:00:53.100> in

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
Audi and there's really no point in

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.209 
Audi and there's really no point in
going<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.899> clean<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.710> belly

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
everybody does and that pretty much does

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.399 
everybody does and that pretty much does
it<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.610> cleaning<00:01:08.610> your<00:01:08.760> belly<00:01:08.939> button<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.930> if

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
you do have a deeper belly button then

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.929 
you do have a deeper belly button then
it's<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.560> lot<00:01:16.680> more<00:01:16.890> important<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.729> pay

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
it's a lot more important for you to pay

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.940 
it's a lot more important for you to pay
attention<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.310> cleaned<00:01:20.549> up

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.080 
do this I guess what people will usually
think<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.909> getting<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.659> q-tip<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
think of is getting like a q-tip and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.940 
think of is getting like a q-tip and
basically<00:02:03.090> soaking<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
basically soaking it in you can do a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.219 
basically soaking it in you can do a
hydrogen<00:02:05.880> peroxide<00:02:06.030> alcohol<00:02:06.960> soap<00:02:09.229> something

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
hydrogen peroxide alcohol soap something

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.140 
hydrogen peroxide alcohol soap something
like<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.660> just<00:02:12.660> pretty<00:02:12.900> much

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
like that and just just pretty much

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.550 
like that and just just pretty much
put<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.330> your<00:02:15.420> belly<00:02:15.569> button<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.200> then<00:02:16.319> go

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
put it in your belly button and then go

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.869 
put it in your belly button and then go
around<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.670> get<00:02:17.849> all<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:19.200> parts<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.799> but<00:02:20.459> be

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
around to get all the parts of it but be

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.479 
around to get all the parts of it but be
very<00:02:21.120> gentle<00:02:21.599> don't<00:02:21.989> like<00:02:22.680> scrub<00:02:23.040> hard<00:02:23.340> or

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
attention to it it builds bacteria

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.660 
attention to it it builds bacteria
bacteria<00:02:45.390> thrives<00:02:46.049> in<00:02:46.489> dark<00:02:47.489> moist<00:02:48.359> or<00:02:48.959> humid

bacteria thrives in dark moist or humid

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.470 
bacteria thrives in dark moist or humid
areas<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.140> lot<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.709> case<00:02:52.950> for

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
areas and that is a lot of the case for

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.030 
areas and that is a lot of the case for
people's<00:02:54.480> belly<00:02:54.660> buttons<00:02:54.989> because<00:02:55.410> they'll

go ahead and shower they won't they

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.080 
go ahead and shower they won't they
typically<00:03:00.540> won't<00:03:00.959> actually<00:03:01.590> clean<00:03:02.340> out<00:03:02.640> their

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
soap run down and just leave it like

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.860 
soap run down and just leave it like
that<00:03:07.500> but<00:03:07.829> they'll<00:03:07.980> take<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.220> shower<00:03:08.870> they'll

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
there's less chances for bacteria to

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.970 
there's less chances for bacteria to
survive<00:03:50.849> in<00:03:51.180> there<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:52.549> this<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:54.980> especially
