smooth and soft so let's get started the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.560 
smooth and soft so let's get started the
first<00:00:41.270> step<00:00:41.810> is<00:00:42.080> to<00:00:42.280> file<00:00:43.280> your<00:00:43.310> nails<00:00:43.790> the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
first step is to file your nails the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
best way to file your nails is to file

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.850 
best way to file your nails is to file
them<00:00:46.610> in<00:00:46.790> one<00:00:47.090> direction<00:00:47.300> instead<00:00:47.990> of<00:00:48.440> going

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
them in one direction instead of going

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.970 
them in one direction instead of going
both<00:00:49.250> ways<00:00:49.280> I<00:00:49.850> like<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.990> file<00:00:51.200> them<00:00:51.380> in<00:00:51.590> a<00:00:51.710> kind

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
both ways I like to file them in a kind

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.060 
both ways I like to file them in a kind
of<00:00:52.040> school<00:00:52.400> vil<00:00:52.640> form<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:53.720> it's<00:00:54.200> kind<00:00:54.530> of<00:00:54.620> round

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
of school vil form so it's kind of round

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.220 
of school vil form so it's kind of round
and<00:00:55.490> square<00:00:55.910> at<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.390> same<00:00:56.600> time<00:00:56.810> so<00:00:57.079> that's

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
and square at the same time so that's

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.880 
and square at the same time so that's
why<00:00:57.380> I<00:00:57.410> call<00:00:57.650> it<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.829> scoville<00:00:59.590> keep<00:01:00.590> filing

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
why I call it a scoville keep filing

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.920 
why I call it a scoville keep filing
them<00:01:01.190> until<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:01.850> get<00:01:02.030> your<00:01:02.210> desired<00:01:02.270> nail

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
them until you get your desired nail

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.469 
them until you get your desired nail
shape<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.470> length<00:01:03.800> and<00:01:04.189> then<00:01:04.640> we<00:01:04.970> move<00:01:05.150> on<00:01:05.299> to

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
shape and length and then we move on to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.130 
shape and length and then we move on to
the<00:01:05.600> next<00:01:05.630> step

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.350 

once<00:01:09.070> you're<00:01:09.250> done<00:01:09.370> filing<00:01:09.880> we're<00:01:10.090> going<00:01:10.270> to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
once you're done filing we're going to

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.270 
once you're done filing we're going to
start<00:01:10.540> buffing<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.380> nail<00:01:11.620> buffer<00:01:11.830> i<00:01:12.010> have

here<00:01:12.550> has<00:01:12.729> three<00:01:13.090> different<00:01:13.240> steps<00:01:13.720> you<00:01:14.260> have

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
here has three different steps you have

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.800 
here has three different steps you have
the<00:01:14.620> blue<00:01:14.800> side<00:01:15.070> which<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.880> much<00:01:16.150> coarser

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
the blue side which is a much coarser

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.469 
the blue side which is a much coarser
kind<00:01:17.050> of<00:01:17.140> buff<00:01:17.409> and<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:18.220> really<00:01:18.550> gets<00:01:19.150> rid<00:01:19.390> of

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
kind of buff and it really gets rid of

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:28.620 
kind of buff and it really gets rid of
the<00:01:20.070> ridges<00:01:21.070> on<00:01:21.280> your<00:01:21.430> nail

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.230 

then<00:01:29.409> you<00:01:29.530> have<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.860> gray<00:01:30.100> side<00:01:30.399> which<00:01:30.939> is

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
then you have the gray side which is

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.929 
then you have the gray side which is
slightly<00:01:32.049> smoother<00:01:32.920> this<00:01:33.100> really<00:01:33.399> smooths

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
slightly smoother this really smooths

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:48.030 
slightly smoother this really smooths
out<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:35.490> dry<00:01:36.490> nail<00:01:36.909> that<00:01:37.360> we<00:01:37.450> just<00:01:37.600> buffed<00:01:38.020> off
