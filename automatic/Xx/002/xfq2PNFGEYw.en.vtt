below I have a regular screen protector

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.830 
below I have a regular screen protector
on<00:03:57.250> mine<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:57.820> doesn't<00:03:58.150> affect<00:03:58.540> too<00:03:58.660> much

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
on mine so it doesn't affect too much

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.080 
on mine so it doesn't affect too much
but<00:03:59.049> if<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.290> have<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.440> tempered<00:03:59.860> glass<00:04:00.090> since

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.740 
but if you have a tempered glass since
it<00:04:01.299> is<00:04:01.329> adding<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:02.170> little<00:04:02.320> bit<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:03.750> thickness

it is adding a little bit of thickness

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.050 
it is adding a little bit of thickness
to<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.220> because<00:04:06.220> there's<00:04:06.370> not<00:04:06.489> much<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.850> gap

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.789 
to it because there's not much of a gap
you<00:04:07.209> might<00:04:07.390> have<00:04:07.510> an<00:04:07.630> issue<00:04:07.780> but<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.560> can<00:04:08.680> take

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
you might have an issue but you can take

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.380 
you might have an issue but you can take
off<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.130> plastic<00:04:09.250> but<00:04:09.790> then<00:04:09.940> that<00:04:10.180> will

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
off the plastic but then that will

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.800 
off the plastic but then that will
remove<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.280> water<00:04:12.280> resistance<00:04:13.000> from<00:04:13.510> any

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
remove the water resistance from any

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.660 
remove the water resistance from any
like<00:04:14.049> little<00:04:14.440> drops<00:04:14.769> or<00:04:15.130> if<00:04:15.220> you're<00:04:15.340> outside

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
like little drops or if you're outside

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.719 
like little drops or if you're outside
when<00:04:16.180> it's<00:04:16.329> raining<00:04:16.540> etc<00:04:17.140> so<00:04:17.709> don't<00:04:18.609> confuse

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
when it's raining etc so don't confuse

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.659 
when it's raining etc so don't confuse
it<00:04:19.060> with<00:04:19.090> water<00:04:19.840> proof<00:04:20.709> just<00:04:21.070> keep<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.519> in

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
it with water proof just keep that in

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.950 
it with water proof just keep that in
mind<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.030> then<00:04:22.510> you're<00:04:22.599> going<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.750> go<00:04:22.870> ahead

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
mind and then you're going to go ahead

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.719 
mind and then you're going to go ahead
and<00:04:23.140> put<00:04:23.320> this<00:04:23.440> inside<00:04:23.919> either<00:04:24.220> way<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.520> can

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
and put this inside either way you can

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.790 
and put this inside either way you can
put<00:04:24.910> it<00:04:25.030> down<00:04:25.660> like<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.169> in<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:27.430> clip<00:04:27.990> or<00:04:28.990> you

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
put it down like so in the clip or you

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.290 
put it down like so in the clip or you
can<00:04:29.950> take<00:04:30.099> it<00:04:30.220> out<00:04:31.260> rotate<00:04:32.260> it<00:04:32.640> either<00:04:33.640> way<00:04:34.000> I

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
can take it out rotate it either way I

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.670 
can take it out rotate it either way I
don't<00:04:34.750> know<00:04:34.810> if<00:04:34.870> you<00:04:34.930> can<00:04:35.020> put<00:04:35.169> a<00:04:35.200> face<00:04:35.410> first

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
don't know if you can put a face first

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.500 
don't know if you can put a face first
let's<00:04:35.890> try<00:04:36.070> that<00:04:36.220> scale<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:36.789> looks<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.240> don't

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
let's try that scale that looks I don't

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.380 
let's try that scale that looks I don't
know<00:04:37.599> why<00:04:37.660> anybody<00:04:37.930> would<00:04:38.169> want<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.440> do<00:04:38.530> this

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
know why anybody would want to do this

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.000 
know why anybody would want to do this
yeah<00:04:40.390> it's<00:04:40.630> not<00:04:40.780> going<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.080> let<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:41.740> that's

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
yeah it's not going to let you so that's

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.790 
yeah it's not going to let you so that's
good<00:04:42.220> is<00:04:43.090> it<00:04:43.360> because<00:04:43.990> it's<00:04:44.260> molded<00:04:44.680> and

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
good is it because it's molded and

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.560 
good is it because it's molded and
contoured<00:04:45.310> here<00:04:45.550> if<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:45.880> can<00:04:46.060> see<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.390> little

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
contoured here if you can see the little

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.320 
contoured here if you can see the little
mold<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:47.979> it<00:04:48.099> just<00:04:48.130> goes<00:04:48.400> in<00:04:48.640> there<00:04:48.849> so<00:04:49.150> that's

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
mold so it just goes in there so that's

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.860 
mold so it just goes in there so that's
really<00:04:49.450> good<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.930> then<00:04:50.440> again<00:04:50.979> you<00:04:51.550> have

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
really good and then again you have

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.930 
really good and then again you have
enough<00:04:52.870> space<00:04:52.900> for<00:04:53.890> your<00:04:54.010> dimple<00:04:54.430> here<00:04:54.729> and

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
enough space for your dimple here and

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.870 
enough space for your dimple here and
then<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.840> back<00:04:56.020> of<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.229> case<00:04:56.610> overall<00:04:57.610> a

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
then the back of the case overall a

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.260 
then the back of the case overall a
really<00:04:58.120> nice<00:04:58.390> case<00:04:58.720> extra<00:04:59.410> protection<00:05:00.090> if<00:05:01.090> you

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
really nice case extra protection if you

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.029 
really nice case extra protection if you
want<00:05:01.450> something<00:05:01.660> like<00:05:01.900> an<00:05:02.020> otterbox<00:05:02.530> since

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
want something like an otterbox since

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.740 
want something like an otterbox since
they're<00:05:03.190> not<00:05:03.310> making<00:05:03.520> it<00:05:03.729> I'd<00:05:04.000> go<00:05:04.300> with<00:05:04.479> the

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
they're not making it I'd go with the

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.260 
they're not making it I'd go with the
unicorn<00:05:05.470> beetle<00:05:05.979> pro<00:05:06.250> because<00:05:06.789> it's<00:05:07.090> going<00:05:07.180> to

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
unicorn beetle pro because it's going to

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.600 
unicorn beetle pro because it's going to
protect<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.690> device<00:05:08.010> front<00:05:09.010> back<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:09.490> then

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
protect the device front back and then

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.399 
protect the device front back and then
you<00:05:09.700> have<00:05:09.820> a<00:05:09.849> clip<00:05:10.150> this<00:05:10.630> is<00:05:10.810> a<00:05:10.840> little<00:05:11.110> bit<00:05:11.289> of

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
you have a clip this is a little bit of

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.050 
you have a clip this is a little bit of
hard<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.680> rotate<00:05:12.099> but<00:05:12.520> it's<00:05:12.640> not<00:05:12.820> too

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
hard to rotate but it's not too

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.029 
hard to rotate but it's not too
difficult<00:05:13.320> so<00:05:14.320> if<00:05:14.500> you're<00:05:14.650> one<00:05:14.800> of<00:05:14.830> those

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
difficult so if you're one of those

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.730 
difficult so if you're one of those
hard-working<00:05:15.570> people<00:05:16.570> that<00:05:17.320> will<00:05:17.530> need<00:05:17.710> a

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
hard-working people that will need a

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.520 
hard-working people that will need a
belt<00:05:18.010> clip<00:05:18.210> go<00:05:19.210> ahead<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:19.390> get<00:05:19.539> this<00:05:19.780> this

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
belt clip go ahead and get this this

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.710 
belt clip go ahead and get this this
doesn't<00:05:20.830> have<00:05:21.039> the<00:05:21.400> kickstand<00:05:21.970> like<00:05:22.539> the

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
doesn't have the kickstand like the

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.430 
doesn't have the kickstand like the
other<00:05:22.840> cases<00:05:23.140> like<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:24.159> otterbox<00:05:25.140> I've<00:05:26.140> tried

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
other cases like the otterbox I've tried

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.969 
other cases like the otterbox I've tried
but<00:05:27.010> it<00:05:27.130> doesn't<00:05:27.460> link<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.090> anything<00:05:28.979> but

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
but it doesn't link to anything but

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.010 
but it doesn't link to anything but
that's<00:05:30.370> about<00:05:30.580> it<00:05:30.640> if<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.419> like<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.750> video
