00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
got to see that would have been really

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.040 
got to see that would have been really
interesting<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:53.480> for<00:05:54.480> me<00:05:54.570> it<00:05:54.870> would<00:05:54.960> have

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
interesting and for me it would have

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.770 
interesting and for me it would have
been<00:05:55.170> like<00:05:55.920> don't<00:05:56.550> assign<00:05:56.880> a<00:05:57.120> lot<00:05:57.330> Goku<00:05:57.630> not

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
boku Vegeta vs. piccolo I think that

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.000 
boku Vegeta vs. piccolo I think that
would<00:06:00.480> been<00:06:00.660> brilliant<00:06:01.170> because<00:06:01.590> you<00:06:01.740> know

would been brilliant because you know

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.760 
would been brilliant because you know
maybe<00:06:02.910> around<00:06:03.150> like<00:06:03.600> the<00:06:03.720> cell<00:06:04.020> salver<00:06:04.590> arc

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
maybe around like the cell salver arc

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.430 
maybe around like the cell salver arc
when<00:06:05.330> when<00:06:06.330> Vegeta<00:06:06.720> just<00:06:06.960> becomes<00:06:07.200> super

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
when when Vegeta just becomes super

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.050 
when when Vegeta just becomes super
saiyan<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:07.860> like<00:06:07.950> piccolo<00:06:08.460> would<00:06:08.640> you<00:06:08.970> know

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
saiyan and like piccolo would you know

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.120 
saiyan and like piccolo would you know
become<00:06:09.450> dynamic<00:06:10.020> and<00:06:10.440> was<00:06:10.590> more<00:06:10.770> powerful

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
become dynamic and was more powerful

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.040
