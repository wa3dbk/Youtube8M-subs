00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.460
 the last pause with the equipment issue 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.349
 this that a collective network of 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.060
 links I kept thinking now what 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.190
 I 'm talking about how much I talked about 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.510
 teams but with few good leaders 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.860
 I see that he knows normal equipment not what 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.230
 difficult this to have to build 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.560
 equipment and pass the intelligence 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.320
 individual to the collective move from doing 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.050
 just to think more systemically mind power 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.720
 position yourself from the balcony and sometimes 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.810
 be near and sometimes far an art not 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.880
 totally and this style not when 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.100
 be more authoritarian because things 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.050
 are in crisis when accompanied by leaving 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.940
 that others do this of I have seen 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.530
 a lot of fail for being mono style 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.479
 growing that apply a style to all 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.150
 the situations and that's why they go and I see them 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.940
 skid very badly 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.520
 the large percentage of skids as 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.960
 you call it or the derailments of the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.150
 leaders have to see by having chosen 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.490
 bad style look at this topic that we 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.190
 we call the seesaw to decide what 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.010
 style you should use according to the level 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.780
 of maturity of the group or team and the level 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.540
 let's say criticality of the situation 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.180
 different, not because if you grab and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.410
 you say good I have very senior people and 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.570
 I want to centralize all the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.120
 decisions generates that stimulus and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.160
 reverse upside down also clear now you 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.320
 I heard dingo sees many leaders who 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.880
 that will take time for the ball to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.250
 know your team for that to know what 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.140
 type of maturity do you have your team 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.729
 Estevo work you need this time to 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.880
 know each one if you do not have time 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.770
 to be with your children our parents 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.750
 if you do not have time to be with your 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.550
 girlfriend are not boyfriends if you do not have time 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.550
 to meet your people I'm not a leader 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.880
 to all this well business people 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.340
 our customers but again our 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.930
 dear don jose dona rosa because they 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.110
 you have to import your equipment system 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.230
 I have no doubt that Don Jose and 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.870
 DoÃ±a Rosa can tell you and advise you with 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.590
 your own experience and tell your 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.140
 children to the nephew to the son of the friend 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.550
 Be careful and be very careful with the subject 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.930
 of the team that belongs is because in 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.880
 any time you're going to have to 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.010
 lead but causally if they are not 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.500
 lawyers is not an accountant is not an engineer 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.630
 here is where the theme comes from that if you 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.880
 you want to keep working 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.440
 the more professionally you have better 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.530
 to become a good person because if 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.300
 you do not lead another grace - in the 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.790
 education that other grandparents gave us 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.220
 parent mentors we go back to the usual 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.930
 this is not being a good person and getting to know each other 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.850
 self importance you have not 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.830
 only that but to realize that 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.650
 besides that knowledge of yourself 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.049
 the best attitude to be able to lead or 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.200
 belong to a team is the service 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.820
 that's why that vocation of service that 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.990
 internal call that the vocation of 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.480
 service passes 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.820
 this is what I see if he wants to be what 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.990
 contrary everything in everyday reality 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.200
 this question that there are people who arrive 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.720
 He charges and puts the charge above 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.400
 him so that from that charge to the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.260
 leadership was linked only 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.780
 with charge many good leaders who 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.120
 we would have things that does not exist that is 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.730
 which is independent of carbon has 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.280
 he may be better or worse leader and the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.800
 background that vocation of service 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.080
 brings from home has to do with 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.490
 values with family culture and 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.780
 then just with what one can 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.780
 manifest in organizations 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.219
 let's see this car says that if one 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.079
 I had to apply even for something 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:05.019
 useful of imagination would be to write 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.030
 in the sky the word tremendous service 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.549
 concept that has turned cases 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.409
 in whole or entire companies not 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.780
 says the case that touched us months ago 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.389
 back not in mexico I remember is the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.919
 leader that good came with his little book that 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.259
 it ends up good culture team that does not 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.970
 I know demanding business and I come with 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.160
 hard culture and applying with style 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.599
 authoritarian nobody was listening 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.090
 totally divorced his team 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.889
 bounced as a basketball driver had him 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.810
 than to give the file not two quarters with 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.699
 totally negative results a climate 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.320
 Wednesday work until he left 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.330
 giving account learned from the pain and 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.220
 clearly following a process of 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.630
 accompaniment with people who 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.880
 we can see we had that cute 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.650
 privilege this change things always 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.889
 we stretched and it changed so that the thing 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.430
 it will work 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.620
 I met his team walked to the plant 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.780
 it showed more to less but in a way 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.550
 genuine it was a bit out of that of that 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.189
 barracks that sometimes you put on 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.659
 within his office his office closed 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:03.150
 to know people to be vulnerable 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.219
 be open learning to know a 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.650
 little more the territory was just that if 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.999
 you tell me to choose a family that 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.009
 I liked the most when he learned to 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:14.159
 handle the optimal distance when he could 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.560
 understand let's say this I see this 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.150
 organizational development this 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.210
 team development that is going to be 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.219
 between not being so close that it seemed like 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.650
 cousin of the people and was up 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:27.900
 susceptible when it was linked and so 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.849
 distant and so distant that people do not 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.909
 I considered because I did not feel part 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:35.969
 because I did not have it in photo sd or that 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:38.159
 that dance back and forth was amazing 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.930
 I share being percent this 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.939
 when the leader ends up placing that 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.620
 be in a hierarchy like the one we 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:46.020
 often drives the military style 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.460
 be so hierarchical and think more than 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.680
 we are part of a network and I am a 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.300
 collaborator who enters and I agree 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.710
 what my team needs this to be 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.170
 complementary as a leader 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.120
 It is formidable but it always sounds but 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.500
 how difficult to implement it in the 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.830
 gossip the hierarchical is in the 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.040
 nature but the arkia network is what 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.410
 comes and that is a nice topic of the network 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.180
 arqui as institutional organizations 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.910
 is that exquisite framework that is being 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.000
 giving but what part of the leader 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.440
 have a good link with yourself and 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.540
 with his team and we always return 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.020
 same so we leave it for the next 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.020
 pause that
