00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
at any time and look at it from any

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.680 
at any time and look at it from any
angle<00:01:37.520> not<00:01:38.520> quite<00:01:38.790> sure<00:01:38.820> how<00:01:39.300> did<00:01:39.600> they

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
angle not quite sure how did they

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.969 
angle not quite sure how did they
actually<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.170> flag<00:01:40.440> out<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> our<00:01:40.830> base

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
actually get the flag out of our base

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.499 
actually get the flag out of our base
when<00:01:41.310> we're<00:01:41.490> supposedly<00:01:41.790> had<00:01:42.090> three<00:01:42.330> guys

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
when we're supposedly had three guys

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.999 
when we're supposedly had three guys
guarding<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.050> now<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.619> easy<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:43.979> back

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
guarding it now it's easy to go back

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.859 
guarding it now it's easy to go back
watch<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.430> film<00:01:44.850> see<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.300> they<00:01:45.420> did<00:01:47.869> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
watch the film see what they did the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.620 
watch the film see what they did the
controls<00:01:49.290> basically<00:01:50.130> work<00:01:50.460> exactly<00:01:50.970> how<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
controls basically work exactly how you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.990 
controls basically work exactly how you
would<00:01:51.869> expect<00:01:52.229> them<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.700> simple

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
would expect them to it's so simple

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.090 
would expect them to it's so simple
conceptually<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:54.930> making<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.320> reality<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
conceptually but making it a reality it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.480 
conceptually but making it a reality it
took<00:01:56.280> years

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
took years

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.980 
took years
your<00:01:59.490> first<00:01:59.729> person<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.450> click<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> right

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
your first person if you click the right

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.770 
your first person if you click the right
stick<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.560> shows<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.210> person<00:02:03.630> was

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
stick it shows you what that person was

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.959 
stick it shows you what that person was
looking<00:02:04.140> at<00:02:04.289> from<00:02:04.530> third<00:02:04.770> person<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.850> other

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
looking at from third person the other

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.639 
looking at from third person the other
option<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.539> have<00:02:06.570> while<00:02:07.110> you're<00:02:07.259> following

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
option you have while you're following

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.820 
option you have while you're following
someone<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.979> third<00:02:08.160> person<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.959> break<00:02:10.560> out

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
someone in third person is to break out

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.880 
someone in third person is to break out
into<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.310> orbiting<00:02:12.030> camp<00:02:12.269> so<00:02:12.690> any<00:02:13.050> time<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.709> hit

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
into a orbiting camp so any time you hit

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.979 
into a orbiting camp so any time you hit
the<00:02:14.040> right<00:02:14.220> stick<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.910> automatically<00:02:15.630> move

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
the right stick you automatically move

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.630 
the right stick you automatically move
out<00:02:16.260> into<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.680> orbiting<00:02:17.160> camera<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.580> you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
out into this orbiting camera and you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.660 
out into this orbiting camera and you
can<00:02:17.819> zoom<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.110> out<00:02:19.290> I'll<00:02:19.680> say<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.370> did

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
can zoom in and out I'll say it I did

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.699 
can zoom in and out I'll say it I did
not<00:02:20.880> know<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.540> world<00:02:21.780> actually<00:02:22.470> had

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
not know that the world actually had

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.830 
not know that the world actually had
like<00:02:22.980> an<00:02:23.099> internal<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:23.790> dash<00:02:24.180> lights<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
like an internal like dash lights and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.839 
like an internal like dash lights and
crap<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:26.160> like<00:02:26.280> I'm<00:02:26.430> flying<00:02:26.640> around

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
crap and so then like I'm flying around

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.850 
crap and so then like I'm flying around
I'm<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.030> wait<00:02:27.450> what<00:02:27.959> like<00:02:28.349> there's<00:02:28.560> actually

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
I'm like wait what like there's actually

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.339 
I'm like wait what like there's actually
like<00:02:28.980> lights<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.459> here<00:02:29.900> there's<00:02:30.900> two<00:02:31.170> ways<00:02:31.290> to

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
like lights in here there's two ways to

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.770 
like lights in here there's two ways to
rewind<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.790> either<00:02:32.910> press<00:02:33.180> left<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
rewind you can either press left on the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.410 
rewind you can either press left on the
d-pad<00:02:33.959> which<00:02:34.799> is<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.099> shortcut<00:02:35.640> or<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.269> can

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
d-pad which is a shortcut or you can

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
d-pad which is a shortcut or you can
bring<00:02:36.630> up<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.230> control<00:02:37.799> pad<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.200> back

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
bring up the control pad I like the back

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.160 
bring up the control pad I like the back
button<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.730> control<00:02:42.060> pad<00:02:42.269> press<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
button on the control pad press a and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.920 
button on the control pad press a and
you'll<00:02:43.650> realize<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.220> way<00:02:44.549> every<00:02:45.299> time<00:02:45.329> that

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
you'll realize that way every time that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.229 
you'll realize that way every time that
someone<00:02:46.200> roll<00:02:46.470> wines<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.010> save<00:02:47.220> film<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.760> hold

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
someone roll wines in a save film I hold

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.900 
someone roll wines in a save film I hold
my<00:02:48.360> breath<00:02:48.660> because<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.769> like<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.340> like

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
my breath because it's like it's like

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.000 
my breath because it's like it's like
God<00:02:51.329> reaching<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.110> being<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:52.470> make

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
God reaching in and being like make

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.830 
God reaching in and being like make
magic<00:02:53.459> happen<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.970> then<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.180> magically<00:02:54.690> just

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
magic happen and then it magically just

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.600 
magic happen and then it magically just
keeps<00:02:54.989> working<00:02:55.200> like<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.950> complexity<00:02:56.579> of

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
keeps working like the complexity of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.140 
keeps working like the complexity of
that<00:02:56.700> system<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:57.510> insane

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.850 

now<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.210> other<00:03:02.450> cool<00:03:02.810> thing<00:03:02.840> is<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.650> ability

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
now the other cool thing is the ability

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.400 
now the other cool thing is the ability
to<00:03:04.190> go<00:03:04.310> into<00:03:04.460> flying<00:03:04.760> camera<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.110> do<00:03:06.230> that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
to go into flying camera and you do that

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.070 
to go into flying camera and you do that
by<00:03:06.680> hitting<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.340> Y<00:03:07.520> button<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.630> breaks

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
by hitting the Y button and that breaks

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.250 
by hitting the Y button and that breaks
you<00:03:09.320> out<00:03:09.500> into<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:10.280> free-roaming<00:03:11.060> camera<00:03:11.720> you

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
you out into a free-roaming camera you

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.020 
you out into a free-roaming camera you
can<00:03:12.290> watch<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.710> from<00:03:12.740> above<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.460> can<00:03:13.820> see

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
can watch it from above and you can see

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.580 
can watch it from above and you can see
what<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:14.420> did<00:03:14.600> maybe<00:03:14.960> get<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> perspective

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
what you did maybe get a perspective

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.350 
what you did maybe get a perspective
where<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.070> can<00:03:16.220> actually<00:03:16.400> see<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.850> impact<00:03:17.240> of

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
where you can actually see the impact of

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.540 
where you can actually see the impact of
that<00:03:17.420> grenade<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.960> through<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.530> zoom<00:03:19.430> in

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
that grenade you through and zoom in

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.040 
that grenade you through and zoom in
really<00:03:19.760> closely<00:03:20.090> on<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.720> action<00:03:21.020> that

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
really closely on the action that

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.740 
really closely on the action that
happened<00:03:21.410> after<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:26.090> there's<00:03:26.270> one<00:03:26.480> group

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
happened after that so there's one group

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.750 
happened after that so there's one group
who's<00:03:26.990> like<00:03:27.140> no<00:03:27.530> don't<00:03:28.070> allow<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.400> they're

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
who's like no don't allow it they're

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.850 
who's like no don't allow it they're

gonna see too many lies its opinion the

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.380 
gonna see too many lies its opinion the
other<00:03:31.010> side<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:31.310> was<00:03:31.370> like<00:03:31.550> look<00:03:31.760> flying

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
other side it was like look flying

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.810 
other side it was like look flying
campus<00:03:32.750> coolest<00:03:33.110> shit<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.920> actually<00:03:34.310> is<00:03:34.460> a<00:03:34.520> big

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
campus coolest shit it actually is a big

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.210 
campus coolest shit it actually is a big
deal<00:03:35.060> when<00:03:35.480> you're<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.350> flying<00:03:36.620> camera<00:03:36.950> if<00:03:37.130> you

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
deal when you're in flying camera if you

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.460 
deal when you're in flying camera if you
hold<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.670> left<00:03:37.880> trigger<00:03:38.320> you<00:03:39.320> can

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
hold in the left trigger you can

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.350 
hold in the left trigger you can
actually<00:03:39.740> fly<00:03:39.950> around<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.400> map<00:03:40.550> faster<00:03:41.180> and

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
actually fly around the map faster and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.800 
actually fly around the map faster and
then<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.080> right<00:03:42.380> trigger<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:43.040> your<00:03:44.030> speed

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
then the right trigger is your speed

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.440 
then the right trigger is your speed
control<00:03:45.320> if<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.070> hold<00:03:46.220> down<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:47.240> right

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
control if you hold down the right

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.300 
control if you hold down the right
trigger<00:03:47.660> in<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.230> little<00:03:48.650> you'll<00:03:48.980> notice

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
trigger in just a little you'll notice

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.330 
trigger in just a little you'll notice
it's<00:03:49.520> slow<00:03:50.120> motion<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:50.750> if<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:51.740> hold<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.220> in

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
it's slow motion and if you hold it in

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.030 
it's slow motion and if you hold it in
all<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.670> way<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.420> actually<00:03:53.690> becomes<00:03:54.650> fast

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
all the way it actually becomes fast

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.430 
all the way it actually becomes fast
