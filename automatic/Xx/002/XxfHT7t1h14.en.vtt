00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
hi guys this is Dora here with natural

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.580 
hi guys this is Dora here with natural
Evita<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.210> short<00:00:09.420> video<00:00:09.660> I'm<00:00:10.230> going

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
Evita and in this short video I'm going

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.799 
Evita and in this short video I'm going
to<00:00:10.679> explain<00:00:11.219> why<00:00:11.820> it's<00:00:12.030> good<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.300> juice<00:00:12.630> your

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
to explain why it's good to juice your

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.760 
to explain why it's good to juice your
vegetables<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.620> eat<00:00:14.040> your<00:00:14.219> fruits<00:00:15.650> for<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
vegetables and eat your fruits for the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.400 
vegetables and eat your fruits for the
first<00:00:17.039> benefit<00:00:17.580> inducing<00:00:18.359> raw<00:00:18.570> vegetables<00:00:19.140> is

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
first benefit inducing raw vegetables is

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.609 
first benefit inducing raw vegetables is
that<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> lot<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.609> nutrients<00:00:21.350> remain<00:00:22.350> in

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
that a lot of the nutrients remain in

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.240 
that a lot of the nutrients remain in
the<00:00:22.890> juice<00:00:23.359> plus<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:25.260> body<00:00:25.470> doesn't<00:00:25.800> need<00:00:26.099> to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the juice plus the body doesn't need to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.570 
the juice plus the body doesn't need to
spend<00:00:26.550> any<00:00:26.820> time<00:00:27.330> or<00:00:27.630> energy<00:00:28.460> digesting<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
spend any time or energy digesting the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.830 
spend any time or energy digesting the
food<00:00:29.900> because<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.199> fiber<00:00:31.500> has<00:00:31.920> been<00:00:32.130> removed

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
food because the fiber has been removed

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.690 
food because the fiber has been removed
so<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.020> means<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.620> nutrients<00:00:35.190> goes

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
so this means that the nutrients goes

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.799 
so this means that the nutrients goes
straight<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.360> our<00:00:36.510> cells<00:00:38.090> take<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> raw<00:00:39.390> carrot

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
straight to our cells take a raw carrot

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.740 
straight to our cells take a raw carrot
for<00:00:40.020> example<00:00:40.790> first<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.969> need<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.329> chew<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
for example first you need to chew it

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.950 
for example first you need to chew it
and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.890> need<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.070> digest<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.030> even

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
and then you need to digest it but even

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.290 
and then you need to digest it but even
if<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.200> chew<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.440> very<00:00:46.739> well<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.120> no

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
if you chew it very well there is no

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.600 
if you chew it very well there is no
guarantee<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.500> nutrients<00:00:50.010> reach<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
guarantee that the nutrients reach the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.020 
guarantee that the nutrients reach the
cell<00:00:50.850> level<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> sicker<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.219> person<00:00:53.760> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
cell level and the sicker a person is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.319 
cell level and the sicker a person is
the<00:00:54.899> less<00:00:54.930> likely<00:00:55.280> their<00:00:56.280> digestive<00:00:56.910> system

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the less likely their digestive system

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.229 
the less likely their digestive system
will<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.170> able<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.649> absorb<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.730> nutrients

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
will be able to absorb the nutrients

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.139 
will be able to absorb the nutrients

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.460 
in people with weaker digestive systems
it<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:26.909> low<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.210> 1%<00:01:28.549> however<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.840> 92%

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
of nutrients are absorbed if one drinks

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.179 
of nutrients are absorbed if one drinks
freshly<00:01:36.390> extracted<00:01:36.750> juices<00:01:38.780> also<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:41.159> a

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
freshly extracted juices also it is a

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.880 
freshly extracted juices also it is a
known<00:01:41.520> fact<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.540> food<00:01:42.930> must<00:01:43.200> become

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
known fact that all food must become

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.260 
known fact that all food must become
liquid<00:01:44.270> before<00:01:45.270> they<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.840> absorbed<00:01:47.270> now

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
liquid before they can be absorbed now

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.539 
liquid before they can be absorbed now
the<00:01:48.329> second<00:01:48.840> reason<00:01:48.990> why<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.920> good<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.189> juice

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the second reason why it's good to juice

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.270 
the second reason why it's good to juice
your<00:01:50.759> vegetables<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.540> eat<00:01:51.840> your<00:01:51.990> fruits<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
your vegetables and eat your fruits is

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
your vegetables and eat your fruits is
that<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.360> juice<00:01:54.570> fruits<00:01:54.990> it

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that when you juice fruits it

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.300 
that when you juice fruits it
concentrates<00:01:56.520> their<00:01:56.790> sugar<00:01:57.149> content<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.869> much

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
concentrates their sugar content so much

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.130 
concentrates their sugar content so much
that<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.729> often<00:01:59.939> be<00:02:00.240> more<00:02:00.270> harming<00:02:00.960> than

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that this can often be more harming than

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.639 
that this can often be more harming than
good

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
good

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.670 
good
this<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.549> because<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> fiber<00:02:03.420> has<00:02:04.020> been<00:02:04.290> taken

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
this is because the fiber has been taken

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.370 
this is because the fiber has been taken
out<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> body<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:07.049> flooded

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
out and so the body is really flooded

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.979 
out and so the body is really flooded
with<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.950> excess<00:02:08.429> amount<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.910> sugar

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
with this excess amount of sugar

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.309 
with this excess amount of sugar
and<00:02:10.229> without<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.890> fiber<00:02:11.189> slowly<00:02:12.319> releasing

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and without the fiber slowly releasing

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.800 
and without the fiber slowly releasing
that<00:02:13.439> sugar<00:02:13.829> into<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.250> bloodstream<00:02:14.599> this<00:02:15.599> can

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
that sugar into the bloodstream this can

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.170 
that sugar into the bloodstream this can
actually<00:02:16.049> spike<00:02:16.680> our<00:02:16.920> blood<00:02:17.189> sugar<00:02:17.219> level<00:02:17.849> of

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
actually spike our blood sugar level of

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.470 
actually spike our blood sugar level of
course<00:02:19.140> enjoying<00:02:19.650> fresh<00:02:20.189> juices<00:02:20.879> sometimes

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
course enjoying fresh juices sometimes

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.270 
course enjoying fresh juices sometimes
can<00:02:21.930> be<00:02:22.079> beneficial<00:02:23.000> but<00:02:24.000> drinking<00:02:24.420> fresh

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
can be beneficial but drinking fresh

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.429 
can be beneficial but drinking fresh
vegetable<00:02:26.280> juices<00:02:26.790> regularly<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.629> much<00:02:28.139> more

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
vegetable juices regularly is much more

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.860 
vegetable juices regularly is much more
beneficial<00:02:28.859> because<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.879> does<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.329> contain

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
beneficial because it does not contain
