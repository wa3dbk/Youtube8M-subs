alright<00:00:00.630> let's<00:00:00.930> continue<00:00:01.260> what<00:00:01.589> type<00:00:01.829> 3

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
alright let's continue what type 3

alright let's continue what type 3
hypersensitivity<00:00:02.909> in<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.990> previous<00:00:04.259> videos

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
hypersensitivity in the previous videos

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.670 
hypersensitivity in the previous videos
we<00:00:04.680> spoke<00:00:05.069> about<00:00:05.220> type<00:00:05.580> 2<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.819> type<00:00:06.060> 1<00:00:06.540> in<00:00:06.779> type

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
we spoke about type 2 and type 1 in type

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.990 
we spoke about type 2 and type 1 in type
1<00:00:07.940> the<00:00:08.940> antigen<00:00:09.750> was<00:00:10.320> circulating<00:00:11.219> while<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
1 the antigen was circulating while the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.020 
1 the antigen was circulating while the
antibody<00:00:12.570> was<00:00:12.780> fixed<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.349> mast<00:00:14.340> cells<00:00:14.670> or

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
antibody was fixed on mast cells or

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.900 
antibody was fixed on mast cells or
basophils<00:00:15.470> while<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.710> type<00:00:16.949> 2<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.190> rules<00:00:17.640> were

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
basophils while in type 2 the rules were

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.150 
basophils while in type 2 the rules were
opposite<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.750> which<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.199> antibody<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:20.010> in

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
opposite in which the antibody was in

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.910 
opposite in which the antibody was in
the<00:00:20.310> circulation<00:00:20.930> while<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.199> antigens<00:00:22.740> were

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the circulation while the antigens were

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.769 
the circulation while the antigens were
fixed<00:00:23.310> on<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> cells<00:00:24.840> now<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.590> type<00:00:25.859> 3

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
fixed on the cells now in type 3

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
fixed on the cells now in type 3
usually<00:00:27.779> both<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:29.130> circulation

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
usually both of them are in circulation

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.510 
usually both of them are in circulation
but<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.300> some<00:00:30.539> cases<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.410> antigen<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.279> be

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
but in some cases the antigen can be

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.299 
but in some cases the antigen can be
planted<00:00:33.079> then<00:00:34.079> followed<00:00:34.500> by<00:00:34.530> antibody

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
we call the antibody antigen complex and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.459 
we call the antibody antigen complex and
immune<00:00:41.730> complex<00:00:42.360> another<00:00:43.260> difference

the<00:00:55.289> origin<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.039> antigen<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.730> be

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the origin of the antigen can be

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.479 
the origin of the antigen can be
exhaustion<00:00:57.570> asst<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.020> endogenous<00:00:58.489> by

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
exhaustion asst or endogenous by

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.450 
exhaustion asst or endogenous by
exogenous<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.239> mean<00:01:00.840> something<00:01:01.829> such<00:01:02.160> as<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
exogenous we mean something such as a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.380 
exogenous we mean something such as a
foreign<00:01:03.000> bacteria<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:04.400> viruses<00:01:05.400> or<00:01:05.700> fungi<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
foreign bacteria or viruses or fungi and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.679 
foreign bacteria or viruses or fungi and
so<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.920> while<00:01:07.920> endogenous<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.659> own

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
so on while endogenous can be your own

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.010 
so on while endogenous can be your own
cell<00:01:10.409> components<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.689> you<00:01:12.689> will<00:01:12.840> see

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
cell components and you will see

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.170 
cell components and you will see
examples<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.950> these<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
examples of these in some of the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.870 
examples of these in some of the
diseases<00:01:15.450> will<00:01:15.689> talk<00:01:15.960> about<00:01:16.189> also<00:01:17.189> by<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
diseases will talk about also by this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.840 
diseases will talk about also by this
immune<00:01:18.600> complex<00:01:19.140> formation<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.700> be

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
immune complex formation there will be

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.429 
immune complex formation there will be
an<00:01:20.939> activation<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> complement<00:01:22.350> system

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
an activation of the complement system

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.670 
an activation of the complement system
and<00:01:23.040> also<00:01:24.030> an<00:01:24.270> induction<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.380> immune

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and also an induction of your immune

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.320 
and also an induction of your immune
cells<00:01:25.979> such<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.280> neutrophils<00:01:27.150> and

lise itseif 3a 4a and 5a also known as
an<00:02:17.129> affiliate<00:02:17.700> auxins<00:02:18.209> which<00:02:18.720> will<00:02:18.989> cause<00:02:19.709> an

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
an affiliate auxins which will cause an

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.100 
an affiliate auxins which will cause an
induction<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.790> inflammation<00:02:21.450> causing

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
induction of the inflammation causing

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.259 
induction of the inflammation causing
further<00:02:22.349> recruitment<00:02:23.159> of<00:02:23.310> white<00:02:23.760> blood<00:02:23.939> cells

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
further recruitment of white blood cells

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.740 
further recruitment of white blood cells
so<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.439> general<00:02:25.950> classification<00:02:26.159> is<00:02:27.150> that

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
so the general classification is that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.660 
so the general classification is that
one<00:02:28.140> group<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.560> generalized<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.579> other

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
one group is generalized and the other

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.880 
one group is generalized and the other
group<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.120> localized<00:02:30.780> most<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
group is localized most of the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.399 
group is localized most of the
discussion<00:02:32.099> will<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.549> about<00:02:32.810> generalized<00:02:33.810> so

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
discussion will be about generalized so

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.699 
discussion will be about generalized so
in<00:02:34.980> serum<00:02:35.640> sickness<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> condition<00:02:37.290> in

in serum sickness this is a condition in

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.149 
in serum sickness this is a condition in

which let's assume a page a person has

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.509 
which let's assume a page a person has
some<00:02:41.700> autoimmunity<00:02:42.260> but<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.709> they're<00:02:44.129> immune

this<00:04:52.300> is<00:04:52.480> due<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:53.010> deposition<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.160> immune
