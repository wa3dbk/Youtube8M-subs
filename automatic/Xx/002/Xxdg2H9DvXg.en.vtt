possible if you can do a thought
experiment<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.809> think<00:00:34.260> about<00:00:34.470> how<00:00:34.650> something

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
experiment and think about how something

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.380 
experiment and think about how something
might<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.699> see<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.120> might<00:00:36.269> be

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
might be and you can see how it might be

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.820 
might be and you can see how it might be
in<00:00:36.510> your<00:00:36.540> head<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.230> probably<00:00:37.320> not<00:00:37.769> that

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
in your head it's probably not that

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.009 
in your head it's probably not that
interesting<00:00:38.460> an<00:00:38.550> idea<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.449> if<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.750> ask

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
interesting an idea but if you can ask

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.780 
interesting an idea but if you can ask
yourself<00:00:40.470> a<00:00:40.559> question<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> only<00:00:41.430> way<00:00:41.640> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
yourself a question that the only way of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.280 
yourself a question that the only way of
finding<00:00:41.970> out<00:00:42.269> how<00:00:42.449> it's<00:00:42.629> gonna<00:00:42.720> be<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.140> by

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
finding out how it's gonna be is by

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.439 
finding out how it's gonna be is by
doing<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.940> that's<00:00:44.940> probably<00:00:45.269> something

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
doing it that's probably something

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.869 
doing it that's probably something
that's<00:00:45.629> quite<00:00:45.750> powerful<00:00:46.019> and<00:00:46.559> that's<00:00:47.250> what

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that's quite powerful and that's what

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.479 
that's quite powerful and that's what
hella<00:00:48.059> Karen<00:00:48.360> Lewis<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.989> yeah<00:00:49.470> it's<00:00:50.129> strange

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
hella Karen Lewis it's yeah it's strange

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.600 
hella Karen Lewis it's yeah it's strange
to<00:00:50.970> think<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:52.110> got<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.680> from<00:00:53.100> totally

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to think how we got this from totally

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520 
to think how we got this from totally
disparate<00:00:54.059> backgrounds<00:00:54.530> professional

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
disparate backgrounds professional

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.049 
disparate backgrounds professional
skateboarding<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.280> mathematics<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
skateboarding in mathematics and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.820 
skateboarding in mathematics and
computer<00:00:57.420> science<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.290> then<00:00:58.409> we've<00:00:58.530> arrived

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
computer science but then we've arrived

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.899 
computer science but then we've arrived
at<00:00:58.979> the<00:00:59.129> same<00:00:59.369> at<00:00:59.909> the<00:00:59.970> same<00:01:00.089> place<00:01:01.729> and<00:01:02.729> that's

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
at the same at the same place and that's

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.539 
at the same at the same place and that's
I<00:01:03.030> think<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.299> why<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.479> works

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.340 

we<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.939> investigate<00:01:09.420> play<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.020> our<00:01:10.140> work

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
we like to investigate play in our work

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.990 
we like to investigate play in our work
because<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.920> think<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.490> powerful

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
because we think it's a very powerful

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.940 
because we think it's a very powerful
place<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:13.080> start<00:01:13.320> from

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
place to start from

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.570 
place to start from
I<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> things<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.460> got<00:01:17.460> me

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
I think one of the things that got me

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460 
I think one of the things that got me
really<00:01:17.909> excited<00:01:17.939> initially<00:01:18.780> about<00:01:19.020> working

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
really excited initially about working

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.889 
really excited initially about working
with<00:01:20.220> Pete<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.850> his<00:01:21.150> background<00:01:21.420> in

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
with Pete was his background in

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.349 
with Pete was his background in
professional<00:01:22.469> skateboarding<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
professional skateboarding and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.469 
professional skateboarding and
particularly<00:01:24.359> what<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.679> is<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.969> good

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
particularly what it is to be a good

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.139 
particularly what it is to be a good
skateboarder<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:28.950> he<00:01:29.009> characterized<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
skateboarder and how he characterized to

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.410 
skateboarder and how he characterized to
me<00:01:30.359> what<00:01:31.109> it<00:01:31.320> felt<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> moment

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
me what it felt like to be in the moment

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.649 
me what it felt like to be in the moment
when<00:01:34.259> skating<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.579> thing<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:35.880> play<00:01:36.149> is<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
when skating the thing with play is that

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.989 
when skating the thing with play is that
if<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.560> good<00:01:37.829> you're<00:01:38.429> not<00:01:38.549> thinking<00:01:38.880> about

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
if it's good you're not thinking about

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.459 
if it's good you're not thinking about
it<00:01:39.090> we're<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.479> completely<00:01:40.259> consumed<00:01:42.320> it's<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
it we're just completely consumed it's a

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.919 
it we're just completely consumed it's a
kind<00:01:43.679> of<00:01:43.710> release<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.460> people<00:01:44.820> yeah<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.509> know

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
kind of release for people yeah you know

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.149 
kind of release for people yeah you know
it's<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.109> moment<00:01:46.439> where<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.619> don't<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.069> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it's a moment where you don't have to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.770 
it's a moment where you don't have to
think<00:01:47.399> about<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.789> at<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.359> and<00:01:48.569> you're

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
think about it at all and and you're

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.599 
think about it at all and and you're
just<00:01:49.020> there<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.710> you're<00:01:49.829> playing<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.520> you're

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
just there and you're playing and you're

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.950 
just there and you're playing and you're
and<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.359> mean<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:51.749> it<00:01:51.869> I

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and you know I mean and that's it I

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.630 
and you know I mean and that's it I
think<00:01:51.990> that's<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.619> nice<00:01:52.740> gift<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.520> be

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
think that's a really nice gift to be

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.889 
think that's a really nice gift to be
able<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.880> give<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.109> to<00:01:55.109> somebody<00:01:55.619> else<00:01:55.890> that

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
able to give to to somebody else that

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.469 
able to give to to somebody else that
space<00:01:57.899> where<00:01:58.319> anything<00:01:58.859> is<00:01:58.950> possible<00:01:59.479> which

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
space where anything is possible which

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.739 
space where anything is possible which
is<00:02:00.509> play<00:02:00.929> is<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.130> most<00:02:02.340> exciting<00:02:02.850> space<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.600> be

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 
is play is the most exciting space to be

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.749 
is play is the most exciting space to be
and<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:04.679> where<00:02:05.069> that's<00:02:05.369> where<00:02:05.549> we

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
and that's that's where that's where we

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.240 
and that's that's where that's where we
want<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:05.999> be

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
want to be

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.630 
want to be
you

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.649 

technology<00:02:15.640> obviously<00:02:15.730> plays<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.090> major<00:02:16.329> part

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
technology obviously plays a major part

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.119 
technology obviously plays a major part
in<00:02:16.689> our<00:02:16.780> work<00:02:16.989> but<00:02:17.109> I<00:02:17.200> think<00:02:17.409> it's<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.709> ideas

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
in our work but I think it's the ideas

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.559 
in our work but I think it's the ideas
and<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.640> systems<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.239> create<00:02:19.769> that

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
and the systems that we create that

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.240 
and the systems that we create that
provide<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.810> ability<00:02:23.079> to<00:02:23.469> put<00:02:23.799> somebody<00:02:24.010> in

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
provide the ability to put somebody in

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.309 
provide the ability to put somebody in
the<00:02:24.549> moment<00:02:24.909> everything<00:02:25.659> is<00:02:25.750> technology

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
the moment everything is technology

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.470 
the moment everything is technology
right<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:27.040> people<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.849> people<00:02:28.150> don't

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
right that people that people don't

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.610 
right that people that people don't
really<00:02:28.599> consider<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.049> everyone<00:02:29.439> has<00:02:29.560> this

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
really consider that everyone has this

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.190 
really consider that everyone has this
kind<00:02:29.799> of<00:02:29.829> perception<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.730> know<00:02:30.909> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
kind of perception of you know the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.619 
kind of perception of you know the
flashing<00:02:32.200> flashing<00:02:32.890> LEDs<00:02:33.629> technologists

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629

Gutenberg<00:02:35.319> was<00:02:35.439> a<00:02:35.500> hacker

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
Gutenberg was a hacker

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.679 
Gutenberg was a hacker
even<00:02:36.280> though<00:02:36.370> da<00:02:36.609> Vinci<00:02:36.939> was<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.090> hacker<00:02:37.329> I

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
even though da Vinci was a hacker I

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:38.879 
even though da Vinci was a hacker I
think<00:02:37.930> we<00:02:37.989> think<00:02:38.109> is<00:02:38.230> well<00:02:38.409> with<00:02:38.530> making<00:02:38.799> your

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
think we think is well with making your

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.770 
think we think is well with making your
own<00:02:38.980> tools<00:02:39.219> is<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.609> if<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.450> want<00:02:40.629> to<00:02:40.689> do

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
own tools is that if you want to do

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.770 
own tools is that if you want to do
something<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:41.439> the<00:02:41.680> tool<00:02:41.889> doesn't<00:02:42.189> exist<00:02:42.780> you

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
something and the tool doesn't exist you

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.819 
something and the tool doesn't exist you
don't<00:02:43.900> want<00:02:44.079> to<00:02:44.139> wait<00:02:44.230> around<00:02:44.349> for<00:02:44.650> somebody

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
don't want to wait around for somebody

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.970 
don't want to wait around for somebody
else<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.220> make<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.609> you<00:02:46.209> know<00:02:46.510> what<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.810> need

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.319 
these kinda they're great they're
amazing<00:02:56.650> tools<00:02:56.859> they're<00:02:57.129> fantastic<00:02:57.790> but

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
amazing tools they're fantastic but

end up owning you or affecting your own
creativity<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.450> that's<00:03:04.450> not<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:04.689> say<00:03:04.810> we

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
creativity and that's not to say we

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.750 
creativity and that's not to say we
don't<00:03:05.049> use<00:03:05.349> all<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.829> those<00:03:05.950> tools<00:03:06.220> all<00:03:06.609> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
don't use all of those tools all the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.420 
don't use all of those tools all the
time<00:03:06.970> in<00:03:07.150> our<00:03:07.269> own<00:03:07.419> work<00:03:07.689> but<00:03:08.349> we<00:03:08.560> were<00:03:09.220> always

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
time in our own work but we were always

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.800 
time in our own work but we were always
aware<00:03:09.849> of<00:03:09.909> their<00:03:10.840> limitations<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:12.599> would<00:03:13.599> trust

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
aware of their limitations I would trust

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.879 
aware of their limitations I would trust

Katerina the whole project came around

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.770 
Katerina the whole project came around
because<00:03:44.680> Nina<00:03:44.950> wanted<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.790> use<00:03:45.970> hypnotherapy

because Nina wanted to use hypnotherapy

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.700 
because Nina wanted to use hypnotherapy
to<00:03:48.000> delve<00:03:49.000> into<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.570> innermost<00:03:49.900> desires<00:03:50.410> and

to delve into the innermost desires and

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.650 
to delve into the innermost desires and
dreams<00:03:50.860> of<00:03:51.250> dancers<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:52.150> was<00:03:52.270> almost<00:03:52.390> as<00:03:52.600> if

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
dreams of dancers it was almost as if

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.960 
dreams of dancers it was almost as if
she<00:03:52.720> came<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.260> us<00:03:53.290> with<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.590> system<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.280> and

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
she came to us with a system and and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.670 
she came to us with a system and and
that<00:03:55.180> immediately<00:03:55.600> made<00:03:55.840> our<00:03:56.020> ears<00:03:56.170> prick<00:03:56.530> up

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
that immediately made our ears prick up

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.260 
that immediately made our ears prick up
because<00:03:57.010> well<00:03:57.190> that's<00:03:57.460> quite<00:03:57.730> similar<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.060> our

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
because well that's quite similar to our

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.790 
because well that's quite similar to our
approach<00:03:58.570> and<00:03:58.750> she<00:03:58.810> had<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:58.930> crazy<00:03:59.110> idea<00:03:59.380> so

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
approach and she had a crazy idea so

it's always nice to work with a
Mentalist<00:04:01.570> yeah<00:04:02.050> and<00:04:02.320> when<00:04:02.650> we<00:04:02.680> say<00:04:02.980> we<00:04:03.010> like

to<00:04:03.370> make<00:04:03.490> systems<00:04:03.850> not<00:04:04.120> narratives<00:04:04.570> that's

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
to make systems not narratives that's

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.510 
to make systems not narratives that's
not<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.050> say<00:04:05.200> that<00:04:05.320> it<00:04:05.440> isn't<00:04:05.710> an<00:04:05.800> art<00:04:05.980> directed

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
not to say that it isn't an art directed

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.210 
not to say that it isn't an art directed
considered<00:04:07.090> beautiful<00:04:07.780> thing<00:04:08.380> I<00:04:08.680> think<00:04:09.070> it's

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
considered beautiful thing I think it's

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.080 
considered beautiful thing I think it's
exciting<00:04:09.400> something<00:04:09.610> that<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:09.820> can<00:04:09.910> change

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
exciting something that you can change

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.000 
exciting something that you can change
yeah<00:04:10.480> it's<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.080> way<00:04:11.170> that<00:04:11.320> people<00:04:11.500> navigate

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
yeah it's the way that people navigate

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.690 
yeah it's the way that people navigate
the<00:04:12.160> systems

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
the systems

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.910 
the systems
hmm<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.690> intriguing<00:04:14.470> we're<00:04:14.740> always

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
hmm that is intriguing we're always

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.949 
hmm that is intriguing we're always
shocked<00:04:15.400> when<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.390> go<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:16.720> see<00:04:16.870> an

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
shocked when you go and see an

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.570 
shocked when you go and see an
interactive<00:04:17.410> installation<00:04:17.920> or<00:04:18.010> some<00:04:18.220> piece

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
interactive installation or some piece

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.910 
interactive installation or some piece
and<00:04:18.850> there's<00:04:19.450> an<00:04:19.540> instruction<00:04:19.959> manual<00:04:20.260> next

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
and there's an instruction manual next

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.880 
and there's an instruction manual next
to<00:04:21.040> it<00:04:21.130> or<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.510> little<00:04:23.050> piece<00:04:23.260> of<00:04:23.290> paper<00:04:23.560> or

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
to make things where you could do

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.420 
to make things where you could do
anything<00:04:31.090> wrong<00:04:31.620> one<00:04:32.620> of<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.770> things<00:04:32.980> that<00:04:33.400> I

anything wrong one of the things that I
really<00:04:33.910> learnt<00:04:34.090> from<00:04:34.210> my<00:04:34.330> time<00:04:34.540> when<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:34.900> was

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
really learnt from my time when I was

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.380 
really learnt from my time when I was
working<00:04:35.380> at<00:04:35.470> United<00:04:35.620> visual<00:04:36.100> artists<00:04:36.520> was<00:04:37.150> for

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
working at United visual artists was for

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.700 
working at United visual artists was for
instance<00:04:37.480> on<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.810> massive<00:04:38.080> attack<00:04:38.170> tool<00:04:38.530> when

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
instance on the massive attack tool when

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.620 
instance on the massive attack tool when
we<00:04:38.830> were<00:04:38.950> doing<00:04:39.280> order<00:04:39.820> yellow<00:04:39.970> responsive

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
we were doing order yellow responsive

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.180 
we were doing order yellow responsive
software<00:04:41.050> and<00:04:41.170> a<00:04:41.200> lot<00:04:41.320> of<00:04:41.410> audio<00:04:41.680> responsive

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
software and a lot of audio responsive

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.700 
software and a lot of audio responsive
visuals<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:43.020> something<00:04:44.020> in<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.170> context<00:04:44.620> of

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
visuals that something in the context of

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.240 
visuals that something in the context of
a<00:04:44.770> screen<00:04:45.360> could<00:04:46.360> be<00:04:46.740> not<00:04:47.740> necessarily<00:04:48.190> that

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
a screen could be not necessarily that

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.770 
a screen could be not necessarily that
interesting<00:04:48.730> so<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.910> screen<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.240> has<00:04:49.540> gets

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
interesting so a screen that has gets

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.600 
interesting so a screen that has gets
brighter<00:04:50.050> if<00:04:50.230> you<00:04:50.260> shout<00:04:50.560> louder<00:04:50.830> but<00:04:51.400> then<00:04:51.520> if

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
brighter if you shout louder but then if

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.050 
brighter if you shout louder but then if
you<00:04:51.700> transport<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.480> into<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.750> context<00:04:53.350> of<00:04:53.470> a

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
you transport that into the context of a

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.240 
you transport that into the context of a
10,000<00:04:55.060> person<00:04:55.570> gig<00:04:55.840> with<00:04:56.470> everyone<00:04:56.860> jumping

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
10,000 person gig with everyone jumping

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.520 
10,000 person gig with everyone jumping
around<00:04:57.400> and<00:04:57.910> when<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.810> lead<00:04:58.930> singer<00:04:59.230> points

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
around and when the lead singer points

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.500 
around and when the lead singer points
the<00:04:59.620> microphone<00:05:00.070> of<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.220> crowd<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:01.300> light

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
the microphone of the crowd the light

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.450 
the microphone of the crowd the light
goes<00:05:01.720> crazy<00:05:01.990> and<00:05:02.380> then<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.800> band<00:05:03.040> goes<00:05:03.220> a<00:05:03.250> bit

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
goes crazy and then the band goes a bit

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.590 
goes crazy and then the band goes a bit
more<00:05:03.490> crazy<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.000> then<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.300> makes<00:05:04.450> this

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
more crazy and then it makes this

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.990 
more crazy and then it makes this
feedback<00:05:04.840> loop<00:05:05.020> happen<00:05:05.500> if<00:05:05.590> we<00:05:05.740> can<00:05:05.950> make<00:05:06.760> that

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
feedback loop happen if we can make that

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000 
feedback loop happen if we can make that
happen<00:05:07.030> with<00:05:07.660> our<00:05:07.840> work<00:05:08.080> it's<00:05:08.440> it's<00:05:08.860> always

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
happen with our work it's it's always

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.160 
happen with our work it's it's always
exciting<00:05:09.640> to<00:05:09.670> see<00:05:10.000> they're<00:05:10.180> quite<00:05:10.540> often<00:05:10.780> work

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
exciting to see they're quite often work

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.310 
exciting to see they're quite often work
as<00:05:11.410> you<00:05:11.620> say<00:05:11.800> pieces<00:05:12.190> is<00:05:12.460> a<00:05:12.490> full-stop<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.330> and

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
as you say pieces is a full-stop and and

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.200 
as you say pieces is a full-stop and and
to<00:05:14.860> make<00:05:15.040> something<00:05:15.280> where<00:05:15.670> you<00:05:15.790> feel<00:05:15.970> you<00:05:16.090> can

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
to make something where you feel you can

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.460 
to make something where you feel you can
be<00:05:16.300> part<00:05:16.480> of<00:05:16.630> something<00:05:16.810> things<00:05:17.140> are<00:05:17.290> very

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
be part of something things are very

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.430 
be part of something things are very
powerful<00:05:17.650> that's<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.340> very<00:05:18.520> powerful<00:05:18.700> thing

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
powerful that's a very powerful thing

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.330 
powerful that's a very powerful thing
and<00:05:20.440> there's<00:05:20.560> something<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:20.800> we<00:05:20.950> always<00:05:21.070> say

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
and there's something that we always say

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.989 
and there's something that we always say
about<00:05:21.370> the<00:05:22.290> virtual<00:05:23.290> world

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:23.999 
about the virtual world

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:26.929 
about the virtual world
whatever<00:05:24.389> that<00:05:24.479> quite<00:05:25.019> means<00:05:25.259> is<00:05:25.759> we've<00:05:26.759> never

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:26.939 
whatever that quite means is we've never

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:28.759 
whatever that quite means is we've never
cried<00:05:27.299> in<00:05:27.329> front<00:05:27.539> of<00:05:27.839> a<00:05:27.899> website<00:05:28.079> and<00:05:28.499> it's

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:28.769 
cried in front of a website and it's

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:31.159 
cried in front of a website and it's
kind<00:05:29.039> of<00:05:29.099> a<00:05:29.219> flippant<00:05:29.610> thing<00:05:29.849> to<00:05:30.029> say<00:05:30.269> but<00:05:30.989> it's

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
kind of a flippant thing to say but it's

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.659 
kind of a flippant thing to say but it's
not<00:05:31.229> really<00:05:31.589> an<00:05:31.679> emotionally<00:05:32.189> affecting

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
not really an emotionally affecting

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.729 
not really an emotionally affecting
place<00:05:32.939> because<00:05:33.389> it's<00:05:33.809> so<00:05:33.989> mediated<00:05:34.499> because

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:34.739 
place because it's so mediated because

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:36.439 
place because it's so mediated because
it's<00:05:34.860> going<00:05:35.009> to<00:05:35.159> a<00:05:35.189> screen<00:05:35.579> and<00:05:35.789> that's<00:05:36.179> kind

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
it's going to a screen and that's kind

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.479 
it's going to a screen and that's kind
of<00:05:36.479> a<00:05:36.599> built<00:05:37.199> in<00:05:37.409> perceptual<00:05:37.919> thing<00:05:38.249> that<00:05:38.399> we

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:38.489 
of a built in perceptual thing that we

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:41.209 
of a built in perceptual thing that we
have<00:05:38.729> so<00:05:39.479> we<00:05:39.719> think<00:05:40.289> the<00:05:40.529> real<00:05:40.739> world<00:05:41.009> is<00:05:41.189> the

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
have so we think the real world is the

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:42.859 
have so we think the real world is the
best<00:05:41.369> place<00:05:41.729> to<00:05:41.759> make<00:05:42.059> memories<00:05:42.239> and<00:05:42.689> that's

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:42.869 
best place to make memories and that's

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:45.229 
best place to make memories and that's
why<00:05:43.169> we<00:05:43.649> work<00:05:43.860> in<00:05:44.159> the<00:05:44.339> real<00:05:44.489> world<00:05:44.549> with<00:05:45.059> art

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:45.239 
why we work in the real world with art

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:47.179 
why we work in the real world with art
with<00:05:45.449> our<00:05:45.629> work<00:05:45.839> but<00:05:46.409> that's<00:05:46.529> not<00:05:46.769> to<00:05:46.860> say<00:05:46.889> that

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
with our work but that's not to say that

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:48.589 
with our work but that's not to say that
the<00:05:47.309> virtual<00:05:47.759> world<00:05:47.999> doesn't<00:05:48.329> have<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.449> lot<00:05:48.569> of

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
the virtual world doesn't have a lot of

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.139 
the virtual world doesn't have a lot of
possibilities<00:05:48.809> as<00:05:49.409> well<00:05:49.619> which<00:05:50.369> is<00:05:50.579> that<00:05:51.029> it's

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:51.149 
possibilities as well which is that it's

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:52.579 
possibilities as well which is that it's
a<00:05:51.269> place<00:05:51.389> completely<00:05:51.809> without<00:05:52.139> any<00:05:52.199> kind<00:05:52.529> of

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:52.589 
a place completely without any kind of

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:55.009 
a place completely without any kind of
physical<00:05:52.919> constraint<00:05:53.369> so<00:05:54.059> it's<00:05:54.539> interesting

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:55.019 
physical constraint so it's interesting

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:57.229 
physical constraint so it's interesting
when<00:05:55.649> you<00:05:55.679> can<00:05:55.949> have<00:05:56.129> something<00:05:56.399> that<00:05:57.059> maybe

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:57.239 
when you can have something that maybe

00:05:57.239 --> 00:05:59.179 
when you can have something that maybe
was<00:05:57.449> inspired<00:05:57.959> by<00:05:58.169> the<00:05:58.229> physical<00:05:58.679> world<00:05:58.889> that

00:05:59.179 --> 00:05:59.189 
was inspired by the physical world that

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:01.159 
was inspired by the physical world that
you<00:05:59.489> then<00:05:59.639> take<00:05:59.849> into<00:06:00.119> the<00:06:00.239> virtual<00:06:00.389> world<00:06:00.779> and

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
you then take into the virtual world and

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.379 
you then take into the virtual world and
then<00:06:01.589> expose<00:06:01.979> that<00:06:02.159> again<00:06:02.549> in<00:06:02.789> the<00:06:02.939> real<00:06:03.119> world

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
then expose that again in the real world

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:04.909 
then expose that again in the real world
so<00:06:03.599> a<00:06:03.629> good<00:06:03.749> example<00:06:03.899> of<00:06:04.259> that<00:06:04.409> would<00:06:04.589> be<00:06:04.739> our

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
so a good example of that would be our

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.219 
so a good example of that would be our
our<00:06:05.099> feedback<00:06:05.729> installation<00:06:06.659> that<00:06:06.869> we<00:06:06.989> did<00:06:07.139> at

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
our feedback installation that we did at

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.829 
our feedback installation that we did at
the<00:06:07.319> Roundhouse<00:06:07.709> with<00:06:08.279> a<00:06:08.819> great<00:06:09.360> friend<00:06:09.479> Todd

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:09.839 
the Roundhouse with a great friend Todd

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.659 
the Roundhouse with a great friend Todd
Van<00:06:10.019> Doolin<00:06:10.289> it<00:06:10.619> was<00:06:10.799> part<00:06:11.009> of<00:06:11.069> this<00:06:11.219> circus

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
Van Doolin it was part of this circus

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.879 
Van Doolin it was part of this circus
festival<00:06:12.089> that<00:06:12.179> happened<00:06:12.539> at<00:06:13.289> the<00:06:13.469> Roundhouse

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
festival that happened at the Roundhouse

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.549 
festival that happened at the Roundhouse
and<00:06:13.919> they<00:06:14.129> came<00:06:14.339> to<00:06:14.459> us<00:06:14.549> initially<00:06:14.639> and<00:06:14.999> said

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:15.559 
and they came to us initially and said

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:18.259 
and they came to us initially and said
can<00:06:16.559> you<00:06:16.589> do<00:06:16.889> something<00:06:17.399> that<00:06:17.729> uses<00:06:18.119> the

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:18.269 
can you do something that uses the

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:20.479 
can you do something that uses the
skills<00:06:18.479> of<00:06:18.719> one<00:06:18.869> of<00:06:18.959> the<00:06:19.049> performers<00:06:19.559> and<00:06:19.799> they

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:20.489 
skills of one of the performers and they

00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:22.129 
skills of one of the performers and they
were<00:06:20.549> also<00:06:20.669> dit<00:06:21.269> we've<00:06:21.689> just<00:06:21.899> felt

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
were also dit we've just felt

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:23.929 
were also dit we've just felt
embarrassed<00:06:22.559> we<00:06:23.039> didn't<00:06:23.309> want<00:06:23.429> to<00:06:23.459> do<00:06:23.639> you

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:23.939 
embarrassed we didn't want to do you

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.929 
embarrassed we didn't want to do you
know<00:06:24.059> like<00:06:24.860> virtual<00:06:25.860> juggling<00:06:26.369> yeah

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:26.939 
know like virtual juggling yeah

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:29.779 
know like virtual juggling yeah
something<00:06:27.809> like<00:06:27.839> that<00:06:27.959> so<00:06:28.529> we<00:06:29.129> tried<00:06:29.399> to<00:06:29.429> think

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
something like that so we tried to think

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.549 
something like that so we tried to think
well<00:06:30.089> if<00:06:30.239> we<00:06:30.389> were<00:06:30.539> in<00:06:30.629> the<00:06:30.689> circus<00:06:31.110> what<00:06:31.409> would

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:31.559 
well if we were in the circus what would

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.859 
well if we were in the circus what would
we<00:06:31.679> be<00:06:31.919> doing<00:06:32.039> so<00:06:32.639> we<00:06:33.089> took<00:06:33.239> a<00:06:33.300> real<00:06:33.569> world

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:33.869 
we be doing so we took a real world

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:35.479 
we be doing so we took a real world
thing<00:06:34.259> and<00:06:34.499> then<00:06:34.589> took<00:06:34.949> it<00:06:35.009> into<00:06:35.189> the<00:06:35.309> virtual

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:35.489 
thing and then took it into the virtual

00:06:35.489 --> 00:06:38.389 
thing and then took it into the virtual
world<00:06:35.819> by<00:06:36.809> having<00:06:37.349> this<00:06:37.469> idea<00:06:37.889> of<00:06:38.069> being<00:06:38.249> able

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:38.399 
world by having this idea of being able

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:41.809 
world by having this idea of being able
to<00:06:38.550> throw<00:06:39.029> pixels<00:06:39.989> almost<00:06:40.469> daughter<00:06:40.800> be<00:06:41.610> able

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 
to throw pixels almost daughter be able

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:43.279 
to throw pixels almost daughter be able
to<00:06:41.909> affect<00:06:42.239> yourself<00:06:42.689> in<00:06:42.899> these<00:06:43.019> kind<00:06:43.259> of

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289 
to affect yourself in these kind of

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.499 
to affect yourself in these kind of
magical<00:06:43.919> mirror<00:06:44.219> forms<00:06:44.669> so<00:06:44.819> those<00:06:44.969> responsive

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:45.509 
magical mirror forms so those responsive

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.079 
magical mirror forms so those responsive
mirrors<00:06:45.869> and<00:06:46.110> then<00:06:46.919> put<00:06:47.249> that<00:06:47.279> back<00:06:47.639> into<00:06:47.879> the

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:48.089 
mirrors and then put that back into the

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:49.639 
mirrors and then put that back into the
real<00:06:48.269> world<00:06:48.569> and<00:06:48.839> allow<00:06:49.079> people<00:06:49.349> to<00:06:49.469> become

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:49.649 
real world and allow people to become

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.040 
real world and allow people to become
performers<00:06:50.069> in<00:06:50.729> front<00:06:51.179> of<00:06:51.329> it<00:06:51.449> so<00:06:51.569> I<00:06:51.839> guess

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
performers in front of it so I guess

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.749 
performers in front of it so I guess
what<00:06:52.259> I'm<00:06:52.409> trying<00:06:52.679> to<00:06:53.159> say<00:06:53.309> is<00:06:53.459> that<00:06:53.639> the

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 
what I'm trying to say is that the

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.779 
what I'm trying to say is that the
virtual<00:06:54.239> and<00:06:54.389> real<00:06:54.419> worlds<00:06:55.069> can<00:06:56.069> blend<00:06:56.429> or<00:06:56.669> go

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
virtual and real worlds can blend or go

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.249 
virtual and real worlds can blend or go
backwards<00:06:57.209> and<00:06:57.299> forwards<00:06:57.689> but<00:06:57.809> we<00:06:57.959> like<00:06:58.139> to

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 
backwards and forwards but we like to

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.679 
backwards and forwards but we like to
always<00:06:58.439> end<00:06:58.739> up<00:06:59.009> back<00:06:59.729> in<00:06:59.969> the<00:07:00.089> end<00:07:00.360> in<00:07:00.599> the

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:00.689 
always end up back in the end in the

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.839 
always end up back in the end in the
real<00:07:00.839> world

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:05.399 

I<00:07:03.939> think<00:07:04.719> we've<00:07:04.809> just<00:07:04.839> scratched<00:07:05.020> the<00:07:05.259> surface

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409 
I think we've just scratched the surface

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.260 
I think we've just scratched the surface
a<00:07:05.709> bit<00:07:05.740> this<00:07:05.979> this<00:07:06.249> there's<00:07:06.550> so<00:07:06.669> much<00:07:06.819> more<00:07:07.029> to

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
a bit this this there's so much more to

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.909 
a bit this this there's so much more to
come<00:07:07.629> and<00:07:07.779> we<00:07:07.869> want<00:07:08.110> to<00:07:08.259> be<00:07:08.349> doing<00:07:08.469> it<00:07:08.709> for<00:07:08.740> a

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 
come and we want to be doing it for a

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:10.829 
come and we want to be doing it for a
long<00:07:09.039> time<00:07:09.339> that's<00:07:09.580> one<00:07:10.209> of<00:07:10.300> the<00:07:10.360> reasons<00:07:10.689> why

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:10.839 
long time that's one of the reasons why

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:13.169 
long time that's one of the reasons why
we<00:07:10.990> do<00:07:11.169> open<00:07:11.679> source<00:07:11.889> everything<00:07:12.459> that<00:07:12.909> we<00:07:12.999> do

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:13.179 
we do open source everything that we do

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:14.850 
we do open source everything that we do
is<00:07:13.449> because<00:07:13.599> we<00:07:13.749> don't<00:07:13.990> want<00:07:14.229> to<00:07:14.289> be<00:07:14.409> known<00:07:14.619> as

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:14.860 
is because we don't want to be known as

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.040 
is because we don't want to be known as
