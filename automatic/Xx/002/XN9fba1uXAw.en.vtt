now<00:00:26.749> Stuart<00:00:27.109> the<00:00:27.259> obvious<00:00:27.769> question<00:00:28.220> what<00:00:28.609> is

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
now Stuart the obvious question what is

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.609 
now Stuart the obvious question what is
icivics<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:29.720> how<00:00:29.779> does<00:00:29.839> it<00:00:30.109> differ<00:00:30.289> from<00:00:30.470> the

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
icivics and how does it differ from the

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.260 
icivics and how does it differ from the
conventional<00:00:31.189> system<00:00:31.369> we've<00:00:31.789> been<00:00:31.909> using<00:00:32.060> for

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
conventional system we've been using for

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.689 
conventional system we've been using for
decades<00:00:32.419> so<00:00:33.289> ISOFIX<00:00:33.920> is<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.129> standardized

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
decades so ISOFIX is a standardized

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.689 
decades so ISOFIX is a standardized
method<00:00:35.149> of<00:00:35.300> installing<00:00:36.110> child<00:00:36.649> seats<00:00:36.980> into

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
method of installing child seats into

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.660 
method of installing child seats into
ISOFIX<00:00:38.690> compatible<00:00:39.199> vehicles<00:00:39.620> that<00:00:40.190> doesn't

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
ISOFIX compatible vehicles that doesn't

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.080 
ISOFIX compatible vehicles that doesn't
use<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.270> vehicle's<00:00:41.719> regular<00:00:42.559> lap<00:00:43.160> sash<00:00:43.460> seat

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
use the vehicle's regular lap sash seat

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.660 
use the vehicle's regular lap sash seat
belt<00:00:44.300> system<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:45.500> here's<00:00:45.710> our<00:00:45.859> ISOFIX<00:00:46.460> seat

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
belt system so here's our ISOFIX seat

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.970 
belt system so here's our ISOFIX seat
that<00:00:47.239> we<00:00:47.359> have<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.320> first<00:00:48.559> thing<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:48.769> note

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
that we have and the first thing to note

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.759 
that we have and the first thing to note
about<00:00:49.010> ISOFIX<00:00:49.730> seats<00:00:50.000> is<00:00:50.269> they<00:00:51.019> all<00:00:51.289> still

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
about ISOFIX seats is they all still

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.310 
about ISOFIX seats is they all still
come<00:00:52.039> with<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.699> same<00:00:53.329> top<00:00:53.660> tether<00:00:53.870> as<00:00:54.140> you

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
come with the same top tether as you

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.990 
come with the same top tether as you
would<00:00:54.440> find<00:00:54.620> on<00:00:54.800> a<00:00:54.859> conventional<00:00:55.429> child<00:00:55.699> seat

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
would find on a conventional child seat

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.630 
would find on a conventional child seat
so<00:00:56.570> there's<00:00:56.719> no<00:00:56.840> difference<00:00:57.019> there<00:00:57.469> if<00:00:58.370> we

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
so there's no difference there if we

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.400 
so there's no difference there if we
flip<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.940> child<00:00:59.179> seat<00:00:59.420> around<00:00:59.839> to<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.170> back

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
flip the child seat around to the back

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.650 
flip the child seat around to the back
we<00:01:01.010> can<00:01:01.039> see<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.699> ISOFIX

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
we can see the ISOFIX

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.080 
we can see the ISOFIX
attachments<00:01:03.649> themselves<00:01:04.250> this<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:04.850> the

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
attachments themselves this is the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.240 
attachments themselves this is the
structure<00:01:05.330> down<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.750> bottom<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:06.860> those<00:01:07.070> are

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
structure down the bottom and those are

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.880 
structure down the bottom and those are
our<00:01:07.370> two<00:01:07.400> isofix<00:01:08.390> attachment<00:01:09.230> points<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.740> go

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
our two isofix attachment points that go

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.820 
our two isofix attachment points that go
directly<00:01:10.160> into<00:01:11.050> structure<00:01:12.050> on<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.470> vehicle

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
directly into structure on the vehicle

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.490 
directly into structure on the vehicle
itself<00:01:13.160> if<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.030> do<00:01:14.510> need<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.930> use<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.140> child

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
itself if you do need to use the child

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.710 
itself if you do need to use the child
seat<00:01:15.830> in<00:01:15.980> a<00:01:16.130> vehicle<00:01:16.370> that's<00:01:16.670> not<00:01:16.940> fitted<00:01:17.330> with

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
seat in a vehicle that's not fitted with

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.560 
seat in a vehicle that's not fitted with
ISOFIX<00:01:18.410> attachments<00:01:19.040> you<00:01:19.670> can<00:01:19.850> still<00:01:20.090> use<00:01:20.330> the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
ISOFIX attachments you can still use the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.080 
ISOFIX attachments you can still use the
regular<00:01:20.780> lap<00:01:21.470> sash<00:01:21.770> seatbelts<00:01:22.430> just<00:01:22.790> like<00:01:22.940> you

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
always would the kids of different ages

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.980 
always would the kids of different ages
need<00:01:25.250> different<00:01:25.520> types<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.360> seats<00:01:26.720> can<00:01:26.930> you

least up to six months of age they must
be<00:01:31.940> carried<00:01:32.300> in<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.570> rear-facing<00:01:32.930> child

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
be carried in a rear-facing child

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.880 
be carried in a rear-facing child
restraint<00:01:33.980> beyond<00:01:34.550> six<00:01:34.820> months<00:01:35.180> the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
restraint beyond six months the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.720 
restraint beyond six months the
progression<00:01:36.890> into<00:01:37.070> different<00:01:37.550> child

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
progression into different child

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.490 
progression into different child
restraints<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.390> really<00:01:38.840> determined<00:01:39.020> by<00:01:39.350> the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
restraints is really determined by the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.610 
restraints is really determined by the
child's<00:01:40.130> shoulder<00:01:40.310> height<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.300> their<00:01:41.720> age<00:01:41.900> so

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
child's shoulder height and their age so

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.200 
child's shoulder height and their age so
what<00:01:42.770> are<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.980> advantages<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.580> icivics

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
what are the advantages of icivics

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.300 
what are the advantages of icivics
compatible<00:01:44.720> seats<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.620> main<00:01:45.800> benefit<00:01:46.280> of

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
compatible seats so the main benefit of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.140 
compatible seats so the main benefit of
ISOFIX<00:01:47.000> is<00:01:47.470> ease<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.530> fitment<00:01:49.130> especially<00:01:50.000> for

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
ISOFIX is ease of fitment especially for

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.730 
ISOFIX is ease of fitment especially for
those<00:01:50.240> people<00:01:50.300> that<00:01:50.660> find<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.170> they<00:01:51.380> need<00:01:51.410> to

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
those people that find that they need to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.670 
those people that find that they need to
move<00:01:51.950> child<00:01:52.640> seats<00:01:52.910> between<00:01:53.090> vehicles<00:01:53.720> it's

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
move child seats between vehicles it's

anchors the only other thing I guess to
note<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.500> at<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:40.190> moment<00:02:40.310> ISOFIX<00:02:41.300> child
