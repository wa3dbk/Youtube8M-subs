so<00:00:00.960> when<00:00:01.110> you<00:00:01.199> talk<00:00:01.380> about<00:00:02.419> detoxing<00:00:03.419> and

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
so when you talk about detoxing and

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.079 
so when you talk about detoxing and
getting<00:00:03.870> those<00:00:04.290> those<00:00:04.770> lead<00:00:05.160> getting<00:00:05.970> those

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
getting those those lead getting those

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.059 
getting those those lead getting those
metals<00:00:06.420> out<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.569> our<00:00:06.750> body<00:00:06.930> how<00:00:07.560> do<00:00:07.620> we<00:00:07.799> do<00:00:07.950> it

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
metals out of our body how do we do it

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.669 
metals out of our body how do we do it
and<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.309> have<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.179> be<00:00:09.269> careful<00:00:09.660> Kili<00:00:10.170> chelation

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
and we have to be careful Kili chelation

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.709 
and we have to be careful Kili chelation
means<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.309> word<00:00:11.460> chelation<00:00:11.910> means<00:00:12.330> metal

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
means the word chelation means metal

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.220 
means the word chelation means metal
binding<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.849> chelation<00:00:14.849> comes<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.960> comes

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
binding and chelation comes that comes

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.060 
binding and chelation comes that comes
from<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> word<00:00:16.710> Kili<00:00:17.310> CH<00:00:17.880> ele<00:00:18.750> hard<00:00:19.470> C<00:00:19.770> like<00:00:19.949> in

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
from the word Kili CH ele hard C like in

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.970 
from the word Kili CH ele hard C like in
chemistry<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.480> that's<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.590> Greek<00:00:22.800> word

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
chemistry and that that's a Greek word

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.019 
chemistry and that that's a Greek word
for<00:00:23.010> claw<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.800> that's<00:00:26.130> how<00:00:26.310> keulen<00:00:26.820> works

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
for claw and so that's how keulen works

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.050 
for claw and so that's how keulen works
it<00:00:27.210> claws<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.960> grabs<00:00:28.830> hold<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.760> like

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it claws and grabs hold like a like like

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.120 
it claws and grabs hold like a like like
the<00:00:30.210> steam<00:00:30.449> shovel<00:00:30.689> things<00:00:31.109> grabs<00:00:31.769> hold<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the steam shovel things grabs hold of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.370 
the steam shovel things grabs hold of
the<00:00:32.189> lead<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.640> cadmium<00:00:33.090> mercury<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.719> takes

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the lead the cadmium mercury and takes

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.380 
the lead the cadmium mercury and takes
it<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.829> kidney<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.690> puts<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.809> solution<00:00:37.350> so

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
it out the kidney it puts in solution so

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.110 
it out the kidney it puts in solution so
the<00:00:39.390> chelation<00:00:40.070> has<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.399> function<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the chelation has that function now the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.990 
the chelation has that function now the
chelation<00:00:42.510> isn't<00:00:42.960> smart<00:00:43.440> enough<00:00:43.579> to<00:00:44.579> choose

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
chelation isn't smart enough to choose

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760 
chelation isn't smart enough to choose
only<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.600> lead<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> other<00:00:46.110> poisonous

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
only the lead and the other poisonous

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.330 
only the lead and the other poisonous
metals

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
metals

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.119 
metals
it<00:00:47.910> also<00:00:48.090> takes<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.600> good<00:00:48.840> things<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.230> like

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it also takes out good things like like

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.689 
it also takes out good things like like
zinc<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.899> magnesium<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.590> calcium<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.460> takes

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
zinc and magnesium and calcium it takes

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.029 
zinc and magnesium and calcium it takes
these<00:00:53.879> things<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:54.410> but<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> takes<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
these things out but it takes out the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.130 
these things out but it takes out the
toxic<00:00:56.489> metals<00:00:56.820> preferentially<00:00:57.629> depending<00:00:58.079> on

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
toxic metals preferentially depending on

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
toxic metals preferentially depending on
which<00:00:58.289> chelating<00:00:58.800> agent<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
which chelating agent you use so the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
which chelating agent you use so the
best<00:01:00.600> chelating<00:01:01.050> agent<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.500> toxic<00:01:01.829> metals<00:01:02.129> is

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
best chelating agent for toxic metals is

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.210 
best chelating agent for toxic metals is
calcium<00:01:02.699> EDTA<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:04.019> next<00:01:04.290> best<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.739> sodium

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
calcium EDTA the next best is sodium

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.810 
calcium EDTA the next best is sodium
EDTA<00:01:05.990> EDTA<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.380> synthetic<00:01:07.650> amino<00:01:08.220> acid<00:01:08.640> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
EDTA EDTA is a synthetic amino acid so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.539 
EDTA EDTA is a synthetic amino acid so
amino<00:01:09.090> acids<00:01:09.540> are<00:01:09.689> very<00:01:09.900> innocent<00:01:10.549> block

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
amino acids are very innocent block

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.850 
amino acids are very innocent block

key<00:01:25.500> leaders<00:01:25.770> that's<00:01:26.549> where<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.880> get<00:01:27.030> what

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
key leaders that's where you get what

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.539 
key leaders that's where you get what
you<00:01:27.689> get<00:01:27.810> from<00:01:27.900> beans<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.530> example<00:01:29.009> beans<00:01:29.400> are

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
you get from beans for example beans are

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.140 
you get from beans for example beans are
good<00:01:29.700> natural<00:01:29.880> key<00:01:30.180> lighters<00:01:30.450> okay<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.640> so

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
good natural key lighters okay and so so

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.569 
good natural key lighters okay and so so
if<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.290> their<00:01:34.439> drawbacks<00:01:35.009> too<00:01:35.460> of

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
if you they have their drawbacks too of

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.530 
if you they have their drawbacks too of
course<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:37.159> but<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> beans<00:01:38.729> are<00:01:38.939> good

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
course but but but the beans are good

course but but but the beans are good
natural<00:01:39.750> key<00:01:40.079> leaders<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.299> give

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
natural key leaders and and if you give

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.740 
natural key leaders and and if you give
EDTA<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> form<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.310> calcium<00:01:44.520> EDTA<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.600> can

give it safely in fairly large amounts

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.380 
give it safely in fairly large amounts
quickly<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:50.009> hook<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> toxic

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
quickly and you can hook on to the toxic

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.510 
quickly and you can hook on to the toxic
metals<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.200> take<00:01:52.439> them<00:01:52.619> out<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> decrease

the body burden now I've seen wonderful
things<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.040> had<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.579> patient<00:01:56.759> once<00:01:57.090> who<00:01:57.439> was<00:01:58.439> a

steel trap young executive in the back
his<00:02:01.380> brain<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.009> incredibly<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.030> he

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
his brain was just incredibly and he

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
his brain was just incredibly and he
started<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.079> lose<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.619> his<00:02:04.799> late<00:02:05.130> 30s<00:02:05.520> 37

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
started to lose it and his late 30s 37

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.880
