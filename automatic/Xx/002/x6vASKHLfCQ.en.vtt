00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to tie it you just make a loop take the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.420 
to tie it you just make a loop take the
working<00:00:51.840> end<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.290> line<00:00:52.500> pass<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.340> around

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
working end of the line pass it around

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.180 
working end of the line pass it around
the<00:00:53.970> back<00:00:54.240> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.480> standing<00:00:54.989> part<00:00:55.200> and<00:00:55.500> right

the back of the standing part and right
back<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> loop<00:00:57.000> a<00:01:00.050> more<00:01:01.050> secure<00:01:01.560> version

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
back into the loop a more secure version

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.100 
back into the loop a more secure version
of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.610> figure<00:01:02.940> 8<00:01:03.090> especially<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:03.899> you're

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
of the figure 8 especially if you're

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.290 
of the figure 8 especially if you're
using<00:01:04.460> slippery<00:01:05.460> high-tech<00:01:06.240> line<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:08.120> to<00:01:09.120> go

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
using slippery high-tech line is to go

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.330 
using slippery high-tech line is to go
around<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.750> standing<00:01:10.260> part<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.800> then<00:01:11.100> take

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
around the standing part and then take

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.780 
around the standing part and then take
an<00:01:11.490> extra<00:01:11.880> half<00:01:11.909> turn<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.610> come<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.760> through

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
an extra half turn and come up through

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.200 
an extra half turn and come up through
the<00:01:15.150> loop<00:01:15.300> you<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.850> nice<00:01:17.850> tight

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the loop you get a nice tight

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.080 
the loop you get a nice tight
symmetrical<00:01:18.960> knot<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.440> it's<00:01:19.590> still<00:01:19.979> easy<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
symmetrical knot and it's still easy to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.289 
symmetrical knot and it's still easy to
untie<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:22.130> third<00:01:23.130> type<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> stopper<00:01:24.090> knot

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
untie a third type of stopper knot

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.360 
untie a third type of stopper knot
that's<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.780> little<00:01:24.960> bit<00:01:25.200> more<00:01:25.380> decorative<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
that's a little bit more decorative and

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.050 
that's a little bit more decorative and
a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.240> bit<00:01:27.390> more<00:01:27.540> permanent<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.909> called<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
a little bit more permanent is called a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.680 
a little bit more permanent is called a
triple<00:01:30.690> overhand<00:01:31.350> knot<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> Bight<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.770 
triple overhand knot you make a Bight of
line<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:35.280> take<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.790> working<00:01:36.150> end<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.450> pass

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
line you take the working end and pass

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
line you take the working end and pass
it<00:01:37.049> around<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.590> standing<00:01:38.010> part<00:01:38.250> three<00:01:38.670> times

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
it around the standing part three times

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.280 
it around the standing part three times
and<00:01:39.799> then<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.979> pass<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:42.420> working<00:01:42.840> end<00:01:42.990> right

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and then you pass the working end right

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.149 
and then you pass the working end right
back<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.830> through<00:01:44.070> those<00:01:44.220> loops<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.900> grab<00:01:45.900> it

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
back up through those loops and grab it

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.130 
back up through those loops and grab it
at<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.430> top<00:01:48.020> what<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.200> end<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:50.159> is
