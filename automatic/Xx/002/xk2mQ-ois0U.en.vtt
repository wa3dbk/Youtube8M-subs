00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.599
 hello everyone is steven and we're 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.429
 found today for a new 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.690
 video presentation of the big 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.820
 news from ios is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 and this time we will talk about the center 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.660
 of control I tell you entry for 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.980
 me it's the best novelty 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.619
 what does it bring you and set 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 it's extremely convenient and for 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.010
 activate it is simple you sweep 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.740
 the bottom screen up like those 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.900
 this is then the center of 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.059
 control seems he is perfectly 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.130
 integrated with ios is it goes very well with 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.320
 the brand new design with its background 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.730
 blurred in the background you see it is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.379
 here on the top 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.050
 five shortcuts for settings 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.360
 system so we have the airplane mode the wifi 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.850
 the bluetooth the mode do not disturb and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 right all the rotation at all times 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.940
 so you can display this center of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.610
 control to enable or disable 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.199
 one of his duties there was the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.270
 rotation for the orientation of the screen 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.160
 but we also have for example the mode 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.050
 airplane game activate it wifi 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.430
 automatically disables you saw it 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.960
 so we have a little color code 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.549
 when a function is active has 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.510
 displayed in white when it is 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.340
 disabled 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.840
 it's black so that's the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.909
 first thing that we find in this 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.140
 control center a few shortcuts 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.240
 for system settings 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.650
 so we do not have many just five 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.869
 month I would have liked for example 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.939
 to have the 3g but hey we can not everything 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.530
 have and just below you see it 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.750
 it 's the brightness control 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.549
 then we go down a little bit 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.590
 and this time it's the control of the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.500
 music with here the full volume too 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.259
 fair play break it back 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.640
 and select the progress of his song 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.990
 so that's the music control 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.159
 classic one that you will find 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.170
 in the music app 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.180
 except that there you have easy access 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.320
 in the control center do not have 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.850
 necessarily need to open your 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.130
 music app to change everything 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.710
 that you open the control center and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.930
 it's gone right below two others 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.430
 functions the first one is drop one 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.960
 big news ios is 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.450
 also and that I introduced you 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.810
 in a video in detail and just to 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.890
 right 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.500
 airplay to connect to 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.369
 compatible devices all the way down the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.219
 control center 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.880
 here we find four other shortcuts 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.039
 the flashlight 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.140
 the clock application the calculator and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.230
 the camera either out of 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.459
 quick launch shortcuts 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.920
 that look if I press their 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.959
 shortcuts of the calculator hop here is 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.700
 it's the calculator that appears and 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.470
 look I can also display the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.099
 control center inside the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.870
 applications 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.519
 and there you see that the blur is still 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.019
 present there for example a little bit about 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.060
 the right we see orange 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.099
 so it's really beautiful this everything 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.810
 new design of you and set up 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.290
 in every detail of the center of 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.819
 control 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.410
 so that's how these work 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.180
 little shortcuts to get back to them 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.799
 there you see that I was able to pass in 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.269
 the clock application just in 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.340
 pressing the clock shortcut 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.140
 this control center so you can 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.970
 use it on the home screen at 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.470
 inside applications but also 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.269
 which is excellent again 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.200
 is that you can activate it from 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.450
 the lock screen 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.060
 you slide from the bottom to the top and he 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.680
 is therefore no longer needed 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.450
 unlock your device to have 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.730
 access to all the features that 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.870
 proposes this control center and 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.340
 especially the flashlight 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.780
 imagine that your device is 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.200
 locked you need the lamp 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.180
 torch 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.829
 you can activate it easily so 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.660
 for example to find a lock 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.099
 in the dark where it can really be 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.109
 very convenient to have access to all that 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.400
 from the lock screen without 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.569
 need to slide for 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.489
 unlock our iphone 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.079
 so I repeat it to you excellent 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.660
 novelty that is this control center 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.040
 really accessible everywhere is seen by 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.120
 against it is possible that some 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.889
 of you find that this 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.540
 accessibility from any 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.579
 location of the device is a little bit 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.840
 embarrassing in this case no problem you 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.569
 you make in the settings and in the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.639
 section control center here you have 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.989
 the activation choice on the screen of 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.620
 lock and inside 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.239
 applications 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.010
 you see that cisse disable the 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.780
 control center is not accessible 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.030
 while when the button is a man 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.500
 it works so here so for a 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.329
 any reason you want to 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.769
 disable the control center on 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.959
 the locked screen or inside the 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.549
 applications you can but in any 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.069
 case it will still be accessible from 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.900
 the home screen 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.310
 another nice little detail to watch the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.959
 control center is also 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.599
 accessible in mode applications 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.980
 landscape like this so this time the 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.750
 design is a little bit different 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.310
 the display has changed compared to the mode 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.319
 portrait you have on the left the 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.329
 shortcuts for system settings on 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.160
 the right for apps and at 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.079
 batum backgrounds remains the control of the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.599
 brightness of music and airplay 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.370
 airdrop so that's it for everything there is 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.010
 important to know about this center of 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.400
 great novelty control of ios is and 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.590
 for me 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.330
 I repeat the best in all 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.250
 really the most useful case since 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.350
 find a lot of things very 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.080
 practice inside things that 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.820
 were missing and 6 most needed 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.259
 to go navigate in the settings or 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.880
 still in the music app 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.130
 we all in the control center 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.900
 so you also tell me what you 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.789
 have thought all this in the comments 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.560
 watch another video if you in 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.580
 had envy and I tell you to very 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.330
 soon for a next 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.330
 Hi
