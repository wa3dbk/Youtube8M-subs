you think about this car is about

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.340 
you think about this car is about

floating above the water here it was

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.839 
floating above the water here it was
incredibly<00:00:27.990> exciting<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.890> Jim<00:00:29.340> perform

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
incredibly exciting to see Jim perform

and I think it demonstrates the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.930 
and I think it demonstrates the
capability<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> car<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.220> well<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.790> our

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.819 

and<00:01:07.240> that's<00:01:07.479> when<00:01:07.780> you<00:01:07.929> think<00:01:08.229> this<00:01:08.499> is<00:01:08.649> the

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
and that's when you think this is the

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.249 
and that's when you think this is the
true<00:01:09.249> test<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:10.240> whether<00:01:10.450> this<00:01:10.749> is<00:01:10.810> going<00:01:11.170> to

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
true test of whether this is going to

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.109 
true test of whether this is going to
work<00:01:11.409> or<00:01:11.649> not<00:01:11.710> well<00:01:12.310> technology<00:01:12.789> has<00:01:12.880> always

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
work or not well technology has always

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.520 
work or not well technology has always
been<00:01:13.270> at<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.509> heart<00:01:13.719> of<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:13.929> jagged<00:01:14.319> round

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
been at the heart of the jagged round

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.440 
been at the heart of the jagged round
and<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.770> think<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.069> new<00:01:15.219> Jaguar<00:01:15.640> XF<00:01:16.000> brings

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
and I think the new Jaguar XF brings

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.999 
and I think the new Jaguar XF brings
forward<00:01:16.659> a<00:01:16.810> cutting<00:01:17.109> edge<00:01:17.229> in<00:01:17.500> terms<00:01:17.530> of<00:01:17.859> the

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
forward a cutting edge in terms of the

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.359 
forward a cutting edge in terms of the
latest<00:01:18.399> technology<00:01:19.090> that<00:01:19.869> Jaguar<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.679> a<00:01:20.920> very

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
latest technology that Jaguar is a very

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.039 
latest technology that Jaguar is a very
different<00:01:21.609> vehicle<00:01:22.179> and<00:01:22.390> that<00:01:22.569> and<00:01:22.929> that's

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
different vehicle and that and that's

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.169 
different vehicle and that and that's
why<00:01:23.229> we<00:01:23.259> chose<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.909> technology<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:24.939> tear<00:01:25.149> on

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
why we chose it technology and tear on

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:26.760 
why we chose it technology and tear on
any<00:01:25.479> new<00:01:25.659> jag<00:01:25.929> unit<00:01:26.289> even<00:01:26.409> from<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:26.740> very

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
any new jag unit even from the very

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.709 
any new jag unit even from the very
