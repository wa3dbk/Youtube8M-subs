00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
area of concern with the GM shoes that

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.530 
area of concern with the GM shoes that
we<00:03:01.440> reviewed<00:03:01.890> was<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.790> all-round<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.300> GM

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
we reviewed was the all-round of GM

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.300 
we reviewed was the all-round of GM
shoes<00:03:03.750> was<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.320> fact<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.740> they<00:03:05.010> didn't<00:03:05.190> have

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
shoes was the fact that they didn't have

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.680 
shoes was the fact that they didn't have
great<00:03:05.520> toe<00:03:05.790> protection<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.390> if<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.570> were

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
great toe protection so if you were

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.820 
great toe protection so if you were
going<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.930> take<00:03:07.080> one<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> foot<00:03:07.620> from<00:03:07.770> a

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
going to take one on the foot from a

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.560 
going to take one on the foot from a
Yorker<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.490> might<00:03:08.850> sting<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.210> little<00:03:09.300> bit

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
Yorker it might sting a little bit

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.820 
Yorker it might sting a little bit
whereas<00:03:09.810> with<00:03:09.960> these<00:03:10.110> it's<00:03:10.380> got<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> lot<00:03:10.740> of

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
whereas with these it's got a lot of

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.680 
whereas with these it's got a lot of
protection<00:03:10.950> there<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:12.120> certainly<00:03:12.540> isn't

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
protection there so certainly isn't

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.570 
protection there so certainly isn't
gonna<00:03:12.960> hurt<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.440> much<00:03:13.650> if<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.250> are<00:03:14.400> gonna

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
gonna hurt that much if you are gonna

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.280 
gonna hurt that much if you are gonna
wear<00:03:14.790> one<00:03:15.000> on<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.210> toe<00:03:15.480> again<00:03:16.080> my<00:03:16.230> advice

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
wear one on the toe again my advice

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.380 
wear one on the toe again my advice
would<00:03:16.590> always<00:03:16.770> be<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.040> use<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> bat<00:03:17.490> but<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.270> my

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
would always be to use the bat but in my

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.850 
would always be to use the bat but in my
case<00:03:18.450> sometimes<00:03:19.110> that's<00:03:19.320> not<00:03:19.530> always

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
case sometimes that's not always

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.370 
case sometimes that's not always
possible<00:03:20.270> now<00:03:21.270> moving<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.810> heat<00:03:21.990> onto

the<00:03:22.470> base<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.860> these<00:03:23.040> you'll<00:03:23.640> see<00:03:23.700> it's

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
the base of these you'll see it's

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.690 
the base of these you'll see it's
aligned<00:03:24.360> with<00:03:24.480> full<00:03:24.840> studs<00:03:25.170> here<00:03:25.460> you've<00:03:26.460> got

for marking your guard traditionally
just<00:03:33.150> there<00:03:33.420> like<00:03:33.660> I'm<00:03:33.810> doing<00:03:34.050> there<00:03:34.170> try<00:03:34.380> not

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
just there like I'm doing there try not

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.500 
just there like I'm doing there try not
to<00:03:34.620> scratch<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.040> floor<00:03:35.250> maybe<00:03:35.910> too<00:03:36.090> popular

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
here but you can see that it's coming

Majesties are rubber dimples there and

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.630 
Majesties are rubber dimples there and
you<00:03:51.990> might<00:03:52.350> think<00:03:52.380> that's<00:03:52.560> quite<00:03:52.890> good<00:03:52.920> for

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
you might think that's quite good for

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.640 
you might think that's quite good for
using<00:03:53.760> indoors<00:03:54.390> but<00:03:54.870> what<00:03:55.020> also<00:03:55.170> helps<00:03:55.440> to

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
using indoors but what also helps to

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.440 
using indoors but what also helps to
make<00:03:55.770> them<00:03:55.920> use<00:03:56.130> indoors<00:03:56.580> I'll<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.210> show<00:03:57.390> you

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
make them use indoors I'll just show you

make them use indoors I'll just show you
the<00:03:57.660> box<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.440> they<00:03:58.560> come<00:03:58.890> with<00:03:58.920> here<00:03:59.550> now<00:04:00.510> the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
the box that they come with here now the

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.090 
the box that they come with here now the
grand<00:04:01.230> unveiling<00:04:01.490> of<00:04:02.490> this<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:04.260> get<00:04:04.470> these<00:04:04.740> to

grand unveiling of this you get these to

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.130 
grand unveiling of this you get these to
come<00:04:05.250> with<00:04:05.430> them<00:04:05.640> so<00:04:06.570> again<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.840> can<00:04:06.930> see<00:04:07.110> a

the spikes at the back but also

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.120 
the spikes at the back but also
similarly<00:04:25.260> because<00:04:25.440> they<00:04:25.680> were

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
similarly because they were

said to be pretty lightweight so if I
just<00:05:52.020> get<00:05:52.440> that<00:05:52.680> on<00:05:52.830> these<00:05:53.490> scales<00:05:53.880> they're<00:05:54.270> so

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
just get that on these scales they're so

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.440

bearing<00:05:55.140> in<00:05:55.230> mind<00:05:55.260> around<00:05:56.160> we<00:05:56.460> go<00:05:56.640> bring<00:05:57.240> my

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
bearing in mind around we go bring my

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.580 
bearing in mind around we go bring my
500<00:05:58.200> we<00:05:58.320> said<00:05:58.530> was<00:05:58.710> our<00:05:58.830> base<00:06:00.350> get<00:06:01.350> that<00:06:01.470> in

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
500 we said was our base get that in

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.410 
500 we said was our base get that in
there<00:06:01.770> for<00:06:01.800> 71<00:06:02.580> it<00:06:02.700> just<00:06:02.850> proves<00:06:03.120> to<00:06:03.240> you<00:06:03.300> how

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
there for 71 it just proves to you how

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.090 
there for 71 it just proves to you how
lightweight<00:06:03.720> those<00:06:04.110> are<00:06:04.380> so<00:06:04.890> if<00:06:04.980> you're

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
lightweight those are so if you're

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.350 
lightweight those are so if you're
someone<00:06:05.430> who<00:06:05.490> really<00:06:05.730> values<00:06:06.060> that<00:06:06.210> and
