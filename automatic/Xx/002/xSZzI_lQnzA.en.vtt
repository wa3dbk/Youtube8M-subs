00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.859
 you what the plague pretty reliable to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.939
 I hope you have there 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.680
 today friends I have the honor of 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.320
 present you an attempt and me 2 g 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.520
 18 silent named general so I was 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.340
 arrived during the game 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.719
 so that the enemy is 5 years old so I 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.550
 I am told we are going for the attempt was not 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.510
 not many points in advance so I 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.309
 do not tell you right now he wants to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.500
 happen or not makes moab recipe you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.550
 will see for yourself 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.660
 so I immediately presented 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.950
 gameplay at the same time so we are 100 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.600
 my plate gives a thousand general with the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.340
 18 are then like everything else 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.980
 stone wood produced at five years of 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.170
 rather high shot and his lack of 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.430
 ammunition second to you this is a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 About portable radars drones 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.309
 and rap at rest because they have but 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 general will be there all when you have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.149
 a helmet and a better what but 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.500
 general with this asset you can do 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.549
 words with all the apps just 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.590
 because you can pre- choose that the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.210
 enemies that it is so it will be at least 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.680
 the top after the shock the trumps 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.640
 specialists pass not due to his cadence 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.140
 firing and are less ammo 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.130
 such extreme conditions since 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.350
 it is a melee weapon and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.850
 determination everywhere the assets 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.900
 specialists faster these four 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.450
 portable adam so portable radars 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.530
 to secure the area 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.000
 it's the best average it's a 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.310
 best thing to do to try the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.259
 moab in May general and the c4 because 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.270
 here are the cmt that will not be 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.890
 really top is to be able to see that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.630
 endurance gameplay I will vary 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.729
 between these two buildings between this side 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.170
 there and the other just because I 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.409
 I will not go tick all over the map 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.060
 what the g 18 when lucho it's 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.049
 impossible it could already see taloc on 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.369
 the guy who goes up the stairs 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.770
 I put a charger was still not 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.570
 dead so must manage between the two 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.470
 buildings and the better it is from your body 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.790
 to body that's why I varied 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.409
 between these two buildings 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.939
 so you'll be able to start 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.619
 video I put the subject code intro 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.630
 to call tv guy so I try to send 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.799
 the video coached leader code is the most 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.840
 geek tv so I hope you 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.060
 accept this video just because 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.040
 that it is an attempt mambo g18 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.840
 which is not necessarily much seen 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.020
 on youtube in general melee yet 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.910
 less so that's it helps to be a little 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.780
 original and varied a little bit 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.870
 weapons on call of duty 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.250
 so that's what I wanted 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.690
 speak in this video because already 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.599
 I do not have much time so the subject 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.530
 is going to be pretty fast so everything 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.550
 I just wanted to talk about 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.900
 workout between youtube hours 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.310
 on Youtube 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.870
 so basically on youtube you have the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.700
 big youtuber category means 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.830
 youtuber little youtuber so the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.989
 big youtuber I speak after 10000 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.720
 youtuber middle subscribers between ben miled 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.450
 and 10000 and small youtuber so between 0 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.500
 and 1000 so the big youtuber you 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.790
 can see that they will often make 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.110
 duels comments such as sir the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.200
 v12 here he commands with 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.540
 gotaga sir tech wars etc the means 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.670
 tube them too this between them by 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.250
 example during live etc 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.900
 but the little youtuber do not get 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.000
 ask between them and it's really a 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.130
 do not do it better 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.510
 really for me I did not know 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.010
 listen to me because here I am 500 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.319
 subscribers really it's a very good 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.730
 trick you asked for example a 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.700
 100 subscriber to make a duel 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.470
 commands tagged with him and ben him he 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.329
 has its 100 subscribers so its assets they 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.950
 will come without your channel and you your 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.230
 assets they will say about their thus 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.060
 big it can allow a little pierced 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.170
 in quotation marks on youtube a little 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.750
 little that help you 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.799
 after second technique for everything 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.299
 just a little more to be done 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.489
 know and community channel so 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.950
 that's really the top I think the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.980
 must therefore like coast qg coast cdf that the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.850
 play tv i can do that it can be too 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.299
 another solution 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.340
 so the best for me third 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.049
 solution for example you ask 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.160
 maybe not a big youtuber even by 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.859
 example to a person like me who have 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.690
 500 subscribers is you so 50 so me 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.489
 for example you ask please 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.959
 you can put me a like so I 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.850
 watch the video this wide audience and 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.040
 if you took video with an iphone 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.829
 you did a little zombies me I 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.940
 31 I'm not a layman and I really do not 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.769
 no longer the docks everyone but I 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.239
 mean for example we say you see if 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.010
 you typed quite sure your 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.620
 video if you really did 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.450
 exist racks the stuff is interesting and 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.190
 Well, here's a little bit like that 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.989
 really help you because it's the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.280
 subscribers as knew your homepage 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.819

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.310
 know about youtube anyway 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.440
 I hope these means will want more 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.760

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.770
 I do not say that they will walk me I know 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.360
