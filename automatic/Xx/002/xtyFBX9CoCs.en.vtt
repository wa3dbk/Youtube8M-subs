 download click and then download there 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 where do you want to personally I will not download 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.549
 since i already have this quack 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.189
 now I'll even show you like this 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.189
 quack so we go into it 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.350
 you can either extract it simplet in 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.740
 any folder or personal on disk d 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.080
 and wherever you want or you can just from 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:47.200
 archive open let's say the installer 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:49.530
 bandikama so choose the language for which 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.720
 want to install further ok 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.180
 then by the way 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.460
 license agreement does not consider Crimea 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.980
 words in English click accept 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.290
 and then choose the type of installation 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.180
 general or by choice I advise on 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.270
 choice because every established 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.869
 unnecessary garbage so we remove from here 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.670
 tick click next so select 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.420
 installation folder where you want 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.640
 install drive c and d where it will be 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.980
 like personally I won't be able to 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.610
 I'm already installed click 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.040
 to establish 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.190
 and left to the left in just about a minute 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.760
 half a minute 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.580
 depends on the weight of the bandits and weighs 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.660
 it's about 120 3 megabytes or maybe 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.160
 even a little more 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.560
 then you can take them game maker 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.660
 but itâ€™s best to open it and not just 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.480
 since i am now dealing with two clicks a 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.550
 best to open on behalf of 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.860
 admin for this you need 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.140
 extract let me show you 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.940
 extract them any disk i extract to disk 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.110
 d see 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:04.090
 click ok yes I just already have 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:07.989
 this one is already extracted so now we are now 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.530
 we will find it where we have and laid down vodka 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.489
 maker here it can be considered such 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.000
 maker here is the knife button and you press the button 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.760
 mice 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.050
 written to run on behalf of 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.700
 administration click on this left 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:27.940
 button and here you see it starts any 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.250
 e-mail address you can not drive your soap 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.080
 just come up with some left soap 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.090
 it is still not checked let's say 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.960
 Now we will think of something 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.170
 so spaceman 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.880
 the dog must put them at the end 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.630
 must be specially 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.360
 Must write mail . 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.590
 skid is a prerequisite for that 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.550
 to shout 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.780
 your bandicam then press register 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.930
 applications 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.450

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.110

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.370

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:25.760
