running<00:03:35.700> off<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.060> mark<00:03:36.330> so<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.930> don't<00:03:37.890> think<00:03:38.070> I

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
running off the mark so I don't think I

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.040 
running off the mark so I don't think I
do<00:03:38.340> think<00:03:38.580> that's<00:03:38.640> been<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> factored<00:03:39.930> in

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
do think that's been on the factored in

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.080 
do think that's been on the factored in
and<00:03:41.010> are<00:03:41.160> they<00:03:41.250> both<00:03:41.400> lightly<00:03:41.700> run<00:03:41.850> into<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
if possible but I'd it'll depend how he

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.640 
if possible but I'd it'll depend how he
gets<00:03:56.819> on<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.030> his<00:03:57.150> next<00:03:57.450> run<00:03:57.569> which<00:03:58.470> will

month or the festival and children

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.700 
month or the festival and children
I<00:04:03.700> thought<00:04:04.300> Burton<00:04:04.780> Porsche<00:04:05.020> had<00:04:05.200> got<00:04:05.380> plenty

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
I thought Burton Porsche had got plenty

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.860 
I thought Burton Porsche had got plenty
for<00:04:06.160> a<00:04:06.190> horse<00:04:06.430> that's<00:04:06.790> trouble<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:07.570> he's<00:04:07.690> not

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
for a horse that's trouble is he's not

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.900 
for a horse that's trouble is he's not
very<00:04:08.020> big

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.650 

and<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.740> know<00:04:12.740> he's<00:04:13.010> sort<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.430> he's<00:04:14.150> not<00:04:14.180> as<00:04:14.480> high

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
and I know he's sort of he's not as high

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.860 
and I know he's sort of he's not as high
as<00:04:14.930> what<00:04:15.170> he<00:04:15.320> was<00:04:15.790> two<00:04:16.790> years<00:04:17.030> ago<00:04:17.269> when<00:04:17.600> he<00:04:17.720> was

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
as what he was two years ago when he was

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.340 
as what he was two years ago when he was
second<00:04:18.260> in<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.380> Hennessy<00:04:18.920> but<00:04:19.870> he<00:04:20.870> isn't<00:04:21.290> a

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
second in the Hennessy but he isn't a

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.500 
second in the Hennessy but he isn't a
very<00:04:21.590> big<00:04:21.830> horse<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.460> would<00:04:23.030> seem<00:04:23.240> a<00:04:23.360> lot

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
very big horse so that would seem a lot

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.950 
very big horse so that would seem a lot
of<00:04:23.630> weight<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.810> carry<00:04:24.140> for<00:04:24.560> me<00:04:25.960> quantitative

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
of weight to carry for me quantitative

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.380 
of weight to carry for me quantitative
easing<00:04:27.370> one<00:04:28.370> has<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.700> be<00:04:28.820> careful<00:04:28.850> with

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
easing one has to be careful with

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.690 
easing one has to be careful with
because<00:04:29.840> he<00:04:30.530> will<00:04:30.740> have<00:04:30.890> to<00:04:31.040> finish<00:04:31.220> in<00:04:31.550> the

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
because he will have to finish in the

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.530 
because he will have to finish in the
first<00:04:32.000> four<00:04:32.690> at<00:04:33.560> cheltenham<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.850> be<00:04:35.000> qualified

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
first four at cheltenham to be qualified

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.810 
first four at cheltenham to be qualified
see<00:04:35.840> technically<00:04:36.200> he's<00:04:36.740> not<00:04:36.770> qualified<00:04:37.280> at

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
see technically he's not qualified at

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.540 
see technically he's not qualified at
the<00:04:37.850> moment<00:04:38.470> so<00:04:39.470> really<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.950> comes<00:04:40.100> down<00:04:40.280> to

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
the moment so really it comes down to

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
Jerry jump really well this forms its

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.560 
Jerry jump really well this forms its
ends<00:04:54.470> been<00:04:54.740> great<00:04:55.010> so<00:04:55.370> he'd<00:04:56.150> be<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.420> most

their last race and the other six were

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.550 
their last race and the other six were
placed<00:05:17.000> I<00:05:17.360> don't<00:05:17.990> believe<00:05:18.080> that's<00:05:18.320> ever

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.590 
placed I don't believe that's ever
happened<00:05:18.860> before<00:05:18.950> and<00:05:19.370> we've<00:05:20.270> even<00:05:20.420> got<00:05:20.570> a

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600

royal<00:05:20.810> ascot<00:05:20.960> winner<00:05:21.260> in<00:05:21.410> the<00:05:21.470> race<00:05:21.590> so<00:05:22.220> I

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
royal ascot winner in the race so I

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.610

think we've got a really high-quality

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.040 
think we've got a really high-quality
contest<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.820> hope<00:05:26.210> they<00:05:26.360> all<00:05:26.390> get<00:05:26.750> there

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.230 
contest I hope they all get there
certainly<00:05:27.350> the<00:05:27.500> top<00:05:27.710> 40<00:05:27.980> or<00:05:28.160> 50<00:05:28.430> get<00:05:28.580> there<00:05:28.760> how

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240
