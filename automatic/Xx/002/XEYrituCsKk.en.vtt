00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.089
 hello all you are seeing a great sea 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.639
 anyone in your room and you know 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:13.019
 because a lot of you a lot of 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.500
 people I like I like it like baby 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.750
 to like etc in the comment of oslo 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.910
 of the video that asks you if you want to see 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.670
 my computer a little bit simply and if 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.510
 you have wanted a very high amount of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.510
 people have wanted so 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.400
 what to say good to begin with I'm 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.349
 recording in the new camera that includes 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.260
 the computer a high definition camera 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.940
 how are you seeing this going wrong 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.790
 after the hairs of not doctor oil 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.620
 of the hospital abete type and in addition the 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.629
 microphone is the integrated and good I'm 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.629
 using the actor who is not bad 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:51.850
 but I have looks my dear friend 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.550
 pecata minuta so good then to 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.079
 next is I'm going to put a small 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.199
 video that is recorded by the mobile of 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.699
 how is it right now and desk already 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.100
 you are not seeing the computer that is 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.710
 quite similar has changed me the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.509
 design basically now they do 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.090
 unibody what they call them that is 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.550
 basically build it in a single 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.950
 aluminum piece weighs considerably less 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.470
 that have also put the frame before 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.960
 very cool black and I do not know that the most 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.160
 finite than in the previous and I do not know that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.179
 it has also changed the base is the one that 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.860
 is supported that you already see that as the 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.840
 air flows better and all that and in addition 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.149
 I have room to spare is saying that 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.159
 I'm trying, I can put the keyboard 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.369
 below is super this way ' 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.749
 and good by the way now that is 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.130
 living on the second screen are you 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:45.060
 seeing what that is 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.060
 if there are many people who have asked me 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:59.049
 so when I can put testing to 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.409
 see that those age smell hopefully sister and 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.240
 he left it auto spam and here we are from 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.489
 back and I want to show you a little bit 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.079
 I'm going to put some images here 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:09.819
 here for the data screen 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:13.510
 important of the computer that you are already 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.180
 seeing intel i7 of 2 with 6 gigahertz 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.310
 if I do not live like to see him he consulted if not 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.530
 2 with 6 gigahertz that can also 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.920
 increase if you miss 3 and I do not know 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.650
 how many do not know a curious thing 16 gb of 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.780
 ram so pulling you know like that I'm not staying 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.379
 without the graph it's a geforce nvidia of 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.940
 people 650 md a giga capacity and there 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.560
 people who have asked me how is that 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.650
 because they also have a laptop 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.310
 macbook pro but yours has line 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.470
 integrate 4000 integral of 4000 the good 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.510
 also but we have a range model 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.120
 high also includes having the graph 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.579
 delicate so the two are the price 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.049
 of one and the computer is changed from that 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.489
 change , how do you say this? 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.709
 responsible for switching between the two 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.400
 graphics when they are going to plant more 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.280
 interesting data I have status disk 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.079
 solid so if I speak this badly I can not 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.819
 make a video the cheeses so I see in a 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.599
 bit of 256 gigs that is that it is 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.239
 spectacular the change that give a 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:21.220
 computer with one thing of these 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.139
 who wants to try but you already know and 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.180
 something I say is the best you can 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.760
 do with a computer that you see that you 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.200
 lack some power to start the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.790
 ssd is a good buy in general and 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.129
 this would be the summary basically of what 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.170
 that is my new computer there are people that 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.200
 I'm sure one hundred percent to say 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.950
 as a passion pajero there is not one thing that 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.510
 there's a lot 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.580
 I should know what 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.080
 basic coexistence of the world and that is 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.620
 talk about money with people who 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:58.410
 you know is so museums 10 people and you've 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.970
 talked to me or anything then the 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.310
 price is something that is very ugly of you 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.290
 is very ugly remember is very ugly 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.760
 talk about that so whoever wants 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.200
 know what price you have to look for a 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.269
 little on the internet that is also not 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.680
 impossible to know and also remember that 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.870
 the price that you will find 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.139
 is necessarily the one who pays the most and 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.269
 as I say again that reason take or not 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.380
 you are busy, so we're not going to 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.239
 let this little video 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.700
 introductory how is my new 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.800
 I'm happy and I'm flying to the 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.169
 week remembering why there will be 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.120
 content today maybe so already 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.840
 you know a greeting and see you later 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.840
 luksic
