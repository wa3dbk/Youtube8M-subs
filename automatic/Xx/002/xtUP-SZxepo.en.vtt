the strobes have an optical slave system

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.400 
the strobes have an optical slave system
so<00:02:13.099> that<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.640> trigger<00:02:14.120> one<00:02:14.420> from<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.810> camera

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
so that you trigger one from the camera

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.710 
so that you trigger one from the camera
the<00:02:16.010> second<00:02:16.400> strobe<00:02:16.640> will<00:02:16.790> see<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.150> fire<00:02:17.420> an

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
the second strobe will see it fire an

the second strobe will see it fire an
old<00:02:17.989> firing<00:02:18.380> response<00:02:18.769> this<00:02:19.190> happens<00:02:19.579> pretty

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
old firing response this happens pretty

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.569 
old firing response this happens pretty
much<00:02:19.910> instantaneously

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
much instantaneously

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.309 
much instantaneously
the<00:02:22.579> trigger<00:02:22.879> portion<00:02:23.329> will<00:02:23.750> go<00:02:23.780> on<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.140> top
