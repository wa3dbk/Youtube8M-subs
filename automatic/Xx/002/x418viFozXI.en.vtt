approximates a good milkshake they come
in<00:00:39.510> different<00:00:39.600> flavors<00:00:39.810> this<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.350> think<00:00:40.410> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
in different flavors this I think is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.200 
in different flavors this I think is
just<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.890> plain<00:00:41.220> strawberry<00:00:41.490> this<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.030> this

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
just a plain strawberry this is this

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.300 
just a plain strawberry this is this
strawberry<00:00:42.510> banana<00:00:42.810> chocolate<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.980> also

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
strawberry banana chocolate and also

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.490 
strawberry banana chocolate and also
vanilla<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.960> really<00:00:46.200> want<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> know<00:00:46.470> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
vanilla and if you really want to know a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.300 
vanilla and if you really want to know a
lot<00:00:46.650> about<00:00:46.800> what<00:00:46.950> happened<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> would

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
lot about what happened I would

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.100 
lot about what happened I would
recommend<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.880> to<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.300> miry<00:00:48.480> infocom

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
recommend going to it and miry infocom

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.930 
recommend going to it and miry infocom
they<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> whole<00:00:49.800> page<00:00:50.010> dedicated<00:00:50.040> to<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
they have a whole page dedicated to the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
they have a whole page dedicated to the
recall<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.680> basically<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.829> main<00:00:52.980> point<00:00:53.130> I

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
recall and basically at the main point I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.470 
recall and basically at the main point I
want<00:00:53.220> to<00:00:53.340> make<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.880> really<00:00:54.180> isn't<00:00:54.300> an

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
want to make is that it really isn't an

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.990 
want to make is that it really isn't an
issue<00:00:54.600> anymore<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.530> believe<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.700> basically

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
issue anymore I believe it was basically

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.780 
issue anymore I believe it was basically
from<00:00:57.270> 2007<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.200> 2009<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:59.100> was<00:00:59.160> an<00:00:59.310> issue<00:00:59.460> I

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
from 2007 to 2009 there was an issue I

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.430 
from 2007 to 2009 there was an issue I
think<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> best<00:01:00.720> way<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> describe<00:01:01.200> it<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
think the best way to describe it is

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.249 
think the best way to describe it is
just<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.710> read<00:01:01.920> directly<00:01:02.489> from<00:01:02.579> Amari<00:01:03.570> AFRICOM

tried some of these and I've never
gotten<00:02:01.200> sick<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.969> probably<00:02:02.969> wouldn't<00:02:03.479> drink<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020

gotten sick I probably wouldn't drink a
whole<00:02:04.169> one<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.099> don't<00:02:05.669> it's<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.119> I

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
whole one and I don't it's not that I

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.699 
whole one and I don't it's not that I
want<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.359> take<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.509> chance<00:02:06.779> it's<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.289> for

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
want to take a chance it's just that for

want to take a chance it's just that for
as<00:02:07.829> far<00:02:07.919> as<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.099> could<00:02:08.190> tell<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> chances<00:02:08.759> are

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
as far as I could tell the chances are

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.919 
as far as I could tell the chances are
pretty<00:02:08.910> remote<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.479> you'd<00:02:09.569> actually<00:02:09.660> get

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
pretty remote that you'd actually get

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.270 
pretty remote that you'd actually get
sick<00:02:10.229> they<00:02:10.380> were<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.649> trying<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.009> safe

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
sick they were just trying to be safe

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.039 
sick they were just trying to be safe
and<00:02:11.939> that<00:02:12.090> was<00:02:12.180> why<00:02:12.269> they<00:02:12.390> made<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.659> blanket

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
and that was why they made that blanket

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.839 
and that was why they made that blanket
recall<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:14.010> good<00:02:14.129> news<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.610> if<00:02:14.730> you're

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
recall the good news is that if you're

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.580 
recall the good news is that if you're
in<00:02:14.939> the<00:02:15.000> market<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.360> MREs<00:02:15.750> you're<00:02:16.409> probably

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
in the market for MREs you're probably

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.360 
in the market for MREs you're probably
not<00:02:16.769> gonna<00:02:16.920> want

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
not gonna want

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
from June 2009 or earlier the only way

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.430 
from June 2009 or earlier the only way
you<00:02:20.879> get<00:02:21.209> those<00:02:21.390> would<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.900> if<00:02:21.989> some<00:02:22.200> seller

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
you get those would be if some seller

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.839 
you get those would be if some seller
was<00:02:22.650> being<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.890> little<00:02:23.099> bit<00:02:23.190> dishonest<00:02:23.430> and

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
was being a little bit dishonest and

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.339 
was being a little bit dishonest and
trying<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.180> pass<00:02:24.390> them<00:02:24.569> off<00:02:24.720> as<00:02:24.750> newer<00:02:25.140> than

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
trying to pass them off as newer than

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.380 
trying to pass them off as newer than
they<00:02:25.650> actually<00:02:25.769> are<00:02:26.090> as<00:02:27.090> long<00:02:27.209> as<00:02:27.239> you're

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
they actually are as long as you're

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.430 
they actually are as long as you're
getting<00:02:27.569> them<00:02:27.690> from<00:02:27.780> after<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.230> period

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
getting them from after that period

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.479 
getting them from after that period
you'll<00:02:28.950> be<00:02:29.040> fine

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
you'll be fine

should mention the reason I know this
was<00:05:11.310> from<00:05:11.870> 2014<00:05:12.870> because<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.159> came<00:05:14.250> from<00:05:14.400> a

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
was from 2014 because it came from a

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.420 
was from 2014 because it came from a
case<00:05:14.699> that<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.509> opened<00:05:16.110> that<00:05:16.139> was<00:05:16.349> for<00:05:16.470> 2014<00:05:17.159> if

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
case that I opened that was for 2014 if

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.850 
case that I opened that was for 2014 if
you<00:05:17.610> were<00:05:17.729> buying<00:05:17.940> loose<00:05:18.300> components<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.740> you

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
you were buying loose components and you

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.020 
you were buying loose components and you
really<00:05:20.130> didn't<00:05:20.370> know<00:05:20.430> what<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.669> came<00:05:20.819> from

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
really didn't know what it came from

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.600 
really didn't know what it came from
then<00:05:22.020> obviously<00:05:22.139> this<00:05:22.470> for<00:05:22.710> zero<00:05:22.979> to<00:05:23.280> four

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
then obviously this for zero to four

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.839 
then obviously this for zero to four
could<00:05:24.000> be<00:05:24.180> from<00:05:24.330> 2004<00:05:25.110> instead<00:05:25.470> of<00:05:25.560> 2014<00:05:26.370> so<00:05:26.789> I

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
could be from 2004 instead of 2014 so I

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.010 
could be from 2004 instead of 2014 so I
guess<00:05:27.000> I<00:05:27.090> deserve<00:05:27.419> something<00:05:27.599> you<00:05:27.780> would<00:05:27.900> want

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020
