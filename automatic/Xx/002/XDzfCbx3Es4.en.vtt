00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.620 
and then here's my part on this side now
overall<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.069> think<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.459> unit<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.060> pretty

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
overall I think the unit is pretty

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.620 
overall I think the unit is pretty
snazzy<00:02:21.959> but<00:02:22.799> for<00:02:23.250> me<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.579> would<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.390> knots

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
snazzy but for me I would like the knots

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.900 
snazzy but for me I would like the knots
to<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.290> bleached<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.860> little<00:02:26.130> bit<00:02:26.250> more<00:02:26.459> right

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
to be bleached a little bit more right

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.759 
to be bleached a little bit more right
in<00:02:27.180> where<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.569> lace<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.319> other<00:02:28.500> than<00:02:28.680> that

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
in where the lace is but other than that

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.160 
in where the lace is but other than that
I<00:02:29.099> have<00:02:29.340> no<00:02:29.400> issues<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.209> unit<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.660> think

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
I have no issues with the unit I think

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.440 
I have no issues with the unit I think
it's<00:02:31.349> absolutely<00:02:31.560> beautiful<00:02:32.400> now<00:02:33.209> i'm<00:02:33.269> just

probably<00:03:11.850> used<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.389> little<00:03:12.569> bit<00:03:12.750> too<00:03:12.959> much<00:03:13.139> but

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
probably used a little bit too much but

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.800 
probably used a little bit too much but
i<00:03:13.709> have<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:13.980> say<00:03:14.340> i<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.970> unit<00:03:15.299> better<00:03:15.569> in

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
i have to say i like the unit better in

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.440 
i have to say i like the unit better in
its<00:03:16.079> natural<00:03:16.500> state<00:03:16.889> without<00:03:17.459> any<00:03:17.790> product<00:03:18.329> in

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
its natural state without any product in

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.660 
its natural state without any product in
it<00:03:18.569> at<00:03:18.660> all<00:03:18.810> more<00:03:19.620> than<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:19.889> like<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.370> part

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
it at all more than I like this part

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.160
