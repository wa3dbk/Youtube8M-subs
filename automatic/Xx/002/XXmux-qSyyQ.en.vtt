00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello all nice to you again 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.400
 I want to let you six tonight 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.049
 see i have explained to him the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.160
 fish bone braid one with two 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.389
 tufts 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.519
 only I want to leave him that way 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.990
 see how long adjust and often spent what 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.610
 i like that very much it is her 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.859
 lay just a little loose above it 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.800
 and that what that way 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.270
 nonchalant what tousled looks what 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.100
 I think that's cool is that you just 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.269
 I really can make the look in our country 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.439
 find it very cool one 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.180
 jeans and then for example one 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.800
 shirt over the shoulder 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.599
 very nice look i'll show you some photos 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.980
 then you will see how they are 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.980
 what the thread and then we start 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.940
 but you first choose is 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.309
 the direction you want to wear her 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.989
 my shadow falls here but i like it 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.820
 nice when the top we bulbs falls so 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.409
 I'm going to look the other way and 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.780
 as you can see what her actually is 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.659
 back then you have very easy 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.440
 if you have volume quickly I will do the rest 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.090
 from my hair to the other side 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.830
 I now have that curl as you see 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.840
 in van yeast I myself in that of fine 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.220
 because I have very stylish hair 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.049
 and i think i 'll lower you than anything 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.659
 come out nicer but it is of course possible 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.729
 even with stylish hair you like your hair 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.470
 keep it at one length then it is 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.539
 The herringbone braid can definitely be a nuisance 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.780
 a bit less loose from the 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.270
 that's the only difference i do i do 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.220
 keep these layers just loosely rich 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.140
 do nothing with it 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.840
 I will only start at the bottom of what I do 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.539
 two divide two pieces and you take 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.670
 once an outer of a pluck and 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.229
 that goes to the other side I do 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.110
 here also 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.460
 on the outside, pick up a tuft and it goes 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.530
 to the other side 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.939
 so you only have two every time 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.310
 picking 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.310
 more outside to the other side 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:08.079
 more the outer picking and that's how you build it 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.700
 on it is a braid on which you have no 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:12.820
 must put voltage so it is possible 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:18.480
 usually stay a bit looser 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:20.890
 4 outside braid again and here again 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:27.480
 you see so i still have my two 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.480
 pick and not too tight keep nice and loose 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.120
 then a little closer and then being able to 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.010
 you see it well 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.690
 you grab the outside of the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.690
 picking and going to the other side 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.120
 as you can see, I don't care at all 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.800
 a hair i really hope to be looser 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.590
 This is also a braid that you don't like 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.510
 gets a lot of tension then it goes too 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.280
 during the day with sagging and 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.280
 that's just so cool because then you really 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.480
 have a nonchalant effect 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.070
 you can see part of the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.400
 outside and you go that far 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.400
 possible 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.120
 I do not opt for it at all 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.830
 to go to the very end 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.260
 because i like it when they just 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.870
 on the curl you also go further into the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.610
 point goes the thinner your braids 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.690
 a rubber band thus came as 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.690
 I have a transparent one again 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.700
 you put it in and what I always do 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.160
 delicately so here pigtail a bit 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.080
 pull it out so that it is nice again 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.730
 again to get in our country and he throws 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:48.420
 then really thicker and I take care of it 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:52.830
 that everywhere in terms of thickness a bit 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.910
 the same look i have here that 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.670
 were kept loose 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.590
 I keep it nice and loose and like me 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.790
 just said because i am against her green 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.769
 go direction 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.110
 do you really have some volume here i think 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.790
 itself very nice there 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.380
 here too we are picking loose that late 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.610
 I also just go that makes it too 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.260
 not just a time out 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.450
 particle behind your ear 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.440
 one with actually also in terms of ideal whole 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.150
 easy 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.690
 and as you can see you have a whole one 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.890
 and in our country the very nice look 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.890
 will show him to you for a moment 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.129
 well that was a fishbone braid 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.050
 but then in the way such as name or 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.300
 stars may wire I have chosen 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.370
 a little more curl but that is your own 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.500
 initiative so do what you yourself do 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.479
 want your own creativity in you 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.560
 hairstyles that way really gives it 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.629
 again who you are 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.949
 do not try to choose a capsule 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:48.050
 that doesn't suit you but keep it 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.069
 always close to yourself where you are 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.080
 feel comfortable with 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.629
 you have to do that because you will shine too 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.979
 really that self-confidence from that for it 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:55.639
