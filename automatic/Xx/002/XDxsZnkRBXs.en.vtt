00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.260 
what's last night last night to result
me<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.520> conclusion<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.180> think

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
me and for your conclusion well I think

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.179 
me and for your conclusion well I think
it's<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.900> positive<00:01:34.380> sign<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.920> sense

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
it's just a positive sign in the sense

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's just a positive sign in the sense
that<00:01:35.280> they<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.759> teams<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.390> tournament

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
that they know teams in this tournament

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.999 
that they know teams in this tournament
will<00:01:36.900> bunker<00:01:37.229> against<00:01:37.590> them<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.700 
will bunker against them you have to
expect<00:01:38.369> Cuba<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> u.s.<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:39.990> passing

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
expect Cuba to that the u.s. out passing

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.530 
expect Cuba to that the u.s. out passing
believes<00:01:41.040> by<00:01:41.250> three<00:01:41.670> times<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.329> match

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
believes by three times in this match

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.929 
believes by three times in this match
more<00:01:42.840> than<00:01:42.960> 600<00:01:43.590> passes<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.490> encouraging

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
more than 600 passes so it's encouraging

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.030 
more than 600 passes so it's encouraging
to<00:01:45.000> see<00:01:45.299> them<00:01:45.540> understand<00:01:46.229> how<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.710> break<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
to see them understand how to break a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.620 
to see them understand how to break a
team<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.579> down<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> early<00:01:48.420> goals

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
team like that down the early goals

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
team like that down the early goals
certainly<00:01:49.470> important<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
certainly important but you have to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.490 
certainly important but you have to
expect<00:01:50.729> Cuba<00:01:51.090> will<00:01:51.210> do<00:01:51.329> similar<00:01:51.689> things<00:01:51.720> can

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
expect Cuba will do similar things can

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.859 
expect Cuba will do similar things can
Wondolowski<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> same<00:01:53.790> poacher<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.630> front

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
Wondolowski be the same poacher in front

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.480 
Wondolowski be the same poacher in front
of<00:01:54.960> net<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.380> they<00:01:55.500> rack<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> same<00:01:56.340> amount

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
of net can they rack up the same amount

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
of net can they rack up the same amount
of<00:01:56.759> passes<00:01:57.210> that's<00:01:57.689> yet<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.079> seen<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.439> I

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
of passes that's yet to be seen but I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.780 
of passes that's yet to be seen but I
think<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.979> good<00:01:59.189> step<00:01:59.430> forward<00:01:59.700> for

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
think this is a good step forward for

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.280 
think this is a good step forward for
the<00:01:59.939> Sun<00:02:00.180> yeah<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.659> course<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.930> mentioned
