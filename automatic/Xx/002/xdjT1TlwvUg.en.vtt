00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:25.824
Whenever I feel painful, I want you to hug me,

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:32.662
and to touch my soul, just like what you have been doing.

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:37.758
Whenever I feel confused,

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:41.399
You always give me a kind of warmth.

00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:47.324
Just like someone hugging me tightly with her arms.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.040
I love you, China.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.032
My dear mother.

00:00:56.478 --> 00:01:00.146
I burst into tears for you.

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:04.441
I am also proud for you.

I love you, China.

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:11.550
My dear mother.

I burst into tears for you.

00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:18.526
I am also proud for you.

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:24.254
I hope that you remember me.

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:26.659
Your child who is still roaming.

00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:32.082
Wherever I am and whenever it is,

00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:34.392
I always miss you.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.690
I hope that you know

00:01:40.353 --> 00:01:43.164
What you mean to me.

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:46.654
Wherever I am and whenever it is,

00:01:47.097 --> 00:01:51.317
You are like my life.
