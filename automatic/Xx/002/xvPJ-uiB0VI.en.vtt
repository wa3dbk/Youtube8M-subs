 hello friends and welcome to another tuto 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.320
 Tuesday, thank you very much for all your 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.369
 comments today I'm going to draw drops of 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.099
 water on a face this tutorial does not 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.020
 is about how to draw a face if 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.350
 you want to see the technique with which I made 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.949
 I advise you to watch the video in the 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.689
 portrait of miranda face and if you want 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.870
 know how to do the proportions 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.260
 correct look at the video of how to draw 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.920
 a face I will put the two links to the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.219
 end of this one 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.339
 but today we are going to make water only to that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.190
 we are going to sink not today we are going to 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.949
 draw water drops 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.850
 for this with a lace more or less 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.969
 lasts a long time ago or the way it 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.820
 I want to darken the edges to 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.060
 give it some shade and then with a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.530
 moldable eraser clarified some parts 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.530
 and I give him flashes of light 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.720
 Y 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.200
 I can use a brush to blur and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.680
 fade and so there's not too much 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.680
 rigid 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.930
 If I want even more light I use a 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.090
 pencil type eraser or could also 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.090
 use a normal eraser for the time 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.820
 I can work the drops backwards, that is, 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.750
 first erase and then do the 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.500
 shades 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.500
 everyone 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.670
 in case you have not seen the video how 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.620
 draw a drop of water I will also put 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.620
 the link at the end of this 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.849
 of course some are more marked and 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.849
 others are almost imperceptible 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.840
 I try to follow the shape of the face in 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.840
 the runoff 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.700
 ah 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.740
 down here let's put some 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.830
 squirts 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.830
 to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.280
 two 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.280
 ah 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.520
 now let's make the fund I try to give the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.370
 form of the waves to the distance are more 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.760
 small and the closer the more 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.760
 big 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.590
 ah 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.860
 he also hinted at the shape of the waves 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.860
 that she would cause when leaving the water 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.800
 Y 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.170
 I give him a tone with the pencil blurred with 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.180
 the brush to make it more uniform and 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.180
 I make them light with the global draft 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.090
 I'm going to 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.580
 messing up a bit to make it look more 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.580
 real like it came out of the water 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.190
 very good we are finishing 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.250
 I would love that in the comments I 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.580
 tell if this seemed useful to you and if 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.580
 taste 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.530

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.780
