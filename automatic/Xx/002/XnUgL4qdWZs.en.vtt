scent<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.390> also<00:02:18.780> neutral<00:02:19.290> cage<00:02:19.590> pretty<00:02:20.370> much

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
scent and also neutral cage pretty much

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.540 
scent and also neutral cage pretty much
I've<00:02:21.510> taken<00:02:21.900> out<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.440> few<00:02:23.010> little<00:02:23.220> toys<00:02:23.430> and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
cheese for them so again they won't have

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.690 
cheese for them so again they won't have
to<00:02:28.410> fight<00:02:28.740> over<00:02:29.390> toys<00:02:31.130> it's<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.370> better<00:02:32.550> for

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
to fight over toys it's just better for

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.470 
to fight over toys it's just better for
them

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
them

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.900 
them
when<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> put<00:02:34.490> this<00:02:35.490> one<00:02:35.700> here<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.800> cage<00:02:38.040> she

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
when I put this one here in the cage she

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.630 
when I put this one here in the cage she
got<00:02:39.090> was<00:02:39.210> chasing<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.840> around<00:02:40.340> chasing<00:02:41.340> her

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
got was chasing it around chasing her

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.660 
got was chasing it around chasing her
around<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.830> she's<00:02:43.830> been<00:02:44.010> really<00:02:44.040> dominant

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
around and she's been really dominant

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.600 
around and she's been really dominant
and<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.650> thought<00:02:46.650> they<00:02:46.770> were<00:02:46.830> gonna<00:02:46.950> fight<00:02:47.340> and

and I thought they were gonna fight and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.120 
and I thought they were gonna fight and

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
the bars I think as well cuz it'd just

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.909 
the bars I think as well cuz it'd just
be<00:05:12.550> nicer<00:05:12.729> for<00:05:12.910> them<00:05:13.120> and<00:05:13.690> I<00:05:14.440> would<00:05:14.590> try<00:05:14.860> and

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
be nicer for them and I would try and

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.570 
be nicer for them and I would try and
find<00:05:15.039> some<00:05:15.400> hooks<00:05:15.669> to<00:05:16.180> make<00:05:16.330> hammocks<00:05:16.810> as<00:05:17.229> well
