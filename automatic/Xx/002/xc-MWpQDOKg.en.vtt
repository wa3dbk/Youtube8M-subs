okay<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:05.970> next<00:00:06.000> cut<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:07.200> stop<00:00:07.440> cut<00:00:07.710> and

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
okay this next cut is the stop cut and

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.510 
okay this next cut is the stop cut and
push<00:00:08.040> cut<00:00:09.080> this<00:00:10.080> would<00:00:10.290> be<00:00:10.379> used<00:00:10.590> for<00:00:10.950> creating

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
push cut this would be used for creating

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.119 
push cut this would be used for creating
a<00:00:11.580> notch<00:00:11.850> or<00:00:12.690> any<00:00:13.199> kind<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.619> fine<00:00:13.889> work

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:14.129 
a notch or any kind of fine work

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.910 
a notch or any kind of fine work
involving<00:00:14.760> cutting<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.600> tenon<00:00:15.809> or<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> joint<00:00:16.650> or

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
involving cutting a tenon or a joint or

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.070 
involving cutting a tenon or a joint or
anything<00:00:17.250> along<00:00:17.400> those<00:00:17.580> lines<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:18.660> first<00:00:18.869> cut

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
anything along those lines the first cut

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.650 
anything along those lines the first cut
we<00:00:19.199> make<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> stop<00:00:19.860> cut<00:00:20.130> now<00:00:21.000> for<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.390> we

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
we make is the stop cut now for that we

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.680 
we make is the stop cut now for that we
just<00:00:21.690> literally<00:00:22.170> roll<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.620> knife<00:00:22.800> around

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
just literally roll the knife around

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.630 
just literally roll the knife around
applying<00:00:24.690> downward<00:00:24.900> pressure<00:00:25.490> what<00:00:26.490> this

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
applying downward pressure what this

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880 
applying downward pressure what this
effectively<00:00:26.789> does<00:00:27.360> is<00:00:28.050> cut<00:00:28.350> through<00:00:28.620> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
effectively does is cut through the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.470 
effectively does is cut through the
length<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> grain<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.880> that's<00:00:30.060> our<00:00:30.240> stop

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
length of the grain so that's our stop

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.700 
length of the grain so that's our stop
cut<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.500> when<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.830> apply<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.160> push<00:00:32.489> cut

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
cut so that when we apply the push cut

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.270 
cut so that when we apply the push cut
it<00:00:34.710> stops<00:00:35.070> at<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.310> point<00:00:37.100> we<00:00:38.100> keep

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
it stops at that point we keep

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.170 
it stops at that point we keep
alternating<00:00:38.910> between<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.239> stop<00:00:39.989> cut<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:41.180> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
alternating between the stop cut and the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.479 
alternating between the stop cut and the
push<00:00:42.390> cut<00:00:44.149> slowly<00:00:45.149> taking<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:45.690> material<00:00:45.810> off

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
push cut slowly taking the material off

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.470 
push cut slowly taking the material off
one<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> important<00:00:48.090> things<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> remember

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
one of the important things to remember

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
one of the important things to remember
with<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.930> cut<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.530> your<00:00:49.770> right<00:00:49.950> hand<00:00:50.160> does

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
with this cut is your right hand does

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310 
with this cut is your right hand does
very<00:00:50.550> little<00:00:50.579> work<00:00:50.970> it's<00:00:51.660> actually<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.110> push

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
very little work it's actually the push

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.319 
very little work it's actually the push
with<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:52.559> thumb<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:55.530> creates<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.040> cut<00:00:56.329> so

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
with your thumb that creates the cut so

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.750 
with your thumb that creates the cut so
I<00:00:57.600> only<00:00:57.809> need<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.170> hold<00:00:58.380> this<00:00:58.500> blade<00:00:58.710> lightly

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.870 

it's<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> pushing<00:01:03.210> action<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> thumb

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
it's the pushing action with the thumb

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.099 
it's the pushing action with the thumb
that<00:01:05.880> allows<00:01:06.090> me<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> make<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> cut<00:01:09.109> that's

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109 
that allows me to make the cut that's

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:17.090 
that allows me to make the cut that's
the<00:01:10.259> push<00:01:10.439> cut<00:01:11.719> and<00:01:12.719> the<00:01:12.810> stop<00:01:13.049> cut<00:01:15.859> ok<00:01:16.859> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the push cut and the stop cut ok the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800 
the push cut and the stop cut ok the
next<00:01:17.310> cut<00:01:17.490> I'm<00:01:17.579> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.819> show<00:01:17.969> you<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.450> is

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
next cut I'm going to show you is is

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.179 
next cut I'm going to show you is is
quite<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> tricky<00:01:19.560> cut<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.100> right<00:01:20.569> and

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
quite a tricky cut to get right and

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.260 
quite a tricky cut to get right and
sometimes<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.490> construed<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.029> cutting

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
sometimes can be construed as cutting

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.940 
sometimes can be construed as cutting
towards<00:01:24.719> yourself<00:01:24.840> which<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.380> lot<00:01:25.529> of<00:01:25.560> people

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
towards yourself which a lot of people

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.370 
towards yourself which a lot of people
you<00:01:26.490> know<00:01:26.549> think<00:01:27.359> is<00:01:27.539> a<00:01:27.569> bad<00:01:27.810> thing

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you know think is a bad thing

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.499 
you know think is a bad thing
it<00:01:28.770> isn't<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.310> long<00:01:29.579> as<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.819> done<00:01:29.969> in<00:01:30.029> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it isn't as long as it's done in a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.230 
it isn't as long as it's done in a
controlled<00:01:30.929> way<00:01:31.340> now<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.789> you'll<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> lot

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
controlled way now what you'll see a lot

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.910 
controlled way now what you'll see a lot
of<00:01:33.270> people<00:01:33.659> doing<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.139> applying<00:01:34.319> pressure

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
of people doing is applying pressure

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.679 
of people doing is applying pressure
towards<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.399> blade<00:01:35.609> with<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:35.819> thumb<00:01:36.149> this<00:01:36.539> is

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
towards the blade with the thumb this is

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.410 
towards the blade with the thumb this is
an<00:01:36.899> extremely<00:01:37.649> bad<00:01:37.979> idea<00:01:38.029> the<00:01:39.029> number<00:01:39.299> of

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
an extremely bad idea the number of

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.269 
an extremely bad idea the number of
thumbs<00:01:39.749> that<00:01:40.049> I've<00:01:40.200> seen<00:01:40.499> cut<00:01:40.770> from<00:01:40.979> people

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:41.279 
thumbs that I've seen cut from people

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:43.010 
thumbs that I've seen cut from people
doing<00:01:41.459> this<00:01:41.700> when<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> knife<00:01:42.209> unexpectedly

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
doing this when the knife unexpectedly

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.690 
doing this when the knife unexpectedly
goes<00:01:43.289> through<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.709> material<00:01:44.219> straight<00:01:44.520> into

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
goes through the material straight into

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
goes through the material straight into
their<00:01:44.849> thumb<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.749> don't<00:01:45.929> even<00:01:46.109> want<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.289> know

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
their thumb you don't even want to know

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.039 
their thumb you don't even want to know
about<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.669> looks<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.569> that's<00:01:48.810> being

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
about but this looks like that's being

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.050 
about but this looks like that's being
done<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.469> it<00:01:49.590> isn't<00:01:49.889> what<00:01:50.459> we're<00:01:50.609> doing<00:01:50.819> here

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
done but it isn't what we're doing here

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.480 
done but it isn't what we're doing here
is<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> squeeze<00:01:51.569> cut<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.169> the<00:01:53.159> way<00:01:53.279> this

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
is the squeeze cut and the way this

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.849 
is the squeeze cut and the way this
works<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.209> on<00:01:54.899> applying<00:01:55.289> pressure<00:01:55.529> with<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
works is on applying pressure with the

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.059 
works is on applying pressure with the
thumb<00:01:56.389> but<00:01:57.389> the<00:01:57.509> thumb<00:01:57.779> is<00:01:58.349> offset<00:01:58.859> to<00:01:59.039> the

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
thumb but the thumb is offset to the

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.649 
thumb but the thumb is offset to the
side<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.489> the<00:01:59.549> blade<00:01:59.759> what<00:02:00.389> I'm<00:02:00.509> actually

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
side of the blade what I'm actually

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.649 
side of the blade what I'm actually
doing<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.109> squeezing<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.889> the<00:02:02.009> hand<00:02:02.569> so<00:02:03.569> I'm

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
doing is squeezing with the hand so I'm

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.999 
doing is squeezing with the hand so I'm
applying<00:02:03.899> pressure<00:02:04.289> with<00:02:04.529> the<00:02:04.619> thumb<00:02:04.859> and

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
applying pressure with the thumb and

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.949 
applying pressure with the thumb and
squeezing<00:02:05.489> with<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> hand<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> blade<00:02:06.810> is

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
squeezing with the hand so the blade is

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.930 
squeezing with the hand so the blade is
going<00:02:07.200> nowhere<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.739> it's<00:02:08.310> certainly<00:02:08.729> going

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
going nowhere and it's certainly going

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.609 
going nowhere and it's certainly going
nowhere<00:02:09.360> near<00:02:09.539> any<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.899> my<00:02:10.050> fingers

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
nowhere near any of my fingers

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.880 
nowhere near any of my fingers
so<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.520> I'm<00:02:11.700> applying<00:02:11.940> pressure

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.240 

with<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> thumb<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:21.560> blade<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.890> coming<00:02:22.070> to

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
with the thumb the blade is coming to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.060 
with the thumb the blade is coming to
the<00:02:22.370> side<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.930> can<00:02:24.110> be<00:02:24.200> used<00:02:24.410> for<00:02:24.620> much<00:02:24.770> finer

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
the side it can be used for much finer

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.920 
the side it can be used for much finer
work<00:02:25.400> much<00:02:25.910> delicate<00:02:26.420> too<00:02:26.630> much<00:02:26.780> more

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
work much delicate too much more

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.280 
work much delicate too much more
delicate<00:02:27.320> work<00:02:27.500> than<00:02:27.710> any<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.040> other<00:02:28.160> cuts

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.510 

and<00:02:33.290> at<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.470> same<00:02:33.590> time<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:34.010> quite<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.250> strong

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
and at the same time it's quite a strong

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.860 
and at the same time it's quite a strong
cut<00:02:34.820> because<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.300> application<00:02:35.390> of

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
cut because of the application of

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.130 
cut because of the application of
pressure<00:02:36.140> with<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.440> thumb<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.870> that's<00:02:38.990> the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
pressure with the thumb so that's the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.630 
pressure with the thumb so that's the
squeeze<00:02:39.440> cut<00:02:41.800> okay<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:42.920> final<00:02:43.100> cut<00:02:43.430> I'm<00:02:43.610> going

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
squeeze cut okay the final cut I'm going

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.300 
squeeze cut okay the final cut I'm going
to<00:02:43.850> show<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.090> today<00:02:44.270> is<00:02:44.980> called<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.070> drill

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
to show you today is called the drill

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.240 
to show you today is called the drill
cut<00:02:46.580> now<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:47.810> would<00:02:47.990> be<00:02:48.020> used<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.560> say<00:02:48.830> making

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
cut now this would be used to say making

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.480 
cut now this would be used to say making
a<00:02:49.340> socket<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.970> make<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.810> bow<00:02:51.800> drill<00:02:51.980> set<00:02:52.100> or

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
a socket to make a bow drill set or

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.340 
a socket to make a bow drill set or
something<00:02:52.730> along<00:02:52.910> those<00:02:53.090> lines<00:02:53.150> now<00:02:54.110> one<00:02:54.320> of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
something along those lines now one of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.200 
something along those lines now one of
the<00:02:54.530> biggest<00:02:55.130> mistakes<00:02:55.490> I<00:02:55.640> see<00:02:55.670> people<00:02:55.850> make

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
the biggest mistakes I see people make

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.210 
the biggest mistakes I see people make
is<00:02:56.630> them<00:02:56.960> holding<00:02:57.260> in<00:02:57.410> their<00:02:57.590> hand<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.070> doing

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
is them holding in their hand and doing

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.160 
is them holding in their hand and doing
this<00:02:58.460> now<00:02:59.120> this<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.510> recipe<00:02:59.810> for<00:03:00.020> disaster

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
this now this is a recipe for disaster

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.280 
this now this is a recipe for disaster
because<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:01.040> knife<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.690> go<00:03:02.690> off<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:03.080> any

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
because the knife can go off in any

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.860 
because the knife can go off in any
direction<00:03:03.640> close<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.790> fingers<00:03:05.240> anything<00:03:05.750> like

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
direction close to fingers anything like

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.080 
direction close to fingers anything like
that<00:03:06.010> very<00:03:07.010> straightforward<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.730> do<00:03:07.910> this

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
that very straightforward to do this

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.990 
that very straightforward to do this
safely<00:03:08.410> all<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.590> need<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:09.860> do<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.370> just<00:03:10.700> put<00:03:10.910> it

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
safely all you need to do is just put it

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.030 
safely all you need to do is just put it
down<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.540> surface<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:14.170> ultimately<00:03:15.170> isn't

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
down on a surface that ultimately isn't

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.150 
down on a surface that ultimately isn't
going<00:03:16.520> to<00:03:16.640> matter<00:03:16.790> if<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.180> slip<00:03:17.450> off<00:03:17.630> anywhere

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
going to matter if you slip off anywhere

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.440 
going to matter if you slip off anywhere
okay<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:19.490> as<00:03:19.580> simple<00:03:19.730> as<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.210> can<00:03:20.330> be

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
okay so it's as simple as that it can be

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.390 
okay so it's as simple as that it can be
against<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.810> tree<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.800> can<00:03:21.950> be<00:03:22.100> against

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
against a tree it can be against

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.250 
against a tree it can be against
anything<00:03:22.580> anything<00:03:23.060> that's<00:03:23.420> that's<00:03:23.810> solid

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
anything anything that's that's solid

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.230 
anything anything that's that's solid
and<00:03:24.500> solid<00:03:25.310> enough<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.640> take<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.090> knife

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
and solid enough to take the knife

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.710 
and solid enough to take the knife
without<00:03:26.480> damaging<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:28.510> simple<00:03:29.510> cut

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
without damaging it a simple cut

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.440 
without damaging it a simple cut
literally<00:03:30.650> stick<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.280> point<00:03:31.520> in<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:31.910> turn

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
literally stick the point in and turn

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.660 
literally stick the point in and turn
the<00:03:32.600> blade<00:03:33.160> allowing<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.250> point<00:03:34.490> of<00:03:34.580> the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
blade to do the work move the object

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.340 
blade to do the work move the object
around<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:37.970> get<00:03:38.180> an<00:03:38.300> even<00:03:38.630> cut<00:03:38.900> all<00:03:39.140> the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
around so you get an even cut all the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:46.500 
around so you get an even cut all the
way<00:03:39.440> around

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.030 

all<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.720> time<00:03:47.930> being<00:03:48.230> mindful<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.710> where<00:03:48.890> that
