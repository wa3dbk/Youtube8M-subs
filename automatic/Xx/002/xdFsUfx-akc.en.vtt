00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.049
 in short, I just got a crunch 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:11.429
 the machine caught fire with just 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.400
 that this and this here 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.140
 started to smoke it called thing 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.770
 receiver boxing then literally minutes 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.869
 one and a half 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.390
 exact just drove not even 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:31.650
 Accelerated expect the motor to warm up 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.239
 just unbearable practical 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.809
 turned white seems the battery that's what 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.980
 turned it to use it already 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.750
 impossible at night sparkles when 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.559
 binds this right to it all 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.530
 it burned out to pussy and here we have 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.530
 the most interesting thing she did is what 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.180
 candles that's why i started very clear 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.610
 the light turned off did not get bored i think 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.369
 Then I ride on this ride 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.470
 In short, what has turned this machine 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:20.100
 already it will be impossible to use here 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.159
 this is a receiver box he is here at all 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.189
 here is a burnt hole like this 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.680
 no way come on camera 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:35.729
 I focus and my husband and she will focus 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.220
 shorter there on the receiver boxed dive at home 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.630
 utter stench 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.829
 his wife's dog was another comp himself 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:48.570
 shooting here and opening than 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.960
 machine than I can say I think that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.600
 the point here was in the ultimate batteries not 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.049
 I will hand the other most likely here 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.170
 there was either too much voltage or 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:05.720
 it was on the closing may 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:11.060
 scripts wow cool 2nd connect oh 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:15.470
 damn one and a half thousand milliamps hours not 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.510
 comic matter how to dispose of where it 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.100
 do whom to call whom not to call 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.830
 understandably only the night will wake strangled 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.100
 damn battery so all myself 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.019
 good patrick machine is now mine 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.880
 further action which is now first 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:36.459
 to write the seller is unlikely that the course 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.569
 decides because the spit already confirmed and 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.880
 see what you can do with this 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.130
 can Putin not send a new machine 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.790
 maybe he will score on my course 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.410
 pleading 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:52.940
 please help well everything will be fine 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:56.090
 all the while all the number even here is something 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.500
 soot in general if you buy in 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.940
 this sphere 959 be careful 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.200

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.070
 offline store where they will give 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.070
