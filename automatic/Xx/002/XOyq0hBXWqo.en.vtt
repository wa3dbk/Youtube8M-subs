00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 look at it in a clear way 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.560
 that I came from the dock now 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.830
 is in the medical department 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.110
 tunnel vilÃ£ brigado with the staff 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.049
 of the bag is now generating a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.119
 greater impact than doing to Chicao 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.580
 that staff asks all customers 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.170
 his mosquito descend from the gym 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.449
 but the purple mouth the guys are like this 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.060
 he attributes this to his work 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.030
 following the challenge is a challenge for 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.980
 american cruzeirenses and and atleticanos 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.610
 andrezza booths present to you 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.610
 which is 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.640
 and then the fan has already thought about getting into 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.670
 shape and break your rival's 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.560
 behind because it is only a partnership of the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.290
 tv with this guy here 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.360
 his gym you can do 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.930
 it and is very easy fÃ¡bio which the 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.050
 The goal of this challenge is to 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.210
 to make this challenge between the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.950
 both the cruise and the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.330
 athletic and of america and together with 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.150
 stand 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.930
 so I think it's going to be very very cool 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.910
 I think that besides you participating, 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.430
 get into shape will still win and a 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.140
 That year the winner is in the gym. 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.750
 and the magnet iof 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.460
 Felipe, it's free, the idea is people I 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.460
 I already went for a walk because it takes a look 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.070
 in structures is top thing is everything of 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.960
 First world everything waiting for you 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.880
 staying out of this will leave your 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.520
 opponent to stand in front of you if I 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.200

 together following closely 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.070
 the author will get more focused is the only 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.869
 difference is the camera rotates and flips 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.680

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.960

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.940
 with the athletic body already takes value there I 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.210
