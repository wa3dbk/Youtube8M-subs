like<00:02:32.459> maybe<00:02:32.670> 75<00:02:33.239> on<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.480> freeway<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.110> got

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
like maybe 75 on the freeway and I got

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.250 
like maybe 75 on the freeway and I got
off<00:02:34.379> I<00:02:34.620> got<00:02:34.950> off<00:02:35.069> on<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.280> exit<00:02:35.819> ramp<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.140> my

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
body my body started to freak out

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:39.530 
body my body started to freak out
because<00:02:38.670> he<00:02:38.910> thought<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> car<00:02:39.239> wasn't<00:02:39.390> gonna

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
because he thought the car wasn't gonna

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.009 
because he thought the car wasn't gonna
stop<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.950> stopped<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.340> about<00:02:41.579> 30<00:02:42.329> feet<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.750> a

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
stop and I stopped in about 30 feet of a

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.470 
stop and I stopped in about 30 feet of a
room<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.860> fine<00:02:44.340> didn't<00:02:44.819> brakes<00:02:45.269> didn't

room just fine didn't brakes didn't
catch<00:02:45.599> fire<00:02:45.629> anything<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:47.160> yeah<00:02:48.799> so<00:02:49.799> yeah

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
catch fire anything so yeah so yeah

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.210 
catch fire anything so yeah so yeah
there's<00:02:50.129> that<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.810> runs<00:02:52.019> okay<00:02:52.319> i<00:02:52.530> guess<00:02:52.920> i<00:02:53.010> mean

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
there's that so runs okay i guess i mean

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.250 
there's that so runs okay i guess i mean
the<00:02:53.310> motor<00:02:53.489> letter<00:02:54.239> has<00:02:54.420> its<00:02:54.569> issues<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.079> i'm

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
the motor letter has its issues but i'm

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.869 
the motor letter has its issues but i'm
staying<00:02:55.709> on<00:02:55.799> top<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.280> make<00:02:56.489> sure<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.760> at

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
staying on top of it to make sure it at

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:04.130 
staying on top of it to make sure it at
least<00:02:56.970> runs<00:02:57.299> until<00:02:57.599> i<00:02:57.690> get<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:58.290> done<00:03:02.569> so<00:03:03.569> more

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140

this one i procured a this is a

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.309 
this one i procured a this is a
megasquirt<00:03:19.530> one<00:03:19.919> on<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:21.060> 2.2<00:03:21.540> PCB<00:03:21.989> which<00:03:22.169> is<00:03:22.290> a

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
megasquirt one on the 2.2 PCB which is a

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.770 
megasquirt one on the 2.2 PCB which is a
little<00:03:22.470> bit<00:03:22.620> outdated<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.970> PCB<00:03:24.359> is<00:03:24.480> anyway

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
little bit outdated the PCB is anyway

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.050 
little bit outdated the PCB is anyway
but<00:03:25.639> every<00:03:26.639> one<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.849> megasquirt

but every one of the megasquirt

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.190 
but every one of the megasquirt
community<00:03:27.599> tells<00:03:27.780> me<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.049> main

run<00:03:43.109> control<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.739> fuel<00:03:44.090> but<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.510> would

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
run control the fuel but the I would

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.059 
run control the fuel but the I would
think<00:03:46.079> when<00:03:46.260> replace<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.590> mega<00:03:46.739> square<00:03:46.950> one

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
think when replace the mega square one

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.409 
think when replace the mega square one
processor<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:47.639> with<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> megasquirt<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.389> I

processor in it with a megasquirt to I
know<00:03:48.599> a<00:03:48.690> guy<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.109> just<00:03:49.260> upgraded<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.739> a

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
know a guy that just upgraded to a

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.099 
know a guy that just upgraded to a
megasquirt<00:03:50.099> three<00:03:50.489> which<00:03:50.700> just<00:03:50.910> came<00:03:51.000> out<00:03:51.180> so

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
megasquirt three which just came out so

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.550 
megasquirt three which just came out so
he's<00:03:52.319> easy<00:03:52.620> as<00:03:53.549> an<00:03:53.730> extra<00:03:54.290> megasquirt<00:03:55.290> to

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
he's easy as an extra megasquirt to

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.890 
he's easy as an extra megasquirt to
laying<00:03:55.799> around<00:03:56.099> that<00:03:56.340> I'll<00:03:57.239> just<00:03:57.389> my<00:03:57.629> majors

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
laying around that I'll just my majors

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.920 
laying around that I'll just my majors
put<00:03:58.049> on<00:03:58.139> this<00:03:58.260> PCB<00:03:59.299> also<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.329> another

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
put on this PCB also I another

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.629 
put on this PCB also I another
difference<00:04:01.230> i'm<00:04:01.349> told<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:03.290> 3.5<00:04:04.370> PCBs<00:04:05.370> have

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
difference i'm told is the 3.5 PCBs have

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.099 
difference i'm told is the 3.5 PCBs have
liked<00:04:05.970> more<00:04:06.120> safety<00:04:06.389> features<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:06.870> case<00:04:06.989> you

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
liked more safety features in case you

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.670 
liked more safety features in case you
wire<00:04:07.319> wrong<00:04:07.910> which<00:04:09.139> you<00:04:10.139> know<00:04:10.230> i<00:04:10.260> guess<00:04:10.560> i'll

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
wire wrong which you know i guess i'll

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.559 
wire wrong which you know i guess i'll
just<00:04:10.709> gamble<00:04:11.160> on<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.400> one<00:04:11.579> hope<00:04:12.120> i<00:04:12.239> wired-up

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
just gamble on that one hope i wired-up

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:13.789 
just gamble on that one hope i wired-up
good<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.840> first<00:04:12.959> time<00:04:13.109> i'm<00:04:13.440> pretty<00:04:13.620> good<00:04:13.739> at

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
good the first time i'm pretty good at

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.680 
good the first time i'm pretty good at
electronics<00:04:16.039> um<00:04:17.039> he's<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.090> cool<00:04:18.209> banner<00:04:18.449> i

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
electronics um he's just cool banner i

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
over here I got my friends motors he's

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.260 
over here I got my friends motors he's
been<00:05:12.190> storing<00:05:12.460> them<00:05:12.610> here<00:05:12.840> actually<00:05:13.840> he's<00:05:13.990> got

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
been storing them here actually he's got

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.439 
been storing them here actually he's got
three<00:05:16.270> CD<00:05:16.870> 26<00:05:17.289> turbos<00:05:17.590> here's<00:05:17.830> one<00:05:18.039> of<00:05:18.129> them

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
three CD 26 turbos here's one of them

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.830 
three CD 26 turbos here's one of them
he's<00:05:19.449> rebuilding<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.560> motor<00:05:20.590> for<00:05:20.919> his<00:05:21.069> 86

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
he's rebuilding the motor for his 86

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.659 
he's rebuilding the motor for his 86
super<00:05:22.840> turbo<00:05:23.080> he<00:05:24.039> told<00:05:24.190> me<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.340> could<00:05:24.460> have<00:05:24.490> one

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
super turbo he told me I could have one

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.390 
super turbo he told me I could have one
of<00:05:24.879> these<00:05:24.940> turbos<00:05:25.360> so<00:05:26.099> there's<00:05:27.099> a<00:05:27.159> good<00:05:27.250> chance

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
of these turbos so there's a good chance

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.950 
of these turbos so there's a good chance
i'll<00:05:27.610> be<00:05:27.699> using<00:05:27.909> one<00:05:28.479> of<00:05:28.569> these<00:05:28.690> are<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:28.870> only

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
i'll be using one of these are the only

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.110 
i'll be using one of these are the only
problem<00:05:29.289> is<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:30.219> uses<00:05:30.520> a<00:05:30.550> very<00:05:30.849> proprietary

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
problem is it uses a very proprietary

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.680 
problem is it uses a very proprietary
flange<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:32.849> it's<00:05:33.849> even<00:05:33.969> hard<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.330> find<00:05:34.539> a

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
flange that it's even hard to find a

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.110 
flange that it's even hard to find a
flames<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.110> weld<00:05:35.319> on<00:05:35.469> to<00:05:35.770> an<00:05:35.919> up<00:05:36.069> pipe<00:05:36.279> so<00:05:36.819> i

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
flames to weld on to an up pipe so i

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.480 
flames to weld on to an up pipe so i
think<00:05:37.960> i<00:05:38.139> know<00:05:38.199> one<00:05:38.590> shot<00:05:38.800> that<00:05:38.979> makes<00:05:39.159> it<00:05:39.279> but

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
think i know one shot that makes it but

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.760 
think i know one shot that makes it but
I<00:05:39.699> mean<00:05:40.210> you<00:05:40.360> to<00:05:40.539> find<00:05:40.779> a<00:05:40.870> friend<00:05:41.169> that<00:05:41.680> can

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
I mean you to find a friend that can

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.800

fabricate anyone in Columbus if I can
get<00:05:44.020> my<00:05:44.110> hands<00:05:44.319> on<00:05:44.469> that<00:05:44.789> it's<00:05:45.789> kind<00:05:45.940> of<00:05:46.090> it's

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
get my hands on that it's kind of it's

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.769 
get my hands on that it's kind of it's
kind<00:05:46.389> of<00:05:46.569> shaped<00:05:46.870> weird<00:05:47.110> it's<00:05:47.469> I<00:05:48.719> think<00:05:49.719> I

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
kind of shaped weird it's I think I

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.839 
kind of shaped weird it's I think I
think<00:05:50.050> it's<00:05:50.199> you<00:05:50.529> know<00:05:50.650> it<00:05:51.340> shaped<00:05:51.580> a<00:05:51.669> little

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
think it's you know it shaped a little

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.769 
think it's you know it shaped a little
bit<00:05:52.029> different<00:05:52.360> than<00:05:52.479> a<00:05:52.509> t3<00:05:53.020> and<00:05:54.690> you<00:05:55.690> know

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:55.779 
bit different than a t3 and you know

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:56.760 
bit different than a t3 and you know
that<00:05:55.930> makes<00:05:56.169> you<00:05:56.289> just<00:05:56.469> it's<00:05:56.710> really

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
that makes you just it's really

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.290 
that makes you just it's really
difficult<00:05:57.069> to<00:05:57.250> find<00:05:57.430> cuz<00:05:57.520> it's<00:05:58.120> so

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
difficult to find cuz it's so

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.830 
difficult to find cuz it's so
proprietary<00:05:59.729> but<00:06:00.729> the<00:06:00.849> turbo<00:06:01.330> itself<00:06:01.539> is<00:06:01.659> cool

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
proprietary but the turbo itself is cool

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.450 
proprietary but the turbo itself is cool
I<00:06:01.870> mean<00:06:01.990> I<00:06:02.139> probably<00:06:02.529> it's<00:06:02.979> not<00:06:03.069> probably<00:06:03.279> act

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
I mean I probably it's not probably act

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.450 
I mean I probably it's not probably act
of<00:06:03.550> a<00:06:03.580> spool<00:06:03.909> very<00:06:04.180> fast<00:06:04.449> but<00:06:05.080> uh<00:06:05.400> you<00:06:06.400> know
