00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.180
 embraces a significant percentage of 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.520
 your propulsion must come from the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.469
 move your legs over your 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.690
 technique is good the more you'll have to 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:22.669
 propulsion and more you will be able 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.259
 to swim quickly the cycle of the movement of 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.900
 legs starts with a phase of 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.380
 Recovery feet and legs his 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.869
 cards 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.609
 young people or those flex and the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.470
 soles of the feet goes back to the surface of 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.090
 water with toes pointing to 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.740
 the rear 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.330
 at the end of this phase your knees and 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.490
 ankles must reach an angle 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.450
 about 90 degrees and your feet have to 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.680
 to be just above your knees 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.570
 look at how floret brings back his 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 feet to her hips with the plant 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.740
 feet to the surface 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.720
 his knees these cards is more important 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.170
 his feet are positioned just at 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.390
 on top of them try not to spread 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.430
 knees beyond the natural width 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.320
 of your body as this generates more than 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.469
 resistance and makes it more difficult a 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.759
 good support at the level of the foot 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.560
 start taking support by turning 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.329
 feet outward and in 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.340
 pointing your toes towards the sides of 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.229
 the pool with the ankles and the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.359
 soles of the feet ready to push the water 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.829
 backwards before florent 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.539
 performed a leg movement he 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.280
 turn his feet backwards to 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.929
 get a good intake of water and gave 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.880
 then a powerful leg movement 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.649
 go back to the phase of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.939
 propulsion by pushing your feet towards 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.979
 the back while your legs 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.109
 lie completely turn your feet 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.700
 in a circular motion at the end of 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.259
 movement 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.030
 try that the soles of your feet are 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.929
 at the same level and touch each other at the end 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.429
 of this phase of the movement try to 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.229
 keep the pressure of the water on your 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.609
 feet 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.409
 the orientation of the force must be towards 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.020
 the back rather than the outside 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.569
 with a leg movement and 3 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.609
 last 30 to 45 cm from your movement 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.259
 of legs are essential because it is 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.770
 this moment that the greatest propulsion 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.689
 is acquired 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.189
 turn your feet so that they get 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.189
 join at the end of the movement
