Jackie<00:02:25.440> was<00:02:28.280> just<00:02:29.280> one<00:02:29.760> more<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:51.170> have<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.260> few

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
Jackie was just one more I have a few

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.900 
Jackie was just one more I have a few
problems<00:02:52.709> sometimes<00:02:53.040> when<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.459> double<00:02:53.700> feats

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
problems sometimes when in double feats

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.479 
problems sometimes when in double feats
well<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.900> one<00:02:55.049> was<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> double<00:02:55.620> feed<00:02:55.829> because

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
well that one was a double feed because

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.699 
well that one was a double feed because
the<00:02:56.989> extractor<00:02:57.989> actually<00:02:58.260> caught<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.680> it

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
the extractor actually caught on to it

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.280 
the extractor actually caught on to it
but<00:02:59.010> yeah<00:02:59.900> works<00:03:00.900> decent<00:03:01.620> right<00:03:01.769> no<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.760> slide

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
but yeah works decent right no the slide

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:16.470 
but yeah works decent right no the slide
goes<00:03:04.290> back<00:03:04.470> four<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:05.190> four<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.400> pretty<00:03:05.760> smooth

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.899 

but<00:03:17.480> yeah<00:03:17.629> it's<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.709> little<00:03:19.219> bit<00:03:19.370> rough<00:03:19.670> right

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
but yeah it's a little bit rough right

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.209 
but yeah it's a little bit rough right
now<00:03:20.319> doesn't<00:03:21.319> want<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:23.469> go<00:03:24.469> all<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.709> way<00:03:24.739> right

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:25.219 
now doesn't want to go all the way right

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:35.039 
now doesn't want to go all the way right
now<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:27.019> looks<00:03:27.200> cool<00:03:27.439> enough<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:33.280> let<00:03:34.280> me<00:03:34.340> try

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
now it looks cool enough and let me try

00:03:35.049 --> 00:04:12.449 
now it looks cool enough and let me try
taking<00:03:36.049> apart<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.439> slide<00:03:36.819> for<00:03:37.819> you<00:03:37.909> guys

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
and the reals kind of coming over here

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.259 
and the reals kind of coming over here
so<00:04:15.099> I<00:04:15.159> got<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.370> glue<00:04:15.760> back<00:04:15.969> that<00:04:16.539> in<00:04:16.900> place

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269
