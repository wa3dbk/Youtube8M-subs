00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.410
 how about friends greet you only in this 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.139
 occasion I bring you the life review of 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.320
 transformers I came back from the line works 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.480
 prime in the deluxe edition and good 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.020
 figure is very good I really liked the 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.380
 Carrying the figure itself is very father 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.600
 brings his two guns to those in the arms 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.860
 well there because the series of if it looked 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.860
 and well you can also put in what 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.660
 it's a hand today we can see it or if what 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.610
 we wanted this one you can also 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.740
 combine in the weapon 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.760
 so we can put it twice no but 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.690
 already exists now that you put it 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.310
 put salt to your liking and to you what 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.500
 You can put as you want as you 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.690
 want one then the figure was 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.760
 very well articulated in many parts is 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.670
 what allows it to be put in 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.280
 practically any position here in 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.780
 knees this one to bring knees 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.300
 because there are many who do not bring what is 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.410
 the knee so it can be a leg 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.300
 or is not then this one is very good 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.030
 articulated figure and all things 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.360
 not then this is a good option 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.880
 for the purchase in the case of what 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.900
 is the face I liked that this one 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.230
 they put a little bit as well as more this day 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.870
 stark at once captures 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.460
 as well as a little more this severe the 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.770
 face 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.200
 there we can see it is as well as as if 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.000
 was angry let's say is 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.979
 and then the truth is that it is very 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.380
 father liked it good this does not have 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.850
 tell the face again function that 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.329
 they always put all the juan back 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.600
 yes and that's a good point in the figure 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.670
 in size is this is suitable as 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.800
 what should be the size of luxe 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.100
 for example if we talked about 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.100
 of size is not for example the hype 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 classic 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.240
 and we can see that it is practically 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.909
 the same size and the colors are very 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.459
 look alike so really the figure is 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.170
 this one is very very very good then in 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.950
 that aspect we are going to remove this 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.890
 bug and good because there he is 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.640
 the point figure that I liked most about 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.640
 these things that here back 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.590
 of the head is a point that is 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.050
 It's the inside part 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.680
 vegan you can see that there is a 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.330
 hollow that still doing what we 're going to 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.910
 do this to him if we want to put it like this 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.100
 so that it is disguised I do not know but if 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.620
 It's hard work to make that 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.240
 dump does not look so hooked but 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.300
 outside of that a figure is shown 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.280
 good good what I liked also from 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.060
 this figure is that even though it is very 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.610
 good in robot mode the vehicle mode is not 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.580
 it's so not that hard to transform 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.070
 it's really very simple and that's a 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.900
 point in your favor from my point of view 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.239
 that the transformation is simple and that 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.850
 the figure is good is a 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.400
 combination that not many achieve 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.670
 many figures achieve so that's 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.810
 something that you have to praise leandro and 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:20.610
 well stencil to the figure brings a 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.580
 grip system of the parts 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.160
 of the margin gates of this of that 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.870
 part of here what is the chest and everything 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.810
 that when we join the shoulders like you 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.329
 could see automatic it joins all the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.709
 figure and I will support after normal 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.709
 we put what is the 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.609
 the roof and we practically have armed 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.500
 and the figure and good and nothing else 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.750
 we put what are the arms like this 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.900
 and so simply because the figure and 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.220
 practically we have it armed in shape 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.790
 of vehicle and this is the elvis hype 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.530
 kinds of luxe good when I bought it 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.320
 I saw that I had some little details that to me 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.740
 I did not like it and that's because 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.110
 correct starting with the wheels of the 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.570
 silver painters to some I had 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.020
 asked what I paint it with the letter 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.020
 of allow 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.890
 sorry the 5 seconds is that I did not have 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.860
 the hand but I use this this this 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:38.400
 pencil let's be attentive 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.400
 extrafine silver and this is the 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.350
 the pencil you normally use to 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.360
 paint them 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.610
 these parts of here must be done with 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.600
 a little bit of care but this is the 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.520
 question of the grace of each 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.240
 and good the figure of time and good 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.980
 here we see her robot robbery of vehicle and 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.900
 the truth is father is very good with 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.860
 with other figures that I have already 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:08.760
 reviewed as for example the william or 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.030
 the horn for then this one 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.760
 they are also on the same scale and that is 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.160
 good in this aspect for me back in 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.170
 the series I liked because they were not given 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.430
 as relevant as they did in the 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:25.680
 movie or as they did in the 280 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.080
 with the quad the series in which you 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.420
 it took away from others 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.670
 characters the laser that I went back out the 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.040
 main in which he was always in 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.720
 everything and good is to make a spray behind 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.340
 what they did was very balanced 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.070
 giving you some chapters to each 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.650
 transform we got to know 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.080
 each one better then I think the headquarters 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.780
 has already had that great success of not 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.950
 make a unique protagonist that always 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.360
 is getting 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.790
 As you say your uncle can be put 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.410
 this horrible thing 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.790
 the truth that you want to put a weapon to a 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.370
 vehicle in the on the cake step too 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.260
 I painted the back because it came 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.930
 very yellow so I painted him what they are 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.940
 the headlights like that went well too 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.610
 paint the leaks with the same group 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.250
 He cited very carefully and the truth remained 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.680
 good from my point of view better the 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.310
 figure he liked me very much the same 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.560
 lights from here ahead see that I liked it 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.320
 and I also liked that inside there is a 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.140
 little dark what is what it resembles 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.750
 the glasses which shows little of the 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.480
 figure inside and that's good because 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.370
 sometimes you can not disguise all the 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.990
 things inside the vehicle and the 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.060
 having it darker is an advantage 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.440
 do not be here and in doing editing that 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.970
 they say it's better and the whole thing and I 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.710
 I have seen it and the truth sincerely 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.650
 just for the fact that it looks like a 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:49.770
 little bit more to the to the figure of the of the 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:52.740
 series is everything that I see best 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.600
 but really as I said if any 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.009
 day comes to fall one was imprisoned then 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.830
 forward but 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.819
 by getting one in the price of the 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.279
 true 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.749
 this figure is very good I hope that if 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.550
 some day offers you editions in the 

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:07.349
 show if not then it does not matter that 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.839
 I recommend all of you this figure is very 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:11.369
 very good here I leave you I hope that 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:13.979
 you liked the review and we are 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:15.960
 this of pending for others 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:19.759
 Reviews of transformers prime or de 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.759
 another series that are fine and will go
