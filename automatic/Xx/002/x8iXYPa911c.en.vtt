00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
so now we'll continue our dadgad tuning

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.269 
so now we'll continue our dadgad tuning
tutorial<00:00:15.290> by<00:00:15.440> looking<00:00:15.769> at<00:00:15.860> these<00:00:15.980> chord

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
tutorial by looking at these chord

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.550 
tutorial by looking at these chord
fingerings<00:00:16.700> and<00:00:16.970> a<00:00:17.480> little<00:00:17.720> bit<00:00:17.840> more<00:00:18.110> detail

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
fingerings and a little bit more detail

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.679 
fingerings and a little bit more detail
you<00:00:19.490> can<00:00:19.610> hear<00:00:19.820> how<00:00:19.939> on<00:00:20.060> each<00:00:20.150> of<00:00:20.300> these<00:00:20.360> chords

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
you can hear how on each of these chords

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.679 
you can hear how on each of these chords
it<00:00:20.779> has<00:00:20.900> a<00:00:20.930> very<00:00:21.200> open<00:00:21.410> sound

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.019 

so<00:00:26.689> dadgad<00:00:27.109> tuning<00:00:27.499> really<00:00:27.849> transforms<00:00:28.849> the

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
so dadgad tuning really transforms the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.179 
so dadgad tuning really transforms the
sound<00:00:29.269> of<00:00:29.390> a<00:00:29.449> song<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.710> you<00:00:30.800> just<00:00:30.980> have

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
sound of a song and that you just have

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.679 
sound of a song and that you just have
these<00:00:31.339> sort<00:00:31.579> of<00:00:31.640> droning<00:00:32.029> notes<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:32.419> you<00:00:32.540> can

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
these sort of droning notes that you can

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.470 
these sort of droning notes that you can
add<00:00:33.010> it<00:00:34.010> also<00:00:34.129> adds<00:00:34.519> a<00:00:34.640> lot<00:00:34.760> of<00:00:34.820> tensions<00:00:35.300> to

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
add it also adds a lot of tensions to

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.000 
add it also adds a lot of tensions to
chords<00:00:35.870> which<00:00:36.050> can<00:00:36.230> give<00:00:36.350> it<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.500> real<00:00:36.680> fresh

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
chords which can give it a real fresh

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.380 
chords which can give it a real fresh
sound<00:00:37.449> so<00:00:38.449> for<00:00:39.019> the<00:00:39.199> D<00:00:39.769> major<00:00:40.040> type<00:00:41.000> of<00:00:41.149> chord

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
sound so for the D major type of chord

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.509 
sound so for the D major type of chord
where<00:00:41.629> we're<00:00:41.750> adding<00:00:41.960> an<00:00:42.170> 11<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.649> it<00:00:42.800> we're

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
where we're adding an 11 to it we're

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.430 
where we're adding an 11 to it we're
going<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.790> just<00:00:44.089> take<00:00:44.300> any<00:00:44.870> finger<00:00:45.170> you<00:00:45.199> want

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
going to just take any finger you want

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.469 
going to just take any finger you want
really<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:45.979> add<00:00:46.190> it<00:00:46.370> to<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.729> 4th<00:00:47.030> fret<00:00:47.269> of<00:00:47.329> the

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
really and add it to the 4th fret of the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.200 
really and add it to the 4th fret of the
4th<00:00:47.720> string<00:00:48.280> we<00:00:49.280> just<00:00:49.489> hit<00:00:49.640> all<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.909> strings

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
4th string we just hit all the strings

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.310 
4th string we just hit all the strings
on<00:00:50.390> that

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
on that

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.510 
on that
for<00:00:53.190> an<00:00:53.550> e-minor<00:00:54.560> I<00:00:55.560> like<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.070> use<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.310> third

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
for an e-minor I like to use the third

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.610 
for an e-minor I like to use the third
and<00:00:56.700> fourth<00:00:56.940> fingers<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.990> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.440> put

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and fourth fingers for this you can put

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.140 
and fourth fingers for this you can put
the<00:00:58.740> third<00:00:58.950> finger<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.310> the<00:00:59.520> second<00:00:59.970> fret<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
the third finger on the second fret of

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.300 
the third finger on the second fret of
the<00:01:00.240> sixth<00:01:00.540> string<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.830> fourth<00:01:02.070> finger

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
the sixth string and the fourth finger

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.740 
the sixth string and the fourth finger
on<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.700> second<00:01:03.150> fret<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.390> fourth<00:01:03.660> string

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
on the second fret of the fourth string

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.710 
on the second fret of the fourth string
and<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.290> muting<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> fifth<00:01:05.670> string<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.480> then

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and I'm muting the fifth string and then

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.370 
and I'm muting the fifth string and then
I'm<00:01:06.900> still<00:01:07.110> strumming<00:01:07.590> everything

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
I'm still strumming everything

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.499 
I'm still strumming everything
so<00:01:09.979> it<00:01:10.040> gives<00:01:10.189> us<00:01:10.280> an<00:01:10.430> e-minor<00:01:10.850> type<00:01:11.119> of<00:01:11.270> sound

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
so it gives us an e-minor type of sound

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.859 
so it gives us an e-minor type of sound
then<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.560> do<00:01:12.650> an<00:01:12.770> f-sharp<00:01:12.979> minor<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:13.850> can<00:01:14.689> just

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
then to do an f-sharp minor I can just

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.990 
then to do an f-sharp minor I can just
take<00:01:15.080> these<00:01:15.409> two<00:01:15.680> fingers<00:01:15.890> slide<00:01:16.520> them<00:01:16.670> up<00:01:16.790> two

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
take these two fingers slide them up two

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.760 
take these two fingers slide them up two
frets<00:01:17.299> to<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.690> fourth<00:01:17.960> fret<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.350> add<00:01:18.590> the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
frets to the fourth fret and add the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.190 
frets to the fourth fret and add the
first<00:01:19.040> finger<00:01:19.490> on<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.900> second<00:01:20.900> fret<00:01:20.930> of<00:01:21.170> the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
first finger on the second fret of the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.800 
first finger on the second fret of the
third<00:01:21.470> string<00:01:22.240> still<00:01:23.240> muting<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.540> fifth

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
third string still muting the fifth

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.670 
third string still muting the fifth
string

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
string

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830 
string
now<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:26.370> shape<00:01:26.610> right<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.360> sort<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.690> my

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
now this shape right here is sort of my

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600 
now this shape right here is sort of my
minor<00:01:28.200> shape<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.950> slide<00:01:29.220> around<00:01:29.370> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
minor shape that I can slide around to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.160 
minor shape that I can slide around to
get<00:01:29.760> other<00:01:29.880> minor<00:01:30.120> chords<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.750> keep<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.110> in

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
get other minor chords so keep that in

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.520 
get other minor chords so keep that in
mind<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.240> G<00:01:33.570> chord<00:01:33.810> I'm<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.440> to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.650 
mind to get the G chord I'm going to
take<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:35.460> same<00:01:35.730> shape<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:36.150> my<00:01:36.300> third<00:01:36.510> and

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
take this same shape with my third and

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.540
