00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.760 

for<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.220> good<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.520> team<00:03:39.470> as<00:03:40.470> much<00:03:40.650> as

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.730 
game and I think if my presence because
of<00:03:47.010> circumstances<00:03:48.230> he's<00:03:49.230> effective

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
of circumstances he's effective

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.120 
of circumstances he's effective
performances<00:03:50.490> and<00:03:50.640> I<00:03:50.730> think<00:03:51.710> not<00:03:52.710> so<00:03:52.830> much<00:03:52.950> my

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
performances and I think not so much my

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.070
