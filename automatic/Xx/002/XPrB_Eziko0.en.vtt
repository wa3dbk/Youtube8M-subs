not characters out as soon as possible

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.670 
not characters out as soon as possible
because<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.860> game<00:02:15.069> still<00:02:15.430> pretty<00:02:16.239> buggy<00:02:16.680> so

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
because this game still pretty buggy so

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.809 
because this game still pretty buggy so

if you don't do it you open yourself up

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.119 
if you don't do it you open yourself up
to<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.360> kind<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:22.959> crap<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.800> what<00:02:23.980> I'm

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
to this kind of crap that is what I'm

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.640 
to this kind of crap that is what I'm
talking<00:02:24.550> about<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:25.269> tag<00:02:25.870> out<00:02:26.080> tag<00:02:26.410> out

talking about that is tag out tag out
before<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.730> get<00:02:27.849> messed<00:02:28.120> up<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:29.010> then

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
before you get messed up and then

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.410 
before you get messed up and then
hopefully<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.280> that's<00:02:33.760> just<00:02:34.000> one<00:02:34.330> on

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
hopefully and that is that's just one on

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.449 
hopefully and that is that's just one on
the<00:02:34.510> bottom<00:02:34.660> game<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.410> don't<00:02:35.769> know<00:02:35.980> if<00:02:36.099> this<00:02:36.280> is

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
the bottom game I don't know if this is

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.000 
the bottom game I don't know if this is
maybe<00:02:36.880> because<00:02:37.209> I'm<00:02:37.450> recording<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:38.019> but<00:02:38.590> here

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
maybe because I'm recording it but here

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.339 
maybe because I'm recording it but here
here<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.519> getting<00:02:39.670> buggy<00:02:40.000> again<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:40.599> but

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
here it's getting buggy again so but

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.120 
here it's getting buggy again so but
it's<00:02:41.680> one-on-one<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.700> can<00:02:43.120> deal<00:02:43.269> with<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.690> and

it's one-on-one I can deal with that and
we'll<00:02:45.130> just<00:02:45.160> use<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.970> power<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.630> knock<00:02:46.989> her<00:02:47.170> out

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.729 

and<00:02:52.030> mom<00:02:52.810> use<00:02:53.110> it

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
believe that the best defense is a good

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.270 
believe that the best defense is a good
offense<00:04:21.060> then<00:04:22.409> then<00:04:23.409> you'll<00:04:23.860> want<00:04:24.099> to<00:04:24.159> do<00:04:24.250> that

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
offense then then you'll want to do that

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.220 
offense then then you'll want to do that
and<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:24.909> only<00:04:25.180> use<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.599> Super<00:04:25.930> Bee

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
and I only use the Super Bee

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.080 
and I only use the Super Bee
as<00:04:26.290> he's<00:04:26.530> in<00:04:26.680> ten<00:04:26.890> times<00:04:27.070> power<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.760> if<00:04:27.970> he

as he's in ten times power and if he
blocked<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.570> would<00:04:30.060> oops

blocked I would oops

blocked I would oops
and<00:04:31.300> I<00:04:31.660> just<00:04:31.810> got<00:04:32.130> one<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.490> chin<00:04:33.670> there's<00:04:33.970> a

and I just got one to the chin there's a

and I just got one to the chin there's a
chokeslam<00:04:34.710> but<00:04:35.710> that's<00:04:35.860> okay<00:04:36.190> because<00:04:36.220> again

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
chokeslam but that's okay because again

chokeslam but that's okay because again
Undertaker's<00:04:37.990> probably<00:04:38.470> moving<00:04:38.770> his

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
Undertaker's probably moving his

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
character that and the game when it

character that and the game when it
comes<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.350> this<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:45.340> only<00:04:45.820> real<00:04:46.390> difference

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
comes to this the only real difference

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.780 
comes to this the only real difference
for<00:04:47.020> him<00:04:47.260> is<00:04:47.820> he<00:04:48.820> has<00:04:49.890> he's<00:04:50.890> got<00:04:51.070> really<00:04:51.490> slow

for him is he has he's got really slow

recovery time just really slow I'm not
really<00:04:54.610> thinking<00:04:54.970> about<00:04:55.030> right<00:04:55.420> now<00:04:55.450> and<00:04:55.860> that

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
few more frames for get up which you

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.630 
few more frames for get up which you
know<00:05:02.170> can<00:05:02.320> throw<00:05:02.500> your<00:05:02.680> timing<00:05:03.070> off<00:05:03.220> if<00:05:03.430> you're

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
know can throw your timing off if you're

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.530 
know can throw your timing off if you're
if<00:05:04.060> you're<00:05:04.120> trying<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:04.900> time<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:06.730> window<00:05:07.270> for

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
if you're trying to time the window for

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.600 
if you're trying to time the window for
when<00:05:07.810> they<00:05:07.990> would<00:05:08.260> run<00:05:08.740> straight<00:05:09.220> into<00:05:09.280> your

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
when they would run straight into your

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.810 
when they would run straight into your
fists

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
fists

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.400 
fists
now<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:13.600> problem<00:05:13.960> you're<00:05:14.050> gonna<00:05:14.200> run<00:05:14.290> into<00:05:14.440> is

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
now the problem you're gonna run into is

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.780 
now the problem you're gonna run into is
you<00:05:17.410> know<00:05:17.500> your<00:05:17.920> characters<00:05:18.340> can't<00:05:18.610> stay

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
you know your characters can't stay

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.090 
you know your characters can't stay
below<00:05:19.030> forever<00:05:19.450> so<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.350> don't<00:05:20.710> know<00:05:20.800> how<00:05:20.920> long

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
below forever so I don't know how long

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.630 
below forever so I don't know how long
this<00:05:21.340> will<00:05:21.580> work<00:05:22.770> again<00:05:23.770> I<00:05:23.800> do<00:05:23.980> believe<00:05:24.370> John

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
this will work again I do believe John

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.490 
this will work again I do believe John
Cena<00:05:25.060> will<00:05:25.270> probably<00:05:25.720> end<00:05:25.810> up<00:05:25.960> getting<00:05:26.110> nerfed

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
Cena will probably end up getting nerfed

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.010 
Cena will probably end up getting nerfed
at<00:05:26.740> some<00:05:26.950> point<00:05:27.280> maybe<00:05:27.520> his<00:05:27.820> puffs<00:05:28.120> only<00:05:28.480> lasts

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
at some point maybe his puffs only lasts

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.260 
at some point maybe his puffs only lasts
a<00:05:29.200> 10<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:29.770> 20<00:05:30.040> seconds<00:05:30.520> instead<00:05:30.820> of<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.090> red

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
a 10 to 20 seconds instead of the red

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:39.810 
a 10 to 20 seconds instead of the red
the<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:32.200> remainder<00:05:32.680> of<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.890> match<00:05:36.930> but<00:05:37.930> in<00:05:38.820> the

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
the the remainder of a match but in the

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.720 
the the remainder of a match but in the
meantime<00:05:40.260> use<00:05:41.260> it<00:05:41.470> use<00:05:41.830> it<00:05:42.070> until<00:05:42.370> it<00:05:42.550> gets

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
meantime use it use it until it gets

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.040 
meantime use it use it until it gets
nerfed<00:05:44.190> because<00:05:45.190> this<00:05:45.550> is<00:05:45.850> probably<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.840> best

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
nerfed because this is probably the best

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.170 
nerfed because this is probably the best
way<00:05:47.260> to<00:05:47.290> rise<00:05:47.740> up<00:05:47.950> to<00:05:48.070> tournaments<00:05:49.770> and<00:05:50.770> I<00:05:51.670> I

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
way to rise up to tournaments and I I

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.210 
way to rise up to tournaments and I I
suggest<00:05:52.690> you<00:05:52.780> do<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.080> online<00:05:53.230> stuff<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.890> hang

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
suggest you do the online stuff to hang

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.260 
suggest you do the online stuff to hang
out<00:05:54.400> because<00:05:55.890> they<00:05:56.890> have<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.310> daily<00:05:57.700> rewards

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
out because they have the daily rewards

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.870 
out because they have the daily rewards
and<00:05:58.510> you<00:05:58.570> can<00:05:59.080> get<00:05:59.230> about<00:05:59.320> 10,000<00:06:00.220> coins<00:06:00.370> just

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
and you can get about 10,000 coins just

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.550 
and you can get about 10,000 coins just
if<00:06:01.150> you<00:06:01.450> if<00:06:02.140> you<00:06:02.320> can<00:06:02.470> complete<00:06:02.710> all<00:06:02.830> three

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
if you if you can complete all three

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.310 
if you if you can complete all three
which<00:06:05.560> is<00:06:05.820> almost<00:06:06.820> always<00:06:07.240> one<00:06:07.720> based<00:06:08.020> around

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
which is almost always one based around

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.460 
which is almost always one based around
gathering<00:06:09.100> right<00:06:09.310> now<00:06:09.340> and<00:06:09.820> then<00:06:10.630> maybe<00:06:11.290> a

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
gathering right now and then maybe a

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.250 
gathering right now and then maybe a
character<00:06:12.100> specific<00:06:12.940> one<00:06:15.120> just<00:06:16.230> supposed<00:06:17.230> to

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
but I haven't seen it forever so maybe

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
but I haven't seen it forever so maybe
batery<00:06:29.530> took<00:06:29.860> that<00:06:30.040> out<00:06:30.070> of<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.430> game<00:06:32.070> which
