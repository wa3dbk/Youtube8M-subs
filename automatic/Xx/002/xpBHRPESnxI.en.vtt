00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the phones alongside the software later

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
the phones alongside the software later
as<00:01:51.720> they've<00:01:51.930> done<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.590> some<00:01:53.040> times<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
as they've done in some times in the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.359 
as they've done in some times in the
past<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.939> new<00:01:54.630> windows<00:01:54.990> phones<00:01:55.380> from<00:01:55.619> HTC<00:01:56.130> have

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
past so new windows phones from HTC have

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.730 
past so new windows phones from HTC have
reached<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> FCC<00:01:57.240> recently<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.530> are

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
reached the FCC recently and we are

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
reached the FCC recently and we are
hoping<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.280> these<00:01:59.430> are<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.939> Eternity<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
hoping that these are the Eternity and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.690 
hoping that these are the Eternity and
Omega<00:02:01.049> which<00:02:01.320> are<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> time<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
Omega which are now the time and the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.880 
Omega which are now the time and the
radar<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.299> well<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.200> seems<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.740> things

some sort of skype video chat for these
devices<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.810> probably<00:02:50.500> for<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.740> newer<00:02:51.010> mango

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490

devices<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.120> come<00:02:52.300> out<00:02:52.450> because<00:02:52.630> obviously

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
devices that come out because obviously

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.660 
devices that come out because obviously
the<00:02:53.410> old<00:02:53.560> ones<00:02:53.830> don't<00:02:54.070> have<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.280> front-facing

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
it images of a nokia 703 have been

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.120 
it images of a nokia 703 have been
leaked<00:03:04.360> on<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.630> slideshow<00:03:05.230> presentation<00:03:06.010> in

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
leaked on a slideshow presentation in

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.970 
leaked on a slideshow presentation in
the<00:03:06.520> funny<00:03:06.760> part<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.420> image<00:03:07.780> is

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the funny part is that the image is

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.250 
the funny part is that the image is
identical<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.220> nokia<00:03:09.670> n9<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.959> the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
identical to the nokia n9 so the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.010 
identical to the nokia n9 so the
question<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:11.800> if<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.640> n9<00:03:13.209> was<00:03:13.540> really<00:03:13.870> the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
question is if that n9 was really the

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.870 
question is if that n9 was really the
mango<00:03:14.500> device<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.100> was<00:03:15.190> supposedly<00:03:15.610> being

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
mango device that was supposedly being

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.810 
mango device that was supposedly being
called<00:03:16.180> Siri<00:03:16.660> what<00:03:17.410> was<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.890> of<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.160> Nokia

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
called Siri what was it of that Nokia

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.210 
called Siri what was it of that Nokia
800<00:03:19.510> codename<00:03:20.050> device<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:20.560> we<00:03:20.650> found<00:03:20.860> last

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
800 codename device that we found last

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.400 
800 codename device that we found last
week<00:03:21.340> could<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.180> be<00:03:22.209> at<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.570> Nokia<00:03:22.930> 800

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
week could it be at the Nokia 800

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.710 
week could it be at the Nokia 800
prototype<00:03:24.100> as<00:03:24.340> some<00:03:24.580> other<00:03:24.850> Windows<00:03:25.390> Phone

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
prototype as some other Windows Phone

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.110 
prototype as some other Windows Phone
which<00:03:25.930> just<00:03:26.140> sounds<00:03:26.260> really<00:03:26.530> good<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.120> then

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
which just sounds really good and then

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.560 
which just sounds really good and then
this<00:03:28.420> n<00:03:28.720> 9<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.640> 703<00:03:30.640> code<00:03:30.880> name<00:03:31.120> would<00:03:31.330> most

this n 9 and 703 code name would most

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.030 
this n 9 and 703 code name would most
probably<00:03:31.840> be<00:03:32.110> some<00:03:32.350> other<00:03:32.380> thing<00:03:32.800> hopefully

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
probably be some other thing hopefully

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.830 
probably be some other thing hopefully
not<00:03:33.370> being<00:03:33.610> called<00:03:33.760> see<00:03:34.060> right<00:03:34.239> now<00:03:34.269> before

losing out on a really good season a

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.520 
losing out on a really good season a
cell<00:04:38.070> phone<00:04:38.370> so<00:04:38.760> sad<00:04:39.570> news<00:04:39.840> for<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.230> but

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
cell phone so sad news for that but

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.780 
cell phone so sad news for that but
again<00:04:40.740> these<00:04:40.860> are<00:04:40.920> just<00:04:41.130> rumours<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.520> could

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
again these are just rumours that could

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.860 
again these are just rumours that could
be<00:04:41.910> changed<00:04:41.940> eventually<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:44.450> well<00:04:45.450> it<00:04:45.600> seems

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
be changed eventually and well it seems

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.290 
be changed eventually and well it seems
location<00:04:46.560> gate<00:04:46.770> has<00:04:46.980> just<00:04:47.310> reached<00:04:47.520> Microsoft

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
location gate has just reached Microsoft

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.450 
location gate has just reached Microsoft
then<00:04:48.570> well<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:49.200> think<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:49.680> Microsoft<00:04:50.250> would

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
then well you think that Microsoft would

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.950 
then well you think that Microsoft would
most<00:04:50.670> probably<00:04:50.910> do<00:04:51.270> something<00:04:51.570> about<00:04:51.780> it

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
most probably do something about it

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.080 
most probably do something about it
before<00:04:52.440> something<00:04:53.100> happens<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.730> them<00:04:53.880> by

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
before something happens to them by

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.940 
before something happens to them by
seeing<00:04:54.419> what<00:04:54.480> happens<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.960> competitors<00:04:55.500> but

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
seeing what happens to competitors but

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.440 
seeing what happens to competitors but
it<00:04:56.070> seems<00:04:56.280> in<00:04:56.400> Microsoft<00:04:56.880> didn't<00:04:57.120> do<00:04:57.210> anything

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
it seems in Microsoft didn't do anything

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.720 
it seems in Microsoft didn't do anything
the<00:04:57.990> class-action<00:04:58.470> lawsuit<00:04:59.100> that<00:04:59.220> Microsoft

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
just related just received has to do

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.260 
just related just received has to do

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
with the fact that the camera

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.240 
with the fact that the camera
application<00:05:03.930> apparently<00:05:04.470> gets<00:05:04.890> information

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250
