00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
absolutely amazing and I never usually

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.960 
absolutely amazing and I never usually
say<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.100> about<00:02:58.160> semi-automatic<00:02:58.940> sniper

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
say that about semi-automatic sniper

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.720 
say that about semi-automatic sniper
rifles<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.530> reason<00:03:00.860> why<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.040> because<00:03:01.430> of

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
rifles and the reason why is because of

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.330 
rifles and the reason why is because of
stats<00:03:02.030> this<00:03:02.750> gun<00:03:03.170> ranked<00:03:03.920> up<00:03:04.040> against<00:03:04.250> the

stats this gun ranked up against the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.560 
stats this gun ranked up against the
ballista<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.850> ballista<00:03:05.180> is<00:03:05.270> also<00:03:05.540> a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
ballista the ballista is also a

and<00:03:08.090> they<00:03:08.630> have<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.870> same<00:03:09.050> damage<00:03:09.290> I've<00:03:09.710> been

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
and they have the same damage I've been

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.800 
and they have the same damage I've been
at<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.220> same<00:03:10.400> range<00:03:10.700> this<00:03:11.150> has<00:03:11.330> better<00:03:11.540> fire

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
at the same range this has better fire

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.810 
at the same range this has better fire
rate<00:03:11.990> obviously<00:03:12.440> because<00:03:12.620> Samuel<00:03:12.980> mag<00:03:13.190> but<00:03:13.670> it

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
rate obviously because Samuel mag but it

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.460 
rate obviously because Samuel mag but it

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.820 
probably would have hit files using a
ballista<00:03:20.030> but<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.959> same<00:03:21.260> amount<00:03:21.320> of<00:03:21.500> damage

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
you can get so many speed and you never

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
you can get so many speed and you never
have<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.020> worry<00:03:30.170> about<00:03:30.260> missing<00:03:30.620> because<00:03:30.740> you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
have to worry about missing because you

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.050 
have to worry about missing because you
can<00:03:31.040> just<00:03:31.070> keep<00:03:31.310> shooting<00:03:31.550> because<00:03:31.790> if<00:03:31.940> you're

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
can just keep shooting because if you're

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.699 
can just keep shooting because if you're
using<00:03:32.240> like<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.540> ballista<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.440> got<00:03:33.590> away

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
using like the ballista you got away

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.320 
using like the ballista you got away
from<00:03:33.770> the<00:03:34.040> put<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.310> next<00:03:34.490> bullet<00:03:34.820> in<00:03:34.970> and

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
from the put that next bullet in and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.640 
from the put that next bullet in and
that<00:03:35.510> can<00:03:35.630> take<00:03:35.780> like<00:03:35.930> free<00:03:36.230> tonight<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.530> think

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
that can take like free tonight I think

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.199 
that can take like free tonight I think
it<00:03:36.860> takes<00:03:36.890> like<00:03:37.100> one<00:03:37.400> or<00:03:37.520> two<00:03:37.550> seconds<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.030> put

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
it takes like one or two seconds to put

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.460 
it takes like one or two seconds to put
it<00:03:38.300> in<00:03:38.390> but<00:03:38.570> that<00:03:39.020> can<00:03:39.170> be<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.350> difference

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
it in but that can be the difference

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.870 
it in but that can be the difference
from<00:03:39.770> life<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.190> death<00:03:40.310> in<00:03:40.459> this<00:03:40.550> game<00:03:40.730> because

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
from life and death in this game because

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.900 
from life and death in this game because
of<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.120> lag<00:03:41.240> compensation<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.760> that's<00:03:43.760> why

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
of the lag compensation so that's why

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.160 
of the lag compensation so that's why
I'm<00:03:43.970> using<00:03:44.120> similar<00:03:44.510> mass<00:03:44.750> in<00:03:44.930> this<00:03:45.020> game

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
I'm using similar mass in this game

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.600 
I'm using similar mass in this game
because<00:03:45.350> they<00:03:45.739> are<00:03:45.920> just<00:03:46.070> absolutely<00:03:46.280> amazing

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
because they are just absolutely amazing

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.430 
because they are just absolutely amazing
but<00:03:47.360> let's<00:03:47.750> talk<00:03:47.840> about<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.110> other<00:03:48.200> ones<00:03:48.350> the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
but let's talk about the other ones the

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.979 
but let's talk about the other ones the
other<00:03:48.650> sim<00:03:48.950> you'll<00:03:49.130> make<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.820> SVU<00:03:50.209> AS<00:03:50.720> and

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
other sim you'll make is the SVU AS and

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.630 
other sim you'll make is the SVU AS and
I<00:03:51.140> really<00:03:51.440> don't<00:03:51.620> like<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:51.830> sniper<00:03:52.250> because

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
I really don't like that sniper because

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.880 
I really don't like that sniper because
it's<00:03:52.790> got<00:03:52.940> such<00:03:53.239> a<00:03:53.420> low<00:03:53.720> rate<00:03:54.260> of<00:03:54.320> damage<00:03:54.680> got

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
it's got such a low rate of damage got

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.530 
it's got such a low rate of damage got
higher<00:03:55.100> accuracy<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.820> visit<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.390> same

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
higher accuracy I visit the same

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.870 
higher accuracy I visit the same
accuracy<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.110> bolt<00:03:57.290> actions<00:03:57.709> but<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.310> Gimli

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
accuracy of the bolt actions but I Gimli

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.210 
accuracy of the bolt actions but I Gimli

good i really think it's near enough on
par<00:05:45.690> with<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.290> xbr<00:05:46.800> but<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.010> fact<00:05:47.220> that<00:05:47.250> the

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
par with the xbr but the fact that the

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.220 
par with the xbr but the fact that the
xbr<00:05:47.820> is<00:05:47.970> just<00:05:48.120> semi<00:05:48.300> all<00:05:48.450> matters<00:05:48.780> you<00:05:48.990> put<00:05:49.200> a

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
xbr is just semi all matters you put a

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.100 
xbr is just semi all matters you put a
stream<00:05:49.590> of<00:05:49.650> bullets<00:05:49.770> like<00:05:50.490> cuts<00:05:50.850> 24-7<00:05:51.630> off<00:05:51.960> it

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
stream of bullets like cuts 24-7 off it

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.170 
stream of bullets like cuts 24-7 off it
just<00:05:52.140> you<00:05:52.590> win<00:05:52.800> much<00:05:53.250> more<00:05:53.490> gun<00:05:53.670> fires<00:05:53.910> it's<00:05:54.150> a

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
just you win much more gun fires it's a

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.340 
just you win much more gun fires it's a
little<00:05:54.390> bit<00:05:54.510> unbalanced<00:05:54.900> in<00:05:55.020> my<00:05:55.110> opinion

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
little bit unbalanced in my opinion

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.170 
little bit unbalanced in my opinion
because<00:05:55.500> it's<00:05:56.040> just<00:05:56.190> a<00:05:56.250> souped-up<00:05:56.670> ballista

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
because it's just a souped-up ballista

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.660 
because it's just a souped-up ballista
that's<00:05:57.540> amazing<00:05:58.170> I<00:05:58.290> stop<00:05:59.160> that's<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.520> only

that's amazing I stop that's the only

like<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.170> site<00:06:19.380> on<00:06:19.500> the<00:06:19.560> blister<00:06:19.920> you've

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
like the site on the blister you've

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.470 
like the site on the blister you've
known<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.580> blister<00:06:20.850> is<00:06:20.940> more<00:06:21.090> accuracy

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
known the blister is more accuracy

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.510 
known the blister is more accuracy
because<00:06:22.260> of<00:06:22.380> the<00:06:22.440> slide<00:06:22.710> I<00:06:22.920> end<00:06:23.100> up<00:06:23.130> missing<00:06:23.370> a

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
because of the slide I end up missing a

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.190 
because of the slide I end up missing a
lot<00:06:23.670> more<00:06:23.820> shots<00:06:24.120> so<00:06:24.420> I<00:06:24.450> really<00:06:24.870> just<00:06:25.050> did

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
lot more shots so I really just did

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.350 
lot more shots so I really just did
clear<00:06:25.440> of<00:06:25.620> it<00:06:25.740> so<00:06:26.460> I<00:06:26.730> think<00:06:26.970> I've<00:06:27.210> said

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
clear of it so I think I've said

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.490

personally<00:06:31.330> my<00:06:31.870> favorite<00:06:31.900> expr<00:06:32.710> and<00:06:32.920> I<00:06:32.980> think

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
personally my favorite expr and I think

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.260 
personally my favorite expr and I think
throughout<00:06:33.370> the<00:06:33.520> game<00:06:33.640> is<00:06:33.820> going<00:06:33.970> to<00:06:34.030> be<00:06:34.090> my

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
fav expr it'd be nice to see maybe later

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.340 
fav expr it'd be nice to see maybe later
