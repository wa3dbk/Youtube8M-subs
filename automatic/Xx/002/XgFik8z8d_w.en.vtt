00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:12.059
 hello i have a forest day make up today 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.250
 for you two a very simple and easy 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.920
 something very natural and fast 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.560
 a lot of pink is complete 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.119
 new tuesday court and i wish 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.119
 Have fun with the video now 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.189
 I have my first video already in 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.660
 this beautiful Valentine's Day 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.910
 schneider shrouds the whole thing 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.220
 looks a bit more beautiful and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.290
 I start with a base to 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.700
 concealer foundation brother and 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.739
 I have eyebrow pencil before 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
 applied because they are always the same 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.370
 but because she was happy and from 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.210
 which motive video would like to have then 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.620
 can you do that in the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.090
 Write comments then I turn that 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 for you and now not one 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.480
 Setting base and carry it everywhere 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.250
 where I will later shadow 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.339
 apply and that is on the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.199
 movable lid in the end angle and on the 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.720
 lower lash line in these rooms 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.210
 in light pink with shadow then I start 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.729
 developed on the movable lid 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.520
 and know in the middle of the bottom 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.890
 Apply the eyelashes and find the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.540
 eyes immediately after that I mean 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.220
 It is not such a dark color 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 but I think it's totally crazy 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.360
 the difference if you like that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.150
 what bright shimmering spreads and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.299
 then I take myself here so earthy kosak 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.340
 and then portalize that in the lid fold 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.130
 you also have a bit of definition too 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.010
 give without a too dark sound to see 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.930
 that he is a relatively natural make-up 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.390
 what should be perfect for the day 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.490
 is suitable and then will 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.100
 with each other so its software transition 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.100
 arises and the whole looks like this 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.980
 then we continue with mascara and her 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.410
 knows me my favorite mascara is the 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.240
 barry mascara of benefit by 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.040
 I just get super long 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.390
 voluminous eyelashes and can me the lok 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.590
 Show spare me because I 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.670
 somehow always with eyelash curler 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.229
 injured 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.340
 I do not know why you can me too 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.140
 times I have the comments write 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.550
 that always happens but I would come 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.380
 I am always a little bit skiny 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.740
 between the display one that is not 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.360
 beautiful 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.730
 that 's why I'm glad that I'm the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.920
 Eyelash curler can save and wear 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.660
 I then and and run and themselves 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.670
 Blunts eyelashes are at the start 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.860
 and that is actually already 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.530
 the eye make-up i find the eyes 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.270
 simply radiate duty I beautiful but 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.950
 not so much with shadow used 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.570
 has and i dont know i am 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.370
 Not really the type of guy 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.950
 a lot of pink eyeshadow hurt at the example 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.020
 no free day that is very suitable 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.490
 good, but we have a rest in the 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.230
 face that we can decorate further 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.970
 our cheeks were us and take here 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.060
 I mean media 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.459
 place of benefit me noticed 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.590
 now that you do not like me to 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.570
 order because I filter the cool color 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.060
 but have put a real 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.209
 really nice from so tender of 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.180
 Covers euro banknotes a bit 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.050
 but does not emphasize overloading 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.440
 acts and then I'm taking the 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.019
 majors playmobil polish from patrice and 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.390
 I'm very pink that's why I'm wearing 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.960
 the only pointwise and unite 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.020
 called a bit over mine 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.120
 So he just a bit of a surgeon 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.040
 and the color is not quite so blatant 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.380
 although she is very strong right now 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.810
 and I think that harmonizes very well 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.610
 with pink eyeshadow and 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.340
 All in all, it's just a lot 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.170
 girly geeks or a valentines day 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.150
 make-up I personally like it a lot 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.740
 well, because I never really pink 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.600
 eyeshadow, but I have to say 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.010
 I became really convinced and 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.730
 it will also be loud on my body 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.680
 carry entry and sit at home 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.840
 And as a cancer food you are welcome 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.220
 Write as he does on Valentine's Day 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.840
 Those are the ones that will make me possible 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.620
 I personally do not go away 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.240
 and if you feel like it now 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.400
