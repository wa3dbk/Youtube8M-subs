excited to talk about cancer globally I

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.510 
excited to talk about cancer globally I
think<00:01:49.130> it's<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.430> travesty<00:01:49.730> that<00:01:51.340> women<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.490> I

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
think it's a travesty that women that I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.580 
think it's a travesty that women that I
met<00:01:52.790> in<00:01:52.820> Africa<00:01:53.420> would<00:01:53.780> rather<00:01:53.960> get<00:01:54.170> AIDS<00:01:54.350> than

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
met in Africa would rather get AIDS than

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.440 
met in Africa would rather get AIDS than
cancer<00:01:54.830> because<00:01:55.640> they<00:01:55.760> know<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:55.970> cancer<00:01:56.300> is

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
cancer because they know that cancer is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.040 
cancer because they know that cancer is
a<00:01:56.540> death<00:01:56.750> sentence<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:58.070> women<00:01:58.400> in<00:01:58.490> India

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
a death sentence that women in India

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.480 
a death sentence that women in India
have<00:02:00.050> to<00:02:00.170> keep<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.530> secret<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:01.159> they<00:02:01.370> have

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
have to keep it a secret that they have

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.280 
have to keep it a secret that they have
cancer<00:02:01.940> even<00:02:02.630> though<00:02:02.720> they<00:02:02.900> know<00:02:03.080> they<00:02:03.260> have

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
cancer even though they know they have

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.070 
cancer even though they know they have
it<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.680> they<00:02:03.770> know<00:02:03.890> they're

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
it and they know they're

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.830 
it and they know they're
dying<00:02:04.260> that<00:02:05.130> shouldn't<00:02:05.430> happen<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.810> I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
dying that shouldn't happen and so I

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.600 
dying that shouldn't happen and so I
feel<00:02:07.230> like<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:07.650> trip<00:02:07.980> is<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.460> opportunity
