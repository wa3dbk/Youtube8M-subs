buckle<00:03:04.819> right<00:03:04.970> there<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.950> all<00:03:07.430> that

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
buckle right there and that all that

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.699 
buckle right there and that all that
does<00:03:07.849> is<00:03:08.120> mate<00:03:08.570> with<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.810> horse<00:03:09.109> it's<00:03:09.350> not<00:03:09.500> made

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
does is mate with a horse it's not made

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.979 
does is mate with a horse it's not made
for<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.970> get<00:03:11.120> back<00:03:11.299> in<00:03:11.480> place<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:11.690> goes

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
for you and get back in place and goes

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.740

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.449 
over top and that just takes over the
tongue<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.440> tail<00:03:15.650> hair<00:03:15.920> doesn't<00:03:16.130> catch

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
tongue so the tail hair doesn't catch

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.610 
tongue so the tail hair doesn't catch
because<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.970> animal<00:03:17.329> has<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.600> much<00:03:17.780> right<00:03:18.049> to

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
because the animal has is much right to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.800 
because the animal has is much right to
flip<00:03:18.859> his<00:03:19.010> hair<00:03:19.250> as<00:03:19.850> when<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.329> mosquitoes
