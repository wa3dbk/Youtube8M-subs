00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
no one else what is it I think we all

get<00:03:36.989> lost<00:03:37.520> in<00:03:38.520> that<00:03:38.580> kind<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.470> mindset<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.890> I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
get lost in that kind of mindset that I

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.340 
get lost in that kind of mindset that I
want<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.880> better<00:03:42.120> than<00:03:42.270> another<00:03:42.690> person<00:03:43.170> I

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
want to be better than another person I

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.870 
want to be better than another person I
want<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.709> wear<00:03:43.890> this<00:03:44.040> because<00:03:44.250> no<00:03:44.550> one<00:03:44.670> else<00:03:44.790> is

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
want to wear this because no one else is

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.900

perform better like academically I just

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.719 
perform better like academically I just
think<00:04:56.039> when<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:56.550> dress<00:04:57.169> well<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.590> feel<00:04:59.039> like

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
think when you dress well you feel like

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.920 
think when you dress well you feel like
good<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:01.470> that's<00:05:02.039> the<00:05:02.130> reason<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.460> dress<00:05:02.900> so<00:05:03.900> I

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
good and that's the reason I dress so I

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.800 
good and that's the reason I dress so I
guess<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.350> kind<00:05:04.500> of<00:05:04.680> thought<00:05:05.100> of<00:05:05.970> my<00:05:06.210> video<00:05:06.539> is

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
guess the kind of thought of my video is

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.520 
guess the kind of thought of my video is
not<00:05:07.350> so<00:05:07.590> much<00:05:07.740> dressing<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.760> try<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.090> be<00:05:09.510> to<00:05:10.350> try

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
not so much dressing to try to be to try

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.620 
not so much dressing to try to be to try
to<00:05:10.560> stand<00:05:10.830> out<00:05:11.099> which<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.699> mean<00:05:11.970> everything<00:05:12.539> I
