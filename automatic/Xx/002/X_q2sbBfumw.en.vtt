00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.409 

here<00:00:02.100> are<00:00:02.190> some<00:00:02.340> basics<00:00:02.879> for<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.179> back

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
here are some basics for the back

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.280 
here are some basics for the back
tumbling<00:00:03.689> complex<00:00:04.470> which<00:00:05.009> is<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:06.359> necessity<00:00:06.960> to

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
tumbling complex which is a necessity to

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.530 
tumbling complex which is a necessity to
have<00:00:07.560> any<00:00:08.010> kind<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.490> aggressiveness<00:00:09.330> and

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
have any kind of aggressiveness and

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.140 
have any kind of aggressiveness and
confidence<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:10.590> backward<00:00:11.040> tumbling<00:00:11.490> so

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
confidence in this backward tumbling so

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.549 
confidence in this backward tumbling so
the<00:00:12.269> first<00:00:12.540> thing<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.960> got<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.259> not<00:00:13.410> be

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
the first thing is you got to not be

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.259 
the first thing is you got to not be
afraid<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:14.009> jump<00:00:14.280> up<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.639> air<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.150> we're

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
afraid to jump up in the air so we're

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.000 
afraid to jump up in the air so we're
just<00:00:15.299> going<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.630> do<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> set<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.260> five<00:00:16.470> straight

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
just going to do a set of five straight

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.849 
just going to do a set of five straight
jumps<00:00:17.430> also<00:00:18.270> working<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.930> arms<00:00:19.289> speed<00:00:19.650> so

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
jumps also working on the arms speed so

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.560 
jumps also working on the arms speed so
that<00:00:19.890> they<00:00:20.160> learn<00:00:20.369> how<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> use<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.090> arms

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
that they learn how to use the arms

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.740 
that they learn how to use the arms
instead<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.199> head<00:00:22.439> ready<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.189> jump

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
instead of the head ready and jump

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.599 
instead of the head ready and jump
flatten<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> hips<00:00:25.140> flatten<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> armpits<00:00:26.400> and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
flatten the hips flatten the armpits and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.310 
flatten the hips flatten the armpits and
make<00:00:26.760> sure<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.119> feet<00:00:27.449> are<00:00:27.689> getting<00:00:27.960> all<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
make sure the feet are getting all the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.669 
make sure the feet are getting all the
way<00:00:28.470> together<00:00:28.730> press<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.000> hips<00:00:30.240> forward

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
way together press the hips forward

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.500 
way together press the hips forward
alright<00:00:31.679> good<00:00:31.920> job<00:00:32.000> now<00:00:33.000> we're<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
alright good job now we're going to do a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.840 
alright good job now we're going to do a
handstand<00:00:33.960> step<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.340> backward

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
handstand step in now on backward

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.819 
handstand step in now on backward
tumbling<00:00:36.360> most<00:00:36.630> combinations<00:00:37.440> going

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
tumbling most combinations going

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.440 
tumbling most combinations going
backwards<00:00:38.370> come<00:00:38.640> from<00:00:38.879> either<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.180> back

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
backwards come from either a back

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.569 
backwards come from either a back
handspring<00:00:40.079> or<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> back<00:00:40.500> walkover<00:00:40.800> mostly<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
handspring or a back walkover mostly a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.940 
handspring or a back walkover mostly a
back<00:00:41.820> handspring<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.200> must<00:00:43.469> learn<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
back handspring so we must learn the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.010 
back handspring so we must learn the
handstand<00:00:44.340> step<00:00:44.850> incorrectly<00:00:45.360> which<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.870> how

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
handstand step incorrectly which is how

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990 
handstand step incorrectly which is how
you<00:00:46.079> come<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:46.770> handspring<00:00:47.460> so

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
you come out of the back handspring so

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.840 
you come out of the back handspring so
kick<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> handstand<00:00:49.460> push<00:00:50.460> through<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
kick up to a handstand push through the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.580 
kick up to a handstand push through the
beam<00:00:51.059> keeping<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> head<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> lead<00:00:52.410> with

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
beam keeping the head in and lead with

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.590 
beam keeping the head in and lead with
the<00:00:52.710> arms<00:00:53.039> now<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.430> saw<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.820> Lexie<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> arms

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the arms now you saw on Lexie the arms

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000 
the arms now you saw on Lexie the arms
are<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> little<00:00:54.870> bit<00:00:55.079> slow<00:00:55.440> we're<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> try

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
are a little bit slow we're going to try

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.330 
are a little bit slow we're going to try
it<00:00:56.070> again

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
it again

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.139 
it again
the<00:00:56.969> arms<00:00:57.420> should<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.840> ahead<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.770> head<00:00:59.149> so

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the arms should be ahead of the head so

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.360 
the arms should be ahead of the head so
the<00:01:00.300> arm<00:01:00.480> swing<00:01:01.050> should<00:01:01.379> lead<00:01:01.649> before<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the arm swing should lead before the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.479 
the arm swing should lead before the
head<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.300> was<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> little<00:01:03.750> bit<00:01:03.870> better

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
head that was a little bit better

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.859 
head that was a little bit better
Lexie<00:01:05.489> could<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.150> where<00:01:06.390> your<00:01:06.510> arms

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
Lexie could you do one where your arms

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.840 
Lexie could you do one where your arms
swing<00:01:07.260> back<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.010> over<00:01:08.040> your<00:01:08.430> head<00:01:08.640> this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
swing back and then over your head this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.390 
swing back and then over your head this
is<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.060> common<00:01:09.540> mistake<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.680> arms<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
is a common mistake the arms want to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.240 
is a common mistake the arms want to
leave<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.850> beam<00:01:12.060> go<00:01:12.420> down<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.500> swing<00:01:13.979> up

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
leave the beam go down and then swing up

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.300 
leave the beam go down and then swing up
which<00:01:14.909> usually<00:01:15.180> makes<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> bent<00:01:16.680> arm<00:01:16.860> back

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
which usually makes for a bent arm back

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
which usually makes for a bent arm back
handspring<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.150> we'll<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.659> more<00:01:18.689> time<00:01:19.080> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
handspring so we'll do one more time of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.780 
handspring so we'll do one more time of
the<00:01:19.409> handstand<00:01:19.799> step<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.520> watch<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the handstand step in watch the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.820 
the handstand step in watch the
direction<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.659> both<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> girl's<00:01:22.380> arms

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
direction of both of the girl's arms

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.420 
direction of both of the girl's arms
from<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.610> beam<00:01:24.350> push<00:01:25.350> forward<00:01:25.890> upward

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
from the beam push forward upward

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.480 
from the beam push forward upward
squeeze<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> hips<00:01:27.420> flat<00:01:28.020> position<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
squeeze the hips flat position now the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.510 
squeeze the hips flat position now the
next<00:01:29.970> thing<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.299> take<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> jump

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
next thing is to take this to a jump

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.980 
next thing is to take this to a jump
speed<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.880> pull<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> first<00:01:33.750> leg

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
speed up the pull down of the first leg

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.109 
speed up the pull down of the first leg
the<00:01:34.200> second<00:01:34.619> leg<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:35.040> into<00:01:35.400> three<00:01:35.670> punches

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the second leg right into three punches

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.280 
the second leg right into three punches
ready<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.579> feet<00:01:38.579> together<00:01:39.000> start<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.020> line

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
ready and feet together start in a line

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.429
