Sony and I have to say I think the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250 
Sony and I have to say I think the
Sony's<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.640> softer<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.390> footage<00:00:51.750> you'd

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
Sony's a little softer the footage you'd

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.720 
Sony's a little softer the footage you'd
be<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> judge<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.070> let<00:00:53.100> me<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.670> is

be the judge and let me know and this is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.240 
be the judge and let me know and this is
good<00:00:54.180> light<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.690> low-light<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.710> definitely<00:00:56.160> is

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
good light in low-light it definitely is

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.400 
good light in low-light it definitely is
softer<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.850> opinion<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.960> full

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
softer in my opinion but this is full

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.840 
softer in my opinion but this is full
daylight<00:00:58.920> midday<00:00:59.699> Sun<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:01.410> let<00:01:02.309> me<00:01:02.460> know<00:01:02.640> what

you think as far as whether or not it's
softer<00:01:07.170> than<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.710> end<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> Panasonic<00:01:09.119> and

more vibrant colors are the Panasonic

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.210

Panasonic<00:01:21.360> actually<00:01:22.229> has<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> setting<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.920> can

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220

set it on for the more vibrant colors I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.730 
set it on for the more vibrant colors I
think<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.159> vivid<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.869> tried<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.500> I

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
think for all vivid and I tried the I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.679 
think for all vivid and I tried the I
think<00:01:28.860> they<00:01:29.070> call<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.340> pop<00:01:29.610> color<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> Sony

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
think they call it pop color in the Sony

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260 
think they call it pop color in the Sony
but<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.799> does<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.159> look<00:01:32.490> realistic<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
but it really does not look realistic it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.569 
but it really does not look realistic it
looks<00:01:33.299> too<00:01:33.750> saturated<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.220> course<00:01:35.430> in

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
looks too saturated but of course in

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.550 
looks too saturated but of course in
post<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.360> saturate<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> colors<00:01:37.110> more<00:01:37.500> in

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
post you can saturate the colors more in

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.020

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.510 
the two you'll notice
in<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.390> surf<00:01:49.689> and<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.590> think<00:01:50.799> right<00:01:51.039> about<00:01:51.310> now

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
in the surf and I think right about now

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.399 
in the surf and I think right about now
I'm<00:01:51.670> starting<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.030> get<00:01:52.119> in<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.299> surf<00:01:52.539> the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
I'm starting to get in the surf the

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.880 
I'm starting to get in the surf the
footage<00:01:54.369> for<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.820> Panasonic<00:01:55.539> right<00:01:55.960> here<00:01:56.259> is

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
footage for the Panasonic right here is

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.670 
footage for the Panasonic right here is
getting<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.579> little<00:01:57.729> less<00:01:58.090> stable<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:59.439> one

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
getting a little less stable this one

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.340 
getting a little less stable this one
here<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.280> Sony<00:02:00.640> again<00:02:01.509> with<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.840> balanced

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
here is the Sony again with the balanced

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.980 
here is the Sony again with the balanced
optical<00:02:02.890> steadyshot<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:04.299> is<00:02:04.420> also<00:02:04.719> giving

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
optical steadyshot this is also giving

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.870 
optical steadyshot this is also giving
the<00:02:05.049> idea<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.409> how<00:02:05.560> well<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:05.950> keeps<00:02:06.220> focus<00:02:06.700> it

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
the idea of how well it keeps focus it

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.580 
the idea of how well it keeps focus it
was<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.299> noticed<00:02:07.659> their<00:02:07.810> faces<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.470> was

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
was it noticed their faces and it was

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.259 
was it noticed their faces and it was
keeping<00:02:08.950> focus<00:02:09.310> on<00:02:09.489> their<00:02:09.670> faces

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
keeping focus on their faces

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.300 
keeping focus on their faces
you<00:02:10.630> be<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.929> judge<00:02:10.959> as<00:02:11.380> far<00:02:11.560> as<00:02:11.650> how<00:02:11.800> well<00:02:12.069> that

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
you be the judge as far as how well that

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.449 
you be the judge as far as how well that
focused<00:02:12.819> tracking<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.510> working<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.769> this<00:02:15.069> next

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
focused tracking is working in this next

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.460 
focused tracking is working in this next
clip<00:02:15.700> we're<00:02:15.940> coming<00:02:16.209> up<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.480> again<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:17.019> back<00:02:17.230> to

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
clip we're coming up to again is back to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.110 
clip we're coming up to again is back to
the<00:02:17.560> Panasonic<00:02:18.310> actually<00:02:18.640> went<00:02:18.790> up<00:02:18.819> three

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the Panasonic actually went up three

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.589 
the Panasonic actually went up three
clips<00:02:19.269> here<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.560> row<00:02:20.769> at<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.099> Panasonic<00:02:21.599> and

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
clips here in a row at the Panasonic and

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.110 
clips here in a row at the Panasonic and
especially<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.440> last<00:02:23.680> clip<00:02:24.190> which<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.880> that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
especially the last clip which is that

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.320 
especially the last clip which is that
same<00:02:25.450> clip<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:27.040> them<00:02:27.190> walking<00:02:27.459> towards<00:02:28.150> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
same clip with them walking towards the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.780 
same clip with them walking towards the
camera<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:29.140> think<00:02:29.830> you're<00:02:30.010> going<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.340> notice

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
camera I think you're going to notice

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.370 
camera I think you're going to notice
right<00:02:31.200> here<00:02:32.790> kind<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.849> shaky<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.660> again<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.110> was

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
right here kind of shaky and again I was

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.930 
right here kind of shaky and again I was
standing<00:02:35.769> in<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.950> surf<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.549> surf<00:02:36.760> was

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
standing in the surf and the surf was

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.300 
standing in the surf and the surf was
hammering<00:02:37.330> into<00:02:37.480> my<00:02:37.660> legs<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.349> in<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.769> sand

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
hammering into my legs and in the sand

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.520 
hammering into my legs and in the sand
was<00:02:39.580> eroding<00:02:40.150> from<00:02:40.299> underneath<00:02:40.660> my<00:02:40.959> feet<00:02:41.230> and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
was eroding from underneath my feet and

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.530 
was eroding from underneath my feet and
so<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.769> was<00:02:41.860> kind<00:02:42.069> of<00:02:42.160> hard<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.540> keep

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
so it was kind of hard to keep

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.259 
so it was kind of hard to keep
everything<00:02:43.840> steady<00:02:44.290> but<00:02:45.190> it's<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:45.940> good<00:02:46.150> to

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
everything steady but it's it's good to

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.880 
everything steady but it's it's good to
see<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.480> think<00:02:46.810> these<00:02:46.930> kinds<00:02:47.349> of<00:02:47.410> real-world

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
see I think these kinds of real-world

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.300 
see I think these kinds of real-world
tests<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:49.569> far<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:49.900> how<00:02:50.049> everything<00:02:50.530> works<00:02:51.069> out

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
tests as far as how everything works out

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.550 
tests as far as how everything works out
so<00:02:52.120> let<00:02:52.239> me<00:02:52.329> know<00:02:52.420> your<00:02:52.599> thoughts<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:53.319> again
