using<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.710> button<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.489> level<00:01:00.090> pressure<00:01:00.600> plate

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
using a button a level pressure plate

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.920 
using a button a level pressure plate
let's<00:01:01.829> go<00:01:02.039> George<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.609> Reds<00:01:03.000> down<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.390> any<00:01:03.629> gonna

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
let's go George a Reds down of any gonna

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.330 
let's go George a Reds down of any gonna
leave<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:05.090> piston<00:01:06.110> extends<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
leave a piston extends if it can and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.590 
leave a piston extends if it can and
pushing<00:01:09.330> blocks<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> I'm<00:01:11.820> sure<00:01:12.060> that's<00:01:12.270> again

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
pushing blocks so I'm sure that's again

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.770 
pushing blocks so I'm sure that's again
a<00:01:12.780> sticky<00:01:13.560> piston<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.220> powered<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.330> same<00:01:15.600> way

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
a sticky piston is powered the same way

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.039 
a sticky piston is powered the same way
and<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:17.340> extends<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.509> push<00:01:19.020> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
and it extends if they can push it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.620 
and it extends if they can push it
blocks<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.189> retracts<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.939> goes<00:01:21.240> back<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
blocks when it retracts it goes back to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020 
blocks when it retracts it goes back to
block<00:01:22.020> touching<00:01:22.560> destiny<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.670> business

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
block touching destiny for the business

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.469 
block touching destiny for the business
I<00:01:24.439> can't<00:01:25.439> use<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.979> sticky<00:01:26.369> piston<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.970> don't

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
I can't use you sticky piston I don't

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
I can't use you sticky piston I don't
have<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.810> these<00:01:27.900> fine<00:01:28.110> bubbles<00:01:28.470> let<00:01:28.799> me<00:01:28.890> show

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
have in these fine bubbles let me show

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.880 
have in these fine bubbles let me show
you<00:01:29.130> how<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> use<00:01:29.520> no<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.680> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
you how to use no more so all you do is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.600 
you how to use no more so all you do is
place<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.540> then<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.320> try<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> find<00:01:34.860> what

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
place it and then you try and find what

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.090 
place it and then you try and find what
imported<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.180> are<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.110> being<00:01:37.770> placed

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
imported really are you being placed

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.940 
imported really are you being placed
back<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.579> front<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.170> then<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.200> need<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
level wish I have and then you replace

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.020 
level wish I have and then you replace
it<00:01:47.070> next<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:48.560> then<00:01:49.560> move<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.820> pushes

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
it next to it then move it and it pushes
