00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.810 
and I have topped it off the fluid open
it<00:02:00.329> up<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.409> more<00:02:01.619> fluid<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.219> because

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
it up and it's more fluid to it because

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340 
it up and it's more fluid to it because
it<00:02:03.000> was<00:02:03.030> pretty<00:02:03.270> low<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.259> took

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
it was pretty low because when I took

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.800 
it was pretty low because when I took
off<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.770> caliper<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.759> let<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> lot<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.600> that

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
off that caliper it let a lot of that

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.779 
off that caliper it let a lot of that
brake<00:02:07.110> fluid<00:02:07.469> out<00:02:07.590> right<00:02:08.129> there<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> floor

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
brake fluid out right there on the floor

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.050 
brake fluid out right there on the floor
and<00:02:09.860> made<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.069> mess

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and made a little mess

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.270 
and made a little mess
release<00:02:13.629> some<00:02:13.750> brake<00:02:14.050> fluid<00:02:14.080> everywhere<00:02:14.560> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
release some brake fluid everywhere so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.920 
release some brake fluid everywhere so
I'm<00:02:15.550> gonna<00:02:15.700> go<00:02:15.819> find<00:02:16.090> someone<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.540> step<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:16.840> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
I'm gonna go find someone to step on the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.720 
I'm gonna go find someone to step on the
brakes<00:02:17.140> leave<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.129> system<00:02:18.370> off<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:20.640> put<00:02:21.640> it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
brakes leave the system off and put it

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.290
