00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.130
 hello beautiful just like we did 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.720
 welcome to the channel today 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.370
 I bring this style of hair very 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.140
 romantic I hope you like this 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.180
 video tutorial a little different in the 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.059
 channel let's start with our 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.039
 Perfectly brushed hair and if it is 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.380
 of the second day without washing much better 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.140
 because it's more flexible you can stop two 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.820
 frontal irregular sections of 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.619
 I'm stopping our hair with 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.410
 two tweezers only so that I do not 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.500
 clog up and I'm going to start taking a 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.720
 middle part and they are small sections 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.960
 but they are from the middle part of the head 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:40.190
 and I'm going to start poking to curl with 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.860
 a brush with thick bristles and so that 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.190
 stay in position and you do not 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.090
 lose that frizz I'm applying 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:53.120
 fixative spray so you have more 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.160
 volume and stop further since 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.649
 I finish removing all the parts I'm going to 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.550
 get to half the hair by the 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.860
 back and I'm going to start brushing 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.360
 a little bit so he starts taking 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.640
 shape 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.280
 this way of hair and with your fingers what 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.250
 I'm going to start molding a little more to 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.910
 to take the volume in the highest part 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.100
 without it being very scandalous and can 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.250
 take some hair from the side 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.040
 to be able to link the backs and 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.830
 stop them and secure them with some 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.950
 pins work and you as they say in 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.870
 some countries and I'm entering 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.970
 only twisting the hair a 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.200
 little bit more so that it stops if 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.229
 occupying about 34 pins and that's it 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.540
 brush your hair and we already have our 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.090
 little bomb that is the main part of the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.479
 combed after I'm going to grab the fringe 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.340
 I'm going to brush it, it's two 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.310
 sections that I had separated and I'm going to 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.460
 start to find the side line 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.430
 what 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.900
 my hair is naturally drawn 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.460
 I'm going to separate it and on one side of the 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.680
 area that we had already created towards 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.979
 back see take a little new piece 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.560
 of hair a strip only and I will 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.920
 start making a braid does not matter 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.569
 that this braid that thin really 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.100
 all we want is for you to arrive 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.680
 to the other end that is what 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.280
 long enough for the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.250
 we can link and that when you 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.310
 let's increase the volume to the braid can 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.230
 get to the other side what am I 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.290
 securing with a transparent sandpaper 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.420
 small that can later be removed 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.180
 quietly without problem and I begin to 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.390
 pull the side parts of the braid 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.459
 to each of the chains that 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.240
 they have the braid I'm pulling them up 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.700
 that starts to grow in volume 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.570
 in each of the parts is transita 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.760
 and it's quite broad and since we have 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.850
 the dimension that we want we can 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.280
 pass over the changuito 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.310
 bulging that we had done backwards 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.040
 and we are going to assure the transit 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.280
 under or between the hair on the other side 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.640
 with pins only this is the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.430
 part more complicated than the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.320
 combed because after this the only thing 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.010
 what we have to do is curl everything 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.350
 our hair with some iron or with 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.990
 some dog like this one that I'm 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.990
 taking that is from the box mark me 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.180
 it seems jr scholarship that is an expensive company 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.760
 I think it says it des continued 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.740
 but any dog â€‹â€‹that has them 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.920
 will serve the only thing that needs to be done 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.470
 is to start doing all of our 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.950
 hair on the side and on the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.830
 back until we reach our 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.210
 little flequitos I take away can be up there 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.030
 to be very careful not to burn 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.569
 above all and that in the fringe I have a lot 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.030
 watch out 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.620
 and the licit ones go towards the sense that 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.329
 we want here I did it 1 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.430
 stroke not forward an attraction 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.280
 forward but they can do all 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.859
 backwards or all forward as 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.680
 you think you can see them much better 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:16.519
 I'm not tightening my curls too much 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.949
 I'm leaving them a bit loose and then 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.660
 to decorate this hairstyle 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.610
 I'm just taking the flowers 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.110
 that are quite economical that have 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.539
 many milestones I'm taking a big 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.820
 amount I'm putting them in the part 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.770
 where our bulging starts in the 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.720
 rear 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.180
 and then that's all it's the only ornament 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.240
 They can also use some ornament 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.930
 a large flower or diamond and then 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.639
 this is the end so that is how it is if 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.590
 they want to fix you can put spray 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.110
 Fixer so that it lasts even more 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.659
 during the event and then I have a 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.900
 very simple and elegant addition to 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:55.550
 romantic going to a party I hope that 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.710
