00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:10.080
 Hello it reduces a Youtube For the last part of the other minute increase in the value of shares 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.280
 I want you to see it, so I can talk to you quickly. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.360
 I'll do it 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.859
 First, I put a script here on the object 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:24.269
 In part because I get rid of this variable as between a variable called a scroll 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.440
 This scripting, which increases the value over time, 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:32.029
 I'll play it once. 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:36.500
 Once you play Unity, you will see the image texture 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:41.180
 As the value of this texture increases, you can see how it moves. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.300
 There can be as tasty figures you see now I go here now offset 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.739
 Is there a value or is this constantly moving 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.280
 2 Now the texture is much more see the flowing water content so as 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.750
 Here, I'll be there to ski the value increases slightly 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.650
 So the faster the value of the skis is now increasingly higher than the offset value 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.750
 Textures can identify areas that move faster 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.730
 I 'll show you the source code for a while , 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:14.780
 I have something like this 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:18.950
 b You can code it directly, but if you press control cream , 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:23.510
 Is not the api that we talked about two times open? 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:28.520
 But you have to think of something like " api" 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:31.970
 Now ours, we now have this part now the variable value and we 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:37.850
 This is where the code actually moves . 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:42.920
 3 text in the yaw portion 3 texture offset in pit 3 In this part, a control comma 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.660
 If you click on the header of the code , 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.190
 Search will be done 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:54.200
 Now press the cleaners in this part of the purchase is viewed so that the source code 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.760
 Now there is this source code into the code you see evil, I put up here now, 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.060
 It's very similar. 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:04.310
 Yes, you can move like this. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:10.760
 That is, where the renderer Maetel Earl 3 Tex office is a composition for the part 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:14.660
 u and the scroll speed extreme scroll speed increased by this portion 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:19.520
 This part is now you see there is a part of who one is as important as the top 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:23.480
 Text x This part has a texture type that follows the oil shaker 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:29.500
 This section is here for a brief description. 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.500
 I'll explain it to you again next time. Thank you.
