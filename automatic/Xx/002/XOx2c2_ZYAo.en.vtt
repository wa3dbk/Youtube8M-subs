00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.679
 the staff looks only I already did the leg 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:12.840
 arm and body we'll have a detail 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.800
 of the famous culture called the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.800
 milk is here in the mold I did 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.060
 respecting the opening of the crowded people 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.330
 doll after 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.039
 I sewed twice and now it's time to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.890
 import with scissors here i will not 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.719
 make this record here 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.649
 I will not come and cut with the scissors here 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.980
 No, I'll go straight with the scissors. 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:45.230
 leaving a small margin comes from 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.230
 seam of half a centimeter or so 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.210
 cutting all around the body of 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.210
 Doll 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:36.510
 You see, I step straight with the scissors. 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:39.080
 here then I'll just cut here will stay 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.080
 the square 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:47.360
 I found this way interesting 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.860
 because it made it easy for the doll to stay 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.470
 seat was opened here 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.760
 So what are we going to do together? 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:04.760
 seam with seam and so on seam 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.760
 seam 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.460
 I can be directed to the same side 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:24.730
 put a pin, I 'll come and go 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:31.530
 pass a straight stitch here to form a 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.530
 sewing very thin caxineiro 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.590
 the same way I 'm going to do the other side 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:14.670
 a sewing brac nor sexy se 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.790
 seam was turned to this side here 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.040
 the company that is otherwise will get twisted 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:32.150
 accompanies here why of the difference in 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:32.150
 doll finish there 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:50.099
 usually who there is sometimes a 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:53.690
 pin does not let the machine sew 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.690
 But we have a problem 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:09.630
 that's it okay but he will stay with the 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.720
 little animals 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:16.230
 Then I'm going to cut the animals and I'm going 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.170
 divert right 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.050
 before turning i have the curved parts 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:26.100
 of mold 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:30.720
 so I'll make the peak do small 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:35.580
 here cuts well in the corners without cutting 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.880
 sewing for when I turn it does not 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:45.300
 get twisted until he makes the curve 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:47.720
 stay right seeing this in the 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.720
 neck 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.870
 on the waist 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.270
 right on the dot here 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.750
 then I 'll have that same curved part 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:23.310
 here in the part of the arm under the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:25.850
 Arm is on the leg, I'm going 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.850
 have here 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.460
 I do the same thing everywhere 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.780
 have the color come in 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.780
 I'll be doing this 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.100
 before them will come 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.600
 Okay now there are several ways to 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.580
 untapped has several tips also in 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.070
 other internet videos such as divert the 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.470
 people will be diverting with enough 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:25.020
 Patience and then I'll show you 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.020
 already divert to the next
