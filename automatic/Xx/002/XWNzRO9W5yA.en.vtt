00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.880
 Good day to all my viewers 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.519
 video blog my name is alexander 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.590
 gennady and today i will tell you about 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.150
 one crown will not even be more exact about him 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.609
 talk about just share my 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.689
 impressions this wine is called screw 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.480
 pant leg is not just wine this 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.090
 manufacturer Herman Silverman 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.970
 the heir to the farm decided to do 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.420
 big revolution among white wines italy 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.390
 and as a result this wine was recognized 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.290
 eight times in a row since 2000 as better 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 and white wine italy recognized it 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.789
 sommelier association of Italy that is 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.620
 Italians themselves and whether it is Italy themselves 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.110
 recognized this wine as the best in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.690
 Italy and what is in it 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.760
 special first of course unusual 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.770
 name label itself look only 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 name vintage what's not and more 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.430
 of course you can write nothing 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.859
 see counter label where we are 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.870
 read what it is 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.450
 venice julia what is this wine ah ji that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 there is this local wine but the name itself 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.390
 also unusual because that is not on it 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.820
 abbreviated from Antonin this too 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.360
 not without reason because the wine was called in 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.909
 the honor of two women 1 Antonina is the former 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.009
 us former mistress of the vineyards on 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.140
 which grapes are now grown for 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.930
 the production of this wine and the second 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.420
 Antonina who do you think this is one of 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.430
 mistresses casanova 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.960
 with the only lover who is not 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.369
 possessed any 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.450
 by generic origin here in these in 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.990
 the honor of these two 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.740
 Antonin called screw pants silverman 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.140
 this is one of those people who graduated 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.600
 two very important wine academies in 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.580
 Italy came back his farm 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.790
 accordingly somewhere in Europe it is 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.369
 I traveled for sale came and 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.470
 saw his father practically 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.840
 dramatically change the style of white wines 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.759
 along with the so-called red wines 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.239
 super tuscan and began to appear 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.880
 super frimu omsky supervened a and so 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.390
 further and here it is just this super white 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.900
 wine 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.030
 one of the first to appear in Italy 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.260
 1975 and the credit just yet strong 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.910
 irmana vintage tonino wine itself do 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.000
 also quite unusual way in 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.050
 The first 5 grapes are pork 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.840
 blanchard yes not 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.690
 it roared jalla it picked then it 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.670
 malvasia when first time 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.260
 you put your nose down 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.560
 malva for this one some sweet 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.079
 taste of cheap wines but gradually wine 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.079
 Sauvignon Blanc opens 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.440
 and some baked apples that gives 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.890
 the ball is given well and in color of course we immediately 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.440
 we can see the very Sauvignon Blanc 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.049
 the same green tint that we all 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.049
 immediately find out when we look at the wine 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.670
 Well, let 's taste it 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.210
 ashamed spits such wine because 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.460
 8 consecutive years the best wine in Italy but his 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.830
 taste certainly can feel it 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.600
 complexity completeness lashed some 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.140
 tropical fruits even slip and 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:30.030
 baked apples feel that wine 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.640
 uneasy is the most important thing because 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.100
 there seems to be a department for wine 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.610
 the best in Italy and I want something 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.390
 same feel of course you start 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.880
 treat him without qualification 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.040
 it is felt in wine though at first 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.020
 something was simple-minded of course when 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.690
 you are at sea 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.360
 the air will not make it clear all the nuances of this 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.410
 guilt and it needs to be felt in 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.490
 some bright big room ok 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.060
 ventilated 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.450
 and of course not by the sea for whom 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.550
 this wine wine it costs 3-3 and a half 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.230
 thousands per bottle I don't think that is normal 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.540
 the consumer will buy it in order 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.400
 to enjoy it 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.560
 it's more likely to blame 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.560
 wine for those who can imagine it 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.070
 allow and probably for those who are looking for 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.680
 just for those but the video I shot for 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.660
 those who sell such wine for those who 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.510
 I wonder what this link is and why it 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.710
 Considered the best wine in Italy because 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.620
 as in russian 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.010
 the description of this wine I saw only one 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.840
 which is copied copy copied 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.460
 manufacturer's website, that is what 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.590
 imposes in taste 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.409
 the manufacturer is everywhere copied by 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.300
 all of our russian site 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:52.219
 that's why I wanted to express my 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.749
 opinion and by the way one more thing than it 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.149
 for some reason she becomes warmer 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.679
 it gets tastier seemingly white 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:05:00.110
 wine the warmer the tastier 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:03.889
 this was my video blog see and 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:07.089
 try only good wine to everyone 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.089
 thanks and bye 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.660
 vintage Antonina Ivanovna 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.660
 but
