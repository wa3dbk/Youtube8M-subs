 recommendations this time I come to you with 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.610
 the roadrunners between 5 and 15 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.900
 millions are the roadrunner as 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.139
 those players that you give them a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.299
 triangle and they say until then we start 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.670
 by cheek of how you can see the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.520
 decent dribbler very good speed 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.890
 dribble passes of senses too and 87 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.650
 speed and makes it even more sitting 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.630
 still that has turnaround turn 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.130
 skilful and vertical those three 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.710
 skills make it a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.960
 magnificent bargainer we passed dumbia already 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.489
 known for a lot of insurance they have nothing 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.079
 bad a pretty explosive force 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.020
 decent dribbling skills and ability 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.120
 of reaction good they are very very fast 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.649
 it just lacks a bit of body has 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.270
 good shooting power and how can you 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.579
 see has roadrunners and skillful feint 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.829
 let's put together hormones have 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.180
 curiously entrance stretched two touches 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.620
 and he passed on very precise something quite 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.199
 curious considering that as 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.930
 you can see is a guy who has 72 of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.610
 long pass repeat long precise pass 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.530
 bargains decently move pretty 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.500
 well with the gold on the feet is very and very 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.560
 fast is strong jumps a lot measures ones 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.630
 78 and it has 85 power without a doubt a 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.580
 We are going to candles and candles if we 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.470
 it has verticality moves forward 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.210
 delayed and skillful turn which is the best 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.220
 that has then that this simple in everything 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.140
 the reaction capacity is good is 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.270
 pretty fast in explosiveness and 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.040
 dribble speed and especially those 90's 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.509
 tip speed let's go now with giovanni 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.759
 two saints and we see the fastest of the 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.830
 list is here because of that explosiveness that 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.500
 dribble and because it has the llegador 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.530
 outside of the foot two touches and all those 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.780
 positions is certainly a player who 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.350
 well used runs a lot and can do 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.570
 virguerías we are fighting the bei verga the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.520
 to call it as you want babel like 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.470
 you can see dribble to good has good 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.570
 Dodge speed is also a pretty 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.030
 fast has a balance of meaning 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.310
 something else that there is sense even and 85 of 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.590
 power undoubtedly a front of the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.360
 that arrives and connects it also has in 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.580
 the band will help you a lot if you leave from 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.800
 the bench we go with giant gas water 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.909
 gyan asamoah does not stand out in absolutely 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.649
 nothing of shots 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.479
 of passes of this direction simply 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.129
 Dodge the same but it's very good 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.660
 reaction capacity explosive force and 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.349
 dribble speed and especially in the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.030
 physical section is a friends machine 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.739
 it measures 80 more and as you can see 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.319
 has game with skillful spinner volley 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.420
 flying in case it was not clear 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.549
 volley is flying and bicycle 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.290

 back we go with via vinil with 92 of 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.739
 speed about 70 and 76 of regularity and 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.810

 many things have a decent pass a 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.910
 shot good enough explosive strength 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.530
 good reaction ability well beat 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.140
 Dodge very good tip speed too 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.269
 me of 173 regularity of 6 and has 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.950
 verticality play at first touch and 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.190
 Curiously, how can you? 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.450
 see it has a 1,100 people 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.370
 there are players who have a lot more people 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.140
 and for me he's a great player 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.800
 Pablo Pablo Hernández, as you can see 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.230

 tip 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.650
 we passed alternates to the vague that although 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.240
 neither is it the fastest here 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.000
 for giving a point a little more 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.130
 technical to the list of roadrunners like 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.230
 you can see great dribbler good control 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.820
 good ball and great the unison to 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.350
 Explosive strength and reaction capacity 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.190
 and speed and dribble too 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.600
 good 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.640
 has no ability if the only thing 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.730
 that fails but it is certainly a crack 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.620
 friends let's Slovak stock this 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.500

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.570
 decent passes good explosive force and 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.100
 dribble speed and 85 speed that 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.720
 they make it go through the same thing 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.060
 that with many others up to the slalom 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.530
 roadrunner and turned to let's go now with 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.570
 wright phillips that has roadrunners 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.220
 skilful self-pairing turn and verticality as 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.950
 you can see it has a simple dribble 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.570
 pass is a bit bad the bad shot 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.330
 directly expressive force very 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.340

 Skillful spinning and elastic twist as you can 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.350
 see is not really good anything in this 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.820
 first page but it has a strength 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.280
 explosive and a good dribble speed 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.190

 reaction capacity 83 is quite 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.900
 well he has already failed a little bit 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.569
 explosive and speed dribble but 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.729
