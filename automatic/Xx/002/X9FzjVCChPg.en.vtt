00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.320
 the delay in bonn jô already in the skin william 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.570
 school thanked the production of 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.240
 chicks ate great quality and 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.480
 dedication friend music student and even 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.660
 we throw that is interesting and enough 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.020
 efficient for you than keyboardist 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.200
 although it looks like a keyboard 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.570
 but he is is a piano digital piano 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.610
 the number of keys on a piano 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.160
 normal and the weight of the keys is also only 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.170
 functional harmony she is like mechanic 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.230
 singing contest to prove car 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.900
 for example you pass not only the question 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.150
 the drive but you can patient 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.100
 how it works since the combustion of 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.870
 burning of fuel and production of 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.180
 energy from the engine blast all this 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.489
 then it would be functionality of a motor 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.510
 of a one-car functional harmony 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.630
 explains this to prepare a musician 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.610
 what is the difference then you can be 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.500
 an instrumentalist to devote himself to 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.650
 all technical exercises are in the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.570
 Blog tahoe year but the harmony worked 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.370
 give you all the knowledge to you and 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.450
 in addition to those involved in what is 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.210
 accustomed to listening 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.570
 so for example if you ask a question 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.330
 for traditional music in the day 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.549
 has not advanced much in studies if 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.799
 I do an op base 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.950
 maybe I can make a bigger one by the hand 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.950
 right 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.820
 our greatest good to do any 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.920
 thing as long as you explain 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.520
 Do you know what 's happening? 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.190
 so why this sound here? 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.440
 I have been the Catholic Sunday at hand 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.270
 right which is greater attention pity 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.150
 I have only had to generate fifth 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.250
 increased and I realize that the fifth 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.530
 with much greater is the seventh largest in the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.760
 dollar so if I think of a name I 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.830
 I can think of bigger with low do or 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.940
 be a smaller basket I can in that 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.160
 technical study that would be a fifth 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.370
 augmented 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.740
 I can consider the doc a tonic and 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.420
 here is a change from this 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.470
 then to implement seventh largest 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.140
 we should not despise any 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.660
 novelty is because all modality 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.660
 it goes already in vector time in continuous 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.700
 how music can create a scenario 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.180
 or the scene also for music with a 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.120
 micro-organism is 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.640
 a young man also said that he listened 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.950
 the searches she changed the beach of 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.720
 put what's inspiring him has 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.000
 nothing to be copying American music 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.280
 many people say this is mechanized 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.040
 this is political quarrel between the extinct 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.930
 Soviet Union capitalism and communism 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.700
 then in the song of keeping this 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.440
 influence has even a manifestation of 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.950
 to use 70's guitars 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.400
 both want to know what policy and 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.290
 music reviews well let's vote 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.220
 here then I'll have a dock 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.410
 implemented in 71 then for the 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.360
 pianist is different from the guitar does not have 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.120
 a lot of sight of the notes but here you have 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.120
 a super-fast reasoning solve 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.920
 after a joke we do this in the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.110
 greater here varying with 7 greater than the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.630
 sound of justice of the greatest work 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.040
 deficit would be as I commented but I 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.530
 I consider it a gift that they implemented 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.530
 the sixth looks only very common in songs 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.340
 then this is the advantage if this does not 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.110
 it was ours to develop all this yes a 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.810
 Super fast exercise that I give to 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.300
 You do that to the greatest and we do it. 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.190
 all three of psol 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.930
 It is not only talked about, it is also revealed that 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.150
 means all fan tracks 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.800
 bigger but thinking that everything is better 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:11.100
 so to speak here the ninth which is the fourth 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.690
 and the sixth in its place with 40 carrots and 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.130
 the best is the 17 largest 11 781 hurts me 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.239
 The smallest of the sling with seven is her number. 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.710
 be greater 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:26.340
 talk about the sixth album of the tonic 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.100
 only if it is only the fifth adjusts the seventh 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.780
 greater is noticed of the 7th and 9th stick in doha 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.540
 with 7 minor 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.340
 two functions of the sun is also 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.790
 interesting this then is only effect 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.790
 folks 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.420
 I can do everything is to work rhythmically 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.760
 in this case the piano instrument of 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.920
 percussion notes lose shots 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.900
 so you can even work division 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.820
 who work tambourim never broke with 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.750
 the political division and applying kean 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.970
 forwarded a copy several chroniclers is you 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.130
 cover all the time are rhythm here 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.350
 that's why it has nothing to do with harmony 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.420
 in this sense but the way you play 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.720
 harmony will then generate several 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.720
 influences 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.900
 you work with good honey now 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.830
 tip is for the sun to work 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:38.160
 his left hand 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:38.160
 in April the various versions of dollars 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.840
 the number of nifty 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.590
 I want to do it here in jack form no longer 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.590
 it's just 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.140
 you were much of the classic period 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.770
 Mosley trio that required a lot 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.950
 speed in the small eighth tone that I 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.950
 have 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.190
 it's one more sign the school did not believe 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.190
 you do not brás
