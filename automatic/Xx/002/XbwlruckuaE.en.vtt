that's<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> my<00:01:40.920> principal<00:01:41.340> concerns<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
that's one of my principal concerns in a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.609 
that's one of my principal concerns in a
way<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.510> where<00:01:42.689> threat<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.170> emerges

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
way really is where threat now emerges

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.020 
way really is where threat now emerges
which<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:43.979> transport<00:01:44.460> networks<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
which is on transport networks and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.330 
which is on transport networks and
outside<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.600> main<00:01:45.750> sites<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:47.009> would<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.220> nice

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
outside the main sites it would be nice
