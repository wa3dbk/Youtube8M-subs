00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.450
 hello everyone this time it's 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.400
 a little tutorial video for you 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.990
 explain how to change the hard drive 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.090
 from his playstation 4 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.070
 so it's really simple there is 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.660
 really nothing complicated the only 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.820
 thing that may be the most subtle to 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.350
 to do is to remove the cabot that is 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.880
 there because it's going to happen on the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.440
 brilliant part of the ps4 so already I 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.300
 already advises you to take back 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.520
 benchmarks at the level of the band of 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.190
 bright which in the middle of there to put 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.230
 your nails here to shoot a little bit 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.440
 dry tac 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.420
 and now it rises alone in just 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.070
 forced a little bit and so here 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.660
 the panel is removed and we have the record 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.970
 hard that is at this location so has it 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.430
 so you take a screwdriver 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.979
 cruciform I do not know if you could 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.619
 see it we did not see too much and 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.479
 in fact here a small screw with the logo 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.500
 playstation 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:26.210
 so I'm going to zoom in on a 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:32.299
 little bit here this opinion it takes place 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.990
 period lices and so I specify that 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.610
 remove the hard drive finally change it 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:43.630
 do not remove the warranty 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:47.390
 here is life that's how it is 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.880
 so the hard disk of the ps4 so he 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.880
 makes 500 gigas and it's a hard drive on 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 will say traditional up zooms game 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:06.730
 so it's almost done it's also written 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.870
 little to push write the sp 500 it's 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.450
 a meaning that means his holy gildas 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.200
 here and it is also marked here 500 giga 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.610
 flat by cons we notice that it is 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.459
 not the same brand of hard drives as 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.410
 those who bought a ps4 to the states 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.840
 united here that's where it's a mark of 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.340
 samsung this is not bad 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.940
 do not worry so after you have to 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:33.310
 unscrew your treviso here here here 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:35.290
 always with the same screw turn and I 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.140
 will change it directly too with 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.680
 a new wind hard drive can them 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.510
 buy 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.520
 and it's not really a hard drive that 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.220
 I bought I'll show you that 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:56.430
 I'm finished with the small and small 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:56.430
 propellers hop yet 2 again a 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.000
 So here is the hard drive after he gets 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:13.099
 simply remove I put aside 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.829
 and so the new hard drive is a 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.299
 sshd you see it means it's 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.159
 a hard drive with in addition to the memory 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.439
 flash ie it's a little bit 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.480
 the equivalent of a ssd which is not so 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.829
 a hard drive is that the sdc that the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.889
 yves memory of flash memory 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.150
 forgiveness and so suddenly having 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.220
 a hard drive to the recipes of this 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.939
 technology there will accelerate the times of 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.379
 loading the facilities the 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.230
 boot of the console everything will change 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.639
 and for info so the mark knows if 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.379
 gates a very good brand at the level 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.719
 hard drives and the capacity its 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.669
 thousand giga a land so an angle of 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.579
 blow I double the capacity and we'll see 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:56.489
 in the end it was there the quality of 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:58.799
 available spaces on the ps4 because 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:04.859
 that with the hard disk of 500 gigas we have 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:07.979
 an available space of 400 1 gigabyte so 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:11.579
 we lose almost monkeys so there is 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:18.419
 will see with this hard drive there first one 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:21.449
 will lose ap after for info there you 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.919
 also need a hard disk in pc format 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.800
 portable ie it is not necessary that he 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.800
 exceeds 9 mm 5th thick 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.070
 so here's something to take in 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.909
 account after it must be 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.590
 greater than 160 gigas as they said 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:40.080
 in the user manual without 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.699
 content of gildas and 7 years is good 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.070
 too little because when I installed 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:48.479
 killzone shadow crazy on on the ps4 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.099
 nothing but him takes 40 th giga so with 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.610
 four games installed you quickly 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.110
 done around what so after age bongo 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.199
 the longest of yours to hand over the ten 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.930
 years old and so after I'm going to show you 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.909
 how do you do to put the hood back 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.720
 the hood their master it's really the 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:12.860
 most part 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:12.860
 fast and the simplest a man 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.370
 the man I repeat that does not prevent 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.699
 to make war changing the 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.770
 hard drive snow does not grill your 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.360
 guarantee so if you ever have a 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.610
 point of discussing on this I repeat 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.229
 so much about the other videos 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.810
 if you have a hard drive problem 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.430
 do not hesitate to change it godfather 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.599
 greater capacity for greater 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:40.110
 speed here is that it's not more 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:43.810
 complicated that I put back the little screw 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:51.039
 with still wines in the triangle 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:54.940
 round square and 3 that's a ca on what that 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.860
 be well closed and so the hood hop 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.650
 it's not complicated we do not put it 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.139
 almost with flowers he leaves 3 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.060
 mm and more here it is not more 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.639
 complicated than that so I'm going to you 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.550
 leave there if ever yes you change the 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.590
 hard disk think to predict the setting to 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.409
 ps4 day on a usb key or so 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.500
 we connected to your network 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:19.690
 if it's possible, that's it 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.039
 leave there do not hesitate to see me a 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.599
 little bit the facebook page I want 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.860
 I do not want to go because do 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.120
 I repeat it enough because there is no 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.940
 still enough hands of who come to 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.169
 see so do not hesitate do not hesitate to 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.660
 talk a little bit about machines also to 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.580
 your entourage 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.300
 friends who might be interested 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.010
 I'll see you soon and I'll tell you 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.340
 wish to have a very good 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.880
 day 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.880
 it is
