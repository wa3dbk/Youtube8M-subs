00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.550 
we learned the theory behind everything
that<00:03:47.820> we<00:03:48.060> know<00:03:48.240> how<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.540> hair<00:03:48.870> work<00:03:49.080> we<00:03:49.410> know

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
that we know how the hair work we know

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.050 
that we know how the hair work we know
that<00:03:49.710> there's<00:03:49.920> layers<00:03:50.250> there's<00:03:50.700> different

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
that there's layers there's different

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.760 
that there's layers there's different
parts<00:03:51.270> of<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.930> most<00:03:52.380> people<00:03:52.650> don't

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
parts of it and most people don't

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.830 
parts of it and most people don't
understand<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:53.850> we<00:03:54.300> also<00:03:54.450> learn<00:03:54.810> how

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
understand that and we also learn how

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.260 
understand that and we also learn how
the<00:03:55.230> hair<00:03:55.590> reacts<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.220> chemicals<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.120> things

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
the hair reacts to chemicals and things

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.520 
the hair reacts to chemicals and things
like<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.570> things<00:03:57.990> that<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.350> really

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
like that things that you really

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.710 
like that things that you really

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
wouldn't ever think about I like totally

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.260 
wouldn't ever think about I like totally
