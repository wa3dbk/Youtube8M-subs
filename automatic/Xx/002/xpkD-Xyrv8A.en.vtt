prime line the line could be changed I
suppose<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.220> having<00:00:29.609> 390<00:00:30.029> zones<00:00:30.300> was<00:00:30.480> just

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
suppose but having 390 zones was just

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.799 
suppose but having 390 zones was just
really<00:00:31.199> good<00:00:31.550> magnum<00:00:32.550> ice<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.090> magnet<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.450> the

is<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.510> sick<00:00:39.750> card<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:41.059> core

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
is just a sick card it's the core

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.619 
is just a sick card it's the core
attacker<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> deck<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.140> suppose<00:00:44.420> it<00:00:45.420> draws

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
attacker of the deck I suppose it draws

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
attacker of the deck I suppose it draws
you<00:00:45.780> cards<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.440> has<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.800> things<00:00:47.070> never

you cards it has some things never
claydol<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.899> better<00:00:49.050> okay

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
claydol it's like that but better okay

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.439 
claydol it's like that but better okay
it's<00:00:50.070> not<00:00:50.160> very<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.149> pretty

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
it's not very little but it's pretty

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:00.319 
it's not very little but it's pretty
good<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.989> pretty<00:00:52.170> good<00:00:57.920> 213<00:00:59.090> emboar<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
good it's pretty good 213 emboar at the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.070 
good it's pretty good 213 emboar at the
moment<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.500> play<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.820> promote<00:01:02.820> epic<00:01:03.210> because

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
moment you play to promote epic because

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.899 
moment you play to promote epic because
they're<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.290> best<00:01:04.619> they<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.489> retreat

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
they're the best they have one retreat

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.240 
they're the best they have one retreat
which<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> better<00:01:07.170> than<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> stupid<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
which is better than the stupid one that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.030 
which is better than the stupid one that
has<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.549> tree<00:01:09.409> burning<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.710> your<00:01:10.890> first

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
has to a tree burning as your first

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.980 
has to a tree burning as your first
attack<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.610> colorless<00:01:11.970> energy<00:01:12.060> might<00:01:12.840> as

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
attack for colorless energy might as

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
attack for colorless energy might as
well<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.409> better<00:01:13.619> than<00:01:13.799> swinging<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.820> 10<00:01:14.970> with

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
well be better than swinging for 10 with

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.130 
well be better than swinging for 10 with
fire<00:01:15.830> 60<00:01:16.830> HP<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.280> matches<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> other<00:01:18.240> ones<00:01:18.600> so

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
fire 60 HP is matches the other ones so

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.910 
fire 60 HP is matches the other ones so
that's<00:01:19.320> fine<00:01:20.360> one<00:01:21.360> Pig<00:01:21.659> night<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.770> was

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that's fine one Pig night this was

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.320 
that's fine one Pig night this was
obviously<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.369> best<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.909> gives<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.150> energy

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
obviously the best just gives you energy

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.480 
obviously the best just gives you energy
acceleration<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.320> doesn't<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:26.280> matter

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
acceleration that doesn't really matter

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
acceleration that doesn't really matter
but<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.390> clearly<00:01:27.869> better<00:01:28.080> than

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
but this one is clearly better than

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.630 
but this one is clearly better than
everyone<00:01:28.970> two<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> ability<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:30.900> bore

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
everyone two of the ability and bore

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.060 
everyone two of the ability and bore
that<00:01:32.640> what<00:01:32.850> fuels<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> deck<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.770> can't

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
that what fuels the deck and you can't

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.190 
that what fuels the deck and you can't
really<00:01:35.520> run<00:01:35.790> less<00:01:36.060> than<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.659> guess<00:01:37.079> you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
really run less than that I guess you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.330 
really run less than that I guess you
can<00:01:37.290> attack<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.650> them<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.189> need

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
can attack with them if you really need

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
can attack with them if you really need
to<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.180> ability<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.750> they're<00:01:39.900> you

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
to but the ability is what they're you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.999 
to but the ability is what they're you
swore<00:01:40.610> one<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> attacking<00:01:42.270> door<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.009> just

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
swore one of the attacking door I just

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.740 
swore one of the attacking door I just
because<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.399> gives<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.700> an<00:01:44.820> alternative<00:01:44.939> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
because it gives you an alternative to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.630 
because it gives you an alternative to
our<00:01:46.020> dl<00:01:46.320> or<00:01:46.649> magnezone<00:01:47.930> 154<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.170> and

discarding on fire essentially the same

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.690 
discarding on fire essentially the same

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.480 
as our deal with less risk one brashear
am<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:58.290> certain<00:01:58.590> matchups<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:59.100> case<00:01:59.369> you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
am just for certain matchups in case you

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.690 
am just for certain matchups in case you
need<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> attack<00:02:00.000> super<00:02:00.540> fast<00:02:01.369> now<00:02:02.369> some

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
need to attack super fast now some

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:11.340 
need to attack super fast now some
people<00:02:02.729> run<00:02:03.119> more<00:02:03.409> like<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:07.069> 122<00:02:08.069> RDL<00:02:09.560> it's

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
people run more like just a 122 RDL it's

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.470 
people run more like just a 122 RDL it's
I<00:02:11.520> guess<00:02:12.520> depending<00:02:12.850> on<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> matchup<00:02:13.330> it's

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
I guess depending on the matchup it's

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.270 
I guess depending on the matchup it's
your<00:02:13.780> main<00:02:14.170> attacker<00:02:14.440> if<00:02:14.890> you're<00:02:15.040> not<00:02:15.130> gonna

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
your main attacker if you're not gonna

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280 
your main attacker if you're not gonna
use<00:02:15.340> magnezone<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:16.900> sick<00:02:17.110> sick

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
use magnezone and it's just sick sick
