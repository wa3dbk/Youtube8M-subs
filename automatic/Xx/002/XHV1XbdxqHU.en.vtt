00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
because guitar learning guitar is

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.859 
because guitar learning guitar is
something<00:00:30.519> that<00:00:30.699> I<00:00:30.730> always<00:00:31.000> wanted<00:00:31.599> to<00:00:31.689> do<00:00:31.840> but

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
being turned into a challenge made it

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.439 
being turned into a challenge made it
easy<00:00:35.980> for<00:00:36.100> me<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.400> scoop<00:00:36.879> time<00:00:37.120> out<00:00:37.269> of<00:00:37.360> my

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
because well it starts from the very

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.740 
because well it starts from the very
basics<00:01:00.580> and<00:01:00.760> it<00:01:00.909> gets<00:01:01.269> more<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.659> more

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
basics and it gets more and more

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
and every time you complete a lesson

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.840 
and every time you complete a lesson
that<00:01:05.199> lesson<00:01:05.740> will<00:01:05.830> be<00:01:05.890> included<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.549> next

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850

time you practice song under the song so
it's<00:01:09.100> very<00:01:09.280> progressive<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.210> allows<00:01:11.170> you

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
it's very progressive and it allows you

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:20.040

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.810 

the<00:01:20.320> first<00:01:20.560> time<00:01:20.800> I<00:01:20.830> picked<00:01:21.160> up<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.400> guitar<00:01:21.550> to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
the first time I picked up the guitar to

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.370 
the first time I picked up the guitar to

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
play the challenge I was a little

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
play the challenge I was a little
overwhelmed<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.670> was<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:24.970> bit<00:01:25.210> daunting<00:01:26.400> firing

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
overwhelmed it was a bit daunting firing

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.370 
overwhelmed it was a bit daunting firing
up<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.640> game<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.690> know<00:01:28.780> right<00:01:29.050> from<00:01:29.200> the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
up the game and you know right from the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.520 
up the game and you know right from the
get-go<00:01:29.590> having<00:01:30.160> it<00:01:30.250> be<00:01:30.400> like<00:01:30.640> strings<00:01:30.940> frets<00:01:31.530> I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
get-go having it be like strings frets I

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.860 
get-go having it be like strings frets I
wasn't<00:01:33.220> really<00:01:33.340> sure<00:01:33.640> where<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.390> start<00:01:34.720> or

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
wasn't really sure where to start or

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.570 
wasn't really sure where to start or
what<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.080> do<00:01:35.320> but<00:01:35.620> eventually<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.160> got<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.400> hang

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
what to do but eventually I got the hang

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.110 
what to do but eventually I got the hang
of<00:01:36.670> it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
of it

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:47.660 
of it
and<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.870> got<00:01:38.050> easier<00:01:38.410> as<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:39.220> went<00:01:39.400> along

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.530 

people<00:01:48.670> should<00:01:48.850> take<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.150> Rocksmith

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
people should take the Rocksmith

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.740 
people should take the Rocksmith
challenge<00:01:49.960> because<00:01:50.619> it<00:01:51.250> makes<00:01:51.790> learning

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
challenge because it makes learning

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.140 
challenge because it makes learning
guitar<00:01:53.259> so<00:01:53.560> much<00:01:53.710> easier<00:01:54.220> if<00:01:54.430> that<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:54.880> goal

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
guitar so much easier if that is a goal

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.140 
guitar so much easier if that is a goal
for<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.509> it's<00:01:56.020> like<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.590> makes<00:01:56.740> fun<00:01:57.100> it's<00:01:57.850> a

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.969 
lot easier to motivate yourself to learn
and<00:02:01.300> actually<00:02:01.780> do<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.080> lessons<00:02:02.470> if<00:02:02.740> it's

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
and actually do the lessons if it's

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.560 
and actually do the lessons if it's
turned<00:02:03.220> into<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.460> game<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:03.970> fun<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.270> it's

turned into a game and it's fun and it's
not<00:02:04.810> this<00:02:04.990> chore<00:02:05.440> that<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.710> have<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.009> come

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
not this chore that you have to come

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.949 
not this chore that you have to come
home<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.430> every<00:02:06.729> night<00:02:11.760> my<00:02:12.760> aha<00:02:13.090> moment<00:02:13.120> was

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
home to every night my aha moment was

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.110 
home to every night my aha moment was
when<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.230> realized<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:14.980> could<00:02:15.400> do<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:15.820> I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
when I realized that I could do this I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.090 
when I realized that I could do this I
realized<00:02:16.690> how<00:02:16.930> much<00:02:17.050> support<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.620> had<00:02:17.770> from<00:02:17.800> my

realized how much support I had from my
friends<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.520> family<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.390> really

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
friends and family and that really

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.780 
friends and family and that really
motivated<00:02:20.140> me<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.650> keep<00:02:21.280> playing<00:02:21.550> and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
motivated me to keep playing and

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.610 
motivated me to keep playing and
practicing<00:02:21.970> more<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.810> that's<00:02:23.260> when<00:02:23.470> my

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
practicing more and that's when my

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.650 
practicing more and that's when my
progress<00:02:24.010> really<00:02:24.190> took<00:02:24.400> off<00:02:24.580> advice<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.630> I

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660
