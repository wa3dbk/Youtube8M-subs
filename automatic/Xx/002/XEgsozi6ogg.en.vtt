00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.340 

just<00:00:03.000> thought<00:00:03.179> I'd<00:00:03.330> give<00:00:03.510> you<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.720> quick<00:00:03.870> movie

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
just thought I'd give you a quick movie

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.089 
just thought I'd give you a quick movie
clip<00:00:04.589> about<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.069> Bowflex<00:00:05.730> dumbbells<00:00:06.950> and<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
clip about the Bowflex dumbbells and the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.259 
clip about the Bowflex dumbbells and the
bends<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.550> go<00:00:08.700> with<00:00:08.910> it

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
bends to go with it

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.270 
bends to go with it
I<00:00:10.759> couldn't<00:00:11.759> resist<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> bench<00:00:12.830> to<00:00:13.830> go<00:00:14.009> with

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
I couldn't resist on a bench to go with

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.210 
I couldn't resist on a bench to go with
the<00:00:14.490> dumbbells<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.389> because<00:00:15.540> they<00:00:15.660> match

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
the dumbbells just because they match

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.980 
the dumbbells just because they match
and<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.369> looks<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.640> little<00:00:17.760> bit<00:00:17.970> smarter<00:00:20.750> so<00:00:21.750> for

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and it looks a little bit smarter so for

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.820 
and it looks a little bit smarter so for
the<00:00:22.050> Bowflex<00:00:22.560> bench<00:00:23.869> got<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.930> seat<00:00:25.170> adjustment

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the Bowflex bench got a seat adjustment

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.509 
the Bowflex bench got a seat adjustment
here<00:00:26.130> which<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.789> really<00:00:27.060> easy<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.539> use<00:00:28.519> you

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
here which is really easy to use you

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.900 
here which is really easy to use you
literally<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.590> take<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:34.790> put<00:00:35.790> it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
literally just take it out and put it

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.869 
literally just take it out and put it
into<00:00:36.210> whichever<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.989> want

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
into whichever one you want

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.319 
into whichever one you want
but<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:39.120> mid-range<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.960> they're<00:00:41.329> just

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
but about mid-range one they're just

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.500 
but about mid-range one they're just
good<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.690> an<00:00:42.750> incline<00:00:46.489> I've<00:00:47.489> got<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> flat

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.900 

there<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> way<00:00:54.030> down<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.480> decline

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
there and all the way down to decline

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.639 
there and all the way down to decline
and<00:00:56.910> then<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.210> help<00:00:58.489> your<00:00:59.489> back<00:01:00.469> you<00:01:01.469> can

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and then to help your back you can

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.420 
and then to help your back you can
actually<00:01:01.800> adjust<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.399> seat<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.879> well<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.250> put

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
actually adjust the seat as well and put

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.070 
actually adjust the seat as well and put
it<00:01:05.519> out<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.150> you've<00:01:06.390> effectively<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it out there so you've effectively got a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.700 
it out there so you've effectively got a
sit-up<00:01:07.380> bench<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:07.950> well<00:01:09.049> here<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.409> don't<00:01:10.590> have

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
sit-up bench as well here you don't have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.820 
sit-up bench as well here you don't have
to<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:12.049> you<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> pin<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.650> comes

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to have it on you got a pin that comes

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.469 
to have it on you got a pin that comes
out<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.409> will<00:01:16.590> come<00:01:16.799> off<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
out here and this will come off I

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.520 
out here and this will come off I
usually<00:01:18.479> leave<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.320> doesn't

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
usually leave it on because it doesn't

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.120 
usually leave it on because it doesn't
really<00:01:19.680> impede<00:01:20.220> when<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.150> using<00:01:22.130> dumbbells

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
really impede when I'm using dumbbells

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.249 
really impede when I'm using dumbbells
for<00:01:23.670> chest<00:01:23.970> press<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.450> stuff<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.990> helps

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
for chest press and stuff but it helps

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.929 
for chest press and stuff but it helps
to<00:01:25.439> beat<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:25.890> feet<00:01:26.040> behind<00:01:26.369> when<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
to beat your feet behind when you do the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.850 
to beat your feet behind when you do the
sit<00:01:27.119> ups<00:01:28.610> onto<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> dumbbells<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.820> we're<00:01:33.689> at

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
sit ups onto the dumbbells this we're at

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.340 
sit ups onto the dumbbells this we're at
60<00:01:34.860> pound<00:01:35.130> dumbbells<00:01:35.640> at<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> moment<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
60 pound dumbbells at the moment if I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.980 
60 pound dumbbells at the moment if I
want<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> alter<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.310> course<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.909> pick<00:01:39.840> them

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
want to alter it of course I pick them

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.880 
want to alter it of course I pick them
up<00:01:41.810> put<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.960> into<00:01:43.729> wrap<00:01:45.439> sometimes<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.770> have

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
up put it into wrap sometimes you have

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.770 
up put it into wrap sometimes you have
to<00:01:47.070> wiggle<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.640> weights<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.329> are<00:01:48.420> left<00:01:48.630> in

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
to wiggle the weights that are left in

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.609 
to wiggle the weights that are left in
the<00:01:48.930> holder<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.189> slots<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.850> nicely<00:01:51.619> and
