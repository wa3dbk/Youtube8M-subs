 [Music] 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.559
 on sunday evening there was in the 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.780
 Goods acceptance in the fist 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.030
 reunion with the fat group the 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.950
 young big band from Hanover enthusiastic 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.650
 with the musical hannover in front of you 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.260
 full house co- founder years markus 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:29.380
 wolf reveals the success of the 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:31.150
 band thought me that we have the djs 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.349
 merge Hanover a bit 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.910
 So want the different ones 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.879
 different corners so a few 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.010
 students and a few parents 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.760
 meant now but so to speak 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.190
 old ones are in bremen 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.899
 type pendant attracted so actually 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.059
 everything and everything hanoveraner the here 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:56.079
 Play up to three positions because of it 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:58.300
 because the musicians simply shine with it 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.179
 the classics of the 50s and 60s 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.739
 In addition, they inspire their audience 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.690
 regularly with world premieres this time 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.540
 were composers from hanover at the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.870
 line 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.870
 [Music] 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.560
 to lose the tradition of the big band 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:24.369
 that makes me this first sap for that 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:26.310
 playing one of the composers is the 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.049
 trumpeter christoph von h 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 his piece takes the listener in with 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:39.420
 a world of agents thrillers and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:41.579
 casino classic was the last piece 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.649
 chase minister for own compositions and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.970
 is a reference to the soundtrack of 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.619
 sixties steve mcqueen this whole 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.829
 So you also called full jazz 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.350
 the spy movies of the sixties 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.950
 old stella and there is this music on 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:05.530
 to that 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:05.530
 [Music] 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.020
 van gaal explains someone for a big one 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.630
 band like the fat horn you compose 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.480
 can do a lot with colors paint that 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.250
 You should also do so in one 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.290
 great occupation and of course that is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.900
 It's nice to have this one too 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.370
 can do world here that you 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.080
 use different instruments 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.450
 You can also play saxophonists 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.120
 goal leads or what clarinet and you 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.070
 on the other hand, you can paint with the colors 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.050
 For example , you use a pop context 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.690
 you completely different elements and there must 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.520
 you can work the piece as well 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.130
 but the big ben is first 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.940
 sounding bodies that worked 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.940
 [Music] 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.910
 the music on hannover is surprising 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.210
 varied thanks to the small but fine 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:00.010
 Jazz scene and I think I have to 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:03.040
 I hide great composers and 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.040
 great potential
