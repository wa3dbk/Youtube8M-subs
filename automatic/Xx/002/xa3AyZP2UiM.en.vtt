00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 death 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.730
 d 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.180
 people ignore everything and everyone when 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.890
 subject is plastic surgery to say 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.529
 michael jackson made billions of 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.830
 plates it believes the millions 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.869
 plastic surgeries is then entered 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.240
 even in 36 million surgeries that he 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.880
 did because he did he did but for you 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.800
 say how many say millions 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.970
 I think you need a better basis 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.140
 than the photos of him and that comes out in the media 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.480
 huh 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.850
 people criticize criticize but I 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.250
 I doubt if I had the opportunity to 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.260
 not giving something that is everybody 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 knows that the neighborhood has 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.050
 adolescence 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.600
 with respect to your appearance everyone 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.809
 he knows that this has left him 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.170
 knows in appearance how the brothers 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.990
 Dad and everyone was a walk talking 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.990
 the doctor giving the mark how it ended 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.760
 affecting it was fixed in that the nose 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.590
 great woman received from large minors 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.630
 and it did not matter how many times to look 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.659
 in the mirror there would always be an analysis 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.689
 bigger than it really was anyway he 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.119
 always looked in the mirror and saw something 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.220
 he did not like himself because each 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.619
 one has his concept of beauty pass 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.990
 for others so he always wanted 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.829
 change since he could he had 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.950
 money 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.720
 What an opportunity why not change right? 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.390
 michael never said how many surgeries 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.700
 he did and I believe that neither he nor 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.909
 Know how many times but not why it was 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.740
 many, but perhaps he does not even know 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.439
 he does not admit to never talking 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.969
 how many exactly did most of the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.469
 people think that it does plastic 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.320
 all the time he was always doing 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.420
 and every time I need a mask 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.939
 It is because I had surgery but 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.610
 neither she nor always people not to 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.350
 think he could not do it alone 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.390
 surgery but his appearance 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.060
 running over time it grew here in the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.580
 media then imagine someone they wanted 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.650
 keep his face from 20 years to 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.930
 When I was 40 years old, that's logical. 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.390
 No time has been changing 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.240
 currently it has been aging then 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.170
 many changes 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.520
 the physique he sometimes emaciated and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.190
 Send me something if I do not like it but do not 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.870
 for having done plastic but for the hair 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.320
 The fact that you have lost weight leaves your face 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.460
 thinner or finally and it is logical that an echo 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.190
 was also always making a 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.160
 treatment for not aging shop that 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.750
 he made botox the fill anyway 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.520
 something some treatment and I believe 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.700
 that he was always really doing 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.040
 to keep taste to keep a 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.410
 young appearance 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.660
 I think it's more incredible already, and the 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.280
 people ignore everyone who did 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.800
 the person may have changed the 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.570
 face can change finished body can 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.520
 have become another person but 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.020
 if you're talking about plastic surgery no 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.560
 Let's talk about michael jackson because 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.960
 will you be able to speak and let it reads and 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.350
 did many times appear 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.720
 surgeries that went wrong people do not know 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.500
 what that limit what will emerge was 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.020
 bad that spoiled the face at last being 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.080
 376 say that he always puts maicon in the 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.000
 these people but how common is it that 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.940
 arise to please anyone but him 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.410
 even and I think it's more beautiful I know 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.810
 there are many people that I also found 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.230
 very beautiful independent of surgery or 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.090
 that's not it he did not do that for 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.330
 please no one and no one wants to play 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.620
 It's not handsome that he did that. 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.950
 people have to admire the talent 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.510
 his music and nothing else 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.970
 the appearance of it is is to appear well what 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.520
 I do not understand is the media insists so much. 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.440
 speaking of Michael's appearance between 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.400
 many different subjects that can be 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.320
 talk about him 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.760
 the media always talking about the appearance 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.490
 Because of that many people 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.590
 deceived by the media and not all 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.150
 the magician's talent to give more 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.150
 importance to appearance and how many 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.650
 he did and how much he did and why 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.420
 What did he do anyway? 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.800
 so before you leave talking about 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.590
 michael's appearance 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.790
 look at yourself you're not perfect 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.609
 no one is 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.040
 there is no beauty pattern each 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.669
 has its beauty each has a concept 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.490
 of beauty for you and the other is not 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.460
 that's right 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.460
 subscribe to the channel I liked 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.520
 I share rocket river 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:42.490
 comment below a kiss for everyone 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.490
 in defense aviol she hears 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.439
 before talking about the surgeries of the 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.449
 March 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:05:02.749
 before talking about the appearance of it looks 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:09.639
 this is look and why is not 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:09.639
 and people are going to pay wake up work 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:16.789
 there is no standard there is no Adam 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.369
 to the field 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.999
 it did not matter if he looked at it 

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:25.789
 no matter happens we lost 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.770
 notion of threw nose crooked he did 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.059
 surgery until he was no longer able to 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.059
 Igor was flagged back and bit the 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.059
 equality
