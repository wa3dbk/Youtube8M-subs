00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
today all right here is a problem we

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.280 
today all right here is a problem we
have<00:00:35.130> some<00:00:35.700> number<00:00:36.570> we're<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.140> say

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
have some number we're going to say

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.420 
have some number we're going to say
blank<00:00:37.739> some<00:00:38.190> number<00:00:38.570> divided<00:00:39.570> by<00:00:39.600> two<00:00:40.430> equals

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
blank some number divided by two equals

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.170 
blank some number divided by two equals
five<00:00:41.640> now<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> world<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.870> algebra<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
five now in the world of algebra and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.270 
five now in the world of algebra and
when<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.270> get<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> little<00:00:45.690> bit<00:00:45.750> older<00:00:46.280> this

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
when you get a little bit older this

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.979 
when you get a little bit older this
might<00:00:47.520> say<00:00:47.730> X<00:00:48.320> X<00:00:49.320> divided<00:00:49.920> by<00:00:49.950> two<00:00:50.070> equals<00:00:50.610> five

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
might say X X divided by two equals five

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.209 
might say X X divided by two equals five
don't<00:00:51.989> let<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.289> throw<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> that's<00:00:53.039> really

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
don't let that throw you that's really

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.560 
don't let that throw you that's really
the<00:00:53.460> same<00:00:53.699> thing<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.420> blank<00:00:55.879> or<00:00:56.879> some<00:00:57.360> number

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the same thing as blank or some number

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.869 
the same thing as blank or some number
divided<00:00:58.050> by<00:00:58.109> two<00:00:58.170> equals<00:00:58.710> five<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.370> there's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
divided by two equals five and there's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.049 
divided by two equals five and there's
two<00:01:00.270> strategies<00:01:00.949> that<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.250> recommend<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> my

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
two strategies that I recommend to my

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.450 
two strategies that I recommend to my
students<00:01:03.650> one<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.680> them<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.010> called<00:01:05.159> guessed

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
students one of them is called guessed

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
students one of them is called guessed
check<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.820> revise<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:06.869> you've

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
check and revise and I know if you've

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.780 
check and revise and I know if you've
watched<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> previous<00:01:07.439> videos<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.220> addition

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
watched the previous videos on addition

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.380 
watched the previous videos on addition
or<00:01:09.060> multiplication<00:01:10.130> or<00:01:11.130> subtraction<00:01:11.820> then

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
or multiplication or subtraction then

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.960 
or multiplication or subtraction then
this<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> familiar<00:01:13.979> strategy<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.880> you

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this will be a familiar strategy for you

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.420 
this will be a familiar strategy for you
what<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.110> pick<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> number<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
what you do is just pick a number you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
what you do is just pick a number you
guess<00:01:17.670> let's<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.330> pick<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> number<00:01:18.689> how<00:01:19.200> about

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
guess let's just pick a number how about

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.830 
guess let's just pick a number how about
7<00:01:20.479> 7<00:01:21.479> 7<00:01:22.170> divided<00:01:22.590> by<00:01:22.619> 2<00:01:22.710> does<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.220> equal<00:01:23.430> 5

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
7 7 7 divided by 2 does that equal 5

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.649 
7 7 7 divided by 2 does that equal 5
well<00:01:24.840> no<00:01:25.140> 7<00:01:26.100> divided<00:01:26.400> by<00:01:26.430> 2<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:27.090> actually<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
well no 7 divided by 2 is actually a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.730 
well no 7 divided by 2 is actually a
decimal<00:01:28.290> number<00:01:28.369> it's<00:01:29.369> 3.5<00:01:30.320> now<00:01:31.320> if<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.590> don't

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
decimal number it's 3.5 now if you don't

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.819 
decimal number it's 3.5 now if you don't
know<00:01:31.829> what<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.979> decimal<00:01:32.310> number<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.670> that's<00:01:32.970> ok

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
know what a decimal number is that's ok

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.289 
know what a decimal number is that's ok
we<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:35.009> try<00:01:35.220> another<00:01:35.369> number<00:01:35.729> let's<00:01:36.090> pick

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
we can try another number let's pick

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.530 
we can try another number let's pick
another<00:01:36.329> number<00:01:36.840> how<00:01:36.990> about<00:01:37.229> 8<00:01:38.210> don't<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.360> put

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
another number how about 8 don't we put

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.160 
another number how about 8 don't we put
8<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.990> here<00:01:40.229> 8<00:01:41.009> divided<00:01:41.640> by<00:01:41.670> 2<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.509> number<00:01:42.810> 4

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
8 in here 8 divided by 2 is the number 4

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.560 
8 in here 8 divided by 2 is the number 4
so<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.700> higher<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.270> lower<00:01:45.450> than

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
so do we have to be higher or lower than

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.999 
so do we have to be higher or lower than
8<00:01:46.310> yes<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:47.939> higher<00:01:48.210> than<00:01:48.540> 8

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
8 yes we have to be higher than 8

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.819 
8 yes we have to be higher than 8
because<00:01:50.009> 8<00:01:50.250> divided<00:01:50.640> by<00:01:50.670> 2<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.030> 4<00:01:51.590> we<00:01:52.590> need<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
because 8 divided by 2 is 4 we need to

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.600 
because 8 divided by 2 is 4 we need to
be<00:01:52.950> higher<00:01:53.280> than<00:01:53.310> 4<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.659> let's<00:01:54.689> try<00:01:55.460> let's<00:01:56.460> try

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
be higher than 4 so let's try let's try

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.859 
be higher than 4 so let's try let's try
9<00:01:57.770> does<00:01:58.770> 9<00:01:59.070> work<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.880> put<00:02:00.090> 9<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.509> our<00:02:00.600> blank

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
9 does 9 work if we put 9 in our blank

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.030 
9 does 9 work if we put 9 in our blank
is<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.229> worth<00:02:01.439> 9<00:02:02.250> /<00:02:02.729> -<00:02:02.790> no<00:02:03.659> that's<00:02:04.200> 4<00:02:04.560> point<00:02:04.860> 5

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
is that worth 9 / - no that's 4 point 5

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.819 
is that worth 9 / - no that's 4 point 5
another<00:02:05.340> decimal<00:02:05.939> number<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.469> need<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> go

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
another decimal number so we need to go

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.500 
another decimal number so we need to go
higher<00:02:08.069> than<00:02:08.280> 9<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.420> let's<00:02:09.750> try<00:02:10.110> 10<00:02:10.760> what's<00:02:11.760> 10

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
higher than 9 and let's try 10 what's 10

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.589 
higher than 9 and let's try 10 what's 10
divided<00:02:13.290> into<00:02:13.530> two<00:02:13.739> groups<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:15.060> answer<00:02:15.390> is

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
divided into two groups the answer is

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.110 
divided into two groups the answer is
five<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.230> checks<00:02:16.530> out<00:02:17.090> ten<00:02:18.090> divided<00:02:18.840> by<00:02:19.110> two

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
five it checks out ten divided by two

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.410 
five it checks out ten divided by two
separated<00:02:21.120> into<00:02:21.269> two<00:02:21.659> groups<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.200> five

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
separated into two groups is five

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.640 
separated into two groups is five
because<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.659> have<00:02:24.780> two<00:02:25.049> groups<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.409> five

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
because you can have two groups of five

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.600 
because you can have two groups of five
five<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.579> five<00:02:27.049> then<00:02:28.049> which<00:02:28.170> will<00:02:28.319> equal<00:02:28.610> 10

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
five and five then which will equal 10

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.059 
five and five then which will equal 10
all<00:02:30.540> right<00:02:30.840> now<00:02:31.019> that's<00:02:31.260> guessed<00:02:31.620> check<00:02:31.890> and

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
all right now that's guessed check and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.339 
all right now that's guessed check and
revisers<00:02:32.610> one<00:02:33.209> other<00:02:33.390> strategy<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
revisers one other strategy I like to

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.640 
revisers one other strategy I like to
use<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.970> strategy<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.720> called<00:02:36.989> opposite

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
use this strategy is called opposite

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.830 
use this strategy is called opposite
operations<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.790> works<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.269> most<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.750> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
operations and it works for most of the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.619 
operations and it works for most of the
operations<00:02:40.409> so<00:02:41.280> let's<00:02:41.549> just<00:02:41.819> say<00:02:42.090> I'm<00:02:42.359> pick<00:02:42.599> a

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
operations so let's just say I'm pick a

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.750 
operations so let's just say I'm pick a
different<00:02:42.930> color<00:02:43.109> here<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:44.010> know<00:02:44.220> that

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
different color here we know that

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.930 
different color here we know that
division<00:02:45.450> has<00:02:45.750> an<00:02:46.019> opposite<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.250> opposite<00:02:47.819> of

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
division has an opposite the opposite of

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.069 
division has an opposite the opposite of
division<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.810> multiplication<00:02:49.470> that's<00:02:50.430> right

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
division is multiplication that's right

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.569 
division is multiplication that's right
division<00:02:52.079> and<00:02:52.230> multiplication<00:02:52.319> so<00:02:53.280> what<00:02:53.459> we

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
division and multiplication so what we

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.509 
division and multiplication so what we
do<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:54.030> we<00:02:54.150> take<00:02:54.389> our<00:02:54.599> number<00:02:54.840> five<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.739> we

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
do is we take our number five and we

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.809 
do is we take our number five and we
just<00:02:56.760> multiply<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.510> times<00:02:57.900> two<00:02:58.459> five<00:02:59.459> times

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
just multiply it times two five times

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.809 
just multiply it times two five times
two<00:03:00.209> will<00:03:00.450> give<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.780> an<00:03:00.989> answer<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.709> ten<00:03:02.400> and

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
two will give you an answer of ten and

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.879 
two will give you an answer of ten and
just<00:03:03.450> like<00:03:03.599> we<00:03:03.750> found<00:03:03.930> with<00:03:04.230> gas<00:03:04.470> check<00:03:04.709> and

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
just like we found with gas check and

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.940 
just like we found with gas check and
revise<00:03:05.129> ten<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.269> your<00:03:06.569> answer<00:03:06.930> because<00:03:07.650> ten

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
revise ten is your answer because ten

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.610 
revise ten is your answer because ten
divided<00:03:08.280> into<00:03:08.849> two<00:03:09.090> groups<00:03:09.329> it's<00:03:10.319> really<00:03:10.500> what

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
divided into two groups it's really what

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.259 
divided into two groups it's really what
division<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:11.069> right<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.579> putting<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.150> into

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
division is right it's putting it into

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.899 
division is right it's putting it into
two<00:03:12.720> equal<00:03:12.750> groups<00:03:13.129> equals<00:03:14.129> their<00:03:14.310> answer<00:03:14.700> of

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
two equal groups equals their answer of

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.500 
two equal groups equals their answer of
five<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.010> hope<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.699> was<00:03:17.819> helpful<00:03:17.849> for<00:03:18.239> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
five so I hope that was helpful for you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.930 
five so I hope that was helpful for you
