Philadelphia my work as an artist who

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.640 
Philadelphia my work as an artist who
works<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.410> glass<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:21.539> foundation<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.439> is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
works with glass the foundation of it is

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.429 
works with glass the foundation of it is
really<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.689> vessel<00:00:24.689> making<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.289> in

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
really in vessel making and in

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.279 
really in vessel making and in
traditional<00:00:26.430> craft<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.090> learned<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> blow

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
traditional craft I learned to blow

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.519 
traditional craft I learned to blow
glass<00:00:28.609> about<00:00:29.609> 22<00:00:30.090> years<00:00:30.330> ago<00:00:30.390> about<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> year

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
glass about 22 years ago about a year

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.770 
glass about 22 years ago about a year
into<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:31.980> started<00:00:32.550> had<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> opportunity

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
into what I started had the opportunity

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.520 
into what I started had the opportunity
to<00:00:33.840> work<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.050> lino

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
to work with lino

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.260 
to work with lino
so<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.730> foundation<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:38.309> actual<00:00:38.730> process

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
so the foundation of the actual process

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.790 
so the foundation of the actual process
there<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.540> rooted<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.140> definition

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
there is rooted in that definition

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
there is rooted in that definition
technique<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:44.270> this<00:00:45.270> link<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
technique so I have this this link to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.880 
technique so I have this this link to
craft<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.340> tradition<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.480> don't<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
craft and tradition that I don't want to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.770 
craft and tradition that I don't want to
break<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.820> fight<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.420> know<00:00:51.629> it's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
break I don't fight it you know it's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.049

well as the vessel maked I'm always
going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> big<00:00:56.789> part<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.120> who<00:00:57.210> I

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
going to do it it's a big part of who I

the<00:01:02.160> inspiration<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.820> The<00:01:03.090> Crucible<00:01:03.270> series

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the inspiration for The Crucible series

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.150 
the inspiration for The Crucible series
comes<00:01:04.080> from<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> number<00:01:04.590> of<00:01:04.620> different<00:01:04.739> places

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
comes from a number of different places

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.770 
comes from a number of different places
but<00:01:05.570> I<00:01:07.550> spent<00:01:08.550> a<00:01:08.670> lot<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.910> time<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.570> past

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
but I spent a lot of time in this past

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.870 
but I spent a lot of time in this past
year<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.440> city<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.800> Chicago<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.520> went<00:01:11.760> over

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
year in the city of Chicago I went over

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.300 
year in the city of Chicago I went over
to<00:01:11.940> Millennium<00:01:12.420> Park<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.440> saw<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.710> beam<00:01:14.010> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to Millennium Park and I saw the beam I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.680 
to Millennium Park and I saw the beam I
think<00:01:14.550> most<00:01:14.700> people<00:01:15.000> are<00:01:15.060> familiar<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
think most people are familiar with the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.800 
think most people are familiar with the
beam<00:01:16.190> and<00:01:17.190> I<00:01:17.430> had<00:01:17.550> seen<00:01:17.730> pictures<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
beam and I had seen pictures of it but I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.480 
beam and I had seen pictures of it but I
had<00:01:19.080> never<00:01:19.260> seen<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.740> person<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.340> was

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
had never seen it in person it was

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.250 
had never seen it in person it was
really<00:01:20.880> kind<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> an<00:01:21.930> extraordinary

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
really kind of an extraordinary

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.320 
really kind of an extraordinary
experience<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.030> object

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
experience because it was this object

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.350 
experience because it was this object
that<00:01:24.690> was<00:01:24.900> doing<00:01:25.820> two<00:01:26.820> things

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that was doing two things

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.870 
that was doing two things
it<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:28.020> drawing<00:01:28.530> people<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.130> while

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it was drawing people in while

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.880 
it was drawing people in while
simultaneously<00:01:30.530> reflecting<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.120> that

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
simultaneously reflecting out and that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.270 
simultaneously reflecting out and that
was<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.400> tipping<00:01:36.060> point<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.390> me<00:01:36.690> in<00:01:37.280> thinking

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
was a tipping point for me in thinking

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.609 
was a tipping point for me in thinking
about<00:01:38.400> these<00:01:38.850> sculptures<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:39.660> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
about these sculptures because the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.140 
about these sculptures because the
interiors<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> these<00:01:41.670> decors<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:44.490> something

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
interiors of these decors is something

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.719 
interiors of these decors is something
that<00:01:45.330> is<00:01:45.479> either<00:01:45.660> mirrored<00:01:46.229> or<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:47.070> very<00:01:47.490> highly

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that is either mirrored or a very highly

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.540 
that is either mirrored or a very highly
polished<00:01:48.119> brass<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:49.110> reflects<00:01:49.590> outward<00:01:50.100> so

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
polished brass that reflects outward so

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.160 
polished brass that reflects outward so
it's<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> interior<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.660> vessel<00:01:51.990> being

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
it's the interior of the vessel being

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.280 
it's the interior of the vessel being
reflected<00:01:52.710> outward<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.280> also<00:01:53.550> reflecting

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
reflected outward and also reflecting

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.960 
reflected outward and also reflecting
whatever<00:01:55.290> imagery<00:01:55.800> or<00:01:56.070> engraving<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.880> the

you know zero is about things being

you know zero is about things being

I<00:02:04.530> did<00:02:05.190> when<00:02:05.580> I<00:02:05.610> turned<00:02:05.880> 40<00:02:06.210> years<00:02:06.390> old<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.870> was

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I did when I turned 40 years old I was

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.900 
I did when I turned 40 years old I was
thinking<00:02:07.290> about<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.590> know<00:02:07.650> time<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.220> moving

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
thinking about you know time just moving

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.270 
thinking about you know time just moving
by<00:02:09.090> words<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.840> one's<00:02:10.470> pretty<00:02:10.709> big<00:02:10.769> I<00:02:11.130> want

by words that one's pretty big I want
like<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:13.470> series<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.010> I'm<00:02:14.100> working

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
like that in the series that I'm working

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.270 
like that in the series that I'm working
on<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.730> week<00:02:14.970> at<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.239> Museum<00:02:15.799> the<00:02:16.799> crucible

on this week at the Museum the crucible
series<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:19.140> feel<00:02:19.590> these<00:02:19.739> things<00:02:19.950> are

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
series I I feel these things are

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.970 
series I I feel these things are
decidedly<00:02:20.670> contemporary<00:02:21.739> sculptures<00:02:22.739> or

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
while I'm pretty specific about how the

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.360 
while I'm pretty specific about how the
shapes<00:02:38.120> should<00:02:38.750> look<00:02:39.050> I'm<00:02:39.500> not<00:02:39.739> really<00:02:40.010> tied

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
shapes should look I'm not really tied

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.059 
shapes should look I'm not really tied
to<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.670> being<00:02:41.000> exactly<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:42.470> know<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:42.800> size

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
to the being exactly you know this size

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.100 
to the being exactly you know this size
or<00:02:43.400> this<00:02:43.550> curve<00:02:43.819> or<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.239> proportion<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:44.930> just

or this curve or this proportion it just

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.619 
or this curve or this proportion it just
gives<00:02:45.319> us<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.800> starting<00:02:46.310> point<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.910> what<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.360> want

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
gives us a starting point of what I want

gives us a starting point of what I want
to<00:02:47.720> look<00:02:47.810> for<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.650> know<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.950> think<00:02:49.010> as<00:02:49.250> most

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
to look for you know and I think as most

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.729 
to look for you know and I think as most
people<00:02:49.879> who<00:02:49.970> are<00:02:50.120> like<00:02:50.450> rooted<00:02:50.840> in<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:51.590> a

people who are like rooted in a in a

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.229 
people who are like rooted in a in a
craft<00:02:52.040> background<00:02:52.580> might<00:02:52.760> be<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:53.120> these

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
craft background might be that these

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.630 
craft background might be that these
curves<00:02:53.599> need<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.500> be<00:02:54.650> constant<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.340> know<00:02:55.459> no

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
curves need to be constant you know no

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.000 
curves need to be constant you know no
flat<00:02:55.970> spots<00:02:56.330> on<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.660> curves<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:57.680> know<00:02:57.769> this

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
flat spots on the curves you know this

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.520 
flat spots on the curves you know this
can't<00:02:58.220> be<00:02:58.430> like<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.810> then<00:02:59.930> conversely

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
can't be like that and then conversely

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.440 
can't be like that and then conversely
on<00:03:00.650> this<00:03:00.830> one<00:03:01.069> is<00:03:01.549> one<00:03:01.790> that's<00:03:01.910> more<00:03:02.120> like<00:03:02.330> an

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
on this one is one that's more like an

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.140 
on this one is one that's more like an
hourglass<00:03:02.959> or<00:03:03.230> or<00:03:03.769> a<00:03:03.830> cooling<00:03:04.340> tower<00:03:04.549> the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
hourglass or or a cooling tower the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.270 
hourglass or or a cooling tower the
shape<00:03:05.390> has<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.629> always<00:03:05.930> be<00:03:06.080> moving<00:03:06.590> in<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.130> so

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
shape has to always be moving in it so

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.699 
shape has to always be moving in it so
I'm<00:03:07.340> constantly<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:08.660> know<00:03:08.690> doing<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.410> doing

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
I'm constantly you know doing that doing

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.680 
I'm constantly you know doing that doing
that<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.250> then<00:03:10.400> when<00:03:11.090> we're<00:03:11.239> on<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.390> putty

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
that and then when we're on the putty

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.559 
that and then when we're on the putty
and<00:03:11.870> finishing<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:12.440> shape<00:03:13.480> Josie<00:03:14.480> will

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
and finishing the shape Josie will

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.110 
and finishing the shape Josie will
actually<00:03:14.959> assist<00:03:15.319> me<00:03:15.530> in<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:16.670> know<00:03:16.730> looking

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
actually assist me in you know looking

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.759 
actually assist me in you know looking
at<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:17.900> know<00:03:17.989> just<00:03:18.019> pointing<00:03:18.500> out<00:03:18.590> an

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
at it and you know just pointing out an

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.059 
at it and you know just pointing out an
area<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.250> looks<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.730> little<00:03:19.970> flat

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069
