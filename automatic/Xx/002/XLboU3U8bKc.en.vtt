hi<00:00:03.420> guys<00:00:03.630> it's<00:00:03.900> Alex<00:00:04.319> from<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.500> top<00:00:04.649> tennis

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
hi guys it's Alex from the top tennis

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.380 
hi guys it's Alex from the top tennis
training<00:00:05.160> today<00:00:05.850> we're<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.180> talk<00:00:06.359> about

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
training today we're going to talk about

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.660 
training today we're going to talk about
Street<00:00:06.930> tensions<00:00:07.380> the<00:00:07.979> first<00:00:08.250> two<00:00:08.490> main

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
Street tensions the first two main

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.419 
Street tensions the first two main
concepts<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.300> understand<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.799> tighter

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
concepts to understand is that a tighter

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.659 
concepts to understand is that a tighter
string<00:00:11.879> and<00:00:12.030> tie<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.209> restring<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.650> it's<00:00:14.519> not

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:14.669 
string and tie to restring is it's not

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.220 
string and tie to restring is it's not
giving<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.030> as<00:00:15.150> much<00:00:15.299> power<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.870> gives<00:00:16.049> you

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
giving it as much power it gives you

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.440 
giving it as much power it gives you
more<00:00:16.350> control<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.520> looser<00:00:17.910> restream<00:00:18.330> will

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
more control and a looser restream will

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.570 
more control and a looser restream will
give<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.720> more<00:00:18.900> power<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:20.130> there's<00:00:20.400> two

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
give you more power so there's two

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.980 
give you more power so there's two
different<00:00:20.760> ways<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.300> where<00:00:21.480> I'm<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> use

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
different ways of where I'm going to use

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.320 
different ways of where I'm going to use
these<00:00:22.230> strings<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:22.830> I'm<00:00:23.519> looking<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.119> when

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
these strings so I'm looking for when

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.999 
these strings so I'm looking for when
I'm<00:00:24.449> looking<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.869> control<00:00:25.289> turn<00:00:25.679> up<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
I'm looking for control turn up to a

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.380 
I'm looking for control turn up to a
tournament<00:00:26.429> if<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.699> feeling<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> ball

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
tournament if I'm feeling that the ball

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.450 
tournament if I'm feeling that the ball
is<00:00:27.630> flying<00:00:28.289> through<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.679> air<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:28.980> perhaps<00:00:29.130> I'm

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
is flying through the air or perhaps I'm

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.330 
is flying through the air or perhaps I'm
playing<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.820> little<00:00:30.000> bit<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.210> altitude<00:00:31.009> or<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
playing a little bit of altitude or the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.800 
playing a little bit of altitude or the
balls<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:32.730> particularly<00:00:33.150> hard<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.660> they're

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
balls are particularly hard so they're

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.900 
balls are particularly hard so they're
flying<00:00:34.110> off<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.320> strings<00:00:34.830> a<00:00:34.950> lot<00:00:35.100> I'll<00:00:35.520> use<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
flying off my strings a lot I'll use a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
flying off my strings a lot I'll use a
slightly<00:00:36.390> tighter<00:00:36.750> tension<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.590> I'm<00:00:37.800> trying

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
slightly tighter tension so I'm trying

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.680 
slightly tighter tension so I'm trying
to<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.340> ball<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:39.000> feeling<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.540> I'm

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
to get the ball in I'm feeling like I'm

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.840 
to get the ball in I'm feeling like I'm
over<00:00:39.990> hitting<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.380> base<00:00:40.860> under<00:00:41.190> mil<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.550> I'll

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
over hitting the base under mil but I'll

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.210 
over hitting the base under mil but I'll
go<00:00:42.090> for<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> slightly<00:00:42.600> title<00:00:43.110> racket<00:00:43.860> tension

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
go for the slightly title racket tension

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.670 
go for the slightly title racket tension
but<00:00:45.030> I'm<00:00:45.150> looking<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.630> bit<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:45.870> power<00:00:46.110> so

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
but I'm looking for a bit more power so

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.530 
but I'm looking for a bit more power so
for<00:00:46.830> example<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.250> I'm<00:00:47.340> playing<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.640> clay<00:00:47.940> I'm

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
for example if I'm playing on clay I'm

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.390 
for example if I'm playing on clay I'm
using<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.870> lot<00:00:49.020> more<00:00:49.050> topspin<00:00:49.650> where<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> balls

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
using a lot more topspin where the balls

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.560 
using a lot more topspin where the balls
are<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.670> start<00:00:50.910> landing<00:00:51.060> a<00:00:51.270> little<00:00:51.450> bit

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
are going to start landing a little bit

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.270 
are going to start landing a little bit
shorter<00:00:51.990> because<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:52.950> to<00:00:53.040> get<00:00:53.160> as

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
shorter because I'm not going to get as

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.490 
shorter because I'm not going to get as
much<00:00:53.400> power<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.120> through<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.630> ball<00:00:54.810> I'm<00:00:55.290> using

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
much power is through the ball I'm using

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.370 
much power is through the ball I'm using
more<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.980> rotation<00:00:56.610> then<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.870> does<00:00:58.050> when<00:00:58.260> I'll

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
more the rotation then it does when I'll

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.830 
more the rotation then it does when I'll
be<00:00:58.560> using<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.220> slightly<00:00:59.520> looser<00:00:59.940> tension<00:01:00.540> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
be using a slightly looser tension and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.960 
be using a slightly looser tension and
that's<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.740> with<00:01:01.950> most<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:02.430> pros<00:01:02.670> when

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
that's so with most of the pros when

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.640 
that's so with most of the pros when
they<00:01:03.060> turn<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.540> a<00:01:03.600> torment<00:01:03.990> well<00:01:04.140> they'll

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
they turn up to a torment well they'll

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.140 
they turn up to a torment well they'll
player<00:01:04.890> they'll<00:01:05.369> play<00:01:05.580> their<00:01:05.729> practice

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
player they'll play their practice

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.849 
player they'll play their practice
points<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.200> they'll<00:01:07.289> have<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> look<00:01:07.710> how

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:07.859 
points and they'll have a look how

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:08.959 
points and they'll have a look how
they're<00:01:08.009> hitting<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> ball<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.850> they'll

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
they're hitting the ball and and they'll

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.849 
they're hitting the ball and and they'll
adjust<00:01:09.090> those<00:01:09.479> trees<00:01:09.780> accordingly<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.740> I'll

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
adjust those trees accordingly now I'll

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.340 
adjust those trees accordingly now I'll
always<00:01:11.039> have<00:01:11.429> a<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:12.240> racquet<00:01:12.630> that's<00:01:12.780> strong

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
always have a one racquet that's strong

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.630 
always have a one racquet that's strong
a<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.770> different<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> others

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
a little bit different to the others

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.399 
a little bit different to the others
when<00:01:14.789> I'm<00:01:14.909> playing<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.179> match<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:16.170> case

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
when I'm playing a match just in case

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.380 
when I'm playing a match just in case
I'm<00:01:16.619> feeling<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.039> little<00:01:17.189> bit<00:01:17.460> I'm<00:01:17.670> sure<00:01:17.729> when

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
I'm feeling a little bit I'm sure when

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.789 
I'm feeling a little bit I'm sure when
I'm<00:01:18.509> playing<00:01:18.719> I<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.469> a<00:01:19.499> little<00:01:19.679> bit

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
I'm playing I want to get a little bit

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.870 
I'm playing I want to get a little bit
more<00:01:19.950> power<00:01:20.219> because<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.609> not<00:01:20.729> getting

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
more power because I'm not getting

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
more power because I'm not getting
through<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.420> opponent<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.320> I'll<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.829> a<00:01:22.859> loose

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
through my opponent so I'll have a loose

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.520 
through my opponent so I'll have a loose
string<00:01:23.579> in<00:01:24.119> my<00:01:24.329> bag<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.539> in<00:01:24.929> case<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.289> want<00:01:25.469> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
string in my bag just in case I want to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
string in my bag just in case I want to
do<00:01:25.649> that<00:01:25.829> and<00:01:26.579> but<00:01:26.969> obviously<00:01:27.299> different

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
do that and but obviously different

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.940 
do that and but obviously different
players<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.929> different<00:01:28.409> preferences

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
players have different preferences

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.980 
players have different preferences
another<00:01:29.939> thing<00:01:30.210> obviously<00:01:30.359> if<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:30.780> playing

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
another thing obviously if I'm playing

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.809 
another thing obviously if I'm playing
against<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> wind<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.950> might<00:01:32.399> want<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.609> use<00:01:32.789> a

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
against the wind I might want to use a

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.179 
against the wind I might want to use a
little<00:01:33.149> bit<00:01:33.270> more<00:01:33.499> looser<00:01:34.499> racket<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.039> a<00:01:35.069> lot

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
little bit more looser racket so a lot

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.649 
little bit more looser racket so a lot
of<00:01:35.219> players<00:01:35.490> will<00:01:35.640> adjust<00:01:35.969> depending<00:01:36.240> on

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
of players will adjust depending on

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.959 
of players will adjust depending on
which<00:01:37.229> side<00:01:37.499> of<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> racket<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.729> court

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
which side of the racket of the court

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.239 
which side of the racket of the court
they're<00:01:39.119> standing<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.659> oh<00:01:40.560> yeah<00:01:41.069> definitely

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
they're standing on oh yeah definitely

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.760 
they're standing on oh yeah definitely
that<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.390> loosest<00:01:42.780> string<00:01:43.079> gives<00:01:43.319> you<00:01:43.439> gives

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
that the loosest string gives you gives

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.679 
that the loosest string gives you gives
you<00:01:43.920> more<00:01:44.100> power<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.090> tighter<00:01:45.359> our

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
you more power and the tighter our

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.929 
you more power and the tighter our
contention<00:01:46.289> gives<00:01:46.889> you<00:01:46.979> more

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
contention gives you more

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.880 
contention gives you more
now<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:48.990> different<00:01:49.439> rackets<00:01:49.829> have

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
now as you know different rackets have

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.370 
now as you know different rackets have
different<00:01:50.729> power<00:01:50.939> capabilities<00:01:51.719> so<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
different power capabilities so a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.020 
different power capabilities so a
slightly<00:01:52.890> more<00:01:53.100> powerful<00:01:53.399> racket<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
slightly more powerful racket that the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.529 
slightly more powerful racket that the
one<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> use<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.140> babble<00:01:55.409> appeal<00:01:55.679> drive<00:01:56.539> this

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
one I use the babble appeal drive this

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.480 
one I use the babble appeal drive this
record<00:01:58.049> give<00:01:58.229> me<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> lot<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> lot<00:01:58.920> more<00:01:58.979> power<00:01:59.340> on

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
record give me a lot a lot more power on

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.190 
record give me a lot a lot more power on
the<00:01:59.670> board<00:01:59.819> so<00:02:00.060> I'm<00:02:00.119> actually<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.959> to<00:02:01.049> use<00:02:01.109> a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the board so I'm actually going to use a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.899 
the board so I'm actually going to use a
little<00:02:01.530> bit<00:02:01.590> tighter<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.069> possibly<00:02:02.609> tighter

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
little bit tighter but possibly tighter

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.690 
little bit tighter but possibly tighter
restrict<00:02:03.479> than<00:02:04.170> perhaps<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> head<00:02:05.250> prestige

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
restrict than perhaps on a head prestige

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
restrict than perhaps on a head prestige
which<00:02:05.909> has<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> slightly<00:02:07.049> tighter<00:02:07.500> streaming

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
which has a slightly tighter streaming

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.249 
which has a slightly tighter streaming
pattern<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.549> there's<00:02:08.729> more<00:02:08.910> strings<00:02:09.360> there

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
pattern so there's more strings there

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
pattern so there's more strings there
for<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> rack<00:02:10.679> you'll<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.099> feeling<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.730> little

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
for the rack you'll be feeling a little

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.449 
for the rack you'll be feeling a little
bit<00:02:12.090> stiffer<00:02:12.750> when<00:02:13.049> I<00:02:13.080> hit<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.680> won't<00:02:13.860> it

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
bit stiffer when I hit so it won't it

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.740 
bit stiffer when I hit so it won't it
won't<00:02:14.580> generate<00:02:14.970> quite<00:02:15.209> as<00:02:15.330> much<00:02:15.480> power<00:02:15.720> so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
won't generate quite as much power so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.869 
won't generate quite as much power so
maybe<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.290> those<00:02:16.769> rackets<00:02:17.250> all<00:02:17.400> right<00:02:17.640> use<00:02:17.849> a

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
maybe on those rackets all right use a

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.350 
maybe on those rackets all right use a
little<00:02:18.180> bit<00:02:18.269> more<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.840> elusively<00:02:19.379> string<00:02:20.360> now

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
little bit more of elusively string now

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.059 
little bit more of elusively string now
depending<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:21.900> what<00:02:22.019> string<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.620> use<00:02:22.829> will

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
depending on what string you use will

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.250 
depending on what string you use will
also<00:02:23.430> depend<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:24.120> tension<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.049> put

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
also depend the tension that you put

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.380 
also depend the tension that you put
into<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.590> racket<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.430> stiffer<00:02:26.910> strings

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
into the racket now a stiffer strings

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.569 
into the racket now a stiffer strings
such<00:02:27.810> as<00:02:27.959> polyester<00:02:28.379> string<00:02:28.829> which<00:02:29.099> doesn't

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
such as polyester string which doesn't

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.479 
such as polyester string which doesn't
have<00:02:29.670> quite<00:02:29.849> as<00:02:29.940> much<00:02:30.180> spring<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.290> as<00:02:31.440> a

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
have quite as much spring to it as a

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.610 
have quite as much spring to it as a
natural<00:02:32.489> gut<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.180> possibly<00:02:33.569> or<00:02:33.750> artificial

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
natural gut but possibly or artificial

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
gut that stream is already quite quite

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.550 
gut that stream is already quite quite
firm<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.610> won't<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.390> ball<00:02:39.720> won't<00:02:40.079> spring<00:02:40.440> off

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
firm so won't the ball won't spring off

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.750 
firm so won't the ball won't spring off
at<00:02:40.739> as<00:02:40.829> much<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.310> I'm<00:02:41.400> going<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.579> use<00:02:41.730> a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
at as much so I'm going to use a

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.660 
at as much so I'm going to use a
slightly<00:02:42.120> looser<00:02:42.660> E<00:02:42.870> string<00:02:43.290> then<00:02:44.040> then<00:02:44.430> one

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
slightly looser E string then then one

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.619 
slightly looser E string then then one
that<00:02:44.879> use<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.269> natural<00:02:46.079> gas<00:02:46.230> stream<00:02:47.000> now<00:02:48.000> when

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
that use on natural gas stream now when

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.680 
that use on natural gas stream now when
I<00:02:48.660> mean<00:02:49.140> myself<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.709> string<00:02:50.310> at<00:02:50.510> fifty<00:02:51.510> four

pounds of 54 56 pounds for the play
matches<00:02:54.359> if<00:02:55.079> I<00:02:55.260> was<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.560> use<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.769> synthetic<00:02:56.099> or

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
matches if I was to use a synthetic or

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.349 
matches if I was to use a synthetic or
real<00:02:56.819> gut

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
real gut

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.839 
real gut
I'll<00:02:57.510> possibly<00:02:58.079> go<00:02:58.290> up<00:02:58.470> maybe<00:02:58.889> ten<00:02:59.190> percent<00:02:59.609> so

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
I'll possibly go up maybe ten percent so

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.690 
I'll possibly go up maybe ten percent so
I'll<00:03:00.480> go<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.109> maybe

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
I'll go for maybe

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.430 
I'll go for maybe
sixty<00:03:02.270> pounds<00:03:02.599> something<00:03:02.780> like<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.110> just<00:03:03.140> to

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
sixty pounds something like that just to

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.080 
sixty pounds something like that just to
give<00:03:03.980> myself<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.459> little<00:03:04.489> bit<00:03:04.760> more<00:03:04.819> of<00:03:05.060> a

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
give myself a little bit more of a

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.330 
give myself a little bit more of a
firmer<00:03:05.360> feel<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.500> something<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.980> note<00:03:07.129> with

firmer feel and something to note with

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.339 
firmer feel and something to note with
the<00:03:07.519> natural<00:03:07.970> gut<00:03:08.180> as<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.360> string<00:03:08.720> itself<00:03:09.050> will

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
the natural gut as a string itself will

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.470 
the natural gut as a string itself will
stretch<00:03:09.800> throughout<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.910> process<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.420> the

stretch throughout the process of the
match<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:13.250> know<00:03:13.370> if<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.580> string<00:03:13.879> it<00:03:13.910> a

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
match so you know if you string it a

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.970 
match so you know if you string it a
little<00:03:14.209> bit<00:03:14.390> tighter<00:03:14.569> you<00:03:15.500> ensure<00:03:15.860> that

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
little bit tighter you ensure that

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.309 
little bit tighter you ensure that
you'll<00:03:16.129> still<00:03:16.400> have<00:03:16.580> enough<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.660> attention<00:03:18.200> at

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
you'll still have enough of attention at

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.930 
you'll still have enough of attention at
the<00:03:18.440> end<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.769> match<00:03:18.950> for<00:03:19.519> when<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.730> play

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
the end of the match for when you play

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.729 
the end of the match for when you play
but<00:03:20.360> that's<00:03:20.480> why<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.750> lot<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.930> approach<00:03:21.290> carries

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
but that's why a lot of approach carries

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.550 
but that's why a lot of approach carries
680<00:03:22.519> records<00:03:22.880> with<00:03:23.030> them<00:03:23.290> for<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.319> match<00:03:24.530> in

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
680 records with them for a match in

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.949 
680 records with them for a match in
their<00:03:24.920> bag<00:03:25.099> because<00:03:25.550> potential<00:03:26.480> will<00:03:26.690> drop

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
their bag because potential will drop

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.620 
their bag because potential will drop
especially<00:03:27.470> in<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.620> heat<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.180> will<00:03:29.480> need

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
especially in the heat so you will need

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.570 
especially in the heat so you will need
other<00:03:29.840> rackets<00:03:30.319> to<00:03:30.530> get<00:03:30.860> that<00:03:31.010> tension<00:03:31.280> back

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
other rackets to get that tension back

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.039 
other rackets to get that tension back
if<00:03:31.760> you're<00:03:31.910> feeling<00:03:32.180> like<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.480> balls<00:03:32.690> disturb

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
if you're feeling like the balls disturb

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.809 
if you're feeling like the balls disturb
me<00:03:33.200> something<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.830> fly<00:03:34.040> out<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.220> your<00:03:34.459> racket<00:03:34.790> a

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
me something to fly out of your racket a

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.660 
me something to fly out of your racket a
little<00:03:35.000> bit<00:03:35.380> now<00:03:36.380> next<00:03:37.099> I'm<00:03:37.310> going<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.519> talk

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
little bit now next I'm going to talk

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.120 
little bit now next I'm going to talk
about<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.970> string<00:03:38.450> data<00:03:38.750> now<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.590> damn<00:03:39.890> that

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
about a string data now the damn that

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.160 
about a string data now the damn that
will<00:03:40.400> make<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.880> racket<00:03:41.269> feel<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.510> lot<00:03:41.780> stiffer

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
will make the racket feel a lot stiffer

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.140 
will make the racket feel a lot stiffer
and<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.709> string<00:03:43.069> tension<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.640> lot<00:03:43.880> tighter

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
and the string tension a lot tighter

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.990 
and the string tension a lot tighter
than<00:03:44.630> using<00:03:45.349> without<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.799> usually<00:03:46.730> players

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
than using without it usually players

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.250 
than using without it usually players
that<00:03:47.209> want<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.420> go<00:03:47.510> for<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> little<00:03:47.989> bit<00:03:48.110> more

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
that want to go for a little bit more

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.350 
that want to go for a little bit more
power<00:03:48.530> will<00:03:48.860> not<00:03:49.340> use<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.549> damn<00:03:49.849> knife<00:03:50.060> because

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
power will not use a damn knife because

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.449 
power will not use a damn knife because
a<00:03:50.390> damn<00:03:50.630> that<00:03:50.810> obviously<00:03:51.470> dampens<00:03:52.280> the

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
a damn that obviously dampens the

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.949 
a damn that obviously dampens the
vibrations<00:03:53.180> through<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.510> string<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:53.870> the

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
vibrations through the string and the

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.289 
vibrations through the string and the
ball<00:03:54.140> doesn't<00:03:54.440> fly<00:03:54.590> off<00:03:54.620> just<00:03:55.010> as<00:03:55.160> much<00:03:55.370> so<00:03:55.670> a

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
ball doesn't fly off just as much so a

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.539 
ball doesn't fly off just as much so a
lot<00:03:57.049> of<00:03:57.140> players<00:03:57.319> prefer<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.860> play<00:03:58.040> with<00:03:58.280> some

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
lot of players prefer to play with some

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.809 
lot of players prefer to play with some

preferably without as I as I started to
get<00:04:01.940> older<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.510> started<00:04:02.989> using<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.650> little<00:04:03.829> bit

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
get older I started using a little bit

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.559 
get older I started using a little bit
more<00:04:04.160> vibration<00:04:04.700> manner<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.180> save<00:04:05.390> myself

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
more vibration manner to save myself

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.479 
more vibration manner to save myself
from<00:04:05.870> injuries<00:04:06.290> stops<00:04:06.799> vibrations<00:04:07.370> going

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
from injuries stops vibrations going

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.539 
from injuries stops vibrations going
through<00:04:07.790> my<00:04:07.910> arm<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:09.079> again<00:04:09.739> when<00:04:09.889> it's<00:04:10.010> work

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
through my arm but again when it's work

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.190 
through my arm but again when it's work
when<00:04:10.730> I'm<00:04:11.000> looking<00:04:11.389> for<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.750> little<00:04:11.870> bit<00:04:12.019> more

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
when I'm looking for a little bit more

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.229 
when I'm looking for a little bit more
power<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.769> will<00:04:13.010> play<00:04:13.310> without<00:04:13.579> a<00:04:13.639> vibration

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
power I will play without a vibration

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.150 
power I will play without a vibration
that<00:04:14.359> now<00:04:14.590> when<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:15.620> was<00:04:15.799> going<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.130> a

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
that now when I was going to a

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.560 
that now when I was going to a
tournament<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:16.760> I<00:04:16.789> was<00:04:16.940> playing<00:04:17.180> with<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:17.539> a

tournament and I was playing with that a

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.420 
tournament and I was playing with that a
vibration<00:04:18.200> number<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:18.769> I<00:04:18.859> was<00:04:18.950> starting<00:04:19.400> to

when<00:04:24.740> they<00:04:24.800> give<00:04:24.979> a<00:04:25.010> racket<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.490> restring<00:04:25.940> to

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
when they give a racket to restring to

when they give a racket to restring to
someone<00:04:26.419> at<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.570> tournament<00:04:26.900> especially<00:04:27.710> you

someone at a tournament especially you

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.400 
someone at a tournament especially you
don't<00:04:28.910> know<00:04:29.120> what<00:04:29.389> tension<00:04:29.810> will<00:04:29.960> come<00:04:30.139> out<00:04:30.289> of

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
don't know what tension will come out of

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.779 
don't know what tension will come out of
that<00:04:30.530> machine<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.039> a<00:04:31.070> lot<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.400> countries

that machine and a lot of the countries

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.279 
that machine and a lot of the countries
maybe<00:04:32.030> they<00:04:32.240> don't<00:04:32.570> have<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.840> best<00:04:33.050> equipment

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
maybe they don't have the best equipment

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.110 
maybe they don't have the best equipment
to<00:04:33.620> restring<00:04:34.010> your<00:04:34.039> racket<00:04:34.130> so<00:04:34.820> when<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:35.030> was

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
to restring your racket so when I was

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.370 
to restring your racket so when I was
traveling<00:04:35.570> I'd<00:04:35.660> always<00:04:35.810> traveled<00:04:36.289> a<00:04:36.350> few

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
traveling I'd always traveled a few

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.650 
traveling I'd always traveled a few
vibration<00:04:37.010> dampers<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:37.580> that<00:04:38.000> if<00:04:38.120> it's<00:04:38.300> string

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
vibration dampers so that if it's string

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.540 
vibration dampers so that if it's string
feels<00:04:38.870> very<00:04:39.050> loose<00:04:39.350> or<00:04:39.919> when<00:04:40.039> I<00:04:40.070> come<00:04:40.310> on<00:04:40.370> the

feels very loose or when I come on the
