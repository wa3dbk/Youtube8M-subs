watching this just marveling at the
incredibly<00:01:02.269> realistic<00:01:02.780> animation<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.979> I

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
incredibly realistic animation and I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.730 
incredibly realistic animation and I
think<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.370> very<00:01:04.400> compelling<00:01:05.030> story<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:05.420> -<00:01:05.740> in

think a very compelling story and - in
the<00:01:06.890> past<00:01:07.130> 25<00:01:07.640> years<00:01:07.940> we've<00:01:08.210> learned<00:01:08.450> more

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
the past 25 years we've learned more

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.600 
the past 25 years we've learned more
about<00:01:08.990> dinosaurs<00:01:09.229> than<00:01:09.860> in<00:01:09.950> all<00:01:10.220> prior

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610

background research was done to make
these<00:01:20.840> dinosaurs<00:01:21.409> completely<00:01:22.070> authentic<00:01:22.520> Oh

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
these dinosaurs completely authentic Oh

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.899 
these dinosaurs completely authentic Oh
every<00:01:25.130> dinosaur<00:01:25.640> you'll<00:01:25.820> see<00:01:26.000> in<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:26.270> movie

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
every dinosaur you'll see in this movie

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.340 
every dinosaur you'll see in this movie
we<00:01:28.909> built<00:01:29.210> from<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.540> bones<00:01:29.750> out<00:01:30.020> from<00:01:30.260> the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
we built from the bones out from the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.340 
we built from the bones out from the
real<00:01:30.530> fossils<00:01:31.899> because<00:01:32.899> it's<00:01:33.079> got<00:01:33.229> the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
real fossils because it's got the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.990 
real fossils because it's got the
muscles<00:01:33.710> underneath<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.310> skin<00:01:34.549> you'll<00:01:34.759> see

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
muscles underneath the skin you'll see

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.300 
muscles underneath the skin you'll see
all<00:01:35.179> of<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.509> skin<00:01:35.750> move<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.869> react<00:01:39.770> exactly

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
all of the skin move and react exactly

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.529 
all of the skin move and react exactly
like<00:01:40.490> real<00:01:40.759> creatures<00:01:42.579> we<00:01:43.579> got<00:01:43.789> bulges<00:01:44.390> and

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
like real creatures we got bulges and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.779 
like real creatures we got bulges and
gets<00:01:44.780> skin<00:01:45.079> stretching<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.710> skin<00:01:45.890> sliding<00:01:46.429> we

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
gets skin stretching the skin sliding we

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.910 
gets skin stretching the skin sliding we
also<00:01:46.939> have<00:01:47.240> revolutionary<00:01:47.990> new<00:01:48.200> systems

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
also have revolutionary new systems

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.210 
also have revolutionary new systems
which<00:01:49.340> actually<00:01:49.999> create<00:01:50.329> real<00:01:50.689> scales

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.760 

the<00:01:56.220> big<00:01:56.430> draw<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.700> me<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.689> combining<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the big draw for me was combining the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.390 
the big draw for me was combining the
real<00:01:59.009> world<00:01:59.930> with<00:02:00.930> animation<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.920> making<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
real world with animation and making it

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.240 
real world with animation and making it
look<00:02:02.549> very<00:02:02.909> realistic<00:02:03.979> one<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> most

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
look very realistic one of the most

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.649 
look very realistic one of the most
important<00:02:05.670> things<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.970> we<00:02:06.090> do<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.509> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
important things that we do is to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.960 
important things that we do is to
capture<00:02:06.869> what<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.590> light<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.830> doing<00:02:07.979> at<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
capture what the light is doing at the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.910 
capture what the light is doing at the
moment<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.509> shoot<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> shot<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.380> as<00:02:10.649> if

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
moment that we shoot the shot it's as if

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.550 
moment that we shoot the shot it's as if
the<00:02:11.220> dinosaur<00:02:12.060> was<00:02:12.360> actually<00:02:13.020> there<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.440> day

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the dinosaur was actually there the day

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:23.090 
the dinosaur was actually there the day
you<00:02:13.590> shot<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:22.080> we've<00:02:22.200> also<00:02:22.380> done<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.739> lot<00:02:22.860> of

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
you shot and we've also done a lot of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.070 
you shot and we've also done a lot of
scan<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.940> environment<00:02:24.540> which<00:02:24.840> adds

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
scan of the environment which adds

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.110 
scan of the environment which adds
amazing<00:02:25.739> detail<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.489> will<00:02:26.610> actually<00:02:26.790> make

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
amazing detail and will actually make

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.059 
amazing detail and will actually make
you<00:02:27.269> feel<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.900> you're<00:02:28.050> really<00:02:28.260> there<00:02:28.769> among

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
you feel like you're really there among

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.610 
you feel like you're really there among
some<00:02:29.989> did<00:02:30.989> i<00:02:31.050> mean<00:02:31.170> that's<00:02:31.290> what<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.500> all<00:02:31.590> boils

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
some did i mean that's what it all boils

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.520 
some did i mean that's what it all boils
down<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.130> great<00:02:32.880> animation<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:34.080> loved

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
down to great animation and I loved

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.470 
down to great animation and I loved
learning<00:02:34.950> about<00:02:35.250> them<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.150> really

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
learning about them if it's really

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.300 
learning about them if it's really
becomes<00:02:36.810> very<00:02:37.080> believable<00:02:37.410> it's<00:02:37.890> fascinating

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310
