would be to always aim at the sternum or
the<00:01:48.240> upper<00:01:48.509> chest<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.380> believe<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.710> is

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.080 
let's say you're going for a jump shot
if<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.829> decide<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.130> aim<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> sternum<00:01:59.939> and

if you decide to aim at the sternum and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.399 
if you decide to aim at the sternum and
you<00:02:00.149> jump<00:02:00.390> up<00:02:00.509> your<00:02:00.719> gun<00:02:00.899> will<00:02:01.049> land<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.290> their

head

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
head

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.260 
head
and<00:02:01.979> you'll<00:02:02.100> still<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.369> able<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> kill<00:02:02.759> them<00:02:02.880> or

and you'll still be able to kill them or

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.670 
and you'll still be able to kill them or
if<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.689> aim<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> sternum<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.320> type<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
if you aim of the sternum you type a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.319 
if you aim of the sternum you type a
drop<00:02:04.950> shot<00:02:05.159> when<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.640> lay<00:02:05.850> down<00:02:05.880> your<00:02:06.210> gun

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
drop shot when you lay down your gun

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.229 
drop shot when you lay down your gun
will<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.810> their<00:02:06.960> stomach<00:02:07.350> or<00:02:07.530> lower<00:02:07.829> torso

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
will be on their stomach or lower torso

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.639 
will be on their stomach or lower torso
so<00:02:09.239> either<00:02:09.390> way<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.840> always<00:02:10.050> kill<00:02:10.500> them

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so either way you can always kill them

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.650 
so either way you can always kill them
also<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.550> you're<00:02:11.670> aiming<00:02:11.849> at<00:02:12.060> them<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.420> may

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
also if you're aiming at them and may

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.700 
also if you're aiming at them and may
jump<00:02:12.989> shot

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
jump shot

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.750 
jump shot
then<00:02:13.860> you'll<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.100> still<00:02:14.430> hitting<00:02:14.640> their

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
then you'll be still hitting their

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.880 
then you'll be still hitting their
stomach<00:02:15.150> or<00:02:15.300> their<00:02:15.600> legs<00:02:15.900> or<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.770> you're

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
aiming at them and they decide a drop

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.460 
aiming at them and they decide a drop
shot<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.750> you're<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.260> able<00:02:19.320> to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
shot that you're going to be able to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.810 
shot that you're going to be able to
clip<00:02:19.740> their<00:02:19.920> head<00:02:20.130> as<00:02:20.310> they're<00:02:20.550> falling

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.100 
clip their head as they're falling
towards<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.090> ground<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.480> shearing<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.960> kill

to find a lot more players that you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.820 
to find a lot more players that you
wouldn't<00:03:09.480> see<00:03:09.630> otherwise<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.620> that's<00:03:10.770> a

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
wouldn't see otherwise so that's a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.040 
wouldn't see otherwise so that's a
really<00:03:11.070> big<00:03:11.190> tip<00:03:11.700> now<00:03:12.090> another<00:03:12.330> aspect<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.900> want

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
really big tip now another aspect I want

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.170 
really big tip now another aspect I want
to<00:03:13.110> talk<00:03:13.230> about<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.650> your<00:03:13.770> movement<00:03:14.100> now<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:15.090> is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
to talk about is your movement now it is

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.640 
to talk about is your movement now it is
always<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.420> good<00:03:15.570> idea<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.140> stick<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
always a good idea just to stick to the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.260 
always a good idea just to stick to the
outskirts<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.310> map<00:03:17.520> because<00:03:17.760> there's<00:03:18.060> so

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
outskirts of the map because there's so

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.580 
outskirts of the map because there's so
much<00:03:18.420> traffic<00:03:18.720> all<00:03:19.050> your<00:03:19.170> going<00:03:19.350> through<00:03:19.410> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
much traffic all your going through the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.870 
much traffic all your going through the
middle<00:03:19.770> you<00:03:20.190> know<00:03:20.220> people<00:03:20.550> are<00:03:20.610> going<00:03:20.760> for

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
middle you know people are going for

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.610 
middle you know people are going for
objectives<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.750> if<00:03:22.170> you<00:03:22.260> stick<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
objectives and if you stick to the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.020 
objectives and if you stick to the
outside<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.010> map<00:03:23.160> your<00:03:23.340> back<00:03:23.520> is<00:03:23.700> always

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
outside of the map your back is always

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.280 
outside of the map your back is always
covered<00:03:24.390> because<00:03:24.750> nobody's<00:03:25.050> going<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.230> be

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
covered because nobody's going to be

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.540 
covered because nobody's going to be
outside<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.950> map<00:03:26.100> they're<00:03:26.250> usually<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
outside of the map they're usually the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.610 
outside of the map they're usually the
wall<00:03:26.790> or<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> fence<00:03:27.390> or<00:03:27.690> whatever<00:03:27.990> so<00:03:28.500> you're

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
wall or a fence or whatever so you're

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.870

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
never going to get shot in the back so

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.730 
never going to get shot in the back so
you<00:03:29.970> know<00:03:30.000> that's<00:03:30.210> always<00:03:30.420> safe<00:03:30.750> also<00:03:31.590> you'll

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
you know that's always safe also you'll

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.110 
you know that's always safe also you'll
be<00:03:31.770> able<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.040> pick<00:03:32.220> off<00:03:32.370> players<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:32.820> aren't

and get a lot more kills that way now

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.520 
and get a lot more kills that way now
also<00:03:39.240> movement<00:03:39.720> has<00:03:39.840> changed<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.320> advanced

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530

warfare as we all know you know there's

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.610 
warfare as we all know you know there's
a<00:03:42.120> double<00:03:42.420> jump<00:03:42.600> there's<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.960> burst<00:03:43.200> there's

a double jump there's a burst there's

a double jump there's a burst there's
long<00:03:43.800> that<00:03:44.040> little<00:03:44.340> slide<00:03:44.610> thing<00:03:44.940> we<00:03:45.720> could

long that little slide thing we could

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.940 
long that little slide thing we could
really<00:03:46.020> set<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.410> our<00:03:46.470> advantage

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
really set to our advantage

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.290 
really set to our advantage
so<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.550> is<00:03:47.670> one<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:47.820> those<00:03:47.940> tips<00:03:48.180> are

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
so this is one of those tips are

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.880 
so this is one of those tips are
targeted<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:48.900> towards<00:03:49.200> advanced<00:03:49.440> warfare

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
targeted just towards advanced warfare

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.500 
targeted just towards advanced warfare
and<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.700> biggest<00:03:50.970> thing<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.180> can<00:03:51.210> give<00:03:51.420> you

guys I'll really save your life a lot I
guarantee<00:03:53.520> it<00:03:53.610> if<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.850> haven't<00:03:54.090> already<00:03:54.180> done

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
guarantee it if you haven't already done

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.030 
guarantee it if you haven't already done
it<00:03:54.600> is<00:03:54.750> when<00:03:55.260> you're<00:03:55.350> getting<00:03:55.440> shot<00:03:55.740> at<00:03:55.860> you're

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
it is when you're getting shot at you're

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.560 
it is when you're getting shot at you're
not<00:03:56.160> really<00:03:56.340> sure<00:03:56.520> where<00:03:56.700> it's<00:03:56.820> from<00:03:57.000> just

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
not really sure where it's from just

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.660 
not really sure where it's from just
double<00:03:57.960> jump<00:03:58.200> up<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.560> then<00:03:58.710> burst<00:03:59.010> backwards

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
double jump up and then burst backwards

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.550 
double jump up and then burst backwards
now<00:04:00.270> that<00:04:00.450> will<00:04:00.570> really<00:04:00.840> help<00:04:01.050> out<00:04:01.200> because<00:04:01.500> I

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
now that will really help out because I

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.930 
now that will really help out because I
would<00:04:01.680> confuse<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.100> enemy<00:04:02.340> you'll<00:04:02.520> lose<00:04:02.760> you

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
would confuse the enemy you'll lose you

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.300 
would confuse the enemy you'll lose you
and<00:04:03.690> also<00:04:03.990> once<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.410> burst<00:04:04.680> backwards<00:04:05.160> I

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
and also once you burst backwards I

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.100 
and also once you burst backwards I
suggest<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.150> lay<00:04:06.360> down<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.810> wait<00:04:06.990> and

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
suggest that you lay down and wait and

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.600 
suggest that you lay down and wait and
see<00:04:07.290> if<00:04:07.350> you<00:04:07.410> can<00:04:07.530> find<00:04:07.770> him<00:04:07.980> if<00:04:08.340> you're<00:04:08.490> able

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
see if you can find him if you're able

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.920 
see if you can find him if you're able
to<00:04:08.730> find<00:04:08.910> him<00:04:09.120> then<00:04:09.300> go<00:04:09.390> ahead<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.660> shoot<00:04:09.780> him

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
to find him then go ahead and shoot him

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
to find him then go ahead and shoot him
he<00:04:10.020> should<00:04:10.200> land<00:04:10.350> right<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.650> your<00:04:10.770> crosshairs

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
he should land right in your crosshairs

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.800 
he should land right in your crosshairs
but<00:04:11.370> if<00:04:11.700> you're<00:04:11.790> not<00:04:11.910> able<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.150> find<00:04:12.360> him<00:04:12.540> don't

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
but if you're not able to find him don't

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.870 
but if you're not able to find him don't
lay<00:04:13.020> down<00:04:13.260> just<00:04:13.620> burst<00:04:13.890> up<00:04:14.040> again<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.760> either

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
lay down just burst up again and either

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.400 
lay down just burst up again and either
burst<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.390> left<00:04:15.660> or<00:04:15.810> burst<00:04:16.020> to<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.230> right

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
burst to the left or burst to the right

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.170 
burst to the left or burst to the right
and<00:04:16.739> you're<00:04:16.920> able<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.280> confuse<00:04:17.609> him<00:04:17.730> so<00:04:17.940> much

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
and you're able to confuse him so much

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.000 
and you're able to confuse him so much
and<00:04:18.780> just<00:04:18.840> try<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.109> get<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.410> safety<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.859> way

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
and just try and get to safety that way

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.710 
and just try and get to safety that way
or<00:04:20.220> if<00:04:20.760> you're<00:04:20.940> feeling<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.239> little<00:04:21.420> with<00:04:21.510> balls

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
or if you're feeling a little with balls

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.000 
or if you're feeling a little with balls
you<00:04:21.870> just<00:04:22.080> try<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.260> find<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.650> guy<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:22.919> then

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
you just try to find the guy and then

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.680 
you just try to find the guy and then
you're<00:04:23.100> able<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.340> kill<00:04:23.550> him<00:04:23.700> this<00:04:24.270> has<00:04:24.480> helped

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
you're able to kill him this has helped

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.790 
you're able to kill him this has helped
me<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:24.900> much<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.200> probably<00:04:25.440> see<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.650> throughout

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
me so much to probably see it throughout

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.930 
me so much to probably see it throughout
the<00:04:25.919> video<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:26.310> I'm<00:04:26.400> play

the video that I'm play

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.400 
the video that I'm play
right<00:04:27.150> now<00:04:27.270> in<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.420> background<00:04:27.960> I'm<00:04:28.140> always

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
right now in the background I'm always

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.230 
right now in the background I'm always
bursting<00:04:28.860> up<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.250> jumping<00:04:29.610> around<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:30.150> doing

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240

bursting up and jumping around and doing
all<00:04:30.390> kinds<00:04:30.600> of<00:04:30.660> crazy<00:04:30.780> stuff<00:04:31.140> just<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.440> confuse

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
all kinds of crazy stuff just to confuse

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.830 
all kinds of crazy stuff just to confuse
the<00:04:31.860> enemy<00:04:31.890> while<00:04:32.250> I'm<00:04:32.370> getting<00:04:32.550> shot<00:04:32.790> at<00:04:32.840> and

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
the enemy while I'm getting shot at and

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.990 
the enemy while I'm getting shot at and
also<00:04:34.290> gives<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.500> time<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.710> reload<00:04:35.100> as<00:04:35.250> well<00:04:35.490> so

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
also gives you time to reload as well so

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.610 
also gives you time to reload as well so
it's<00:04:36.090> going<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.330> keep<00:04:36.420> that<00:04:36.480> in<00:04:36.750> mind<00:04:36.930> now

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
it's going to keep that in mind now

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.750 
it's going to keep that in mind now
another<00:04:37.860> thing<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:38.130> want<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.340> mention<00:04:38.460> is

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
another thing I want to mention is

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.580 
another thing I want to mention is
mini-map<00:04:39.240> awareness<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:39.990> can<00:04:40.020> learn<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:40.560> much

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
mini-map awareness you can learn so much

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.620 
mini-map awareness you can learn so much
by<00:04:40.980> looking<00:04:41.010> at<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.520> mini-map<00:04:41.850> honestly<00:04:42.480> guys

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
by looking at the mini-map honestly guys

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.330 
by looking at the mini-map honestly guys
I<00:04:42.780> think<00:04:42.840> in<00:04:43.080> my<00:04:43.260> gameplays<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.890> look<00:04:44.070> more<00:04:44.280> at

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
I think in my gameplays I look more at

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.710 
I think in my gameplays I look more at
the<00:04:44.430> mini-map<00:04:44.730> than<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.000> do<00:04:45.060> at<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.420> actual

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
the mini-map than I do at the actual

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.450 
the mini-map than I do at the actual
game<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.350> that's<00:04:46.680> because<00:04:46.980> you<00:04:47.070> could<00:04:47.190> spot

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
game and that's because you could spot

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.920 
game and that's because you could spot
so<00:04:47.670> many<00:04:47.820> traffic<00:04:48.180> patterns<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.720> know<00:04:48.810> when

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
so many traffic patterns you know when

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.330 
so many traffic patterns you know when
you're<00:04:49.020> hearing<00:04:49.200> gunshots<00:04:49.410> you're<00:04:50.100> able<00:04:50.310> to

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
you're hearing gunshots you're able to

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.890 
you're hearing gunshots you're able to
see<00:04:50.490> them<00:04:50.610> on<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:50.730> mini-map<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.630> advanced

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
see them on the mini-map and in advanced

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.150 
see them on the mini-map and in advanced
warfare<00:04:52.050> if<00:04:52.380> they're<00:04:52.530> not<00:04:52.680> running<00:04:52.830> blast

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
warfare if they're not running blast

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.770 
warfare if they're not running blast
suppressor<00:04:53.280> you're<00:04:53.970> able<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.180> see<00:04:54.330> their<00:04:54.450> exit

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
suppressor you're able to see their exit

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.420 
suppressor you're able to see their exit
movements<00:04:55.170> so<00:04:55.590> you're<00:04:55.770> actually<00:04:56.130> able<00:04:56.250> to

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
movements so you're actually able to

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.190 
movements so you're actually able to
study<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.880> mini-map<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.480> learn<00:04:57.810> where<00:04:58.080> the

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
study the mini-map and learn where the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.780 
study the mini-map and learn where the
enemy<00:04:58.470> spawning<00:04:58.770> where<00:04:59.130> they're<00:04:59.280> going<00:04:59.610> and

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
enemy spawning where they're going and

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.310 
enemy spawning where they're going and
just<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.180> lot<00:05:00.360> of<00:05:00.390> different<00:05:00.570> traffic<00:05:01.020> patterns

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
just a lot of different traffic patterns

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.540 
just a lot of different traffic patterns
so<00:05:01.470> it's<00:05:01.590> really<00:05:01.740> useful<00:05:01.920> just<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.310> stare<00:05:02.490> at

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.860 
so it's really useful just to stare at
the<00:05:02.610> mini-map<00:05:02.910> so<00:05:03.390> make<00:05:03.540> sure<00:05:03.570> you<00:05:03.720> guys<00:05:03.810> are

the mini-map so make sure you guys are

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.300 
the mini-map so make sure you guys are
constantly<00:05:04.170> looking<00:05:04.590> at<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:04.950> becomes

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
constantly looking at that becomes

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.950 
constantly looking at that becomes
mini-map<00:05:05.700> awareness<00:05:06.120> is<00:05:06.270> really<00:05:06.510> important

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
mini-map awareness is really important

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.570 
mini-map awareness is really important
so<00:05:07.500> that's<00:05:07.710> pretty<00:05:07.860> much<00:05:07.950> it<00:05:08.130> hopefully<00:05:08.520> you
