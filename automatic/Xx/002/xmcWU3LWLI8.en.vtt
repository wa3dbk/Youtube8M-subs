00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:49.070 
last match it was five good matches in a
row<00:05:43.940> so<00:05:45.500> we<00:05:46.729> it's<00:05:47.729> it's<00:05:48.180> still<00:05:48.419> gathering<00:05:48.780> in

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
row so we it's it's still gathering in

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.860 
row so we it's it's still gathering in
this<00:05:49.289> together<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.919> data<00:05:50.129> so<00:05:50.870> hopefully

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
this together and data so hopefully

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.740 
this together and data so hopefully
should<00:05:51.930> again<00:05:52.380> I'm<00:05:53.310> adapting<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.449> same

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
should again I'm adapting the same

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.249 
should again I'm adapting the same
system<00:05:55.469> that<00:05:55.500> you<00:05:55.770> have<00:05:55.979> on<00:05:56.719> natural<00:05:57.719> to<00:05:58.110> the

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
system that you have on natural to the

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.209 
system that you have on natural to the
server<00:05:59.150> so<00:06:00.150> it'll<00:06:00.870> they<00:06:01.380> won't<00:06:01.620> affect<00:06:02.039> we

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
server so it'll they won't affect we

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:03.620 
server so it'll they won't affect we
will<00:06:02.370> be<00:06:02.520> balanced<00:06:02.849> and<00:06:02.940> people<00:06:03.270> moved<00:06:03.449> around

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
will be balanced and people moved around

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.769 
will be balanced and people moved around
it<00:06:03.930> just<00:06:03.960> decides<00:06:04.500> them<00:06:04.830> at<00:06:05.219> the<00:06:05.340> beginning<00:06:05.779> so

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779 
it just decides them at the beginning so

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.459 
it just decides them at the beginning so
we'll<00:06:06.990> see<00:06:07.139> if<00:06:07.169> it's<00:06:07.380> only<00:06:07.529> good<00:06:07.789> nice<00:06:09.349> cuz<00:06:10.349> it

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:10.469 
we'll see if it's only good nice cuz it

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.409 
we'll see if it's only good nice cuz it
the<00:06:11.099> balance<00:06:11.699> in<00:06:11.819> a<00:06:11.909> certain<00:06:12.090> i<00:06:12.240> just

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
the balance in a certain i just

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.890 
the balance in a certain i just
completed<00:06:12.750> evolved<00:06:13.650> after<00:06:14.610> a<00:06:14.940> while<00:06:15.210> I<00:06:15.539> don't

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
completed evolved after a while I don't

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.719 
completed evolved after a while I don't
know<00:06:16.050> why<00:06:16.319> it<00:06:17.219> got<00:06:17.550> so<00:06:17.759> bad<00:06:18.949> what<00:06:19.949> I<00:06:19.979> left<00:06:20.310> it<00:06:20.520> it

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
know why it got so bad what I left it it

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.459 
know why it got so bad what I left it it
was<00:06:20.940> it<00:06:21.270> as<00:06:21.389> good<00:06:21.419> round<00:06:21.840> after<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.259> ground

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:22.469 
was it as good round after the ground

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.950 
was it as good round after the ground
like<00:06:22.590> a<00:06:22.620> good<00:06:22.860> indeed<00:06:23.219> he<00:06:23.490> did<00:06:23.729> ever<00:06:24.300> had<00:06:24.690> a<00:06:24.719> bad

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
like a good indeed he did ever had a bad

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.000 
like a good indeed he did ever had a bad
round<00:06:25.229> Oh

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.070 

but<00:06:29.010> after<00:06:29.610> a<00:06:29.670> while<00:06:29.910> I<00:06:29.970> hadn't<00:06:30.540> touched<00:06:30.750> it<00:06:30.990> in

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
but after a while I hadn't touched it in

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.340 
but after a while I hadn't touched it in
a<00:06:31.170> few<00:06:31.410> months<00:06:31.590> and<00:06:32.360> apparently<00:06:33.360> defeated<00:06:34.140> I

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
a few months and apparently defeated I

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.140 
a few months and apparently defeated I
don't<00:06:34.650> think<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:34.920> settings<00:06:35.280> changed<00:06:35.730> but<00:06:35.880> i

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
don't think the settings changed but i

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.200 
don't think the settings changed but i
guess<00:06:36.630> the<00:06:36.810> playerbase<00:06:37.140> changed<00:06:37.890> and<00:06:38.070> it<00:06:38.520> just

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
guess the playerbase changed and it just

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.120 
guess the playerbase changed and it just
was<00:06:39.600> on<00:06:39.810> it<00:06:39.960> wasn't<00:06:40.320> able<00:06:40.470> to<00:06:40.620> bounce<00:06:40.770> anymore

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
was on it wasn't able to bounce anymore

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:49.040 
was on it wasn't able to bounce anymore
