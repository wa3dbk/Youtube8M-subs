 manufacturing was done 50 years ago 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.970
 because they kept this record 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.620
 in the making of this rifle 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.840
 It was obviously a rifle that 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.940
 practically had zero failures ie 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.090

 bullets precision is excellent is a 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.500
 very light rifle and also on the 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.760
 same rifle they have made a lot of 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.350
