00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.320
 throughout these 10 years because we have 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.260
 learned a lot about work 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.690
 scenic we have managed to increase 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.760
 our number of dancers with the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.760
 years not only that we have tried that 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.860
 be quality dancers we have achieved 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.390
 make mexico represent in festivals 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.120
 international and national festivals 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.340
 also and well that's a reason for 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.280
 pride for us already 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.620
 in these 10 years of work 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.140
 clear if within the achievements more 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.750
 great I think we can 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.610
 mention several how to win the contest 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.380
 state a few years from our 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.340
 training get the second year at the level 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.680
 state second last year 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.860
 we had the first state place in the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.070
 express cons espartaqueadas and we did 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.920
 a good role in the national we have 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.290
 had some very profitable ideas 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.420
 quite productive where we have left 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.580
 the name of our country on high and of 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.550
 the dance to which we dedicate ourselves 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.490
 that's on the one hand on the other hand going 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.960
 creating as independent this part 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.080
 of production this part of laying foundations 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.120
 be 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.060
 it has been made by hand important not but 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.150
 one of the greatest achievements I think 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.090
 which is to reach an artistic maturity 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.420
 that is still in process and also 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.080
 clear in having the satisfaction of having 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.100
 worked at least dancers friends 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.960
 that have become big 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.680
 dancers and being put big 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.680
 friends and finally having achieved that 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.200
 artistic contact between dancers and 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.810
 directors 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.410
 how good the work has taken 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.660
 artistic at a different level not 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.030
 diverse above but different from that of 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.580
 some groups do not want that that's the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.650
 difference and for me it would be one of the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.450
 greater achievements and I get to something very 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.209
 important is also to keep track of 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.769
 that we have tried if of course the 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.630
 Dancer's training but respect for 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.330
 that figure of the dancer that many times 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.220
 the truth from personal experience and by 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.870
 what we have observed sometimes, 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.049
 everywhere you are respected as what 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.830
 is and well I think we have tried in that 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.890
 sense of claiming that figure not of 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.620
 to provide the dancer that is the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.720
 place he deserves as an artist and for 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.520
 supposed as a human being we do not believe 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.630
 we who do not work with machines 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.730
 and that is very important too 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.160
 respect that part so that they 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.230
 feel at ease and happy to dance and 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.230
 that is not only the requirement of dance
