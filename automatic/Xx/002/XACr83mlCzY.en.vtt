00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 good guys review video by 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.779
 this antenna is an antenna to hold 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.340
 inside the house not to be mounted on the roof by 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.280
 connect directly to the TV 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.719
 without any kind of power me 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.219
 sent this company that sells on 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.490
 amazon he will put the link in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.230
 description and I expected to say va 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.300
 well I sent and I will see that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.490
 worked more than a breath does not work 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.279
 because i'm a bit in the mountains and i 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.609
 connects an antenna that is very far from 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.529
 here and then I thought that only the antenna 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.079
 on the roof with the right amplifier 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.730
 powerful could put me in a position to 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.300
 show me some channels because here 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.980
 we have always suffered with the channels seen 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.079
 that it is a little bit covered by the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.300
 this is precisely the comparison of the mountain 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.520
 content looked at bath that was there 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.680
 nothing but simple photos 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.600
 I destroy this antenna but it remains there 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.510
 glued because what you are going for 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.809
 see to me really left to mouth 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.809
 open 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.199
 Review video of this antenna is 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.070
 a simple antenna with a cable e 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.479
 promises to be able to take channels 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.340
 simply by connecting it to the TV 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.330
 I go to my TV with the pen 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.039
 normally attached los connect weigh 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.280
 area where we don't take well we are in 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:22.049
 mountain the increase is digital 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.440
 terrestrial we took only seven 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:33.479
 cable channels connected to the TV is 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:37.229
 the subject takes nothing we pass it e 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.709
 I'm going to put it near here 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.380
 window and we see ordered boys and 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.030
 we manage to catch 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.509
 take channels 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:54.149
 we have a 3m double-sided tape that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.450
 we can use one of the positions 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:02.340
 I increase the antenna position to 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.469
 butter for a moment the position in 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.109
 this way we see how many channels I can 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:12.180
 to see I give you the summary 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:15.720
 it almost takes almost everyone 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.209
 channels that also takes with the antenna of 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.609
 home the one that is placed on the roof with 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.079
 the amplifier and with lanternist that 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.989
 we have called many times over the years 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.880
 to try to improve a little bit 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.890
 the reception that was really 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.760
 especially for some dramatic cases 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.829
 for channel 5 and RAI channels then 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.600
 which you see that practically the channels yes 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.540
 they see a few bangs there is some little one 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.700
 trouble though is I will show you now 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.150
 also what happens in the plan of 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.489
 under 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.260
 because this is the second floor vi 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.000
 I repeat we are surrounded by mountains 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.400
 there is only one opening in this valley 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.590
 looking in a distant direction 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.049
 far away where there is a 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.609
 transmitter then we are forced to 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.709
 connect a transmitter much more 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.459
 far from others because the mountains 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.190
 surround surround the house in the plane 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.670
 downstairs where you practically see with a 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.220
 landscape less broad the situation will be 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.240
 of 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.160
 consistent and now let's see 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.020
 well now I will also make positions 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.760
 in this TV we see that behind 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.160
 the TV set the signal 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.240
 disappears so it is preferable in this 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.480
 case keep it on sight 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.850
 there is no need for this to attack 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.730
 at the window it would also be enough to keep it 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.180
 in the wall near the TV that the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.010
 signal in any case returns while 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.130
 hidden right behind the TV in 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.750
 this particular case goes away and also 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.400
 in the rooms below when we go to 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.050
 see we find out that there are points 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.690
 clearly better and points 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.760
 worst in this case hidden the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.300
 too many hurts to get to 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.300
 signal 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.170
 where it came to that was without 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.000
 amp with nothing I said 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.340
 oh well, but the junta goes absolutely 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.019
 it's crazy guys i stayed 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.349
 aghast 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.989
 and now the test in the piano room 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.659
 land that is practically not a 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.610
 basement but it is completely 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.950
 surrounded by trees and the 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.260
 conformation of the territory, however 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.169
 at the window looking in the direction 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.560
 of this earth, though not having it 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.169
 open view because it is low 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.210
 despite this he can find 45 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:42.699
 honest and against digital channels 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:45.460
 over a hundred the incredible thing that 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.680
 also takes raiuno raidue raitre than me 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.389
 on the ground floor I could not take 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.039
 I have had to resort to another 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.810
 preamplifier that gives more strength to the 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.250
 therefore simply signal these 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.370
 from the end it is simple like learns 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.650
 raiuno raidue raitre and we talk about the 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.300
 third attempt made with the TV 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.919
 which has the same angle as the 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.110
 same television we had seen ho 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.150
 done the search the zero result 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.419
 channels found despite having the same 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.620
 angle the windows and then one 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.020
 similar situation 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.030
 standing two and a half meters three meters 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.340
 below it fails to peck 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.949
 nothing because I repeat I am in one 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.240
 conca then standing on top of the other pur 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.180
 being the window in one direction 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.449
 wrong compared to where the antenna that 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.879
 transmits that it is very far never 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.620
 in this direction you can see below 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.840
 the not real signal fails to have 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.139
 the necessary strength 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.990
 but it is clear that every house has its own 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.550
 features so it's not mine 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.169
 review that can tell you what 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.879
 will happen at your home 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.879
 but be a very cheap thing 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:53.430
 when it takes it takes really well 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.830
 I would say that it could be decisive 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.089
 in many situations 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.580
 this is the antenna that was me 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:03.080
 shipped for the review it comes from 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.830
 shipping was from amazon.uk 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.009
 so fast it arrives 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:12.089
 from England to 13 pounds 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.589
 99 with a 60 percent discount on 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.810
 description I also put the link to 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:18.360
 this other tile sold on amazon.com 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.039
 that also an active amplifier because 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.409
 there is a socket to be attached 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.060
 let's see here the antenna layout of 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.189
 current then attaches to 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.569
 digital terrestrial will put us at the 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:32.669
 television if you don't have the 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:35.189
 decoder I hope with always that 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.349
 this review of mine was helpful 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:39.539
 if so, please leave one 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:45.409
 italico thumbs up as always
