00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.570 
death machine over till machine courses
want<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> show<00:00:24.619> the<00:00:25.619> original<00:00:26.039> version<00:00:26.160> here

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
how to see how to setup this one has 620

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.979 
how to see how to setup this one has 620
Spencer's<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:33.260> one<00:00:34.260> row<00:00:34.410> every<00:00:34.680> three<00:00:35.989> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
Spencer's just one row every three and

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.010 
Spencer's just one row every three and
now<00:00:37.290> I'll<00:00:37.440> show<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.890> new<00:00:38.010> version<00:00:39.020> so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
now I'll show you the new version so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.490 
now I'll show you the new version so
here's<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> new<00:00:40.829> version<00:00:41.450> this<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> lot

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
here's the new version this one is a lot

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
here's the new version this one is a lot
cleaner<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.980> actually<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:45.710> 440<00:00:47.329> dispensers

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
cleaner it actually has 440 dispensers

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.350 
cleaner it actually has 440 dispensers
so<00:00:48.780> twice<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:49.590> much<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.890> before<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.460> big

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
so twice as much as before a big

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.049 
so twice as much as before a big
improvement<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.800> figured<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
improvement as I figured out that you

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
improvement as I figured out that you
can<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.390> put<00:00:54.660> another<00:00:55.260> row<00:00:55.410> underneath<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
can just put another row underneath and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.549 
can just put another row underneath and
they're<00:00:56.100> still<00:00:56.280> powered<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> cleaned<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.469> up

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
they're still powered so I cleaned it up

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.590 
they're still powered so I cleaned it up
a<00:00:58.680> lot<00:00:58.829> and<00:01:00.559> since<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:02.030> one<00:01:03.030> every<00:01:03.420> two

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
a lot and since you have one every two

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.649 
a lot and since you have one every two
almost<00:01:03.809> there's<00:01:04.530> no<00:01:04.710> space<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.510> you<00:01:06.510> can

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
almost there's no space in there you can

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.039 
almost there's no space in there you can
just<00:01:06.689> use<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.700> simple<00:01:08.700> chain<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.570> torches

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
just use a simple chain of torches

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.840 
just use a simple chain of torches
there's<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.530> single<00:01:12.920> added<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> bit<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.520> faster

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
there's a single added a bit of a faster

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.530 
there's a single added a bit of a faster
clock<00:01:15.650> this<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.009> bit<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.640> also<00:01:18.180> added

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
clock this up a little bit I also added

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.469 
clock this up a little bit I also added
a<00:01:18.720> line<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.490> when<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
a line here so you can see when the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.800 
a line here so you can see when the
clocks<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.320> sometimes<00:01:23.000> ok<00:01:24.000> line<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.619> and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
clocks going is sometimes ok line up and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.580 
clocks going is sometimes ok line up and
stop<00:01:27.810> working<00:01:28.140> download<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
stop working download so and that so you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.840 
stop working download so and that so you
can<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.860> from<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> tower<00:01:32.340> whether<00:01:32.670> it's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
can see from the tower whether it's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.160 
can see from the tower whether it's
right<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:34.369> took<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.579> original<00:01:35.960> start<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
right here I took the original start and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.830 
right here I took the original start and
I<00:01:37.229> put<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> fence<00:01:37.619> around<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.369> nothing<00:01:39.000> get

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I put a fence around it so nothing get

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.980 
I put a fence around it so nothing get
in<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.259> shut<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> off<00:01:40.860> by<00:01:41.040> accident<00:01:41.750> but<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.810> put

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
in and shut it off by accident but I put

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.389 
in and shut it off by accident but I put
the<00:01:43.049> testing<00:01:43.409> tower<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.310> can

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the testing tower up here so you can

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.730 
the testing tower up here so you can
play<00:01:44.549> around<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.170> now<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.229> pressure<00:01:46.470> pad

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
play around with it now the pressure pad

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:59.240 
play around with it now the pressure pad
and<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:48.600> switch<00:01:49.350> here

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.330 

so<00:02:00.250> that's<00:02:01.140> basically<00:02:02.140> twice<00:02:02.799> as<00:02:02.950> many<00:02:03.070> arrows

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
so that's basically twice as many arrows

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.490 
so that's basically twice as many arrows
that<00:02:03.880> you've<00:02:04.090> already<00:02:04.270> got<00:02:04.360> before<00:02:04.509> that's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
that you've already got before that's

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.200 
that you've already got before that's
just<00:02:05.649> one<00:02:05.799> cycle<00:02:06.219> one<00:02:06.610> firing<00:02:06.850> from<00:02:07.090> each

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
just one cycle one firing from each

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.790 
just one cycle one firing from each
other<00:02:07.420> uh<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:10.000> not<00:02:10.119> too<00:02:10.300> much<00:02:10.420> fun<00:02:10.769> that<00:02:11.769> I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
other uh it's not too much fun that I

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.470 
other uh it's not too much fun that I
didn't<00:02:12.099> shoot<00:02:12.280> at<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:14.940> make<00:02:15.940> sure<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.090> gave<00:02:16.360> you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
didn't shoot at so make sure I gave you

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:37.910 
didn't shoot at so make sure I gave you
some<00:02:16.690> mob<00:02:17.110> spawners<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:20.019> kill<00:02:20.170> stuff

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.150 

it<00:02:38.920> down<00:02:40.380> what<00:02:41.380> size<00:02:41.680> 60<00:02:42.160> for<00:02:42.430> these<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:45.069> you

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
it down what size 60 for these so you

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.600 
it down what size 60 for these so you
have<00:02:45.250> plenty<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.549> stuff<00:02:45.790> he'll<00:02:47.459> want<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.519> get

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
have plenty of stuff he'll want to get

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.330 
have plenty of stuff he'll want to get
around<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.230> I'm<00:02:50.230> gonna<00:02:50.380> make<00:02:50.620> some<00:02:50.860> simple

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
mamas then you have arrows disappearance

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.710 
mamas then you have arrows disappearance
and<00:02:56.019> laid<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.380> ground<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.510> can't

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
and laid the ground so that you can't

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.309 
and laid the ground so that you can't
you<00:02:58.870> keep<00:02:59.019> hiring<00:03:00.989> Peter<00:03:01.989> huh<00:03:02.350> it's<00:03:02.680> just<00:03:02.950> now
