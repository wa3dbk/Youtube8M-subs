then we get these little pieces here the

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.469 
then we get these little pieces here the
satellite<00:04:06.250> itself<00:04:06.370> has<00:04:06.939> a<00:04:06.970> lot<00:04:07.239> of<00:04:07.269> neat

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
things and they built it nice to hold it

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.089 
things and they built it nice to hold it
in<00:04:13.989> here<00:04:14.169> where<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.379> got<00:04:14.500> these<00:04:14.620> little<00:04:14.799> laser

and then you got your Sten shins there
that's<00:04:23.860> all<00:04:24.039> there<00:04:24.159> is<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.280> it<00:04:24.400> here's<00:04:25.389> a<00:04:25.449> look

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
that's all there is to it here's a look

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.300 
that's all there is to it here's a look
at<00:04:25.780> your<00:04:25.990> vintage<00:04:26.199> instructions<00:04:27.099> they<00:04:27.250> do

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
at your vintage instructions they do

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.820 
at your vintage instructions they do
give<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.729> an<00:04:27.820> alternate<00:04:28.330> model<00:04:28.690> there<00:04:28.900> and

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
give you an alternate model there and

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.800 
give you an alternate model there and
they<00:04:30.099> get<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.370> star<00:04:30.639> grid<00:04:30.969> pattern<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:31.630> we

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
they get the star grid pattern that we

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.610 
they get the star grid pattern that we
saw<00:04:32.050> with<00:04:32.320> the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
saw with the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.240 
saw with the
a future<00:04:33.250> on<00:04:36.630> monorail<00:04:37.630> is<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.710> same<00:04:39.010> kind

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
a future on monorail is that same kind
