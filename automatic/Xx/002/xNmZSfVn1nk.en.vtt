00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 the people of put vx de soi ventura 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.340
 hernandez 95 and I come up with another criticism of 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.620
 shit x about a classic that what 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.139
 staff is the host the true crime 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.850
 streets of los angeles available for 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.730
 the ps2 xbox nintendo gamecube and pc then 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.949
 let's start with the review hehehe true 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.470
 crime street of los angeles is a game 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.750
 created in 2003 by the admission company 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.490
 if many will say but what a son of a bitch 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.669
 criticizing a game nine years ago 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.530
 but then you will see why the game as 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.559
 says the name develops in the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.540
 city of the angels by logic throughout 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.820
 the city which gives the first advantage 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.520
 the large number of space where you can 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.399
 to go around solving crimes or 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.050
 just fucking xd besides that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.960
 you can take the car that is given to you 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.000
 win now I explain to you because in the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.340
 game you are a policeman who seeks to be a 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.980
 detective if I also said that game 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.010
 so shit I hate the fucking police 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.539
 cules xd but the more you go deeper into 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.030
 the story you see is a very good 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.360
 plot and that you're not a simple cop but 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.730
 one 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.080
 this one is supposed to be the host 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.170
 just below the fbi 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.240
 now let's go to graphics charts 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.770
 they are not bad at all despite being a game 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.980
 older than the fucking mother of 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.010
 Illuminated 7 xp has better graphics 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.840
 that the gta san andreas of 2005 although 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.150
 that fucking game of fucking does not have 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.220
 better graphics than the gta but in short 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.410
 that is another good game that is the host 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.190
 but I will not talk about those blowjobs in this 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.410
 xd video in order to let history 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.750
 game starts with nixon who while 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.940
 the game goes by you realize that it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.040
 Nicholas Wilson called but he was brought up by 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.110
 a very poor Chinese family since their 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.300
 mother died when she was born and her father who 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.180
 He was also the best policeman 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.399
 angels by the way was killed and by 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.869
 it does not even enter the angels to be 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.869
 detective and know the truth of 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.759
 murder of his father now being in 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.920
 lahore there is an investigation where a 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.810
 such rocky who is from the russian mafia is 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.970
 involved in money laundering crimes 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.890
 and the murder of nick's father at 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.050
 end you discover that the doctor is looking for 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.150
 revenge on him and also solve the cid 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.110
 of the Russian mafia that is supposedly 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.210
 allied with 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.270
 Chinese triads of a guy called guru 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.190
 who has more than 3000 and of age xd not 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.460
 I'm kidding that age has the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.220
 old man was bitch x 0 now let's go to the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.050
 gameplay the game has very controls 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.440
 simple that even a reggaeton 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.170
 consummate can understand the xddddd 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.360
 hahahaha pure pineapples I do not think so but if 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.220
 the controls are simple there's no 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.320
 need to aim as it points 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.750
 there is also a mode automatically 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.580
 precision ie shoot on camera 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.380
 slow with one of the two pistols that 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.660
 You can also take two 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.760
 machine guns but for a short time now 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.100
 that you do not have extra charger what 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.260
 makes it more realistic for the only weapon that 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.300
 you have unlimited ammo these two 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.840
 pistols which you can change to 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.310
 long game with side quests 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.810
 apart from that he has body fights to 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.150
 body here it gets more interesting 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.910
 because you're a brother of a black ribbon 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.950
 of kung fu xd so if you get some 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.950
 rapist, you can fuck him 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.080
 another thing is the management of the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.330
 cars is not bad but if you 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.980
 shoot in a tire you fucked up already 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.110
 that reduces considerably 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.730
 speed but you can repair it by giving 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.280
 some reward points 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.500
 here you do not use money but those points 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.830
 that you get when you capture criminals pass 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.299
 missions and all those blowjobs of the game 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.159
 Well, what I like also is that if 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.170
 you do not want to do any mission there 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.239
 moments when you can spend catching 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.239
 criminals in the city you can solve 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.610
 crimes like street fights fights 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.700
 conjugal here you break the mother to two 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.860
 spouses x of assaults situations of 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.290
 hostages shootings clandestine careers 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.230
 and another crime verb is that I already 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.569
 I got bored of writing there the game has 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.150
 a great variety of music its genres 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.940
 they are divided into loud soft music and I think 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.099
 that management x of the best that has 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.680
 this game is the final three if they have 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.269
 listened well to three endings which 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.819
 you unlock depending on how 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.170
 good you are if you are a shit like this will be 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.329
 the end of the game 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.030
 if you are medium the end will not be so bad 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.489
 if you are the host so exciting and 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.100
 difficult will be the end of the game there is 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.830
 different types of shooting missions 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.610
 time trial chases solve 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.919
 crimes 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.259
 melee fights and infiltrations 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.150
 they are to go somewhere 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.129
 without anyone noticing leaving 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.639
 unconscious or killing those who 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:40.139
 see as well as if you were a ninja xd 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.090
 apart from that if you fail a mission in 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.639
 chances give you alternative missions 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.469
 to follow the course of history 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.750
 another thing that you have is your detour from the 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:51.539
 many will say what the fuck does 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.610
 a zombie in a police game but the 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.409
 game in that consists near the end 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.569
 there is a mission where you have to 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.879
 grab you to hosts with a zombie other 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.860
 where you must kill some with weapons other 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.620
 where you face the demons I do not know 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.870
 why else where you face in combat 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.060
 two whores that teleport and the 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.689
 last and strangest where you must kill 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.729
 a fucking dragon culero xddddd I do not know what 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.960
 those of activision were smoked but if it was 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.910
 moca was the grandmother xd 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.110
 This game is not for fanboys that 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.630
 they cheat the lives of the players 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.639
 saying that the game is pure shit for 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.400
 be a sandbox and have more unreal things 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.530
 that sabrina xd breasts for 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.270
 finish the game has an extra where 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.340
 if you get some dog bones 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.590
 golden or enter a key you can 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.240
 play for an hour with snoop dogg no 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.210
 I know why but it's not bad at all 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.310
 way in conclusion the game is very 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.199
 good for the pc the only bad thing is the 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.259
 weight since it weighs 2 gigas 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.430
 but the requirements are not many 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.039
 well that has been all on my part 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.050
 I hope you liked it, do not forget 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.449
 comment this video and I like that

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.039
