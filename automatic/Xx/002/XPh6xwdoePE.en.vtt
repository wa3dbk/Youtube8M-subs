have a look at this bring the dinner

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.590 
have a look at this bring the dinner
fork<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.679> near<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.340> tennis<00:00:32.640> ball<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.480> you'll

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
fork up near the tennis ball and you'll

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.330 
fork up near the tennis ball and you'll
find<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.380> close<00:00:34.590> enough<00:00:34.770> yes

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
find that if you get it close enough yes

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370 
find that if you get it close enough yes
the<00:00:35.640> tennis<00:00:35.940> ball<00:00:36.120> starts<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> roll<00:00:36.899> towards

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the tennis ball starts to roll towards

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
the tennis ball starts to roll towards
the<00:00:37.500> fall<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.309> bring<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> fork<00:00:38.790> back<00:00:38.940> towards

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the fall so bring the fork back towards

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
the fall so bring the fork back towards
yourself<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.050> tennis<00:00:40.350> ball<00:00:40.559> keeps

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
yourself and the tennis ball keeps

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.970 
yourself and the tennis ball keeps
rolling<00:00:42.059> isn't<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.540> amazing<00:00:43.140> now<00:00:43.829> you're

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
rolling isn't that amazing now you're

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.500 
rolling isn't that amazing now you're
probably<00:00:44.190> saying<00:00:44.399> yourself<00:00:44.730> would<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.300> work

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
probably saying yourself would it work

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.600 
probably saying yourself would it work
with<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.320> handle<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.920> fork<00:00:47.160> let's<00:00:47.399> try

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
with the handle of the fork let's try

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.189 
with the handle of the fork let's try
that<00:00:49.399> bring<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.520> near<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.700> ball<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.270> yes

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
that bring it near the ball and yes

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
that bring it near the ball and yes
still<00:00:52.530> works<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.460> fact<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
still works in fact I think I can get it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.299 
still works in fact I think I can get it
to<00:00:54.480> work<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.780> my<00:00:54.930> fingers<00:00:55.289> only<00:00:56.570> here<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.690> go

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
to work with my fingers only here we go

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.160 
to work with my fingers only here we go
yes<00:00:59.309> coming<00:00:59.940> towards<00:01:00.270> me<00:01:00.390> coming<00:01:00.750> towards<00:01:01.050> me

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
yes coming towards me coming towards me

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.920 
yes coming towards me coming towards me
and<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.859> stop<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.250> whenever<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.579> want<00:01:02.930> you're

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and I can stop it whenever I want you're

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.929 
and I can stop it whenever I want you're
probably<00:01:04.170> saying<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:05.189> must<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.610> something

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
probably saying there must be something

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
probably saying there must be something
attached<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> ball<00:01:06.720> there<00:01:07.140> isn't<00:01:07.290> look<00:01:07.710> at

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
attached to the ball there isn't look at

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.920 
attached to the ball there isn't look at
that<00:01:07.950> ordinary<00:01:08.670> tennis<00:01:08.939> ball<00:01:09.150> nothing

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
have a look at this there it is a

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.060 
have a look at this there it is a
curtain<00:01:44.579> ring<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:46.049> happening<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.710> I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
curtain ring so what was happening is I

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.219 
curtain ring so what was happening is I
was<00:01:47.399> moving<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.820> foot<00:01:48.000> away<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:49.079> was

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
