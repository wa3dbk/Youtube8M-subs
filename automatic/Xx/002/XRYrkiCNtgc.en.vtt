and<00:00:37.910> essentially<00:00:38.690> go<00:00:38.900> home<00:00:39.140> thinking<00:00:39.530> that

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
and essentially go home thinking that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.319 
and essentially go home thinking that

10,000 cases through a year which is a
really<00:00:51.890> high<00:00:52.160> volume<00:00:52.670> we<00:00:52.970> have<00:00:53.210> one<00:00:53.570> floor

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
really high volume we have one floor

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.229 
really high volume we have one floor
where<00:00:54.170> we<00:00:54.320> do<00:00:54.440> surgical<00:00:54.710> cases<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.120> the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
where we do surgical cases so the

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.630 
where we do surgical cases so the
patients<00:00:56.630> are<00:00:56.720> able<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:57.050> enter<00:00:57.410> on<00:00:57.620> one<00:00:58.340> floor

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
patients are able to enter on one floor

patients are able to enter on one floor
go<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.480> pre-op<00:00:59.780> better<00:01:00.110> surgery<00:01:00.530> go<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.770> pack

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
go to pre-op better surgery go to pack

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.860 
go to pre-op better surgery go to pack
you<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.489> be<00:01:01.640> discharged<00:01:02.149> all<00:01:02.390> in<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.660> same

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.179 
you and be discharged all in the same
area<00:01:03.079> so<00:01:03.410> we<00:01:03.530> get<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.710> great<00:01:03.980> deal<00:01:04.159> of

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
area so we get a great deal of

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.270 
area so we get a great deal of
efficiency<00:01:04.939> by<00:01:05.089> that<00:01:05.420> for<00:01:05.810> me<00:01:05.899> to<00:01:06.020> do<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.069> same

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
efficiency by that for me to do the same

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.129 
efficiency by that for me to do the same
number<00:01:07.520> of<00:01:07.670> cases<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.359> less<00:01:08.509> hours<00:01:08.929> is<00:01:09.109> more

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:09.139 
number of cases and less hours is more

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:11.379 
number of cases and less hours is more
efficient<00:01:09.679> on<00:01:09.770> my<00:01:09.920> time<00:01:10.189> it's<00:01:10.909> also<00:01:11.119> more

what we the gains that we could make on

what we the gains that we could make on
a<00:04:41.450> financial<00:04:42.020> but<00:04:42.169> also<00:04:42.320> much<00:04:42.710> more<00:04:42.740> on<00:04:43.040> the

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
quality side of it it just made more

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.530 
quality side of it it just made more
sense<00:04:45.229> to<00:04:45.710> go<00:04:45.889> striker<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.610> believe<00:04:47.120> also<00:04:47.330> that

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
sense to go striker I believe also that

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.000 
sense to go striker I believe also that
one<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> things<00:04:48.260> about<00:04:48.440> these<00:04:48.830> new

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
one of the things about these new

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.640 
one of the things about these new
systems<00:04:49.220> with<00:04:50.180> striker<00:04:50.540> is<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.990> ability<00:04:51.169> to

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
systems with striker is the ability to

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.890 
systems with striker is the ability to
bring<00:04:52.370> in<00:04:52.490> new<00:04:52.639> modules<00:04:53.150> so<00:04:53.389> as<00:04:53.540> things<00:04:53.720> are

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
bring in new modules so as things are

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.960 
bring in new modules so as things are
coming<00:04:54.139> on<00:04:54.320> long<00:04:54.590> in<00:04:54.950> the<00:04:55.130> future<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.700> allows

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
coming on long in the future it allows

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.780 
coming on long in the future it allows

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
us to do more things it makes surgery a

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.640 
us to do more things it makes surgery a

lot easier for a surgeon and you have a

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.129 
lot easier for a surgeon and you have a
tendency<00:05:18.889> to<00:05:19.130> do<00:05:19.370> more<00:05:19.580> things<00:05:19.639> than<00:05:20.240> that<00:05:20.960> you

tendency to do more things than that you

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.680 
tendency to do more things than that you
would<00:05:21.350> in<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.560> past<00:05:21.889> to<00:05:22.700> make<00:05:22.910> it<00:05:23.060> easier<00:05:23.450> for

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
would in the past to make it easier for

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.600 
would in the past to make it easier for
the<00:05:23.780> patient<00:05:23.990> yesterday<00:05:24.710> I<00:05:24.740> had<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.100> physician

the patient yesterday I had a physician

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.370 
the patient yesterday I had a physician
come<00:05:25.850> into<00:05:26.150> my<00:05:26.270> office<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.840> he<00:05:27.050> was<00:05:27.200> talking

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
come into my office and he was talking

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.529 
come into my office and he was talking
to<00:05:27.710> me<00:05:27.800> about<00:05:27.830> an<00:05:28.370> endoscopic<00:05:28.880> procedure<00:05:29.330> he

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
to me about an endoscopic procedure he

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.779 
to me about an endoscopic procedure he
does<00:05:29.690> it<00:05:29.840> another<00:05:30.110> facility<00:05:30.500> he<00:05:31.340> was<00:05:31.460> telling

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
does it another facility he was telling

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
me about how difficult it was to get it

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.370 
me about how difficult it was to get it
done<00:05:34.010> how<00:05:34.430> it<00:05:35.060> was<00:05:35.180> an<00:05:35.330> older<00:05:35.600> facility<00:05:36.139> he

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380
