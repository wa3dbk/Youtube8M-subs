00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
way let's take a closer look at the case

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.450 
way let's take a closer look at the case
itself<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:40.379> case<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.770> composed<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> two

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
itself this case is composed of two

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
itself this case is composed of two
different<00:00:41.760> materials<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> has<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> hard<00:00:42.989> outer

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
different materials it has a hard outer

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.740 
different materials it has a hard outer
shell<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> inside<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.149> soft<00:00:45.420> rubber

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.290 
shell and on the inside is a soft rubber
material<00:00:46.469> now<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> soft<00:00:47.399> rubber<00:00:47.550> material<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
material now the soft rubber material is

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000 
material now the soft rubber material is
going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> help<00:00:48.989> with<00:00:49.140> any<00:00:49.289> type<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.800> fall

damage so it is going to absorb that

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.779 
damage so it is going to absorb that
shock<00:00:51.930> now<00:00:52.739> when<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.949> comes<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> installation

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
shock now when it comes to installation

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and the only problem I did have with

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.570 
and the only problem I did have with
installed<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.110> case<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.340> two

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580

installed in this case there is the two
flaps<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.119> bottom<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.200> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
flaps on the bottom you just have to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
flaps on the bottom you just have to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and then pretty much this closed arm up

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.130 
and then pretty much this closed arm up
and<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.460> case<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.909> installed<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.990> case

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
and the case is installed so this case

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.810 
and the case is installed so this case
will<00:01:19.350> protect<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.799> phone<00:01:19.890> against<00:01:20.220> dust<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
dirt so it has a flat for the headphone

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990 
dirt so it has a flat for the headphone
jack<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.770> well<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> power<00:01:23.369> port<00:01:23.729> and
