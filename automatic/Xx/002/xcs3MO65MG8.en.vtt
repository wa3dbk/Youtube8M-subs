touches more modern iPod touches you

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.700 
touches more modern iPod touches you
need<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> double<00:00:12.690> check<00:00:12.900> your<00:00:13.080> hardware<00:00:13.259> specs

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
need to double check your hardware specs

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.560 
need to double check your hardware specs
but<00:00:13.980> I've<00:00:14.519> been<00:00:14.759> plugging<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.150> into<00:00:15.360> an

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
but I've been plugging this into an

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.630 
but I've been plugging this into an
iPhone<00:00:15.660> 4s<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.920> been<00:00:17.100> working<00:00:17.310> up<00:00:17.520> to

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
iPhone 4s and it's been working up to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.450 
iPhone 4s and it's been working up to
you<00:00:17.730> fantastically<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:19.260> control<00:00:19.890> pad<00:00:20.130> it's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
you fantastically this control pad it's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.580 
you fantastically this control pad it's
pretty<00:00:21.210> light<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:22.050> that's<00:00:22.140> partly<00:00:22.529> because

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
pretty light but that's partly because

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.840 
pretty light but that's partly because
there's<00:00:22.859> no<00:00:22.949> batteries<00:00:23.340> including<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
there's no batteries including the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.370 
there's no batteries including the
reason<00:00:24.119> why<00:00:24.240> there's<00:00:24.449> no<00:00:24.480> batteries<00:00:24.930> included

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
reason why there's no batteries included

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.929 
reason why there's no batteries included
because<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.650> doesn't<00:00:25.890> need<00:00:25.980> any<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.730> gets

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
because it doesn't need any it gets

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.000 
because it doesn't need any it gets
enough<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> power<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.990> signals<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.710> needs

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
enough of a power and signals it needs

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.580 
enough of a power and signals it needs
through<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> audio<00:00:30.480> jack<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.230> literally

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
through the audio jack so this literally

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.850 
through the audio jack so this literally
plugs<00:00:31.949> into<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.460> headphone<00:00:32.489> socket<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.300> your

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
plugs into the headphone socket of your

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.130 
plugs into the headphone socket of your
iPad<00:00:34.860> or<00:00:34.920> iPhone<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.790> us<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.690> gets<00:00:36.899> all

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
iPad or iPhone for us and it gets all

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.660 
iPad or iPhone for us and it gets all
the<00:00:37.469> comparator<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.780> control<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.500> this

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
the comparator to control and use this

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.030 
the comparator to control and use this
very<00:00:41.670> neat<00:00:41.879> little<00:00:42.200> gamepad<00:00:43.200> I've<00:00:43.649> got<00:00:43.860> quite

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
what I've certainly found is it's very

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.730 
what I've certainly found is it's very

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
responsive with the joystick controls

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.340 
responsive with the joystick controls
and<00:02:33.300> immediately<00:02:34.300> works<00:02:34.570> it's<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.990> fully

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
and immediately works it's a fully

and immediately works it's a fully
featured<00:02:35.680> controller<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:37.290> certainly<00:02:38.290> easier

featured controller and certainly easier

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.740

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
like the iPhone so I've only been use

then you're actually able to fly your
drone<00:03:10.330> using<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.260> thumbsticks<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:11.970> that's<00:03:12.970> a

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
pretty responsive and quite a nice way

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.000 
pretty responsive and quite a nice way
of<00:03:15.250> controlling<00:03:16.209> your<00:03:16.420> AR<00:03:17.200> drone<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.680> much

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
of controlling your AR drone is much

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.990 
of controlling your AR drone is much
more<00:03:18.310> like<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:20.040> controller<00:03:21.040> you'd<00:03:21.580> get<00:03:21.820> for<00:03:21.970> a

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
more like a controller you'd get for a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.880 
more like a controller you'd get for a
normal<00:03:22.269> remote<00:03:22.630> controlled<00:03:22.959> helicopter

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
gamepad suddenly do that they do that

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.979 
gamepad suddenly do that they do that
well<00:03:45.160> both<00:03:45.519> with<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.820> IAR<00:03:46.420> drone<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.870> they

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
well both with the IAR drone and they

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.390 
well both with the IAR drone and they
also<00:03:47.140> do<00:03:47.350> that<00:03:47.530> well<00:03:47.709> in<00:03:47.860> some<00:03:48.100> of<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.220> games

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
also do that well in some of the games

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.039 
also do that well in some of the games
but<00:03:48.940> say<00:03:49.150> there<00:03:49.360> aren't<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.600> many<00:03:49.660> games

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
but say there aren't that many games

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.420 
but say there aren't that many games
supported<00:03:50.590> yeah<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.830> hope<00:03:51.010> that's<00:03:51.220> going<00:03:51.340> to

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
supported yeah I hope that's going to

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.670 
supported yeah I hope that's going to
grow<00:03:51.610> it's<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.420> it's<00:03:52.870> not<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.230> main<00:03:53.350> reason<00:03:53.380> why

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
grow it's a it's not the main reason why

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.160 
grow it's a it's not the main reason why
I<00:03:53.709> bought<00:03:53.920> this<00:03:54.100> but<00:03:54.340> it's<00:03:54.459> certainly<00:03:55.170> that

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
I bought this but it's certainly that

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.720 
I bought this but it's certainly that
demonstrates<00:03:56.799> how<00:03:57.040> good<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:57.459> is

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
demonstrates how good this is

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.390 
demonstrates how good this is
and<00:03:57.959> there<00:03:58.959> are<00:03:59.110> perhaps<00:03:59.500> three<00:03:59.920> or<00:03:59.980> four<00:04:00.220> them

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
and there are perhaps three or four them

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.190 
and there are perhaps three or four them

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
you can you can get a general feel for

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.820 
you can you can get a general feel for
the<00:04:04.090> kind<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.299> quality<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.870> game<00:04:05.049> etc<00:04:05.680> but

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
the kind of quality of the game etc but

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.340 
the kind of quality of the game etc but
the<00:04:06.489> one<00:04:06.700> I'm<00:04:06.940> sort<00:04:07.269> of<00:04:07.299> recommending<00:04:08.170> at<00:04:08.260> the
