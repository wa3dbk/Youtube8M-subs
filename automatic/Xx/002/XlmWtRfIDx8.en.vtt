Victoria<00:03:33.890> is<00:03:34.100> just<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.880> little<00:03:35.090> bit<00:03:35.180> better

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
Victoria is just a little bit better

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.670 
Victoria is just a little bit better
well<00:03:36.560> this<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.390> well-used<00:03:38.920> 1948<00:03:39.920> Gibson<00:03:40.820> l12

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
well this is a well-used 1948 Gibson l12

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.140 
well this is a well-used 1948 Gibson l12
basically<00:03:43.720> falls<00:03:44.720> between<00:03:45.160> l7<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:46.280> l5<00:03:46.730> it

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
basically falls between l7 and l5 it

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.290 
basically falls between l7 and l5 it
made<00:03:47.300> far<00:03:47.660> fewer<00:03:48.080> l12<00:03:48.980> than<00:03:49.700> either<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.180> those

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
made far fewer l12 than either of those

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.800 
made far fewer l12 than either of those
other<00:03:50.540> models<00:03:50.990> and<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:53.210> difference<00:03:53.600> between

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
other models and the difference between

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.780 
other models and the difference between
this<00:03:54.350> it's<00:03:54.740> basically<00:03:55.160> an<00:03:55.430> l5<00:03:55.940> with<00:03:56.840> less

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
this it's basically an l5 with less

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.350 
this it's basically an l5 with less
ornamentation

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.310 

but<00:04:02.050> it<00:04:02.140> looks<00:04:02.410> in<00:04:03.250> appearance<00:04:04.080> more<00:04:05.080> like<00:04:05.290> a

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
but it looks in appearance more like a

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.590 
but it looks in appearance more like a
mental<00:04:05.710> seven<00:04:06.400> but<00:04:06.820> it's<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:07.030> little<00:04:07.210> bit<00:04:07.330> I

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
mental seven but it's a little bit I

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.730 
mental seven but it's a little bit I
think<00:04:07.980> lighter<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.850> carving<00:04:10.300> and<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:11.530> also

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
think lighter in the carving and I also

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.130 
think lighter in the carving and I also
have<00:04:12.070> several<00:04:13.060> other<00:04:13.330> 48<00:04:15.299> Gibson<00:04:16.299> guitars<00:04:16.630> but
