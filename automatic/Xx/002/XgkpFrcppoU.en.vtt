00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.910
 enrique enríquez the storms with 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.190
 thunder are somewhat noisy but you know that 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.600
 they are good not a bus and what is 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.989
 good from a storm with thunder 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.960
 virtual generally calm quiet 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.199

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.059
 I think I have an idea 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.040
 every time a lightning comes I go to 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.159
 think that that deals with your camera 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.800
 flash and so you will not be afraid 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.750
