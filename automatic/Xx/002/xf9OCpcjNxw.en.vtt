00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
no problem this is no problem on a scale

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.000 
no problem this is no problem on a scale
of<00:02:17.000> one<00:02:17.299> to<00:02:17.330> ten<00:02:17.659> the<00:02:17.810> Heat<00:02:18.019> are<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.260> 10<00:02:18.799> right

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
of one to ten the Heat are a 10 right

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.580 
of one to ten the Heat are a 10 right
now<00:02:19.069> as<00:02:19.340> far<00:02:19.400> as<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.780> reason<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.379> there's

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
now as far as the reason is there's

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.199 
now as far as the reason is there's
three<00:02:21.799> things<00:02:21.980> number<00:02:22.280> one<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.670> matchups

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
three things number one the matchups

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.210 
three things number one the matchups
they<00:02:23.750> got<00:02:23.900> nobody<00:02:24.140> can<00:02:24.409> guard<00:02:24.620> Derek<00:02:24.980> rules

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
they got nobody can guard Derek rules

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.830 
they got nobody can guard Derek rules
the<00:02:25.519> point<00:02:25.760> guard<00:02:25.970> position<00:02:26.030> for<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.569> Miami

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
the point guard position for the Miami

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.110 
the point guard position for the Miami
Heat<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.319> very<00:02:27.739> bad<00:02:27.980> there's<00:02:28.579> nobody<00:02:28.909> that<00:02:29.090> can

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
Heat is very bad there's nobody that can

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.149 
Heat is very bad there's nobody that can
guard<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.780> with<00:02:29.930> their<00:02:30.079> bigs<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:30.530> Joakim<00:02:30.950> nor

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
guard it with their bigs and Joakim nor

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.979 
guard it with their bigs and Joakim nor
and<00:02:31.400> Boozer<00:02:31.610> down<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.030> middle<00:02:32.269> really<00:02:32.420> yeah<00:02:32.959> I

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
and Boozer down the middle really yeah I

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.809 
and Boozer down the middle really yeah I
think<00:02:33.349> Boozer<00:02:33.799> and<00:02:33.829> Karl<00:02:34.159> and<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.610> Bosh

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
think Boozer and Karl and and Bosh

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.180 
think Boozer and Karl and and Bosh
pretty<00:02:35.180> much<00:02:35.379> eliminate<00:02:36.379> each<00:02:36.500> other<00:02:36.709> the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
pretty much eliminate each other the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.640 
pretty much eliminate each other the
second<00:02:37.579> reason<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.970> defense<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:39.019> deep<00:02:39.290> isn't

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
second reason is defense that deep isn't

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.680 
second reason is defense that deep isn't
going<00:02:39.920> away<00:02:40.010> okay<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:41.060> way<00:02:41.180> Taj<00:02:41.450> Gibson

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
going away okay the way Taj Gibson

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.910 
going away okay the way Taj Gibson
played<00:02:42.019> offense<00:02:42.379> to<00:02:42.440> weight<00:02:42.590> Luol<00:02:42.890> Deng

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
played offense to weight Luol Deng

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.069 
played offense to weight Luol Deng
played<00:02:43.310> offense<00:02:43.609> last<00:02:43.730> night<00:02:43.970> maybe<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.930> might

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
played offense last night maybe it might

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.330 
played offense last night maybe it might
have<00:02:45.230> been<00:02:45.319> a<00:02:45.349> bad<00:02:45.590> night<00:02:45.799> for<00:02:45.829> money<00:02:46.129> but

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
have been a bad night for money but

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.559 
have been a bad night for money but
they're<00:02:46.489> still<00:02:46.730> going<00:02:46.879> to<00:02:46.909> get<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.269> same

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
they're still going to get that same

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.809 
they're still going to get that same
defensive<00:02:48.230> intensity<00:02:48.440> from<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> Chicago

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
defensive intensity from the Chicago

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.690 
defensive intensity from the Chicago
Bulls<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.269> last<00:02:50.569> big<00:02:50.840> reason<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.349> is

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
Bulls and the last big reason is is

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.309 
Bulls and the last big reason is is
Thibodeau<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.209> head<00:02:53.420> coach<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:54.139> the<00:02:54.290> Chicago

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
Thibodeau the head coach of the Chicago

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.039 
Thibodeau the head coach of the Chicago
Bulls<00:02:54.859> has<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:55.909> blueprint<00:02:56.540> how<00:02:56.659> to<00:02:56.720> stop

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
Eastern Conference over the last couple

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.360 
Eastern Conference over the last couple
of<00:03:04.700> years<00:03:04.970> him<00:03:05.720> constantly<00:03:06.680> applying<00:03:07.159> that

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
of years him constantly applying that

not<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.019> let<00:03:09.139> up<00:03:09.349> I<00:03:09.500> think<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.190> Miami<00:03:10.489> Heat<00:03:10.700> are

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
not to let up I think the Miami Heat are

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.990 
not to let up I think the Miami Heat are
in<00:03:11.000> bad<00:03:11.450> bad<00:03:12.019> shape<00:03:12.220> right<00:03:13.220> now<00:03:13.370> something

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
in bad bad shape right now something

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.460 
in bad bad shape right now something
that<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.359> he'd<00:03:14.540> do<00:03:14.690> extremely<00:03:15.019> well<00:03:15.139> is<00:03:15.379> they

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
that the he'd do extremely well is they

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.649 
that the he'd do extremely well is they
take<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.769> ball<00:03:15.950> inside<00:03:16.280> they<00:03:17.030> stop<00:03:17.359> doing

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
take the ball inside they stop doing

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.030 
take the ball inside they stop doing
that<00:03:17.780> yesterday<00:03:17.989> they<00:03:18.290> settle<00:03:18.620> for<00:03:18.709> several

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
that yesterday they settle for several

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.500 
that yesterday they settle for several
jump<00:03:19.340> shots<00:03:19.579> instead<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.060> trying<00:03:20.449> to

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
jump shots instead of trying to

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.330 
jump shots instead of trying to
penetrate<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.989> get<00:03:21.109> into<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.379> paint<00:03:21.590> what

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
penetrate and get into the paint what

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.500 
penetrate and get into the paint what
happened<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.879> mean<00:03:23.030> not<00:03:23.209> only<00:03:23.329> were<00:03:23.419> they

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
happened I mean not only were they

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.300 
happened I mean not only were they
lackluster<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:24.199> they<00:03:24.470> gave<00:03:24.769> up<00:03:25.040> when<00:03:25.220> it

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
lackluster but they gave up when it

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.920 
lackluster but they gave up when it
comes<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.579> going<00:03:25.760> inside<00:03:26.120> which<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.660> something

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
comes to going inside which is something

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.930 
comes to going inside which is something
that<00:03:27.049> they<00:03:27.139> do<00:03:27.319> go<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:27.889> the<00:03:28.099> foul<00:03:28.310> line<00:03:28.340> get<00:03:28.819> to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
that they do go to the foul line get to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.250 
that they do go to the foul line get to
the<00:03:29.030> foul<00:03:29.209> line<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:32.419> lanes<00:03:32.690> weren't<00:03:33.049> there

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
the foul line the lanes weren't there

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.379 
the foul line the lanes weren't there
they<00:03:33.560> were<00:03:33.859> flashing<00:03:34.400> down<00:03:34.609> so<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
they were flashing down so the

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.569 
they were flashing down so the
penetration<00:03:35.900> by<00:03:36.319> LeBron<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.069> Dwayne<00:03:37.129> Wade

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
penetration by LeBron and Dwayne Wade

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.640 
penetration by LeBron and Dwayne Wade
was<00:03:37.849> kind<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.150> affected<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.599> little<00:03:38.690> bit<00:03:38.930> and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
was kind of affected a little bit and

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.439 
was kind of affected a little bit and
what<00:03:39.829> you<00:03:39.949> saw<00:03:40.129> a<00:03:40.160> lot<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.459> in<00:03:40.819> which<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.239> have

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
what you saw a lot of in which you have

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:42.879 
what you saw a lot of in which you have
seen<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.780> lot<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.019> historically<00:03:42.560> over<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.739> last

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
seen a lot of historically over the last

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.099 
seen a lot of historically over the last
couple<00:03:43.069> of<00:03:43.190> years<00:03:43.430> as<00:03:43.609> isolation<00:03:44.569> basketball

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
couple of years as isolation basketball

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.960 
couple of years as isolation basketball
by<00:03:45.290> LeBron<00:03:45.620> James<00:03:45.949> and<00:03:46.250> Dwyane<00:03:46.280> Wade<00:03:46.730> and

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
by LeBron James and Dwyane Wade and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.369 
by LeBron James and Dwyane Wade and
that's<00:03:47.510> what<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.780> seems<00:03:47.959> like<00:03:48.019> they<00:03:48.199> didn't

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
that's what it seems like they didn't

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.539 
that's what it seems like they didn't
run<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.530> lot<00:03:48.709> of<00:03:48.739> plays<00:03:48.859> it<00:03:49.099> just<00:03:49.129> seems<00:03:49.430> like

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
run a lot of plays it just seems like

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.159 
run a lot of plays it just seems like
they<00:03:49.669> tried<00:03:49.849> to<00:03:49.940> go<00:03:50.060> one-on-one<00:03:50.299> you<00:03:50.810> know<00:03:50.989> and

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
they tried to go one-on-one you know and

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.300 
they tried to go one-on-one you know and
I<00:03:51.230> know<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.440> they<00:03:51.620> scared<00:03:51.919> to<00:03:52.010> getting<00:03:52.220> from

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
I know that they scared to getting from

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.699 
I know that they scared to getting from
