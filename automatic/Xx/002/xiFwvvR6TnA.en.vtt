00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.750
 new video this time have a boxing 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.880
 it had been a long time since he brought 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.410
 they just sent me a package a piece 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.509
 the big grass computer package 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.400
 games I teach you the guys I left was the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.230
 that they will sponsor me from 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.750
 now sponsor a lot of teams 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.270
 of competitive Americans and everything and it's 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.400
 an energy drink that they sent me 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.080
 a sample so you will try it before 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.449
 that nothing and I liked quite then 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.429
 I did not accept, because I'm not going to 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.790
 teach a product that is bad or is 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.980
 wrong or not then that's what I was 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.739
 drinking right now some are about 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.989
 powders that you throw the cold water and already 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.329
 does not move if you have the shake is a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.190
 energy drink because that helps you 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 to not lose concentration we 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 We take many hours when you do 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.070
 it also encourages you sport pretty 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.289
 not after the laces and that you do not 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.030
 take them away because I started last week 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.399

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.980

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.840
