00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.100
Yes, I liked this Swift..

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.010
but now it's time..

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.630
Time to blow the engine

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.059
And that's up to you, it's not so hard, I will explain it.. You're going to sit in it, start it and keep the pedal to the metal.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.059
and smile

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.300

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.410
You're a pro I see... that was a quick one.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.440
Nice..

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.750
Now it's seized up..

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.580
Try to crank it!

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.740
Try it, see if it starts..

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.740
Nooo.. it's dead... You killed it!

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.180
and it was such a reliable car...

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.420
It was so nice.. allright, you wanted to go sweeping I believe..

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.160
Damned... ungratefull

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.240
we also gave something away..

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.870
He really hates this car..

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.840
The pieces came till here..

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.780
Allright... what do you think of that?

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.380
It's a nice farewell
I didn't repair that wipkar for noting..

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.920

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.920
You have to challenge it too!

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:34.859
The goes a loudspeaker..

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.519
Never unsatisfied passengers!

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.999
Let's see how this Ka can take a beating!
