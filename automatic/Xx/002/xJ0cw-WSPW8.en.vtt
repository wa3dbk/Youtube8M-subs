okay as you can see it's pretty bouncy

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.430 
okay as you can see it's pretty bouncy
and<00:05:28.510> you<00:05:29.510> really<00:05:29.750> don't<00:05:29.870> have<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.139> do<00:05:30.290> much

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
and you really don't have to do much

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.409 
and you really don't have to do much
work<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.949> it<00:05:31.100> after<00:05:31.520> we<00:05:31.699> do<00:05:32.000> this

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
work to it after we do this

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.670

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
so you can see it's pretty much

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.920 
so you can see it's pretty much
straighten<00:06:18.280> it's<00:06:18.610> not<00:06:18.850> really<00:06:19.300> like<00:06:19.810> you

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
straighten it's not really like you

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.330 
straighten it's not really like you
really<00:06:19.960> don't<00:06:20.230> have<00:06:20.290> to<00:06:20.380> do<00:06:20.500> much<00:06:20.680> to<00:06:20.740> it<00:06:21.130> but

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
really don't have to do much to it but

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.980 
really don't have to do much to it but
it's<00:06:21.610> really<00:06:22.000> at<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.270> same<00:06:22.450> time<00:06:22.690> it<00:06:22.870> has<00:06:22.960> a

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
it's really at the same time it has a

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.650 
it's really at the same time it has a
lot<00:06:23.260> of<00:06:23.380> volume<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:23.800> it<00:06:24.220> feels<00:06:25.150> really<00:06:25.300> light

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
lot of volume to it feels really light

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.410

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:40.820 
I do have a lot of flyaways because I

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.640 
I do have a lot of flyaways because I
blew<00:07:41.000> dry<00:07:41.180> it<00:07:41.240> up<00:07:41.389> so<00:07:41.720> what<00:07:41.840> I'd<00:07:41.930> usually<00:07:42.229> do<00:07:42.530> is

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.650 
blew dry it up so what I'd usually do is

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.230 
blew dry it up so what I'd usually do is
just<00:07:42.830> like<00:07:43.010> spritz<00:07:43.729> a<00:07:43.820> little<00:07:44.030> bit<00:07:44.150> of

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 
just like spritz a little bit of

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.790 
just like spritz a little bit of
hairspray<00:07:44.389> and<00:07:44.870> kind<00:07:45.080> of<00:07:45.139> run<00:07:45.290> my<00:07:45.440> hands

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 
hairspray and kind of run my hands

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.070 
hairspray and kind of run my hands
through<00:07:45.860> it<00:07:46.220> to<00:07:46.490> kind<00:07:46.729> of<00:07:46.760> get<00:07:46.910> them<00:07:47.000> down<00:07:47.150> it

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 
through it to kind of get them down it

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.680 
through it to kind of get them down it
usually<00:07:48.440> works<00:07:50.680> so<00:07:51.680> that's<00:07:52.190> it<00:07:52.580> I<00:07:52.820> hope<00:07:53.540> you
