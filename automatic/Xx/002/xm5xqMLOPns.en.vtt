00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
I got some big pens they're really good

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.099 
I got some big pens they're really good
they<00:00:19.310> last<00:00:19.580> long<00:00:19.849> normally<00:00:20.720> you<00:00:20.810> buy<00:00:20.929> those

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
they last long normally you buy those

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.349 
they last long normally you buy those
expensive<00:00:21.679> pins<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.220> they<00:00:22.789> don't<00:00:22.910> last<00:00:23.089> long

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
expensive pins and they don't last long

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.120 
expensive pins and they don't last long
at<00:00:23.509> all<00:00:23.599> but<00:00:23.839> those<00:00:23.990> really<00:00:24.320> do<00:00:24.439> last<00:00:24.679> long<00:00:24.920> and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
at all but those really do last long and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.870 
at all but those really do last long and
then<00:00:25.490> I<00:00:25.519> got<00:00:26.529> some<00:00:27.529> big<00:00:27.769> mechanical<00:00:28.160> pencils<00:00:28.730> I

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
then I got some big mechanical pencils I

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.720 
then I got some big mechanical pencils I
like<00:00:29.089> these<00:00:29.300> because<00:00:29.929> the<00:00:30.349> lead<00:00:30.560> size<00:00:31.429> is<00:00:31.699> a

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
like these because the lead size is a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.630 
like these because the lead size is a
lot<00:00:31.999> smaller<00:00:32.270> than<00:00:32.539> the<00:00:32.750> normal<00:00:33.050> ones<00:00:33.460> or<00:00:34.460> they

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
lot smaller than the normal ones or they

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.920 
lot smaller than the normal ones or they
have<00:00:34.820> these<00:00:34.940> other<00:00:35.149> ones<00:00:35.360> with<00:00:35.539> really<00:00:35.809> big

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
have these other ones with really big

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.139 
have these other ones with really big
lead<00:00:36.200> and<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:36.559> hate<00:00:36.920> them<00:00:37.070> because<00:00:37.309> it<00:00:37.969> makes

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
lead and I hate them because it makes

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.580 
lead and I hate them because it makes
your<00:00:38.270> handwriting<00:00:38.750> really<00:00:38.930> sloppy<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:39.410> gross

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
your handwriting really sloppy and gross

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.470

looking<00:00:39.920> but<00:00:40.399> with<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.670> thin<00:00:40.820> ones<00:00:41.059> your

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
looking but with the thin ones your

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.330 
looking but with the thin ones your
handwriting<00:00:41.840> is<00:00:41.899> all<00:00:41.989> pretty<00:00:42.140> I<00:00:42.410> got<00:00:43.129> note

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
unless they really have to but that's

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.430 
unless they really have to but that's
the<00:00:47.420> only<00:00:47.480> reason<00:00:47.660> I<00:00:47.840> really<00:00:47.960> got<00:00:48.170> them<00:00:48.350> is

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
the only reason I really got them is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.400

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
because I have to and then i have this

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.799 
because I have to and then i have this

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
and I use it every time we have to do

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.580 
and I use it every time we have to do
flashcards<00:00:56.510> for<00:00:56.570> our<00:00:56.719> class<00:00:56.899> like<00:00:57.289> if<00:00:57.440> a

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
flashcards for our class like if a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.560 
flashcards for our class like if a
teacher<00:00:58.160> makes<00:00:58.460> us<00:00:58.699> instead<00:00:59.239> of<00:00:59.300> just<00:00:59.510> putting

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
teacher makes us instead of just putting

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.330 
teacher makes us instead of just putting
like<00:00:59.899> a<00:00:59.929> hair<00:01:00.140> tie<00:01:00.320> around<00:01:00.620> it<00:01:00.980> which<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.219> what

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
like a hair tie around it which is what

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.119 
like a hair tie around it which is what
I<00:01:01.399> normally<00:01:01.489> do<00:01:01.910> I<00:01:02.719> started<00:01:03.379> using<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:03.769> again

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
I normally do I started using this again

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.700 
I normally do I started using this again
the<00:01:04.759> this<00:01:05.119> past<00:01:05.390> year<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:06.290> really<00:01:06.530> is

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
the this past year and it really is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.060 
the this past year and it really is

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
rubber band they always tend to fall out

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.560 
rubber band they always tend to fall out
and<00:01:13.490> everything<00:01:13.850> but<00:01:14.000> if<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:14.270> put<00:01:14.420> them<00:01:14.509> in

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
and everything but if you put them in

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.899 
and everything but if you put them in
this<00:01:14.770> they<00:01:15.770> stay<00:01:15.979> nice<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:16.220> all<00:01:16.549> put<00:01:16.790> together

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
this they stay nice and all put together

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.770 
this they stay nice and all put together
so<00:01:17.509> it's<00:01:17.659> really<00:01:17.810> helpful<00:01:18.049> with<00:01:18.409> these<00:01:19.780> this

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780
