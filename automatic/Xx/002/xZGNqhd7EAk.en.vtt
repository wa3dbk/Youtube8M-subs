00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
forgiving so I'm going to whisk this

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.580 
forgiving so I'm going to whisk this
until<00:02:28.610> all<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.660> dry<00:02:30.019> ingredients<00:02:30.049> are

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
incorporated with the wet there will

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:41.970 
incorporated with the wet there will
still<00:02:33.230> be<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.590> few<00:02:34.040> lumps<00:02:34.340> left

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
the center and also around the edge of

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.509 
the center and also around the edge of
the<00:03:33.790> pancake<00:03:34.329> you<00:03:34.569> will<00:03:34.720> see<00:03:34.989> that<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.769> batter

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
the pancake you will see that the batter

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.030 
the pancake you will see that the batter
loses<00:03:37.360> its<00:03:37.569> glisten<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:38.290> kind<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.709> starts<00:03:38.950> to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
loses its glisten and kind of starts to

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.550 
loses its glisten and kind of starts to
turn<00:03:39.280> dull<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:39.970> that's<00:03:40.810> when<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.079> know<00:03:41.260> when

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.070 
starting to pop which means I can go
ahead<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:19.840> flip<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.680> just<00:04:21.810> like<00:04:22.810> that

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080
