actually<00:03:16.720> present<00:03:17.380> my<00:03:17.620> beginning<00:03:18.040> research

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
actually present my beginning research

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.270 
actually present my beginning research
at<00:03:18.870> conferences<00:03:19.870> both<00:03:20.319> here<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.980> States

and<00:03:21.700> abroad<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.569> we<00:03:22.660> take<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.900> year<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.440> this

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
and abroad so we take a year like this

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.120 
and abroad so we take a year like this
one<00:03:24.069> it's<00:03:24.819> got<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.150> real<00:03:25.480> big<00:03:25.780> fat<00:03:26.140> ring<00:03:26.470> his<00:03:26.920> own
