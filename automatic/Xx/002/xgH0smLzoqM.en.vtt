00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
me well you know as I said earlier you

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.330 
me well you know as I said earlier you
have<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.080> look<00:02:39.230> for<00:02:39.410> horses<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.920> have<00:02:39.980> proven

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
have to look for horses that have proven

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.410 
have to look for horses that have proven

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
over the distance and I think that

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.560 
over the distance and I think that
fishers<00:02:41.780> cross<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:42.709> know<00:02:42.860> proven<00:02:43.700> came

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
fishers cross you know proven came

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.690 
fishers cross you know proven came
second<00:02:44.930> in<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.080> cleve<00:02:45.290> hurdle<00:02:45.769> you<00:02:46.370> know<00:02:46.489> if

they're if the big bucks of old turns up
they're<00:02:49.310> not<00:02:49.340> seeing<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.819> win<00:02:50.030> but<00:02:50.269> but<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.780> just

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
they're not seeing a win but but I just

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.990 
they're not seeing a win but but I just
think<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.769> know<00:02:51.860> he's<00:02:52.040> his<00:02:52.459> time<00:02:52.730> might<00:02:52.970> be

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
think you know he's his time might be

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.540 
think you know he's his time might be
over<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:54.110> think<00:02:54.680> I'd<00:02:54.769> be<00:02:54.890> tempted<00:02:55.130> looking
