some food coloring into it and I use the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420 
some food coloring into it and I use the
icing<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> doesn't<00:00:52.350> send<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:52.949> my

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
icing on just so it doesn't send out my

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
icing on just so it doesn't send out my
consistency<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.149> much<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.899> always

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
consistency as much but you can always

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.920 
consistency as much but you can always
use<00:00:55.320> normal<00:00:55.739> food<00:00:55.890> coloring<00:00:56.539> next<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.780> make

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
use normal food coloring next up to make
things<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.230> lot<00:00:58.469> easier<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.920> us<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.340> terms<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
things a lot easier for us in terms of

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.610 
things a lot easier for us in terms of
pipe<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.000> into<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.480> little<00:01:00.690> shot<00:01:00.899> cups<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
pipe it into the little shot cups is to

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.429 
pipe it into the little shot cups is to
just<00:01:01.770> put<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.039> into<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.250> giant<00:01:02.430> ziploc<00:01:02.699> bag

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
just put it into a giant ziploc bag

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.450 
just put it into a giant ziploc bag
afterwards<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.769> want<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> line<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:05.339> all

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
afterwards we just want to line up all

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.130 
afterwards we just want to line up all
the<00:01:05.580> shot<00:01:05.820> cups<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.510> cut<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> hole<00:01:06.990> at<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the shot cups and then cut a hole at the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.320 
the shot cups and then cut a hole at the
end<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> ziploc<00:01:08.040> bag<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.850> continue

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
end of the ziploc bag and then continue

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.570 
end of the ziploc bag and then continue
to<00:01:09.360> pipe<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> out<00:01:10.020> now<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> little

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
to pipe it out now this can get a little

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 
to pipe it out now this can get a little
chunky<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.840> other<00:01:13.020> alternatives<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.799> my

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
chunky but the other alternatives on my

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.760 
chunky but the other alternatives on my
blog<00:01:14.250> or<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> lot<00:01:14.850> thinner<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.390> consistency<00:01:15.990> but

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
blog or a lot thinner in consistency but

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
blog or a lot thinner in consistency but
other<00:01:16.890> than<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.280> pipe<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.270> above

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
other than that just pipe it up to above

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.270 
other than that just pipe it up to above
the<00:01:18.930> face<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.830> need<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> add<00:01:20.250> some

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
speaking of chocolate you're going to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.780 
speaking of chocolate you're going to
need<00:01:51.990> some<00:01:52.200> melted<00:01:52.740> dark<00:01:52.890> chocolate<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.430> just

need some melted dark chocolate and just

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.609 
need some melted dark chocolate and just
put<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> little<00:01:54.479> dollop<00:01:54.810> inside<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
put like a little dollop inside of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.490 
put like a little dollop inside of
cupcake<00:01:56.520> liners<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:58.020> would<00:01:58.290> really

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
cupcake liners and I would really

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.990 
cupcake liners and I would really
recommend<00:01:58.649> they<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> foil<00:01:59.549> ones<00:01:59.790> just

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
recommend they get the foil ones just

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.880 
recommend they get the foil ones just
because<00:02:00.210> they're<00:02:00.390> much<00:02:00.540> more<00:02:00.750> sturdier<00:02:01.229> after

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
that just keep rotating it around until

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.490 
that just keep rotating it around until
the<00:02:04.140> entire<00:02:04.409> thing<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.860> coated<00:02:05.369> YUM<00:02:06.500> after

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the entire thing is coated YUM after

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.199 
the entire thing is coated YUM after
that<00:02:07.619> just<00:02:07.860> put<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.220> side<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.640> cool<00:02:08.910> and
