pedal I've ever messed around with it's
got<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.359> funky<00:00:18.960> steampunk<00:00:19.740> look<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.160> I've

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
got this funky steampunk look that I've

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
got this funky steampunk look that I've
never<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:21.090> seen<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> guitar<00:00:21.960> effect

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
never really seen on a guitar effect

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.560 
never really seen on a guitar effect
before<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.310> build<00:00:23.609> quality<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.090> rock-solid

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
before the build quality is rock-solid

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.570 
before the build quality is rock-solid
and<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:24.990> love<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> fact<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.130> looks<00:00:26.340> like

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and it love the fact that it looks like

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.759 
and it love the fact that it looks like
it<00:00:26.730> came<00:00:26.939> off<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.240> bench<00:00:27.689> rather<00:00:28.410> than<00:00:28.680> an

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
it came off a bench rather than an

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.339 
it came off a bench rather than an
assembly<00:00:29.220> line<00:00:29.400> oddly<00:00:30.330> enough<00:00:30.420> there's<00:00:31.109> no

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
assembly line oddly enough there's no

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.830 
assembly line oddly enough there's no
battery<00:00:31.830> compartment<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.820> you'll<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
power it with a wall wart and once you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.530 
power it with a wall wart and once you
fire<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.719> up<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.230> got<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.710> coolest<00:00:38.280> LED<00:00:39.210> ever

a gigantic fan of over drivers I have

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.880 
a gigantic fan of over drivers I have
several<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.670> varying<00:01:00.239> flavors<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.710> one

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
several of varying flavors but this one

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.189 
several of varying flavors but this one
threw<00:01:02.100> me<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.460> loop<00:01:02.520> however<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.870> can't

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
threw me for a loop however as it can't

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.899 
threw me for a loop however as it can't
be<00:01:04.290> used<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> normally<00:01:05.189> use<00:01:05.640> an

be used for what I normally use an

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.980 
be used for what I normally use an

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
overdrive for a clean boost this is a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.190 
overdrive for a clean boost this is a
dirt<00:01:10.560> pedal<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.670> volume<00:01:12.030> knob<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.630> more<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
dirt pedal the volume knob is more of a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.590 
dirt pedal the volume knob is more of a
cut<00:01:13.530> than<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> boost<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.820> gain<00:01:15.000> goes<00:01:15.240> from

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
cut than a boost and the gain goes from

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.399 
cut than a boost and the gain goes from
slightly<00:01:15.930> grimy<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.770> full-on<00:01:17.460> sludge

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
slightly grimy to full-on sludge

slightly grimy to full-on sludge
truthfully<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.680> somewhere<00:01:20.250> between<00:01:20.490> an

truthfully it's somewhere between an
over<00:01:21.210> driver<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.900> fuzz<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.759> so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
over driver and a fuzz but it just so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.010 
over driver and a fuzz but it just so
happens<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> sound<00:01:25.170> amazing<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.040> blues<00:01:26.490> leads
