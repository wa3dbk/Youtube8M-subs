00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
pushes when these rules will try get two

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
pushes when these rules will try get two
balls<00:01:03.239> pass<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.449> middle<00:01:04.720> round<00:01:05.820> that's<00:01:06.820> the

center line yep that's right yeah yeah a
potting<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.769> all<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.130> fine<00:02:23.760> right<00:02:24.360> obviously

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
path step so and that's pretty much top

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.410 
path step so and that's pretty much top
of<00:02:33.299> that<00:02:33.480> once<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.380> broken<00:02:34.709> off<00:02:35.269> it's<00:02:36.269> a

illegal ball of your next shot so it's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.610 
illegal ball of your next shot so it's
irrelevant<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.840> put<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.200> four<00:02:49.470> or<00:02:49.500> five

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
six balls of the break effectively it's

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.490 
six balls of the break effectively it's
often<00:02:53.400> table<00:02:53.819> from

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
opponent's board a nice fine so try this

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:41.040 
opponent's board a nice fine so try this
one<00:05:25.959> more<00:05:26.139> time<00:05:38.939> so<00:05:39.939> we<00:05:40.360> set<00:05:40.599> up<00:05:40.629> this<00:05:40.869> scenario

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
one more time so we set up this scenario

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.609 
one more time so we set up this scenario
so<00:05:41.789> like<00:05:42.789> I<00:05:42.819> was<00:05:42.999> saying<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:44.110> skill<00:05:44.379> shot

00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:44.619 
so like I was saying the skill shot

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:47.069 
so like I was saying the skill shot
involves<00:05:45.099> as<00:05:45.219> long<00:05:45.819> as<00:05:45.999> all<00:05:46.269> your<00:05:46.539> color<00:05:46.809> set

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:47.079 
involves as long as all your color set

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:51.329 
involves as long as all your color set
is<00:05:47.229> gone<00:05:47.469> at<00:05:48.429> the<00:05:48.639> end<00:05:48.669> of<00:05:48.969> the<00:05:49.029> shop<00:05:49.300> then<00:05:50.339> that

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:51.339 
is gone at the end of the shop then that

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:53.759 
is gone at the end of the shop then that
is<00:05:51.459> a<00:05:51.489> legal<00:05:51.729> shot<00:05:52.089> so<00:05:52.389> as<00:05:52.629> we're<00:05:53.259> on<00:05:53.409> yellows

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:53.769 
is a legal shot so as we're on yellows

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:54.059 
is a legal shot so as we're on yellows
