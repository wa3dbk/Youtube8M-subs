raking the leaves in the fall is one of

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.860 
raking the leaves in the fall is one of
those<00:00:07.980> dreaded<00:00:08.519> chores<00:00:08.849> for<00:00:09.210> many<00:00:09.420> people

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
those dreaded chores for many people

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.350 
those dreaded chores for many people
research<00:00:10.740> has<00:00:10.950> shown<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.460> by<00:00:11.849> frequently

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
research has shown that by frequently

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.959 
research has shown that by frequently
mowing<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:13.559> can<00:00:13.740> sometimes<00:00:14.219> incorporate<00:00:14.820> up

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
mowing you can sometimes incorporate up

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.120 
mowing you can sometimes incorporate up
to<00:00:15.089> four<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.540> six<00:00:15.780> inches<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.230> fallen<00:00:16.890> tree

leaves into the turf without harming it

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.790 
leaves into the turf without harming it
the<00:00:20.699> theory<00:00:21.090> behind<00:00:21.210> mowing<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> leaves<00:00:22.590> into

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the theory behind mowing the leaves into

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.790 
the theory behind mowing the leaves into
the<00:00:22.859> lawn<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.970> based<00:00:24.390> upon<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> fact<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.470> you

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the lawn is based upon the fact that you

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.339 
the lawn is based upon the fact that you
have<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.250> mow<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.640> lawn<00:00:26.670> frequent<00:00:27.390> enough<00:00:27.539> so

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
have to mow the lawn frequent enough so

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.169 
have to mow the lawn frequent enough so
whenever<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:28.980> kind<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.400> white<00:00:29.580> dusting

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
whenever you get kind of a white dusting

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.540 
whenever you get kind of a white dusting
of<00:00:30.359> leaves<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> turf<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.980> go<00:00:32.189> ahead<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
of leaves on the turf you go ahead and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.729 
of leaves on the turf you go ahead and
mow<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.450> mow<00:00:33.630> whether<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.079> not<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.410> turf

amount of leaf coverage so if you're

amount of leaf coverage so if you're

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
September and November what the research

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.289 
September and November what the research
found<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.350> mulch<00:01:25.680> mow<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
found is that when you mulch mow and

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.999 
found is that when you mulch mow and
fertilize<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> fall<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.080> fertilizer

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
fertilize in the fall that fertilizer

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
fertilize in the fall that fertilizer
helps<00:01:29.549> naturally<00:01:30.119> break<00:01:30.390> down<00:01:30.710> compost

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
helps naturally break down compost

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.700 
helps naturally break down compost
decompose<00:01:32.520> those<00:01:33.210> leaves<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.200> they<00:01:34.320> filter

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
decompose those leaves so they filter

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.710 
decompose those leaves so they filter
back<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.189> basically<00:01:35.400> turn<00:01:35.909> into<00:01:35.939> human<00:01:36.570> or

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
back and basically turn into human or

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.020 
back and basically turn into human or
compost<00:01:37.290> which<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.009> beneficial<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.850> lawn

of course if the leaves pile up deep

of course if the leaves pile up deep
enough<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.450> they<00:01:42.570> start<00:01:42.869> suffocating

shading<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> lawn<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.720> need<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.960> get

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
shading out the lawn then we need to get

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.810 
shading out the lawn then we need to get
