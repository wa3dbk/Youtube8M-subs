00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.910
 always attentive to her students from 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.740
 future dancers the school scene sade of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.320
 Giuliano puts a new piece on the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.320
 training of the young generation 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.960
 dance today stefano de martino held 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.490
 a beautiful and intense lesson stefano de 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.820
 martino after a career from 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.060
 professional returns to his land 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.210
 Christmas and come back with a masterclass at 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.859
 schoolchildren dance evening whichever they are 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.990
 first impressions what is the emotion 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.820
 who is living but always does to me 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.590
 pleasure of returning some December in the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.710
 my inter christmas as we said no 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.930
 because he finds himself a bit too 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.540
 because we say that I was overwhelmed 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.770
 a bit from many events from four 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.540
 in other words, years go by 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.980
 no friends then when i return 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.720
 precisely here I find my own a little 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.030
 real extra dimension 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.690
 I see that this school especially today 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.030
 that we will do a masterclass and one at a time 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.650
 definitely a lot of structure 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.199
 professional and so I'm happy 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.210
 because we could do I said we could 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.610
 do the job your best 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.310
 prestigious and proper dance school 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.590
 for this you imitate important exponents 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.570
 of the sports world of the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.970
 dance today yes and stefano de martino which 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.270
 are the emotions this is experiencing 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.860
 school of very beautiful motions apart 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.110
 that they still take some styles 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.450
 that's why this is different 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.670
 intention to bring characters 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.410
 television beyond us clearly 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.020
 we call television channels but also 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.869
 to the teachers of the area they are 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.330
 very good anyway and try to do 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.830
 make other styles other lessons 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.930
 stage with these characters for 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.540
 learn to have a different impact 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.240
 a different approach with teachers 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.180
 and do not always screw into the routine a 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.520
 of the school party teacher 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.710
 and then the emotion clearly to see 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.540
 a TV personality because not every 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.880
 so much a teacher must give these 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.010
 emotions after a successful career 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.480
 you to the students and the students who 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.000
 want to pursue a career from 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.270
 professional what can you advise but 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.610
 I always recommend 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.070
 let's say you invest a lot of your own time 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.770
 on their own sense it does not believe so much 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.560
 to the people who promise you maybe 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.960
 shortcuts or let's say that ours 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.470
 work is really done we get the 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.410
 face 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.660
 therefore the recommendations serve up to 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.560
 a certain point when you see a person 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.580
 that applies on stage to notice immediately 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.370
 equal yet when you see someone who 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.270
 it's worth nothing so I always say about 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.470
 invest a lot 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.750
 try out 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.300
 continually, that is, myself 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.650
 despite the many work commitments 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.210
 I always find some time clipping 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.740
 to do lesson with a thing 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.300
 fundamental 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.490
 we will meet this friend again 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.200
 next edition I am still in force 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.650
 for the moment because every year as friends 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.290
 before it starts let's say the broadcast 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.780
 it's all a bit in doubt in the sense that he knows 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.130
 never when we leave as we leave 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.080
 who is there who is not there for the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.990
 moment still he knows nothing as a dancer 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.810
 professional new father and husband of 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.720
 belen how does he manage everything 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.090
 this but I manage it by trying to 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.280
 keep in touch with normality 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.709
 let's say that despite what 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.959
 people think a moment enough 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.640
 normal sense to work with 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.370
 family life like a father 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.330
 whatever I try to keep one 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.330
 mental stability
