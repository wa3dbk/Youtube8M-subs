00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
number will go up on the lower left hand

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330 
number will go up on the lower left hand
side<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.140> next<00:01:31.409> step<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.920> when<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
side now the next step for when the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.740 
side now the next step for when the
infected<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.060> through<00:01:33.299> four<00:01:33.570> spots

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
infected there's through four spots

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
infected there's through four spots
those<00:01:34.350> are<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.530> first<00:01:34.740> two<00:01:34.920> spots<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
those are the first two spots in the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.580 
those are the first two spots in the
main<00:01:35.790> room<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.780> weather<00:01:36.990> two<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.560> the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
and then when he does pick it up all you

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.570 
and then when he does pick it up all you
gotta<00:03:07.110> do<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.680> will<00:03:07.980> gear<00:03:08.160> like<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> little

gotta do is you will gear like a little

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.130 
gotta do is you will gear like a little
thing<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.880> then<00:03:09.000> go<00:03:09.210> back<00:03:09.450> out<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> trash

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
thing and then go back out of the trash

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.610 
thing and then go back out of the trash
chute<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.920> don't<00:03:11.190> die<00:03:12.080> that's<00:03:13.080> weird<00:03:13.320> it

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
chute so you don't die that's weird it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.209 
chute so you don't die that's weird it
is<00:03:13.770> here<00:03:14.130> normally<00:03:14.820> I'm<00:03:14.910> much

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:19.219 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:21.649 

very<00:03:20.219> easy<00:03:20.430> but<00:03:20.849> it's<00:03:21.030> just<00:03:21.239> kind<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.510> pain

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
very easy but it's just kind of a pain

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.880 
very easy but it's just kind of a pain
in<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.810> ass<00:03:21.930> because<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.230> need<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.409> find<00:03:22.709> it

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
in the ass because you need to find it

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.649 
in the ass because you need to find it
and<00:03:23.069> that's<00:03:23.250> really<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.609> difficult<00:03:24.090> part<00:03:24.359> so

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
and that's really the difficult part so

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.240 
and that's really the difficult part so
then<00:03:24.810> once<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.079> find<00:03:25.349> it<00:03:25.469> you<00:03:25.530> go<00:03:25.799> on<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.129> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
then once you find it you go on to the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.490 
then once you find it you go on to the
next<00:03:26.489> step<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.939> you<00:03:27.450> obviously<00:03:27.719> keep<00:03:28.260> going

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
next step and you obviously keep going

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.399 
next step and you obviously keep going
back<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.920> computer<00:03:29.400> hitting<00:03:30.239> X<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:31.200> tell

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
back to the computer hitting X to tell

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.110 
back to the computer hitting X to tell
them<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.430> love<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.700> next<00:03:32.939> step<00:03:33.090> and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
them that you love the next step and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.490 
them that you love the next step and
she'll<00:03:33.390> say<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.599> don't<00:03:33.870> have<00:03:33.959> enough<00:03:34.170> cards

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
she'll say you don't have enough cards

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.720 
she'll say you don't have enough cards
so<00:03:34.709> we<00:03:34.859> have<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.040> do<00:03:35.159> with<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.519> kill

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
so we have to do with you to kill

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.429 
so we have to do with you to kill
zombies<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.239> they<00:03:36.269> will<00:03:36.420> drop<00:03:36.659> little<00:03:36.989> cards

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 
zombies and they will drop little cards

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.899 
zombies and they will drop little cards
and<00:03:37.650> these<00:03:38.099> little<00:03:38.340> cards<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.609> have<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.790> get

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
and these little cards you have to get

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.839 
and these little cards you have to get
49<00:03:39.389> of<00:03:39.780> them<00:03:40.069> it<00:03:41.069> can<00:03:41.250> take<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.459> little<00:03:41.609> bit<00:03:41.790> of

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
49 of them it can take a little bit of

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.160 
49 of them it can take a little bit of
time<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.389> zombies<00:03:42.510> get<00:03:42.840> harder<00:03:43.109> and

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
time and the zombies get harder and

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.360 
time and the zombies get harder and
harder<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.500> kill<00:03:43.709> so<00:03:44.189> I'd<00:03:44.250> recommend

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
harder to kill so I'd recommend

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.940 
harder to kill so I'd recommend
upgrading<00:03:44.790> your<00:03:45.120> gun<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:46.530> then<00:03:46.739> all<00:03:46.829> you

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
upgrading your gun and then all you

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.740 
upgrading your gun and then all you
gotta<00:03:47.069> do<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.280> find<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.670> loop<00:03:47.879> spot<00:03:48.180> where<00:03:48.659> you

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
gotta do is find a loop spot where you

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.149 
gotta do is find a loop spot where you
can<00:03:48.780> kill<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.200> zombies<00:03:49.530> then<00:03:49.650> go<00:03:49.799> back<00:03:49.950> and

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
can kill the zombies then go back and

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.770 
can kill the zombies then go back and
pick<00:03:50.250> them<00:03:50.400> up<00:03:50.489> very<00:03:50.549> easily<00:03:50.819> it's<00:03:51.359> not<00:03:51.540> too

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
pick them up very easily it's not too

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.659 
pick them up very easily it's not too
too<00:03:51.959> difficult<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.159> kind<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.519> pain

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
too difficult but it is kind of a pain

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:54.860 
too difficult but it is kind of a pain
in<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.819> ass<00:03:53.970> because<00:03:54.090> some<00:03:54.359> people<00:03:54.629> may<00:03:54.720> go

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
in the ass because some people may go

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.720 
in the ass because some people may go
faster<00:03:55.200> than<00:03:55.379> others<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.129> if<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.340> go<00:03:56.430> faster

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
faster than others so if you go faster

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.009 
faster than others so if you go faster
than<00:03:56.879> your<00:03:57.060> teammates<00:03:57.359> all<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.569> got<00:03:57.689> to<00:03:57.810> make

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
than your teammates all you got to make

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.470 
than your teammates all you got to make
sure<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.739> do<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.459> make<00:03:59.909> sure<00:03:59.939> all<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.299> you

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
are good to go on to the next step here

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.610 
are good to go on to the next step here
