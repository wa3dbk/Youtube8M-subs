00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.540
 until when 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.240
 cycle 1 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.430
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.800
 new ip is theirs today you 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.360
 will you finally know whether or not you 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.770
 can give bread your rabbit ago 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.990
 surely a lot of people who have you 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.849
 said yes you can quite give 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.419
 from the parent other rabbit it will use his 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.009
 teeth etc 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.690
 and then others may tell you 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.309
 that not especially not it is necessary especially 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350
 not give his apartment that you 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.660
 are finally going to have the answer in this 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.400
 video so note that even if we go 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.129
 talk more specifically about bread 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.100
 also applies of course to brioche 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.780
 biscotos cracotte etc 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.909
 so to attack the heart of the subject 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.619
 start by giving up all 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.610
 your received ideas like for example that 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.710
 your does not have in hand I can 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.210
 always that he loves that even your 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.720
 grandparents give me to their skin 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.309
 than then rabbit than some sellers 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.839
 veterinary animal advised you 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.030
 to give bread so abandoned 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.770
 really on the backs of the roses so he 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.140
 must remember the golden rule 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.549
 when one or his richemont his animal must 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.380
 always but give what he can 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.750
 find in nature then we're going 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.850
 first analyze my rabbit needs and 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.500
 then the bread to know if that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.820
 corresponds well to the needs of Latin 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.250
 so no need to be a big 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.080
 specialist to realize that the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 wild rabbits at home risk that 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.340
 of herbs and plants and sometimes a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.720
 little bit of fruits and vegetables of course 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.040
 touch them their increased so it's going 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.230
 give something that is going to be very 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.670
 low in fiber and in greece but by 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.110
 against where there will be a lot of fiber 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.070
 and water and now for our bread 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.550
 we will have something that will 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.470
 contain pesticides but decides or 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.420
 not the bread itself already contains 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.310
 a lot of friends including pretty much 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.680
 three quarters so the starch is a 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.890
 sugar that does not taste sweet but that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.350
 to 100 on the poor in fiber and bone 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.210
 and then the bread is cooked then the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.760
 cooking is really a human process 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.560
 and that's the very big disadvantage of 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.540
 denature the food ie 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.420
 the more you cook your food is 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.799
 more at melgven wc vitamins okay 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.720
 really change the whole quality of 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:16.510
 the food that ultimately does not go 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.400
 all be the same so 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.230
 or because of the live the rabbit is going 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.610
 grow and will see its transit of 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.950
 rules and because he's not used to 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.390
 to consume as much sugar then because 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.299
 pesticides now on 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.340
 to intoxicate it and by the lack of fibers 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.519
 and downstream bone has also been tuned the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.680
 transit is accustomed to the contrary and 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.260
 of course the bread is cooked so it goes 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.849
 denature the food and the rabbit and is 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.519
 an animal that consume food 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.799
 always believed and yes you'll understand 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.720
 the bread is not suitable for the rabbit is 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.730
 dangerous to think that a food for 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.920
 humans that we created for our 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.170
 consumption and for the health of your 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.639
 fir tree especially did not give them and no 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.620
 not cost all the people who 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.670
 are going to say that the fixed feeling bread is 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.670
 totally wrong 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.189
 and that's this video is over I 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.730
 See you soon for 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.730
 new ip 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.099
 which threatens 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.510
 the beginning of a video is always very 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.530
 hard 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.920
 so I'll make you the sentences in the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.920
 series 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.220
 facing the benches give a boost 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.220
 which you are going
