going to take care of itself it's

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
going to take care of itself it's
physically<00:01:19.560> impossible<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.340> leave<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.700> arm

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
towards the net the arm has to come out

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.990 
towards the net the arm has to come out
of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> way<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.310> focus<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.909> your

shoulder rotation then this arm will
take<00:01:30.329> care<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.630> itself<00:01:30.810> I'm<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.979> fast

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
take care of itself I'm going to fast

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.039 
take care of itself I'm going to fast

this for it a little bit is that

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.699 
this for it a little bit is that
structure<00:02:22.599> starts<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.049> break<00:02:23.260> down<00:02:23.319> you've

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
structure starts to break down you've

structure starts to break down you've
turned<00:02:23.950> your<00:02:24.159> wrist<00:02:24.400> over<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:24.969> strings

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:25.389 
turned your wrist over so the strings

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.629 
turned your wrist over so the strings
against<00:02:26.379> a<00:02:26.439> little<00:02:26.620> bit<00:02:26.739> difficult<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.159> see

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
against a little bit difficult to see

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.899 
against a little bit difficult to see
but<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:27.999> strings<00:02:28.180> are<00:02:28.389> facing<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.900> court<00:02:29.200> and

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
but the strings are facing the court and

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.759 
but the strings are facing the court and
you<00:02:30.909> want<00:02:31.180> your<00:02:31.480> arm<00:02:31.719> position<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.379> stay<00:02:32.590> the

less<00:02:40.419> at<00:02:40.599> contact<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:41.230> he's<00:02:41.349> going<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.590> keep

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
less at contact and he's going to keep

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.670 
less at contact and he's going to keep
this<00:02:42.400> arm<00:02:42.700> position<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:44.109> bend<00:02:44.439> of<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.590> elbow

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
this arm position the bend of the elbow

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.789 
this arm position the bend of the elbow
the<00:02:45.459> laid-back<00:02:45.669> wrist<00:02:46.379> he's<00:02:47.379> going<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.590> keep

the laid-back wrist he's going to keep
that<00:02:48.040> through<00:02:48.579> contact<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:49.359> let's<00:02:49.510> play<00:02:49.659> for

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
that through contact so let's play for

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.439 
that through contact so let's play for
he's<00:02:50.139> made<00:02:50.349> contact<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.189> then<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.239> ball<00:02:52.389> is

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:52.449 
he's made contact and then the ball is

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:54.509 
he's made contact and then the ball is
well<00:02:52.840> off<00:02:53.019> his<00:02:53.199> strings<00:02:53.530> but<00:02:53.799> he<00:02:53.919> still<00:02:54.250> has

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
well off his strings but he still has

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.479 
well off his strings but he still has
that<00:02:54.699> same<00:02:55.000> relationship<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.620> his<00:02:57.159> strings

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
that same relationship so his strings

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.119 
that same relationship so his strings
are<00:02:57.790> still<00:02:58.449> parallel<00:02:59.409> to<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> court<00:02:59.859> yours

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
stays back a little bit a little bit too

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.960 
stays back a little bit a little bit too
much<00:03:23.019> as<00:03:23.319> you<00:03:24.040> hit<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.519> into<00:03:24.879> your
