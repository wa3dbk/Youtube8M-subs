pressure on the pedal a cadence of

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.630 
pressure on the pedal a cadence of
around<00:01:17.300> 90<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.050> do<00:01:18.560> one<00:01:18.770> legged<00:01:19.039> drills<00:01:19.429> for

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
around 90 and do one legged drills for

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.550 
around 90 and do one legged drills for
about<00:01:19.850> 30<00:01:20.149> seconds<00:01:20.600> each<00:01:20.750> leg<00:01:21.050> a<00:01:21.080> few<00:01:21.380> times
