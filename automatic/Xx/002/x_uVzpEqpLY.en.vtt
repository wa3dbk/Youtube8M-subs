00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello everyone I am opus thread and today I am going 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.299
 to explain how to open the playstation3 in 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.730
 any operating system and with 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.870
 any router first everything we're going to go 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.790
 to settings in play 3 and network settings 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 then we go to adjustments and lists of 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.290
 connection and we're going to aim at a 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.570
 paper the ip address and the router 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.840
 predetermined after we go to the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.140
 computer 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.490
 let's be on the computer if we're 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.490
 let's go to system preferences 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.890
 we are going to advanced 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.370
 and here we have to look 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.399
 First of all tcp / ip and we look at the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.829
 router if it matches play 3 is 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.410
 say with the route in determined of play 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.500
 3 then we go to tns and we 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.750
 we will point out these two that are our 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.350
 of ns for those who have windows vista 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.070
 or 7 we are going to put cmd directly in the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.640
 search bar if we're not going to put 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.680
 execute and execute cmd then we are going to 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.369
 this black screen and we put ip 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.050
 conflict bar to and we give to enter and 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.690
 then we are going to go to this other 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.789
 black screen once we give it to ender 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.700
 we will come out this screen we are going to 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.250
 search in the gateway 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.880
 default and let's see if it matches 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.000
 with the preferred router that we have 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.630
 targeted playstation3 and then we're going to 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.310
 point the two servers in the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.979
 up and down and now we're going 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.250
 to the browser with the codes that we have 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.390
 aimed to do the following steps 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.820
 whether you are in windows or if 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.470
 you are in mac is going to be the same and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.710
 I will also explain how it is done in 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.030
 serve on different routes I have a 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.890
 jazztel router 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.340
 now let's come to the browser and let's go 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:02.979
 to put in the search bar 192 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.460
 points 168 points 1.1 and we are going to give you 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.650
 enter 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.270
 I have entered before so you 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.150
 surely if you have never entered 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.200
 is going to ask for a username and a 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.240
 password if you are from jazztel is admin 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.420
 the user and here in the password 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.030
 if you are in other routers it can be in 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.959
 the username 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.330
 1 2 3 4 and the password 1 2 3 4 can 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.489
 be in a user admin a password 1 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.480
 2 3 4 and the other way around I 'm going to put you in 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.080
 descriptions of different 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.530
 combinations that are good now here 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.470
 we are going to come in atlante setup and 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.870
 let's go to ls 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.570
 and here we are going to point out the two of ls that 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.330
 we have pointed before the one of ls server that 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.420
 I was in 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.790
 in the for the windows was in this 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.290
 black screen that we have targeted the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.360
 two codes that had up and down 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.150
 for the others who were in the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.060
 dns section of those of the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.650
 network preferences so we 're going to 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.599
 point here 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.629
 up the one that was up and down the 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.450
 that was down and upl and knows and already what 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.480
 I have then we are going to come to nac and 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.290
 here we are going to put mz host and we are going to 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.870
 point here the ip of the playstation3 is 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.380
 say the one that we have pointed out in the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.130
 play 3 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.100
 not the default router but the 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.820
 of the playstation3 we are going to point it out 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.090
 here and already know pri and apart from having the 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.550
 cream open now we're going to have 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.240
 also better connection normally and we 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.670
 is going to put that many more times 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.220
 I hope you liked it and well let's go 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.660
 a moment to play 3 to see what we have 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.700
 what to do now 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.250
 once in playstation3 we will go to 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:02.370
 Internet connection settings we're going 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.370
 to give ok let's go to custom 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.960
 then we're going to go by carlos and 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.260
 we have wireless cable and we have 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.140
 Automatic piano wireless and adjustment 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.850
 disk in manual ip here we are going to put 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.010
 the ip address that we have from the 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.370
 playstation3 and that we have also put 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.200
 in the zone of demilitarize 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.990
 demilitarized was more than enough in 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.060
 what we see on the screen and the drs is 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.190
 that we have written before the router 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.250
 the one you see on the screen 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.930
 now let's go to mt automatic the 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.300
 video next use a play activate and 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.800
 here we are going to show us everything and then 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.800
 we are going to give you programs connection 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:52.030
 and he's going to give us a type of enap type 2 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.320
 that means we have it open 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.990
 and we can also continue in each of 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.580
 duty 'and see that it's also open like that 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.170
 that these are all the steps that 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.780
 we have to continue if we want to open the 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:07.660
 cream in playstation3 and I hope that you 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.660
