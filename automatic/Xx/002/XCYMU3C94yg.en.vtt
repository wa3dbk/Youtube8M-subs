00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
supply of those I would guess and then

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.660 
supply of those I would guess and then

the original game it used to deduct

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.260 
the original game it used to deduct
points<00:02:55.930> from<00:02:56.590> your<00:02:56.650> score<00:02:57.190> so<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:57.940> want<00:02:58.180> to

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
points from your score so you want to

get as many as you can and accumulate

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.160 
get as many as you can and accumulate
points<00:03:00.310> versus<00:03:00.820> letting<00:03:01.090> them<00:03:01.240> run<00:03:01.660> past<00:03:01.990> you

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
points versus letting them run past you

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.850 
points versus letting them run past you
and<00:03:02.490> run<00:03:03.490> into<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.940> ground<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.540> take<00:03:05.470> points

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
and run into the ground and take points

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.500 
and run into the ground and take points
away<00:03:06.160> from<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.550> however<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:07.120> won't<00:03:07.180> kill<00:03:07.450> you

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
away from you however it won't kill you

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.350 
away from you however it won't kill you
it'll<00:03:07.780> just<00:03:08.020> remove<00:03:08.320> points<00:03:08.710> from<00:03:08.800> your<00:03:08.860> score

it'll just remove points from your score

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.560 
it'll just remove points from your score

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
now the asteroids or the spinners

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.660 
now the asteroids or the spinners
however<00:03:14.260> if<00:03:14.500> they<00:03:14.650> hit<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.950> ground<00:03:15.130> will

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
however if they hit the ground will

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.330 
however if they hit the ground will
destroy<00:03:16.420> your<00:03:16.720> base<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:17.860> definitely<00:03:18.160> want

which I'm sure we'll see what those are
all<00:03:26.560> about<00:03:26.740> here<00:03:27.010> maybe<00:03:27.250> in<00:03:27.460> some<00:03:28.060> gameplay<00:03:28.510> so

those spinners you don't want to let hit
the<00:04:42.430> ground<00:04:42.640> and<00:04:43.030> basically<00:04:43.600> what<00:04:43.840> you're

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
the ground and basically what you're

the ground and basically what you're
trying<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.290> do<00:04:44.410> here<00:04:44.440> is<00:04:44.650> just<00:04:44.800> go<00:04:45.010> for<00:04:45.190> the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
trying to do here is just go for the

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.450 
trying to do here is just go for the
high<00:04:45.460> score

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.950 

now<00:04:53.460> if<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.610> want<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:53.790> leave<00:04:54.030> auto<00:04:54.240> fire<00:04:54.630> on

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
now if you want to leave auto fire on

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.750 
now if you want to leave auto fire on
you<00:04:55.230> can<00:04:55.380> do<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:55.740> but<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.160> looks<00:04:56.400> like<00:04:56.490> it

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
you can do that but it looks like it

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.550 
you can do that but it looks like it
doesn't<00:04:56.910> fire<00:04:57.270> quite<00:04:57.690> as<00:04:57.840> fast<00:04:58.050> as<00:04:58.350> I<00:04:58.500> could

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
doesn't fire quite as fast as I could

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.890 
doesn't fire quite as fast as I could
fire<00:04:59.300> when<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.330> do<00:05:00.450> it<00:05:00.660> manually<00:05:05.510> so<00:05:06.510> there's<00:05:06.720> I

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
fire when I do it manually so there's I

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.420 
fire when I do it manually so there's I
look<00:05:07.200> like<00:05:07.350> one<00:05:07.500> of<00:05:07.530> those<00:05:07.650> mines<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.220> want<00:05:08.370> to

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
asteroids this is kind of like asteroids

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.720 
asteroids this is kind of like asteroids
but<00:06:22.580> just<00:06:22.760> on<00:06:22.820> a<00:06:22.880> flat<00:06:23.240> plane<00:06:24.100> and<00:06:25.100> I<00:06:25.520> think

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
but just on a flat plane and I think

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.210 
but just on a flat plane and I think
it's<00:06:25.850> brilliant<00:06:26.150> how<00:06:26.690> you<00:06:27.170> lose<00:06:27.380> points<00:06:27.740> for

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
it's brilliant how you lose points for

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.950 
it's brilliant how you lose points for
missing<00:06:30.970> asteroids<00:06:31.970> letting<00:06:32.330> them<00:06:32.480> fall<00:06:32.720> by

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
awesome it's pretty cool they can get

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.490 
awesome it's pretty cool they can get
really<00:06:43.580> low<00:06:44.030> but<00:06:44.569> yet<00:06:44.720> you<00:06:44.750> can<00:06:44.990> still<00:06:45.020> take

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
really low but yet you can still take

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:52.719 
really low but yet you can still take
them<00:06:45.650> out<00:06:50.500> like<00:06:51.500> we<00:06:51.680> received<00:06:52.069> some<00:06:52.159> sort<00:06:52.340> of<00:06:52.610> a

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729
