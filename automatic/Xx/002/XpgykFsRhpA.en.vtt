00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.639 
looking out for that so um a lot a lot
of<00:01:52.179> speculation<00:01:53.020> going<00:01:53.170> around<00:01:53.349> with<00:01:53.440> this

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
of speculation going around with this

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.800 
of speculation going around with this
here<00:01:53.890> so<00:01:54.160> hopefully<00:01:54.489> this<00:01:54.849> is<00:01:55.030> what<00:01:55.390> we've

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
here so hopefully this is what we've

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.660 
here so hopefully this is what we've
been<00:01:55.840> waiting<00:01:56.050> for<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.130> supposed<00:01:57.429> to<00:01:57.550> be

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
been waiting for this is supposed to be

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.120 
been waiting for this is supposed to be
a<00:01:57.700> cheaper<00:01:58.270> DLC<00:01:58.959> because<00:01:59.950> they've<00:02:00.099> been

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
a cheaper DLC because they've been

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.919 
a cheaper DLC because they've been
lightness<00:02:00.610> up<00:02:00.789> with<00:02:00.910> all<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:01.239> you<00:02:01.840> know

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
lightness up with all this you know

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.570 
lightness up with all this you know
these<00:02:02.319> double<00:02:02.679> hice<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.099> stuff<00:02:03.220> like<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.399> so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
these double hice and stuff like that so

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.969 
these double hice and stuff like that so
maybe<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.090> casino<00:02:04.450> be<00:02:04.569> pop<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.929> out<00:02:05.020> be<00:02:05.619> run<00:02:05.830> up

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979
