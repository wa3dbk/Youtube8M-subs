the solitude of the lakes the mountains
the<00:01:57.750> valleys<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.170> think<00:01:58.410> that<00:01:58.530> could<00:01:58.830> have<00:01:58.950> been

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the valleys I think that could have been

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.469 
the valleys I think that could have been
a<00:01:59.280> little<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.640> do<00:01:59.759> with<00:01:59.789> his<00:02:00.000> first<00:02:00.209> marriage

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
a little to do with his first marriage

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.389 
a little to do with his first marriage
which<00:02:00.720> apparently<00:02:00.959> wasn't<00:02:01.259> happiest<00:02:01.800> so<00:02:02.310> he

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
which apparently wasn't happiest so he

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.770 
which apparently wasn't happiest so he
spent<00:02:02.610> quite<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.789> lot<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.030> time<00:02:03.209> you<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.569> on

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
spent quite a lot of time you know on

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.249
