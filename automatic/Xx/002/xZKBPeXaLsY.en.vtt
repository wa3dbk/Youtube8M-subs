00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.169
 here 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.349
 here 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.140
 add me 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.910
 weather and weather forecast in kenya 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 I was inspired by this incredible amazing place 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.820
 I thought of an explorer 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.979
 which beats through all these situations 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:53.509
 so something extremely if you google with the extremely basking d 

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:54.510
 in the sun 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.170
 but also something extremely soft on the other side with this icon 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.910
 games to buy them helium 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.429
 I asked for collectibles with Dai Dai games 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.190
 especially those that have crowns 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.420
 very strange on t-shirts 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.549
 and then he played very well used bmw on the field 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.520
 with a ballpoint pen 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.690
 drawing them directly on a breeze 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.210
 bay of the sun oo precisely for this reason we say of nature and 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.090
 life 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.820
 fishing sensation 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.180
 Mobile testicles are the queen of regular diving 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260
 is 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.750
 I wouldn't like to see the models that look like sediments 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.910
 red vercelli 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.380
 because nothing is ever didactic but it is always revised and reinterpreted
