the<00:02:52.989> entire<00:02:53.350> way<00:02:53.620> through<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.480> only<00:02:55.810> real

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
the entire way through the only real

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.390 
the entire way through the only real
hitch<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.350> gameplay<00:02:56.590> for<00:02:57.010> me<00:02:57.100> was<00:02:57.280> the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
hitch in the gameplay for me was the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.160 
hitch in the gameplay for me was the
over-the-shoulder<00:02:57.819> targeting<00:02:58.600> system<00:02:58.959> and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
over-the-shoulder targeting system and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.289 
over-the-shoulder targeting system and
the<00:02:59.319> auto<00:02:59.500> aim<00:02:59.739> felt<00:03:00.069> off<00:03:00.310> in<00:03:00.549> some<00:03:00.760> areas<00:03:01.120> but

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
the auto aim felt off in some areas but

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.479 
the auto aim felt off in some areas but
to<00:03:02.170> be<00:03:02.319> honest<00:03:02.709> there's<00:03:02.890> not<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.069> whole<00:03:03.310> lot<00:03:03.459> of

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
to be honest there's not a whole lot of

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.220 
to be honest there's not a whole lot of
shooting<00:03:03.849> that<00:03:03.880> goes<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.390> it's<00:03:04.959> mainly

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
shooting that goes on it's mainly

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.830 
shooting that goes on it's mainly
collecting<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.069> gathering<00:03:06.190> items<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.660> it's

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
collecting and gathering items so it's

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.390 
collecting and gathering items so it's
not<00:03:07.989> gonna<00:03:08.200> really<00:03:08.440> be<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.739> deal-breaker<00:03:09.040> for

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
not gonna really be a deal-breaker for

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.880 
not gonna really be a deal-breaker for
those<00:03:09.700> fans<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.290> verdict<00:03:11.680> on<00:03:11.739> the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
those fans so the verdict on the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.970 
those fans so the verdict on the
gameplay<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.519> it's<00:03:13.060> really<00:03:13.569> great<00:03:13.830> but<00:03:14.830> how

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
gameplay is it's really great but how

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.890 
gameplay is it's really great but how
does<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.280> look

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
does it look

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
does it look
graphically<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.019> framerate<00:03:17.319> held<00:03:17.739> up<00:03:17.890> quite

nice<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.940> characters<00:03:19.329> were<00:03:19.510> just<00:03:19.840> about

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
nice and the characters were just about

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.930 
nice and the characters were just about
