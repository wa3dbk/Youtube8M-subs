00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
usually happening with these drums is

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.040 
usually happening with these drums is
the<00:00:46.739> sound<00:00:47.010> waves<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.809> traveling<00:00:48.809> down

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the sound waves are all traveling down

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.369 
the sound waves are all traveling down
the<00:00:49.770> legs<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> they're<00:00:51.149> terminating<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the legs and they're terminating you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
the legs and they're terminating you
know<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> ground<00:00:53.160> into<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> into<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
know like a ground into the into the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.830 
know like a ground into the into the
ground<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:56.430> know<00:00:56.550> my<00:00:56.820> test<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.420> any<00:00:57.510> drum

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
ground so you know my test for any drum

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.330 
ground so you know my test for any drum
whether<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.289> rims<00:00:58.530> mount<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:59.010> something

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
whether it's on rims mount or something

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.569 
whether it's on rims mount or something
like<00:00:59.460> these<00:00:59.699> these<00:01:00.300> isolation<00:01:01.340> booty<00:01:02.340> shaker

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
like these these isolation booty shaker

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.130 
like these these isolation booty shaker
things<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.719> play<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:06.110> take<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
things here is is to play here take it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.460 
things here is is to play here take it
off<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> ground

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
off the ground

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.560 
off the ground
and<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:10.310> mean<00:01:10.460> we<00:01:10.580> literally<00:01:10.880> have<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.210> retune

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
and I mean we literally have to retune

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.360 
and I mean we literally have to retune
the<00:01:11.750> drum<00:01:11.990> because<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:13.130> know<00:01:13.250> the

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
the drum because the you know the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.000 
the drum because the you know the
resonance<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:14.390> much<00:01:14.570> different<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.500> what

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
resonance is so much different so what

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.350 
resonance is so much different so what
we're<00:01:16.100> going<00:01:16.190> to<00:01:16.250> do<00:01:16.370> is<00:01:16.490> we're<00:01:16.640> going<00:01:16.730> to<00:01:16.790> take

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.860 
we're going to do is we're going to take
these<00:01:17.510> little<00:01:17.660> foam<00:01:18.560> booty<00:01:18.890> shaker<00:01:19.540> dudes<00:01:20.540> and

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
these little foam booty shaker dudes and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.840 
these little foam booty shaker dudes and
put<00:01:21.020> them<00:01:21.110> on<00:01:21.260> here<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:22.340> know<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.730> idea

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
put them on here and you know the idea

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.130 
put them on here and you know the idea
is<00:01:23.120> it's<00:01:23.270> just<00:01:23.300> going<00:01:23.480> to<00:01:23.570> isolate<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:24.020> from

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
is it's just going to isolate it from

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.450 
is it's just going to isolate it from
the<00:01:24.230> ground<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.700> it's<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.660> cheap<00:01:27.380> way<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.980> do

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
the ground and it's a cheap way to do

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.150 
the ground and it's a cheap way to do
something<00:01:28.730> that<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.510> think<00:01:29.690> all<00:01:30.050> of<00:01:30.110> us<00:01:30.290> really

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
something that I think all of us really

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.010 
something that I think all of us really
want<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.550> do<00:01:31.700> with<00:01:31.850> our<00:01:31.970> 4-times<00:01:32.240> whether<00:01:32.810> it's

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
want to do with our 4-times whether it's

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.730 
want to do with our 4-times whether it's
in<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.130> studio<00:01:34.580> or<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:36.170> know<00:01:36.260> on<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.530> road

in the studio or you know on the road
I'm<00:01:36.980> actually<00:01:37.160> using<00:01:37.520> them<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.820> road<00:01:38.020> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
I'm actually using them on the road and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.700 
I'm actually using them on the road and
I'm<00:01:39.140> digging<00:01:39.440> them<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.930> see<00:01:42.170> we<00:01:42.410> got<00:01:42.560> that

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
I'm digging them and see we got that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.190 
I'm digging them and see we got that
same<00:01:42.920> thing<00:01:43.160> we<00:01:43.310> pop<00:01:43.520> them<00:01:43.700> off<00:01:44.320> real<00:01:45.320> quick

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
same thing we pop them off real quick
