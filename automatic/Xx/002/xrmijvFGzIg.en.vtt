00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
you know work with that for about two

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.179 
you know work with that for about two
weeks<00:01:05.659> until<00:01:06.049> they<00:01:06.350> really<00:01:06.619> found<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:06.920> right

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
weeks until they really found that right

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.469 
weeks until they really found that right
tension<00:01:07.490> that<00:01:07.729> was<00:01:07.880> going<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.060> work<00:01:08.180> for<00:01:08.390> them

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
tension that was going to work for them

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.630 
tension that was going to work for them
as<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.869> as<00:01:09.049> a<00:01:09.110> dryer<00:01:09.649> goes<00:01:09.829> up<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.220> down<00:01:10.310> and

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
as the as a dryer goes up and down and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.609 
as the as a dryer goes up and down and
that<00:01:10.729> was<00:01:10.909> that<00:01:11.240> was<00:01:11.360> really<00:01:11.750> big<00:01:11.960> aha<00:01:12.380> for

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
that was that was really big aha for

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.899 
that was that was really big aha for
everybody<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.460> think<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.759> made

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
everybody and I think that made

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.190 
everybody and I think that made
everybody<00:01:14.149> a<00:01:14.329> little<00:01:14.479> bit<00:01:14.689> more<00:01:14.810> comfortable

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
everybody a little bit more comfortable

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.010 
everybody a little bit more comfortable
with<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.889> fact<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.189> they<00:01:16.399> could<00:01:16.609> control

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
with the fact that they could control

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.109 
with the fact that they could control
exactly<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.649> features<00:01:19.280> on<00:01:19.549> that<00:01:19.850> particular

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
exactly the features on that particular

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.910 
exactly the features on that particular
dryer<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:21.049> we're<00:01:21.170> going<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.350> work<00:01:21.499> best<00:01:21.710> for

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
dryer that we're going to work best for

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.069 
dryer that we're going to work best for
them<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.249> it<00:01:22.369> didn't<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:23.299> actually<00:01:23.719> enhance

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
them so it didn't it actually enhance

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.050 
them so it didn't it actually enhance
their<00:01:24.350> work<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.740> didn't<00:01:25.039> take<00:01:25.549> away<00:01:25.789> from<00:01:25.939> it

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
their work it didn't take away from it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.599 
their work it didn't take away from it

their<00:02:19.269> bathrooms<00:02:19.630> at<00:02:19.810> home<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.650> don't

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
their bathrooms at home so we don't

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.380 
their bathrooms at home so we don't
except<00:02:21.190> for<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.400> one<00:02:21.519> that<00:02:21.730> sweeps<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.150> floor

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
except for the one that sweeps the floor

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.830 
except for the one that sweeps the floor
we<00:02:22.870> don't<00:02:22.989> have<00:02:23.230> any<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.840> traditional
