00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.830
 Hello such friends as I youtube 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.619
 I am your android and this video that are going to 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.730
 see skills for the servers of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.680
 minecraft ok 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.250
 good are some servers who with cream 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.810
 in a video what to do see friends like that 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.950
 that I will leave them in the description 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.320
 of the video and 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.430
 and good to enter the servers are going to 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 give in play get down here where it says to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.650
 side of the snow 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.780
 external 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.860
 once they enter external is going to 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.370
 go out to these options in the direction that 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.370
 they're going to put 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.200
 when you are andrÃ©s the address of the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.650
 center 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.990
 and all numbers are usually as 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.940
 bring 32 points 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.710
 the numbers point three numbers this 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.480
 server that you can put is not real 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.480
 he only sees it 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:22.420
 and port so only one remains 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:26.320
 of the entire servers and termination 54 of 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.030
 all the rest are 30 so this one almost 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.980
 they will not move it more than for a 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.740
 occasion and then they give him the down 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.770
 since they have it well and in server name 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.369
 they can put whatever 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.990
 and since already raising the name no 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.280
 what matters is the address and 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.840
 port 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.150
 As I tell you, this is just a 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.970
 example and already after they have it 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.310
 they will give in the server and I will give in 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.920
 back because it's just an example 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.060
 and the ones that worked for me were 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.060
 this from phoenix server 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.659
 this one here I invented the name of 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.080
 A) Yes 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:12.030
 at least not only as I say the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.519
 only what matters is that the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.980
 address and port name actually not 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.840
 it matters but if you have to take it but 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.569
 it does not matter whoever it is 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.170
 and good thing that I want to comment is 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.069
 that yesterday night did not upload video like that 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.849
 what 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.159
 this is good diego so you know that no 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.689
 upload video and then I will continue 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.939
 uploading videos only fell to 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.250
 upload video because they had homework and had 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.250
 what to do so 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.130
 if I'm going to continue uploading videos to see if 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.280
 right now finishing this video I do another 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.080
 and I upload it if not because then tomorrow I'll upload 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.700
 one in the morning and another cycle in the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.470
 night 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.950
 but good now taking advantage of not 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.750
 I have three as you can see here says 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.120
 says up where they have the time says 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.879
 218 m below certain is that it has 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.440
 started to record at 215 that line 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.760
 are the doses done as you can see 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.790
 well this and recording right now market 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.180
 I wait for three of this video in 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.890
 youtube my channel so well 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.150
 I comment this so you know but if I go 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.980
 to continue uploading videos do not go to 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.710
 to think that as it did not rise to arrive the night 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.690
 they say camps and not upload videos 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.090
 and then tell them what server as the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.610
 friends and they say they are very unstable 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.830
 so they better be disconnected as 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.440
 I tell my mentions saw that says 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.410
 enfinity server and the or because it 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.420
 I invented the name 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.290
 and well, I'll leave it to you in the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.070
 description so they prove them if 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.590
 they serve them very well hopefully and they place 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:55.550
 so I'm your android 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.760
