00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.580 
come up against 288 rated strikers now
we're<00:01:27.150> obviously<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.869> was<00:01:28.080> literally<00:01:28.470> my

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
we're obviously this was literally my

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
we're obviously this was literally my
first<00:01:28.770> game<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> World<00:01:29.520> Cup<00:01:29.700> game<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.030> well

first game on the World Cup game as well

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.840 
first game on the World Cup game as well
so<00:01:30.479> trying<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.409> used<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.159> slight<00:01:32.610> knew

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
so trying to get used to the slight knew

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.850 
so trying to get used to the slight knew
differences<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.689> playstyle<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.439> stuff<00:01:34.680> was<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
differences in playstyle and stuff was a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.950 
differences in playstyle and stuff was a
little<00:01:35.130> bit<00:01:35.250> difficult<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.420> I've<00:01:36.570> got<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.780> say

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
little bit difficult and I've got to say

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200 
little bit difficult and I've got to say
it<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.259> feels<00:01:37.500> quite<00:01:37.680> smooth<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.400> also<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it it feels quite smooth but also the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.520 
it it feels quite smooth but also the
players<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.810> was<00:01:40.020> using<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.500> think

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
players that I was using I think

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.800 
players that I was using I think
probably<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.369> chemistry<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.420> felt<00:01:42.750> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
probably to do with chemistry it felt a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.100 
probably to do with chemistry it felt a
little<00:01:42.930> bit<00:01:43.140> sort<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:44.450> slower<00:01:45.450> than<00:01:45.990> normal

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
little bit sort of slower than normal

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.690 
little bit sort of slower than normal
Ultimate<00:01:46.590> Team<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> only<00:01:47.520> way<00:01:47.670> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
Ultimate Team I think is the only way I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.359 
Ultimate Team I think is the only way I
can<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.750> tell<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.079> guys<00:01:49.409> now<00:01:49.649> agüero<00:01:50.009> gets

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
can really tell you guys now agüero gets

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
can really tell you guys now agüero gets
through<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> 30th<00:01:51.960> minute<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.380> does<00:01:52.590> make

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
through in the 30th minute and does make

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.100 
through in the 30th minute and does make
it<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.250> nil<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:53.759> opponent<00:01:54.329> which<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.810> just

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it one nil to my opponent which is just

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.620 
it one nil to my opponent which is just
unfortunate<00:01:55.439> because<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.210> really<00:01:57.210> struggled

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
unfortunate because I really struggled

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.539 
unfortunate because I really struggled
I'm<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:57.840> gonna<00:01:58.020> lie<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:59.040> partnership

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
I'm not gonna lie this the partnership

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.120 
I'm not gonna lie this the partnership
between<00:01:59.670> a<00:02:00.060> agüero<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.259> Suarez<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.770> front<00:02:02.009> for

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
between a agüero and Suarez up front for

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.889 
between a agüero and Suarez up front for
this<00:02:02.219> guy<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> little<00:02:03.149> bit<00:02:03.390> too<00:02:03.509> much<00:02:03.689> for

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
this guy was a little bit too much for

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
this guy was a little bit too much for
me<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.079> handle<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.740> did<00:02:05.490> manage<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.850> hold<00:02:06.149> him

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
me to handle I did manage to hold him

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.199 
me to handle I did manage to hold him
off<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.570> one<00:02:06.750> nil<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:08.129> he<00:02:08.489> was<00:02:08.849> pretty

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
off to one nil and but he was pretty

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.360 
off to one nil and but he was pretty
much<00:02:09.390> dominating<00:02:10.110> really<00:02:10.500> taking<00:02:10.950> shots<00:02:11.190> from

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
much dominating really taking shots from

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.970 
much dominating really taking shots from
all<00:02:11.520> over<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.849> place<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
all over the place and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.619 
all over the place and
fairly<00:02:13.250> boring<00:02:13.459> first<00:02:13.879> game<00:02:14.150> does<00:02:14.420> end

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
fairly boring first game does end

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.110 
fairly boring first game does end
one-nil<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.230> my<00:02:15.349> opponent<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.190> we<00:02:16.849> didn't

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
one-nil to my opponent so we didn't

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.000 
one-nil to my opponent so we didn't
score<00:02:17.330> any<00:02:17.390> goals<00:02:17.569> that<00:02:18.230> game<00:02:18.470> which<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.799> not

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
score any goals that game which is not

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.220 
score any goals that game which is not
great<00:02:19.670> at<00:02:19.940> all<00:02:20.090> because<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.390> idea<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.049> get

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
great at all because the idea is we get

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.600 
great at all because the idea is we get
packs<00:02:21.500> when<00:02:21.739> we<00:02:21.860> score<00:02:22.069> goals

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
packs when we score goals

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.789 
packs when we score goals
but<00:02:23.209> what<00:02:23.390> we<00:02:23.510> will<00:02:23.659> be<00:02:23.810> doing<00:02:23.959> is<00:02:24.170> after<00:02:24.319> every

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
but what we will be doing is after every

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.530 
but what we will be doing is after every
single<00:02:25.159> game<00:02:25.280> whether<00:02:25.549> we<00:02:25.760> win<00:02:25.970> or<00:02:26.090> lose<00:02:26.120> we

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
single game whether we win or lose we

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.990 
single game whether we win or lose we
will<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:26.930> opening<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.920> pack<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.670> know<00:02:28.940> you
