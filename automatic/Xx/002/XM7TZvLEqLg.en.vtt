00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
i'm not sure what i bugged me so much

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.270 
i'm not sure what i bugged me so much
but<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.930> particular<00:02:04.290> commentary<00:02:04.979> really

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
but that particular commentary really

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.160 
but that particular commentary really
bugged<00:02:05.490> me<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.750> was<00:02:06.869> bad<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
bugged me just because that was bad and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.839 
bugged me just because that was bad and
cal<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> fast<00:02:07.979> expansion<00:02:08.369> i<00:02:08.580> really

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
cal going for a fast expansion i really

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.699 
cal going for a fast expansion i really
think<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.179> creative<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.869> map<00:02:10.050> simply

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
think that's creative on this map simply

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.530 
think that's creative on this map simply
because<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.370> know<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.910> your<00:02:12.030> opponent<00:02:12.390> is

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
because you know that your opponent is

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.370 
because you know that your opponent is
going<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.810> seal<00:02:12.989> in

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
going to seal in

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.960 
going to seal in
you<00:02:13.650> know<00:02:13.740> what's<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.010> four-player<00:02:14.430> map<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
you know what's a four-player map so a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.160 
you know what's a four-player map so a
lot<00:02:15.210> of<00:02:15.240> this<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.540> actually<00:02:15.870> going<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.050> come

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
lot of this is actually going to come

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.420 
lot of this is actually going to come
down<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.320> scouting<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.800> question<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.160> when<00:02:17.400> is

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
down to scouting the question is when is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.920 
down to scouting the question is when is
for<00:02:17.700> GG<00:02:17.910> gonna<00:02:18.030> scout<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.570> it's<00:02:18.810> also

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
for GG gonna scout this and it's also

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.180 
for GG gonna scout this and it's also
going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.230> critical<00:02:19.350> whether<00:02:19.680> he<00:02:19.800> produces

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
going to be critical whether he produces

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.440 
going to be critical whether he produces
those<00:02:20.340> early<00:02:20.610> Marines<00:02:20.850> he<00:02:20.940> went<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.240> really

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
those early Marines he went for a really

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.910 
those early Marines he went for a really
quick<00:02:21.600> gas<00:02:21.810> before<00:02:22.050> even<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.500> barracks<00:02:22.800> was

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
quick gas before even that barracks was

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.020 
quick gas before even that barracks was
finished<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.280> really<00:02:23.550> going<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.730> go<00:02:23.820> for<00:02:23.970> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
finished so really going to go for a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.120 
finished so really going to go for a
fast<00:02:24.210> factory<00:02:24.570> here<00:02:24.720> maybe<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.770> make<00:02:25.890> sure<00:02:26.010> you

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
fast factory here maybe to make sure you

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.110 
fast factory here maybe to make sure you
can<00:02:26.250> push<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.520> out<00:02:26.640> maybe<00:02:26.820> he's<00:02:27.000> thinking

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
can push this out maybe he's thinking

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.210 
can push this out maybe he's thinking
about<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.600> factory<00:02:27.900> push<00:02:28.080> already<00:02:28.350> gateway

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
about to factory push already gateway

is sending that scout the question is

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.950 
is sending that scout the question is
what<00:02:35.790> direction<00:02:36.000> does<00:02:36.150> ago<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.780> first

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
what direction does ago that first

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.270 
what direction does ago that first
factor<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.440> down<00:02:37.560> does<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.920> look<00:02:37.980> like<00:02:38.130> he<00:02:38.250> I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
factor going down does it look like he I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.650 
factor going down does it look like he I
don't<00:02:38.670> think<00:02:38.940> he<00:02:39.000> was<00:02:39.090> producing<00:02:39.240> a<00:02:39.480> marine

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
don't think he was producing a marine

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.760 
don't think he was producing a marine
out<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.930> get<00:02:40.020> another<00:02:40.050> look<00:02:40.320> at<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.500> barracks

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
out to get another look at the barracks

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.350 
out to get another look at the barracks
that<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.490> be<00:02:41.610> absolutely<00:02:41.730> huge<00:02:42.150> not

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that is going to be absolutely huge not

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.550 
that is going to be absolutely huge not
producing<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.810> marine<00:02:42.990> so<00:02:43.140> producing<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
producing a marine so producing the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.590 
producing a marine so producing the
factory<00:02:43.860> first<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.340> his<00:02:44.730> first<00:02:44.790> 200<00:02:45.330> minerals

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
factory first on his first 200 minerals

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.420 
factory first on his first 200 minerals
not<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> marine<00:02:46.110> first<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.070> that's<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.310> little

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
not a marine first so that's a little

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.620 
not a marine first so that's a little
bit<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.730> little<00:02:47.820> late<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.240> that's<00:02:48.390> going<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.540> be

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
bit of little late so that's going to be

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.110 
bit of little late so that's going to be
wow<00:02:49.020> it's<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.400> can't<00:02:50.700> emphasize<00:02:50.850> that

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
wow it's it I can't emphasize that

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.550 
wow it's it I can't emphasize that
actually<00:02:51.630> enough<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.990> he's<00:02:52.080> not<00:02:52.200> producing

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
actually enough that he's not producing

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.900 
actually enough that he's not producing
for<00:02:52.800> Marines<00:02:53.070> here<00:02:53.250> because<00:02:53.730> that's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
for Marines here because that's

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.310 
for Marines here because that's
essentially<00:02:54.210> 200<00:02:54.690> minerals<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.110> he's<00:02:55.230> going

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
essentially 200 minerals that he's going

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.110 
essentially 200 minerals that he's going
to<00:02:55.380> have<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.590> be<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.250> basically<00:02:56.520> use<00:02:56.640> elsewise

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
to have to be to basically use elsewise

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.880 
to have to be to basically use elsewise
another<00:02:57.810> factory<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> fast<00:02:58.500> expansion

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
another factory on a fast expansion

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.010 
another factory on a fast expansion
something<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.640> i<00:03:00.030> would<00:03:00.630> say<00:03:00.780> another

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
something like that i would say another

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.350 
something like that i would say another
and<00:03:01.380> he<00:03:01.620> probably<00:03:02.010> will<00:03:02.280> fast<00:03:02.520> expand<00:03:02.970> after

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
and he probably will fast expand after

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.700 
and he probably will fast expand after
seeing<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.720> early<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.230> now<00:03:04.410> as<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.650> see

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
seeing this early and now as you can see

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.710 
seeing this early and now as you can see
scouting<00:03:05.190> right<00:03:05.310> away<00:03:05.490> so<00:03:05.550> big<00:03:06.000> things<00:03:06.450> going

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
scouting right away so big things going

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.420 
scouting right away so big things going
really<00:03:06.840> for<00:03:07.110> Gigi's<00:03:07.350> way<00:03:07.500> here<00:03:07.710> seeing<00:03:08.400> that

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
really for Gigi's way here seeing that

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.710 
really for Gigi's way here seeing that
early<00:03:08.820> expansion<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.180> question<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.510> what

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
early expansion the question is what

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.480 
early expansion the question is what
does<00:03:09.840> he<00:03:09.930> do<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.140> deal<00:03:10.290> with<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.500> now<00:03:10.620> we'll<00:03:11.340> see

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
does he do to deal with it now we'll see

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.710 
does he do to deal with it now we'll see
if<00:03:11.550> he<00:03:11.640> puts<00:03:11.820> down<00:03:11.880> additional<00:03:12.150> expansion<00:03:12.660> you

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
if he puts down additional expansion you

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.230 
if he puts down additional expansion you
sending<00:03:13.020> in<00:03:13.110> SCV<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.590> direction<00:03:13.940> no<00:03:14.940> putting

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
sending in SCV that direction no putting

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.340 
sending in SCV that direction no putting
down<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> second<00:03:15.660> factory<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.110> he's<00:03:16.200> going<00:03:16.290> to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
down a second factory so he's going to

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.230 
down a second factory so he's going to
do<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.500> two<00:03:16.680> factory<00:03:17.010> push<00:03:17.190> here<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.850> second

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
do a two factory push here so second

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.340 
do a two factory push here so second
barracks<00:03:18.480> going<00:03:18.690> here<00:03:18.870> I'm<00:03:18.930> sorry<00:03:19.110> second

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
barracks going here I'm sorry second

barracks going here I'm sorry second
gateway<00:03:19.500> going<00:03:19.770> down<00:03:19.920> for<00:03:20.670> four<00:03:21.000> calamy<00:03:21.450> time

gateway going down for four calamy time

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.770 
gateway going down for four calamy time
now<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.050> again<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.100> huge<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.790> no

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
now that again this is huge that no

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.260 
now that again this is huge that no
first<00:03:25.050> four<00:03:25.320> Marines<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.860> really<00:03:26.550> big<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:27.000> think

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
first four Marines is really big I think

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.030 
first four Marines is really big I think
and<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.810> really<00:03:28.200> worked<00:03:28.380> out<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.620> for<00:03:28.770> Gigi's

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
and that really worked out in for Gigi's

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.590 
and that really worked out in for Gigi's
favor<00:03:29.280> here<00:03:29.520> you<00:03:29.610> got<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.880> factory<00:03:30.240> down<00:03:30.390> a

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
favor here you got that factory down a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.060 
favor here you got that factory down a
lot<00:03:31.020> faster<00:03:31.050> than<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.560> think<00:03:31.740> he<00:03:31.800> would<00:03:31.980> have

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
lot faster than I think he would have

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.190 
lot faster than I think he would have
well<00:03:32.640> he's<00:03:33.090> got<00:03:33.240> minerals<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.660> work<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.960> is

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
well he's got minerals to work this is

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.810 
well he's got minerals to work this is
what<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.440> should<00:03:34.620> say<00:03:34.800> actually<00:03:34.980> he<00:03:35.700> probably

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
what I should say actually he probably

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.520 
what I should say actually he probably
could<00:03:36.270> have<00:03:36.300> gotten<00:03:36.510> out<00:03:36.660> with<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:37.230> with<00:03:37.440> just

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
could have gotten out with it with just

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.960 
could have gotten out with it with just
a<00:03:37.650> couple<00:03:37.830> anyway<00:03:38.070> putting<00:03:38.400> down<00:03:38.520> a<00:03:38.550> bunker

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
a couple anyway putting down a bunker

also<00:03:55.500> going<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.650> give<00:03:55.800> Cal<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.130> impression

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
also going to give Cal the impression

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.949 
also going to give Cal the impression
that<00:03:56.550> hey<00:03:56.790> I'm<00:03:56.970> in<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.180> pretty<00:03:57.630> good<00:03:57.750> position

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
that hey I'm in a pretty good position

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.570 
that hey I'm in a pretty good position
here<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.440> did<00:03:58.590> produce<00:03:58.830> those<00:03:59.040> initial<00:03:59.400> four

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
here you did produce those initial four

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.980 
here you did produce those initial four
Marines<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.270> he<00:04:00.360> didn't<00:04:00.630> go<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.840> fast

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
Marines so he didn't go that fast

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.540 
Marines so he didn't go that fast
expansion<00:04:01.440> he<00:04:01.620> probably<00:04:01.860> isn't<00:04:02.220> going<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.459> go

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
expansion he probably isn't going to go

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.920 
expansion he probably isn't going to go
for<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.880> factory<00:04:03.180> push<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:03.690> he's<00:04:03.810> going

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
for a to factory push and so he's going

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.180 
for a to factory push and so he's going
to<00:04:03.990> be<00:04:04.110> somewhat<00:04:04.410> though<00:04:04.500> well<00:04:04.860> it's<00:04:05.010> going<00:04:05.130> to

push there's a citadel of a dune going

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.370 
push there's a citadel of a dune going
up<00:05:07.830> right<00:05:08.040> now<00:05:08.220> also<00:05:08.880> gas<00:05:09.090> going<00:05:09.330> down<00:05:09.600> it

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
up right now also gas going down it

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.740 
up right now also gas going down it
looks<00:05:10.650> like<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.100> now<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.310> will<00:05:12.030> see<00:05:12.240> for<00:05:12.540> GG

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
looks like and now I will see for GG

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.000 
looks like and now I will see for GG

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
like that didn't pick off that marine so

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.440 
like that didn't pick off that marine so
he<00:05:20.190> wants<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.460> get<00:05:20.550> asked<00:05:20.700> out<00:05:20.790> I<00:05:20.850> don't<00:05:21.330> think

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
he wants to get asked out I don't think

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.760

back off three tanks being produced it

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
back off three tanks being produced it
looks<00:05:24.210> like<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.419> double<00:05:24.540> upgrades<00:05:24.900> on<00:05:24.990> the

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
looks like the double upgrades on the

in<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.820> vultures<00:05:33.120> he's<00:05:33.570> in<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.720> pretty<00:05:33.840> good

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
in the vultures he's in a pretty good

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.000 
in the vultures he's in a pretty good
position<00:05:34.080> we'll<00:05:34.440> see<00:05:34.530> what<00:05:34.650> he's<00:05:34.740> going<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:34.919> be

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
position we'll see what he's going to be

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.770 
position we'll see what he's going to be
up<00:05:35.100> against<00:05:35.490> here<00:05:35.940> looks<00:05:36.390> like<00:05:36.510> there's<00:05:36.660> that

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
up against here looks like there's that

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.180 
up against here looks like there's that
single<00:05:37.050> true<00:05:37.169> goon<00:05:37.350> along<00:05:37.710> side<00:05:37.979> it's<00:05:38.100> going

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
single true goon along side it's going

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.490 
single true goon along side it's going
to<00:05:38.280> be<00:05:38.340> able<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.550> pick<00:05:38.669> that<00:05:38.700> marine<00:05:39.030> off<00:05:39.210> and

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
to be able to pick that marine off and

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.240 
to be able to pick that marine off and
hopefully<00:05:40.500> they'll<00:05:40.800> get<00:05:40.890> a<00:05:40.950> look<00:05:41.100> at<00:05:41.190> the

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
hopefully they'll get a look at the

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.350 
hopefully they'll get a look at the
front<00:05:41.340> door<00:05:41.490> Stargate<00:05:41.880> going<00:05:42.090> down<00:05:42.210> in<00:05:42.300> the

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
front door Stargate going down in the

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.090 
front door Stargate going down in the
meantime<00:05:42.770> unfortunately<00:05:43.770> don't<00:05:43.830> think<00:05:44.010> it's

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
meantime unfortunately don't think it's

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.020 
meantime unfortunately don't think it's
going<00:05:44.190> to<00:05:44.250> be<00:05:44.340> very<00:05:44.370> useful<00:05:44.550> it's<00:05:44.789> going<00:05:44.910> to<00:05:44.970> be

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
going to be very useful it's going to be

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.730 
going to be very useful it's going to be
he's<00:05:45.210> a<00:05:45.240> long<00:05:45.479> ways<00:05:45.660> off<00:05:45.810> a<00:05:45.870> fleet<00:05:46.260> beacon<00:05:46.560> here

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
he's a long ways off a fleet beacon here

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.930 
he's a long ways off a fleet beacon here
or<00:05:46.919> an<00:05:47.130> arbiter<00:05:47.460> or<00:05:47.520> anything<00:05:47.789> like<00:05:47.820> that

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
or an arbiter or anything like that

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.310 
or an arbiter or anything like that
looks<00:05:48.210> like<00:05:48.300> he's<00:05:48.419> got<00:05:48.570> five<00:05:48.780> dragoons<00:05:49.140> i

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
looks like he's got five dragoons i

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.990 
looks like he's got five dragoons i
think<00:05:49.470> is<00:05:49.560> for<00:05:49.800> dragoons<00:05:50.100> actually<00:05:50.430> up<00:05:50.760> on<00:05:50.880> his

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
think is for dragoons actually up on his

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.390 
think is for dragoons actually up on his
front<00:05:51.150> door<00:05:51.360> a<00:05:51.419> zealot<00:05:51.780> or<00:05:51.870> two<00:05:51.990> as<00:05:52.979> well<00:05:53.190> it

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
front door a zealot or two as well it

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.409 
front door a zealot or two as well it
looks<00:05:53.520> like<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.729> vulture<00:05:53.940> starting<00:05:54.180> to<00:05:54.270> push

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
looks like the vulture starting to push

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.090 
looks like the vulture starting to push
up<00:05:54.570> his<00:05:54.900> tanks<00:05:55.229> and<00:05:55.350> vultures<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.650> little<00:05:55.979> bit

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
up his tanks and vultures a little bit

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.380 
up his tanks and vultures a little bit
separated<00:05:56.490> which<00:05:56.669> kind<00:05:56.850> of<00:05:56.910> know<00:05:57.180> it<00:05:57.270> looks

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
separated which kind of know it looks

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.940 
separated which kind of know it looks
like<00:05:57.510> the<00:05:57.600> vulture<00:05:57.780> is<00:05:57.870> going<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.050> go<00:05:58.140> in<00:05:58.289> from

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
like the vulture is going to go in from

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.170 
like the vulture is going to go in from
an<00:05:59.070> odd<00:05:59.250> angle<00:05:59.520> they're<00:05:59.789> going<00:05:59.910> to<00:05:59.970> go<00:06:00.060> into

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
an odd angle they're going to go into

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.580 
an odd angle they're going to go into
six<00:06:00.419> o'clock<00:06:00.630> location<00:06:00.990> pilon<00:06:01.289> going<00:06:01.470> out<00:06:01.530> the

front door and that's only four dragons
in<00:06:02.880> a<00:06:02.940> singles<00:06:02.970> elit<00:06:03.479> there<00:06:03.660> the<00:06:04.350> vultures

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
in a singles elit there the vultures

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.750 
in a singles elit there the vultures
going<00:06:04.740> to<00:06:04.830> come<00:06:04.950> in<00:06:05.039> from<00:06:05.190> the<00:06:05.280> south<00:06:05.460> so<00:06:05.490> this

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
going to come in from the south so this

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.710 
going to come in from the south so this
is<00:06:05.820> going<00:06:05.940> to<00:06:06.000> look<00:06:06.090> somewhat<00:06:06.360> like<00:06:06.390> a<00:06:06.510> vulture

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
is going to look somewhat like a vulture

is going to look somewhat like a vulture
her<00:06:07.020> ass<00:06:07.250> and<00:06:08.250> then<00:06:08.430> this<00:06:08.700> is<00:06:08.880> interesting

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.800 
here and really a calfee commits there
it's<00:06:11.580> going<00:06:11.669> to<00:06:11.760> establish<00:06:12.150> a<00:06:12.360> nice<00:06:12.510> point<00:06:12.720> so

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
it's going to establish a nice point so

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.350 
it's going to establish a nice point so
now<00:06:12.870> results<00:06:13.770> 3g<00:06:14.460> goons<00:06:14.640> alongside<00:06:14.910> we'll<00:06:15.240> see

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
now results 3g goons alongside we'll see

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.730 
now results 3g goons alongside we'll see

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
damage to the cells looks like one of
