00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.859
 today we are going to learn how to make 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.990
 nice decorations but above all good 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.470
 cheap so you can decorate your house 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.470
 at Christmas 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.400
 good 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.699
 for today you need felt glue 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.500
 paint suitable for fabric and brushes thread 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:32.379
 a piece of tape needles and pins 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.970
 scissors a little bit of wadding and the pattern that 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.630
 You can download in the box 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.460
 description 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.920
 as always the first thing we're going to 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.070
 to do is cut the pattern and pass it to 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.230
 the cloth 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.020
 at the moment we are going to set everything aside and we 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.670
 let's meet with the snowman 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.040
 we will join the two parties we will put 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.870
 some pins and we'll start sewing by 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.620
 the lower half of the doll towards the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.620
 upper half 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.310
 once we get to that point 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.230
 we will move the ornament aside and 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.000
 we will cut a piece of tape that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.860
 we will put on the head of our doll 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.170
 so that later it serves us to be able 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.479
 hang it anywhere 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.490
 when you have put it crazy we will do 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.500
 almost to the end leaving a little 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 to fill in what we will then close 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.630
 the same way we sewed the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.630
 rest of the body 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.909
 now that you have all three ready is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.080
 time to put in the details on fabric 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.080
 with a little bit of glue 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.780
 the latter is not in the pattern but if 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.940
 you want them to be funnier 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.200
 you can add a tie to the cookie and 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.200
 snowman a scarf 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.970
 and finally and once the details 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.290
 in cloth are dry we are going to give you some 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.290
 touches of paint for for example 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.430
 put eyes to add shadows or paint 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.430
 your standard adorable fronts 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.320
 i 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.140
 I hope you liked this
