here we are so if you have messed up

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.609 
here we are so if you have messed up
your<00:00:17.760> settings<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.779> want<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.080> copy<00:00:19.320> my

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
to make my yaw rate a little bit slower

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.930 
to make my yaw rate a little bit slower
because<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.469> my<00:00:52.649> Pyro's<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.250> go<00:00:53.399> slower<00:00:53.699> in

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940

the beginning if you want your pirate to
be<00:00:56.430> faster<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.420> make<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.750> 100<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.260> more

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
be faster you can make it 100 or more

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.709 
be faster you can make it 100 or more
than<00:00:58.590> 100<00:00:58.980> if<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.340> make<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.000> lowers<00:01:00.539> I

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
than 100 if you make it the lowers I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.529 
than 100 if you make it the lowers I
mean<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.530> put<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> values<00:01:02.640> lower<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.270> end

point<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.019> channel<00:01:04.320> 4<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:05.189> pyro<00:01:05.400> rates<00:01:05.670> will

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
point of channel 4 your pyro rates will

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.570 
point of channel 4 your pyro rates will
go<00:01:06.060> slower<00:01:06.530> put<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:07.860> your<00:01:08.130> pyro<00:01:08.340> rates

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
go slower put it more your pyro rates

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.630 
go slower put it more your pyro rates
will<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.880> faster<00:01:09.330> ok<00:01:10.170> channel<00:01:10.770> 5<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.250> hundred

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
will be faster ok channel 5 is hundred

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.649 
will be faster ok channel 5 is hundred
six<00:01:12.210> hundred<00:01:12.450> seven<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.470> 100<00:01:14.119> next<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.240> stream

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
six hundred seven is 100 next is stream

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.340 
six hundred seven is 100 next is stream
channel<00:01:16.170> 1<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.380> minus<00:01:17.009> 4<00:01:17.390> channel<00:01:18.390> 2<00:01:18.630> channel<00:01:18.659> 3

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
channel 1 is minus 4 channel 2 channel 3

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.440 
channel 1 is minus 4 channel 2 channel 3
basically<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.369> don't<00:01:20.610> want<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.000> follow<00:01:21.240> my

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
basically you don't want to follow my

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.390 
basically you don't want to follow my
trims<00:01:21.780> because<00:01:22.200> trims<00:01:22.710> are<00:01:22.890> according<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
trims because trims are according to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.300 
trims because trims are according to
your<00:01:23.610> helicopter<00:01:23.790> behavior<00:01:24.920> after<00:01:25.920> trim<00:01:26.159> we

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
your helicopter behavior after trim we

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.359 
your helicopter behavior after trim we
are<00:01:26.400> coming<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.850> dual<00:01:27.210> rates<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.950> see

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
are coming to dual rates so you can see

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.030 
are coming to dual rates so you can see
my<00:01:29.610> dual<00:01:29.909> rate<00:01:30.119> settings<00:01:32.000> LR<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.150> an<00:01:33.360> elevator

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
my dual rate settings LR on an elevator

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:42.560 
my dual rate settings LR on an elevator
okay<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.829> rather<00:01:38.960> then<00:01:39.960> come<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.409> Expo<00:01:41.570> I'm

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
okay and rather then come to Expo I'm

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.219 
okay and rather then come to Expo I'm
not<00:01:42.840> using<00:01:43.079> any<00:01:43.530> Expo<00:01:44.570> finally<00:01:45.570> throttle<00:01:45.990> hold

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
not using any Expo finally throttle hold

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.190 
not using any Expo finally throttle hold
the<00:01:47.189> stuff<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.840> value<00:01:49.079> is

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the stuff is like the value is

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.310 
the stuff is like the value is
completely<00:01:49.740> zero<00:01:50.009> then<00:01:50.880> gyro<00:01:51.270> normal<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.810> 100%

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
completely zero then gyro normal is 100%

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.399 
completely zero then gyro normal is 100%
idle<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.250> 70<00:01:53.729> percent<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.840> finally<00:01:55.290> they

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
idle up is 70 percent then finally they

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.030 
idle up is 70 percent then finally they
have<00:01:55.530> aux<00:01:55.799> which<00:01:56.509> such<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:58.820> throttle<00:01:59.820> normal

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
have aux which such to throttle normal

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.380 
have aux which such to throttle normal
25<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> throttle<00:02:02.880> curve<00:02:03.799> 50<00:02:05.240> 7500<00:02:06.240> so

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
25 this is the throttle curve 50 7500 so

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.520 
25 this is the throttle curve 50 7500 so
that's<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.750> nice<00:02:06.930> linear<00:02:07.829> curve<00:02:08.450> okay<00:02:09.500> then

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that's a nice linear curve okay then

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.940 
that's a nice linear curve okay then
idle<00:02:10.920> up<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.610> hundred

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
idle up is hundred

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.530 
idle up is hundred
I'll<00:02:13.870> 300<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.650> all<00:02:15.890> 100<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.640> my<00:02:16.880> idle<00:02:17.209> up<00:02:17.330> are

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
I'll 300 it's all 100 so my idle up are

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.770 
I'll 300 it's all 100 so my idle up are
completely<00:02:18.290> hundred<00:02:19.209> because<00:02:20.209> my<00:02:20.420> motor<00:02:20.630> is

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
completely hundred because my motor is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.780 
completely hundred because my motor is
not<00:02:20.930> powerful<00:02:21.260> enough<00:02:21.470> then<00:02:22.160> we<00:02:22.370> come<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
not powerful enough then we come to the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.980 
not powerful enough then we come to the
pitch<00:02:23.000> normal<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.660> 38<00:02:24.170> 46<00:02:25.209> 60<00:02:26.209> 80<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:27.760> hand

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
pitch normal is 38 46 60 80 and a hand

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.860 
pitch normal is 38 46 60 80 and a hand
idle<00:02:29.990> up<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.290> zero<00:02:30.620> 25<00:02:31.280> 50<00:02:31.790> 75<00:02:31.820> hundred<00:02:32.690> which

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
idle up is zero 25 50 75 hundred which

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.670 
idle up is zero 25 50 75 hundred which
is<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.230> linear<00:02:33.500> curve<00:02:34.000> okay<00:02:35.000> however<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:36.170> also<00:02:36.440> a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
is a linear curve okay however is also a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.570 
is a linear curve okay however is also a
linear<00:02:37.160> curve<00:02:38.320> next<00:02:39.320> we<00:02:39.440> come<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:40.160> swash

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
linear curve next we come to the swash

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.330 
linear curve next we come to the swash
so<00:02:41.030> L<00:02:41.239> are<00:02:41.360> honest<00:02:41.660> eighty<00:02:41.930> elevator<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:43.010> 80

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
so L are honest eighty elevator is 80

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.290 
so L are honest eighty elevator is 80
and<00:02:43.790> pitch<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:45.020> 100<00:02:45.739> percent<00:02:46.160> it's<00:02:46.700> positive

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
and pitch is 100 percent it's positive

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.900 
and pitch is 100 percent it's positive
but<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:47.900> might<00:02:48.260> want<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.560> do<00:02:48.739> them<00:02:49.160> negative

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
but you might want to do them negative

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.449 
but you might want to do them negative
depending<00:02:50.420> on<00:02:50.750> your<00:02:51.470> helicopter<00:02:52.100> swash

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
depending on your helicopter swash

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
movement back to the river's nothing

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.560 
movement back to the river's nothing
much<00:02:55.730> left<00:02:55.900> that's<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.110> for<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.709> kts<00:02:58.360> 450s<00:02:59.360> d

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
much left that's it for the kts 450s d

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.199 
much left that's it for the kts 450s d
setup<00:02:59.930> on<00:03:00.200> kts<00:03:00.709> radio<00:03:01.130> nothing<00:03:01.700> much
