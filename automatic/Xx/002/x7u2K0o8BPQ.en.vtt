00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.660
 Yes Good evening length is 100 videos going right just achieved 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.790
 I everyone in the world year 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.040
 Thanks 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.300
 Not I was going to talk 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.090
 Congratulations at the event 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:23.270
 People from everyone 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.280
 Backed by everyone of rice who we are very impressed 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.510
 From now on everyone comments etc 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.440
 Investigation Division 1 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.200
 Have 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.850
 I think this time 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.970
 Well I will go for a while at the 1001st time to commemorate the 101st time 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.510
 Click here 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:46.250
 High voltage La of the video does not come from around before last 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:50.079
 6 Boy and here Kawada said also he certainly sounded in 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:54.770
 Before sounding about 28,300 rpm 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.340
 It is a system of about 3 alkaline battery 2 bolts 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.340
 1,300 yen 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:07.010
 I put it in the freezer and rang 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.400
 Oh here in Fes in the eye were servants I You're the same Pau also is between the two 3 alkaline batteries 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.640
 29,000 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.500
 pop 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.090
 Non-key 300 yen is quite expensive 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.759
 Well 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.990
 Let me know this time and let me know the result that I really want to be here. 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.259
 Do you think 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.549
 At first we think to actually run 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.230
 I would like to aim for the number of revolutions in NiMH Japan 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.060
 so 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.450
 After that 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:41.460
 It is with 2 alkaline batteries 35 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:45.040
 I'd like to try it First of all, I think that it is an earthquake because of this nickel hydrogen 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.370
 [musics] 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:54.470
 It's power, which sounded in Fuwaa 0 Toko with + 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:57.070
 It is a nickel-hydrogen secondary This I think would like to stretched the number of revolutions of here. 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:20.280
 I go to the other party 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:22.470
 [musics] 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.810
 It is around 26000 yen 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.040
 Then it rang with this freezer with 2 alkaline batteries 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.440
 i would like to go pada work 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.500
 [musics] 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.949
 of 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.949
 [musics] 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.909
 Spock 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.909
 There Huh 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.810
 [musics] 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:04.209
 It is 29800 here, too, does not change 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:09.510
 Was also species's power you play with your long-awaited here of 6 volts in Yes 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.390
 Would like to use nickel hydrogen 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.660
 Chez 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.660
 of 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.330
 [musics] 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.090
 [musics] 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.600
 [musics] 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:49.850
 It is around 25,300 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:53.750
 I think it will be understood by alkaline batteries next whether it is getting faster 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:04:00.890
 Yes Thank you for very much you waiting I'm here is the platform favorite 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.880
 The power Shimoda, which sounded in the six goals and I want to turn in alkaline batteries two's bolt 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.250
 think 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.250
 Here are all the results 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.310
 Is it more than 28,300? 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.400
 Let's do it 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.789
 Of one 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.789
 [musics] 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.740
 [musics] 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.170
 Somewhat unstable at 29700 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:24.130
 It's a power that I used to say that this 6-volt whistling sound sounds like a motor. 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:33.370
 Finally up to nearly 29,800 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:33.620
 I went around, but I think it's still unstable , right after using it for that devil 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.080
 leg 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.250
 It did not wander at all be great stable when it was about the first to 28300 rotation 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.320
 But now 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:49.610
 What do is this it is seen Nante's Gu' in Well raised or lowered something stain seeds 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:53.610
 Will it or I just somehow I is the imagination to see this 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:59.610
 Certainly the brush has been also felt good to wear while I 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:03.870
 I think you still wonder if the side of the person as electricity has become unstable and 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:07.169
 This is a bit because Nara City also has the purpose of stabilizing itself after all 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.289
 It is after not say yet whether good or bad What also 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:14.119
 To experiment 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:17.869
 Though it became high rotation well, it may have been able to prove well though 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:23.419
 Was worn say if we actually use 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:29.310
 When I bought it, I think I should use salt if this is the case . 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:33.390
 I Why Well, things like that I Toka use from now on toward the this or I implementation 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.250
 It may not be possible This is a little too unstable I 've come up after a storm 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:40.440
 I have a little trouble setting 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:42.870
 Stable and wonder if an important point that Rutteyuu I believe because this is a little 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:49.830
 Kedomo after completion do not use 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:54.330
 As a result it becomes high rotation motor and advances the break in Well high voltage certainly 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:58.470
 I think I can say that this 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:02.860
 However after and that it is a power dash motor 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:07.960
 Just because it's not a new motor 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:11.199
 If you only want to be careful there, it is not always the same result 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.560
 It is not always the case, so when you refer to it 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:18.189
 I would like to ask you attention 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:22.849
 This is the power of this motor and yes 

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:26.810
 I say that I tried to sound at 6 volts with something suspicious equipment 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:49.650
 It was animation of result It is good to see again 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:49.650
