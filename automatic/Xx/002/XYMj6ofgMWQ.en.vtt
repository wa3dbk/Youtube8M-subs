things<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.600> I've<00:03:15.080> come<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.500> find<00:03:15.770> since

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
things that I've come to find since

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.360 
things that I've come to find since
purchasing<00:03:17.060> my<00:03:17.270> GoPro<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:18.110> that<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:19.130> seems

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
purchasing my GoPro is that it seems

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.950 
purchasing my GoPro is that it seems
like<00:03:19.490> you<00:03:19.730> can<00:03:19.910> never<00:03:20.030> have<00:03:20.300> enough<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.780> these

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
like you can never have enough of these

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.890 
like you can never have enough of these
thumb<00:03:21.440> screws<00:03:21.470> they<00:03:22.250> tend<00:03:23.210> not<00:03:23.270> to<00:03:23.390> include

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
thumb screws they tend not to include

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.050 
thumb screws they tend not to include
them<00:03:24.140> with<00:03:24.320> everything<00:03:24.820> when<00:03:25.820> you<00:03:25.910> buy

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
them with everything when you buy

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.000 
them with everything when you buy
certain<00:03:26.480> mounts<00:03:26.960> there<00:03:27.170> seems<00:03:27.650> like<00:03:27.800> there's

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
certain mounts there seems like there's

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.830 
certain mounts there seems like there's
always<00:03:28.160> additional<00:03:28.640> parts<00:03:29.240> you<00:03:29.390> needed<00:03:29.720> and

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
always additional parts you needed and

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.700 
always additional parts you needed and
this<00:03:29.930> seems<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.350> be<00:03:30.380> really<00:03:30.770> one<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.010> them

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
this seems to be really one of them

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.780 
this seems to be really one of them
because<00:03:33.710> there's<00:03:33.980> really<00:03:34.160> nothing<00:03:34.580> special

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
because there's really nothing special

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.530 
because there's really nothing special
it's<00:03:35.210> like<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.510> little<00:03:35.750> bolt<00:03:36.110> with<00:03:37.540> plastic

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
it's like a little bolt with plastic

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.500 
it's like a little bolt with plastic
handles<00:03:38.930> on<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.320> hand<00:03:39.830> for<00:03:40.100> your<00:03:40.240> to<00:03:41.240> be<00:03:41.360> able

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
handles on the hand for your to be able

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.880 
handles on the hand for your to be able
to<00:03:41.660> grip<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.410> tighten<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.220> up<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:44.740> let's<00:03:45.740> just

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
to grip it tighten it up and let's just

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.550 
to grip it tighten it up and let's just
go<00:03:46.070> ahead<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.310> try<00:03:46.490> it<00:03:46.550> on<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:48.200> particular

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
go ahead and try it on this particular

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.860 
go ahead and try it on this particular
stand<00:03:49.100> here<00:03:50.500> screws<00:03:51.500> in<00:03:51.830> so

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
stand here screws in so

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.140 

now<00:03:54.379> three<00:03:54.620> of<00:03:54.680> these<00:03:54.920> are<00:03:55.220> actually<00:03:55.760> longer

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
now three of these are actually longer

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.339 
now three of these are actually longer
than<00:03:59.890> one<00:04:00.890> as<00:04:01.849> you<00:04:02.030> can<00:04:02.209> see<00:04:02.390> once<00:04:02.660> shorter

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
than one as you can see once shorter

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.820 
than one as you can see once shorter
than<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:04.010> others<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.780> I<00:04:06.140> really<00:04:06.530> don't<00:04:06.709> know

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
than the others and I really don't know

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.949 
than the others and I really don't know
why<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.280> is<00:04:07.489> but<00:04:11.319> works

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
why that is but works

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.779 
why that is but works
so<00:04:16.199> that's<00:04:17.199> good<00:04:17.500> let's<00:04:17.949> take<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.340> look<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:18.669> the

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
so that's good let's take a look in the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.770 
so that's good let's take a look in the
other<00:04:19.269> package<00:04:20.970> here<00:04:21.970> we<00:04:22.090> have<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.270> couple<00:04:22.570> of

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
other package here we have a couple of

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.050 
other package here we have a couple of
the<00:04:24.930> they<00:04:25.930> call<00:04:26.169> it<00:04:26.289> a<00:04:26.350> pivot<00:04:26.680> arm<00:04:26.860> assembly

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.249 

kind<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.150> got<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.270> little<00:04:31.419> bag<00:04:31.660> it's<00:04:31.930> out<00:04:32.080> of<00:04:32.110> a

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
kind of got a little bag it's out of a

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.060 
kind of got a little bag it's out of a
bag<00:04:33.930> these<00:04:34.930> are<00:04:35.110> really<00:04:35.350> good<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.650> allows<00:04:35.830> you

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
bag these are really good it allows you

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.159 
bag these are really good it allows you
to<00:04:36.190> be<00:04:36.310> able<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.729> you<00:04:36.910> get<00:04:37.330> more<00:04:37.479> flexibility

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
to be able to you get more flexibility

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.370 
to be able to you get more flexibility
with<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.500> camera<00:04:40.949> you<00:04:41.949> can<00:04:42.160> kind<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.490> see<00:04:42.759> that

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
with the camera you can kind of see that

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.860 
with the camera you can kind of see that
the<00:04:44.380> way<00:04:44.560> that<00:04:44.770> these<00:04:44.949> are<00:04:45.389> designed<00:04:48.810> so<00:04:49.810> I'm

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
the way that these are designed so I'm

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.680 
the way that these are designed so I'm
being<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.139> kid<00:04:50.410> being<00:04:50.680> able<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.919> build<00:04:51.190> stuff<00:04:51.690> so

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
being a kid being able to build stuff so

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.300 
being a kid being able to build stuff so
you<00:04:52.780> basically<00:04:53.259> you<00:04:53.440> insert<00:04:55.680> like<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:57.009> and

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
you basically you insert like that and

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.710 
you basically you insert like that and
then<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.360> would<00:04:58.509> take<00:04:58.690> one<00:04:58.930> of<00:04:58.990> these

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.989 

screw<00:05:05.470> that<00:05:05.500> into<00:05:05.950> that

00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:08.999 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:16.279 

and<00:05:10.159> and<00:05:11.159> this<00:05:11.459> part<00:05:11.819> would<00:05:14.119> like<00:05:15.119> Legos<00:05:15.569> and

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
and and this part would like Legos and

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.879 
and and this part would like Legos and
go<00:05:16.439> into<00:05:16.619> that

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.149 

and<00:05:23.460> let's<00:05:24.389> see<00:05:24.719> here<00:05:25.050> this<00:05:25.650> was<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:25.919> little<00:05:26.069> bit

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
and let's see here this was a little bit

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:32.110 
and let's see here this was a little bit
tight<00:05:26.659> that's<00:05:27.659> what<00:05:27.870> I<00:05:27.930> get<00:05:28.110> started

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.600 

so<00:05:32.750> yeah<00:05:32.900> there<00:05:33.260> it<00:05:33.380> goes<00:05:33.410> it's<00:05:34.160> just<00:05:34.220> longer

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
so yeah there it goes it's just longer

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.260 
so yeah there it goes it's just longer
taking<00:05:35.120> longer<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.449> write<00:05:35.930> it<00:05:36.050> through<00:05:37.270> so

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
taking longer to write it through so

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.210 
taking longer to write it through so
that<00:05:38.300> goes<00:05:38.510> like<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:38.780> so<00:05:39.199> as<00:05:39.320> you<00:05:39.500> can<00:05:39.710> see<00:05:39.949> it

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
that goes like that so as you can see it

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.820 
that goes like that so as you can see it
gives<00:05:40.460> you<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:41.419> know<00:05:41.570> quite<00:05:42.530> a<00:05:42.560> bit<00:05:42.620> of

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
gives you you know quite a bit of

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.060 
gives you you know quite a bit of
flexibility<00:05:43.400> there<00:05:44.080> of<00:05:45.080> course<00:05:45.350> a<00:05:45.470> few<00:05:45.680> extra

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
flexibility there of course a few extra

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.180 
flexibility there of course a few extra
so<00:05:46.449> that's<00:05:47.449> a<00:05:47.570> look<00:05:47.720> at<00:05:47.870> that<00:05:48.080> these<00:05:48.440> are<00:05:48.800> the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
so that's a look at that these are the

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.140 
so that's a look at that these are the
GoPro<00:05:49.760> mount<00:05:50.210> 3-way<00:05:50.870> pivot<00:05:51.229> arm<00:05:51.620> assembly
