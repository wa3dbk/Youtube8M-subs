00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
because I didn't think there was enough

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.259 
because I didn't think there was enough
evidence<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.279> show<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.850> thing<00:00:24.090> is

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
evidence to show that this thing is

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.300 
evidence to show that this thing is

Wally<00:01:34.799> originally<00:01:35.460> had<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.820> was<00:01:35.909> a

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
Wally originally had that was a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.410 
Wally originally had that was a
signature<00:01:36.390> Pokemon<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.070> don't<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:39.180> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
signature Pokemon so I don't know like I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.730 
signature Pokemon so I don't know like I
really<00:01:39.780> wish<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.409> because

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
really wish it was like that because

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.469 
really wish it was like that because
that<00:01:41.130> would<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.430> definitely<00:01:41.700> shown<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.329> we

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that would have definitely shown that we

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.969 
that would have definitely shown that we
were<00:01:42.600> getting<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> mega<00:01:43.110> Gardevoir<00:01:43.530> Pokemon

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
were getting a mega Gardevoir Pokemon

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.410 
were getting a mega Gardevoir Pokemon
Omega<00:01:44.009> Ruby<00:01:44.280> enough<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> set<00:01:44.909> fire<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.329> we

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
Omega Ruby enough to set fire but we

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.539 
Omega Ruby enough to set fire but we
already<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.649> now<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
already have one so now it's just the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.710 
already have one so now it's just the
question<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.970> whether<00:01:48.149> we're<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> get<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
question of whether we're going to get a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.380 
question of whether we're going to get a
big<00:01:48.899> late<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:50.009> are<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> couple<00:01:51.090> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
big late there are like a couple of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.420 
big late there are like a couple of
reasons<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> why<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.250> there

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
reasons as to why I think that there

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.069 
reasons as to why I think that there
might<00:01:53.759> not<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.180> mega<00:01:54.420> evolution<00:01:54.899> for

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
might not be a mega evolution for

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.780 
might not be a mega evolution for
delayed<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.560> let's<00:01:55.710> get<00:01:55.829> into<00:01:55.890> those<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.759> only

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
delayed so let's get into those the only

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.490 
delayed so let's get into those the only
couple<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.479> reasons<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.049> why<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.320> think

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
couple of reasons as to why I think

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.260 
couple of reasons as to why I think
there<00:01:58.829> won't<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> mega<00:01:59.280> evolution<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.119> this

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
there won't be a mega evolution for this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.719 
there won't be a mega evolution for this
guy<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.689> because<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.619> already<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:02.189> nine

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
guy is because we already have nine

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.840 
guy is because we already have nine

going to be coming soon we have

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.920 
going to be coming soon we have
metagross<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.430> also<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.900> latios<00:02:18.900> and

metagross and we also have latios and
latias<00:02:19.740> which<00:02:20.190> are<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.820> debut<00:02:21.300> we<00:02:21.750> don't

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
latias which are going to debut we don't

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.330 
latias which are going to debut we don't
we<00:02:22.080> don't<00:02:22.290> know<00:02:22.410> when<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.830> they<00:02:23.130> actually

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
we don't know when but they actually

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.510 
we don't know when but they actually
exist<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.780> that's<00:02:25.380> like<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> only

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
exist so that's like one of the only

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.670 
exist so that's like one of the only
things<00:02:27.060> because<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.540> think<00:02:27.600> psychic<00:02:28.290> has<00:02:28.500> like

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
things because I think psychic has like

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.650 
things because I think psychic has like
one<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.190> most<00:02:29.430> like<00:02:29.640> mega<00:02:29.910> evolution<00:02:30.480> like

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
one of the most like mega evolution like

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.300 
one of the most like mega evolution like
it's<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.410> biggest<00:02:31.590> mega<00:02:31.860> evolution

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
it's like the biggest mega evolution

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.890 
it's like the biggest mega evolution
typing<00:02:32.640> right<00:02:32.820> now<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.000> might<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.510> wrong<00:02:33.720> on

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
typing right now I might be wrong on

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.720 
typing right now I might be wrong on
that<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:34.110> might<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.740> might<00:02:35.280> be<00:02:35.460> some<00:02:35.700> other

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
that I might it might be some other

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.490 
that I might it might be some other
typing<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.420> know<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:36.870> definitely<00:02:37.050> up

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
typing but I know it's definitely up

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.100 
typing but I know it's definitely up
there<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.640> might<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.030> one<00:02:39.390> drawback<00:02:39.750> as

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
there so that might be one drawback as

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.960 
there so that might be one drawback as
to<00:02:40.230> why<00:02:40.350> they<00:02:40.560> don't<00:02:40.770> do<00:02:40.890> make<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.190> Gallade<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
to why they don't do make it Gallade the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.310 
to why they don't do make it Gallade the
other<00:02:42.120> drawback<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.720> could<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:42.990> thought<00:02:43.170> it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
other drawback I could have thought it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.680 
other drawback I could have thought it
was<00:02:43.500> maybe<00:02:43.770> if<00:02:44.100> there<00:02:44.430> was<00:02:44.640> some<00:02:44.940> sort<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.300> sin

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
was maybe if there was some sort of sin

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.450 
was maybe if there was some sort of sin
Oh<00:02:45.840> remake<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.590> don't<00:02:46.800> know<00:02:46.980> if<00:02:47.130> there<00:02:47.280> will

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
Oh remake and I don't know if there will

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.310 
Oh remake and I don't know if there will
be<00:02:47.520> or<00:02:47.760> not<00:02:47.820> it's<00:02:48.090> too<00:02:48.330> far<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.630> tell<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.170> at

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
be or not it's too far to tell it's at

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.350 
be or not it's too far to tell it's at
least<00:02:49.590> two<00:02:49.950> years<00:02:50.160> away<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.700> they<00:02:50.880> were<00:02:50.940> gonna

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
least two years away if they were gonna

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.770 
least two years away if they were gonna
do<00:02:51.540> one<00:02:52.310> but<00:02:53.310> if<00:02:53.460> there<00:02:53.640> was<00:02:53.850> then<00:02:54.330> they<00:02:54.720> could

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
do one but if there was then they could

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.900 
do one but if there was then they could
also<00:02:55.020> say<00:02:55.320> mega<00:02:55.650> delayed<00:02:56.070> for<00:02:56.430> them<00:02:56.640> because

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
also say mega delayed for them because

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.760 
also say mega delayed for them because
again<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:57.630> where<00:02:57.930> make<00:02:58.140> accolade<00:02:58.530> came

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770

again that's where make accolade came
from<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.550> was<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.270> know<00:03:00.390> from<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.380> know<00:03:01.500> sin

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
from it was you know from you know sin

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.650 
from it was you know from you know sin
of<00:03:01.950> course<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:02.460> now<00:03:02.640> it's<00:03:03.150> kind<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.510> different

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
of course but now it's kind of different

to<00:03:15.630> do<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.110> post<00:03:16.290> game<00:03:16.500> but<00:03:16.680> i'm<00:03:16.770> pretty

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
to do that to a post game but i'm pretty

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.470 
to do that to a post game but i'm pretty
sure<00:03:17.400> you'll<00:03:17.610> be<00:03:17.760> able<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.240> during

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
sure you'll be able to do that during

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.050 
sure you'll be able to do that during
the<00:03:18.630> middle<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.870> game<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.670> big<00:03:20.880> question

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
the middle of game so the big question

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.540 
the middle of game so the big question
is<00:03:21.390> though<00:03:21.660> if<00:03:21.930> Glade<00:03:22.680> does<00:03:22.980> get<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> mega

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
is though if Glade does get a mega

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.330 
is though if Glade does get a mega
evolution<00:03:24.240> well<00:03:24.600> Walley<00:03:24.900> be<00:03:25.230> using<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.770> that's

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
evolution well Walley be using it that's

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.810 
evolution well Walley be using it that's
a<00:03:26.490> good<00:03:26.700> question<00:03:27.030> because<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.110> said<00:03:28.170> like

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
a good question because like I said like

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.970 
a good question because like I said like
wall-e<00:03:29.820> originally<00:03:30.540> had<00:03:30.750> Gardevoir<00:03:31.320> so<00:03:31.680> would

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
wall-e originally had Gardevoir so would

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.620 
wall-e originally had Gardevoir so would
they<00:03:32.130> change<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.700> story<00:03:33.030> up<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.240> little<00:03:33.480> bit

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
they change that story up a little bit

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.630 
they change that story up a little bit
and<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.320> know<00:03:34.470> instead<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.980> had<00:03:35.160> being<00:03:35.400> guard

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
and you know instead of had being guard

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.240 
and you know instead of had being guard
for<00:03:35.880> they<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.150> Glade<00:03:36.540> maybe<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.590> because<00:03:38.010> like

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
for they do Glade maybe so because like

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.890 
for they do Glade maybe so because like
wall-e<00:03:38.550> even<00:03:38.970> though<00:03:39.060> he's<00:03:39.270> like<00:03:39.480> kind<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.780> a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
wall-e even though he's like kind of a

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.270 
wall-e even though he's like kind of a
big<00:03:40.080> part<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.440> story<00:03:40.740> we<00:03:40.980> didn't<00:03:41.190> really

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
big part of the story we didn't really

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.620 
big part of the story we didn't really
see<00:03:41.520> much<00:03:41.550> of<00:03:41.730> his<00:03:41.910> guard<00:03:42.120> bar<00:03:42.330> at<00:03:42.420> all<00:03:42.510> i<00:03:42.540> think

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
see much of his guard bar at all i think

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.470 
see much of his guard bar at all i think
we<00:03:42.870> only<00:03:43.050> sell<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.620> one<00:03:43.920> battle<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:45.000> for<00:03:45.330> it

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
we only sell it in one battle so for it

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.210 
we only sell it in one battle so for it
not<00:03:45.660> being<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.110> significant<00:03:46.920> they<00:03:47.070> can

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
not being so significant they can

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.440 
not being so significant they can
probably<00:03:47.520> just<00:03:47.610> change<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.030> up<00:03:48.180> if<00:03:48.330> they

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
probably just change this up if they

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.240 
probably just change this up if they
wanted<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.870> put<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.560> mega<00:03:49.770> blade<00:03:50.070> and

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
wanted to and put in a mega blade and

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.100 
wanted to and put in a mega blade and
stuff<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.490> mega<00:03:50.700> Gardevoir<00:03:51.180> because<00:03:51.810> keep<00:03:52.020> in

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
stuff a mega Gardevoir because keep in

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.690 
stuff a mega Gardevoir because keep in
mind<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:52.740> know<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.040> champion<00:03:53.400> have<00:03:53.520> mega

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
mind you know the champion have mega

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.990 
mind you know the champion have mega
Gardevoir<00:03:54.150> for<00:03:54.330> pokemon<00:03:54.690> X&amp;Y<00:03:54.960> um<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.700> feel

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
Gardevoir for pokemon X&amp;Y um so I feel

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.280 
Gardevoir for pokemon X&amp;Y um so I feel
like<00:03:57.120> they're<00:03:57.480> we're<00:03:57.690> gonna<00:03:57.840> do<00:03:58.020> make<00:03:58.200> it

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
like they're we're gonna do make it

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.710 
like they're we're gonna do make it
delayed<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.890> Wally<00:03:59.490> would<00:03:59.790> probably<00:04:00.480> have

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
delayed that Wally would probably have

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.690 
delayed that Wally would probably have
it<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.200> we'll<00:04:01.800> just<00:04:01.830> have<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.190> see<00:04:02.250> hopefully

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
it so we'll just have to see hopefully

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.610 
it so we'll just have to see hopefully
that<00:04:03.210> all<00:04:03.360> works<00:04:03.630> out<00:04:03.810> because<00:04:03.960> I<00:04:04.200> would<00:04:04.440> like

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
that all works out because I would like

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.530 
that all works out because I would like
to<00:04:04.740> see<00:04:04.860> this<00:04:05.040> thing<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.880> know<00:04:05.910> just<00:04:06.300> see
