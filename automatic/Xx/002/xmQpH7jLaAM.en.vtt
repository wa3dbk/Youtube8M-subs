00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.300
 coach what did you think of this party 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.020
 all number of very good moments the amx some also some lesser moments 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.929
 it happened very sharply every now and then 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.640
 very good forward football 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.849
 a 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.759
 that is still 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.409
 that is an improvement 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.359
 in some things 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.109
 yes we did not take the lead in the second half but actually if you get the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.340
 igz had a more limited opinion that we have a 7 8 chance of playing football together 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.330
 yes we have also created good opportunities 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.780
 that is that is very positive 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.850
 you can always miss one or two or 3 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.790
 but at least we have created many opportunities and that is very bad 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.170
 positive 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.440
 first there would also be a few chances given away 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.350
 and that is a bit of the negative side 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.560
 I don't like a bomb to give away too many chances in people's spaces 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.560
 to give 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.880
 but 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.910
 with the opportunity created in the first half the second half already and that is 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.810
 good 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.579
 yes we also keep the zero that is also important that does 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.279
 now as a dutch coach you will find it turned out to be zero or are you going 

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:15.359
 Dutch principle we just have to make more domes than the opponent 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.549
 that is not so with me the maker and dodge no more 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.840
 an opponent 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 always try to keep the zero which is the most important 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.790
 we are professionals buyers come we don't mind you not 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.800
 kill that score and third 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.900
 That is not possible 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.030
 you know you have to give away as little as possible and as much as possible 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.159
 yes to step into the ambiance in the ballroom of darfur 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.219
 bags insider other good old days 11,500 people stop around the season 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.190
 yet we were waiting for it 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.800
 well i have the honor i actually didn't expect you at all then 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.280
 terrible top 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.470
 and and and very much the nice things to see and we need it too 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.140
 we also need the twelfth man 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.460
 Everyone who is in the future is already intimidated by being public 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.620
 so the duo needed 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.660
 yes very happy 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.319
 very happy with the people who came the thank you 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.409
 and we need you so keep the team working out
