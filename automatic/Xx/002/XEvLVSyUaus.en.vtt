00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.130 

my<00:00:03.360> whole<00:00:03.570> proposition<00:00:04.080> was<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:05.569> fuse<00:00:06.569> fashion

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
my whole proposition was to fuse fashion

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.720 
my whole proposition was to fuse fashion
in<00:00:07.319> chocolate<00:00:07.799> so<00:00:07.950> that's<00:00:08.130> why<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> call<00:00:08.550> myself

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
in chocolate so that's why I call myself

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.209 
in chocolate so that's why I call myself
a<00:00:08.970> coke<00:00:09.150> lanista<00:00:12.259> one<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> things<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.950> love

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
a coke lanista one of the things I love

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.039 
a coke lanista one of the things I love
the<00:00:14.610> best<00:00:14.790> about<00:00:14.880> designing<00:00:15.360> chocolate<00:00:15.900> is

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
the best about designing chocolate is

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.429 
the best about designing chocolate is
just<00:00:16.619> using<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.820> as<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.150> canvas<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.020> it's

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
just using it as a canvas and it's

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.859 
just using it as a canvas and it's
essentially<00:00:19.890> art<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.460> as<00:00:21.090> designer<00:00:21.600> it's

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
essentially art and as designer it's

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.470 
essentially art and as designer it's
great<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.650> dimension<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.400> flavor<00:00:23.789> on

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
great I have that dimension of flavor on

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:41.869 
great I have that dimension of flavor on
top<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:25.140> color<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.980> shapes<00:00:40.399> we<00:00:41.399> use

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
top of color and shapes we use

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.819 
top of color and shapes we use
exclusively<00:00:42.210> French<00:00:42.870> chocolate<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.620> we

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
exclusively French chocolate and we

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.619 
exclusively French chocolate and we
believe<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> best<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> world

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
believe it it's the best in the world

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.049 
believe it it's the best in the world
and<00:00:45.989> we're<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:46.680> letting<00:00:47.100> totally<00:00:47.760> great

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

ingredients and for our chocolate every

chocolate<00:00:53.910> has<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> different<00:00:54.899> process

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
chocolate has a different process

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.139 
chocolate has a different process
depending<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> piece<00:00:56.489> we're<00:00:56.730> creating

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
depending on the piece we're creating

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.020 
depending on the piece we're creating
but<00:00:57.780> generally<00:00:58.230> our<00:00:58.680> process<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.760> have

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
but generally our process is we have

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.819 
but generally our process is we have
these<00:01:00.329> fallen<00:01:00.600> cognitive<00:01:00.960> molds<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.680> use

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
these fallen cognitive molds that we use

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.830 
these fallen cognitive molds that we use
to<00:01:02.100> make<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> chocolate<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:03.180> will<00:01:03.329> hand<00:01:03.570> paint

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
to make the chocolate we will hand paint

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.509 
to make the chocolate we will hand paint
them<00:01:04.049> we'll<00:01:04.350> airbrush<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.100> we'll<00:01:05.220> use<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
them we'll airbrush then we'll use the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820 
them we'll airbrush then we'll use the
patient<00:01:05.850> needs<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.180> apply<00:01:06.510> colors<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.320> then

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
patient needs to apply colors and then

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.560 
patient needs to apply colors and then
we'll<00:01:07.950> create<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.280> cast<00:01:08.610> user<00:01:09.090> tempered

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
we'll create a cast user tempered

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.960 
we'll create a cast user tempered
chocolate<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.170> fill<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.010> mold<00:01:11.610> with

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
chocolate so we fill the mold with

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.880 
chocolate so we fill the mold with
chocolate<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.869> knock<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.290> out<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.650> there's<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
chocolate we knock it out so there's a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
chocolate we knock it out so there's a
cast<00:01:14.159> left<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> tempered<00:01:14.939> chocolate<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.509> well

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
cast left of tempered chocolate and well

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
cast left of tempered chocolate and well
separate<00:01:16.439> chocolates<00:01:16.799> shrieks<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
separate chocolates shrieks so what it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.179 
separate chocolates shrieks so what it
does<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.659> pulls<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.080> shape<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.950> pour

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
does is it pulls the shape that you pour

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.640 
does is it pulls the shape that you pour
the<00:01:20.310> chocolate<00:01:20.430> into<00:01:21.020> releases<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the chocolate into releases and then to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.920 
the chocolate into releases and then to
knock<00:01:22.830> them<00:01:23.040> out<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:24.060> once<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.390> cast<00:01:24.750> is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
knock them out so once that cast is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.660 
knock them out so once that cast is
created<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.680> create<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> filling<00:01:26.460> with

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
created we create the filling with

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.740 
created we create the filling with
whatever<00:01:26.850> we're<00:01:27.060> gonna<00:01:27.119> make<00:01:27.360> whether<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
whatever we're gonna make whether it's a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.289 
whatever we're gonna make whether it's a
caramel<00:01:28.259> whether<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.829> ganache<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:29.549> we

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
caramel whether it's ganache and then we

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.360 
caramel whether it's ganache and then we
let<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.479> set<00:01:30.750> Chris

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
let it set Chris

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.640 
let it set Chris
overnight<00:01:31.730> and<00:01:32.150> take<00:01:32.360> another<00:01:32.600> spoonful<00:01:33.560> of

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
overnight and take another spoonful of

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.950 
overnight and take another spoonful of
chocolate<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.250> finish<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.450> chocolate<00:01:35.840> by

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
chocolate and finish the chocolate by

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.930 
chocolate and finish the chocolate by
closing<00:01:36.290> it<00:01:36.500> using<00:01:36.920> tempered<00:01:37.220> chocolate<00:01:37.250> the

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
closing it using tempered chocolate the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.970 
closing it using tempered chocolate the
process<00:01:38.300> takes<00:01:38.570> about<00:01:38.720> two<00:01:39.170> days<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.680> flavor

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
process takes about two days of flavor

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.070 
process takes about two days of flavor
so<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:40.970> takes<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.390> whole<00:01:41.600> week<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.960> actually

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
so it takes the whole week to actually

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.590 
so it takes the whole week to actually
create<00:01:42.650> one<00:01:42.920> batch<00:01:43.160> of<00:01:43.370> a<00:01:43.520> collection<00:01:43.820> it's

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
create one batch of a collection it's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.990 
create one batch of a collection it's
not<00:01:44.810> just<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.230> one-day<00:01:45.800> process<00:01:46.520> we<00:01:46.700> really

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
not just a one-day process we really

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.580 
not just a one-day process we really
have<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.330> respect<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.810> chocolate<00:01:48.230> to<00:01:48.470> make

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
have to respect the chocolate to make

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.380 
have to respect the chocolate to make
sure<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.070> end<00:01:49.220> products<00:01:49.610> are<00:01:49.760> shiny<00:01:50.030> and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
sure that the end products are shiny and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.120 
sure that the end products are shiny and
as<00:01:50.720> definite<00:01:51.140> as<00:01:51.170> we<00:01:51.560> designed<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:52.010> to<00:01:52.040> be

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
as definite as we designed it to be

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.680 
as definite as we designed it to be
we're<00:01:55.130> not<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.340> very<00:01:55.430> traditional<00:01:55.820> chocolatier

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
we're not a very traditional chocolatier

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.500 
we're not a very traditional chocolatier
we<00:01:57.110> like<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.790> design<00:01:58.790> our<00:01:58.910> chops<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.210> little<00:01:59.240> bit

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
we like to design our chops a little bit

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.090 
we like to design our chops a little bit
differently<00:01:59.840> using<00:02:00.140> colored<00:02:00.560> cocoa<00:02:00.830> butter

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
differently using colored cocoa butter

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.320 
differently using colored cocoa butter
and<00:02:01.340> as<00:02:01.730> a<00:02:01.760> bunch<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.030> different<00:02:02.270> techniques

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
and as a bunch of different techniques

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.600 
and as a bunch of different techniques
we<00:02:02.690> can<00:02:02.720> use<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:03.020> do<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.160> packaging

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
we can use to do that so the packaging

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.100 
we can use to do that so the packaging
