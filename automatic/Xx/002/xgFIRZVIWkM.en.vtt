can you give us a demo some of the
features<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> sonic<00:00:13.530> which<00:00:13.650> is

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
features that have a sonic which is

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.919 
features that have a sonic which is
innovating<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.370> top<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.700> space

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
innovating in the top in space

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.060 
innovating in the top in space
absolutely<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.289> you're<00:00:16.379> seeing<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:16.710> is

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
absolutely so what you're seeing here is

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.109 
absolutely so what you're seeing here is
actually<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:18.600> android<00:00:19.140> based<00:00:20.119> platform

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
actually it is an android based platform

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.660 
actually it is an android based platform
so<00:00:21.420> we're<00:00:21.660> starting<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.920> tablet<00:00:23.369> that's

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
so we're starting with a tablet that's

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.540 
so we're starting with a tablet that's
using<00:00:24.090> android<00:00:24.480> 2.2<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.949> course<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.490> of

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
using android 2.2 and of course all of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.670 
using android 2.2 and of course all of
the<00:00:26.760> benefits<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.269> has<00:00:27.539> let's<00:00:28.230> not<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.560> of

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the benefits that has let's not think of

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.109 
the benefits that has let's not think of
it<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.920> sense<00:00:29.250> because<00:00:29.699> there's

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
it in that sense because there's

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.749 
it in that sense because there's
hundreds<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.679> know<00:00:31.800> tablets<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.340> exists

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
hundreds of you know tablets that exists

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.220 
hundreds of you know tablets that exists
out<00:00:32.880> there<00:00:32.910> we're<00:00:33.750> going<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.930> show<00:00:34.170> you

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
kind of a mirror of it it's working

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.950 
kind of a mirror of it it's working
independently<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> same<00:01:00.059> software<00:01:00.719> so

Appian multipass can do up there

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.689 
Appian multipass can do up there
questions<00:04:31.210> on<00:04:31.419> it<00:04:31.540> yes<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.410> literally<00:04:32.860> becomes

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
questions on it yes it literally becomes

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.810 
questions on it yes it literally becomes
