 in this review we will consider 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.130
 electronic bite alarm 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.840
 Foxy brand 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.840

 without sound there are 8 levels of tonality 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.199
 also 8 time study 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.480
 this scale of 8 LEDs 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:25.420

 bite that is from the shore or shore in 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.190
 This alarm has a function 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.230
 memory settings that are 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.320
 your settings will not be

 here it is and night mode works 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.380
 blocking the sensor you're the one to 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.900
