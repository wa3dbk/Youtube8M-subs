your Xbox one mic you can do this to a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.000 
your Xbox one mic you can do this to a
one<00:01:02.280> huge<00:01:02.820> thing<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.989> don't<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.769> about

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
one huge thing that I don't like about

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.700 
one huge thing that I don't like about
the<00:01:05.489> Xbox<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:08.869> microphone<00:01:09.869> system<00:01:10.439> as

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the Xbox one is the microphone system as

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.429 
the Xbox one is the microphone system as
of<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.250> now<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:12.689> reason<00:01:12.930> why<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.110> don't<00:01:13.170> like

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
of right now the reason why I don't like

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.429 
of right now the reason why I don't like
it<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:14.119> they<00:01:15.119> gave<00:01:15.299> us<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.720> weird

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
it is because they gave us some weird

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.140 
it is because they gave us some weird
weird<00:01:16.979> thing<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:18.659> use<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.710> our<00:01:20.520> controller

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
weird thing to use for our controller

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.510 
weird thing to use for our controller
and<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.790> see<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.650> very<00:01:25.680> very

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and you can see it is very very

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.069 
and you can see it is very very
different<00:01:27.409> from<00:01:28.409> how<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.909> old<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.479> used<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
different from how the old one used to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.080 
different from how the old one used to
be<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.560> 360<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.820> hole

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
be this is the 360 one with that hole

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.280 
be this is the 360 one with that hole
and<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:35.509> like<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.600> weird<00:01:36.869> almost

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and then this one like a weird almost

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.810 
and then this one like a weird almost
looks<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.560> an<00:01:37.710> HDMI<00:01:38.130> port<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.610> kind<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
looks like an HDMI port it's kind of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.050 
looks like an HDMI port it's kind of
later<00:01:40.460> however<00:01:41.600> with<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> old<00:01:43.460> my<00:01:44.460> old<00:01:44.640> set<00:01:44.939> up

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.760 
changed it up and I have this thing now
it's<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.890> pretty<00:02:20.130> big<00:02:20.490> problem<00:02:23.360> however<00:02:24.770> there

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
it's a pretty big problem however there

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.910 
it's a pretty big problem however there
is<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> way<00:02:26.280> around<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:27.260> especially<00:02:28.260> with<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
is a way around it especially with the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.740 
is a way around it especially with the
Astros<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:30.620> your<00:02:31.620> turtle<00:02:32.010> beach's<00:02:32.370> and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
Astros and your turtle beach's and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.790 
Astros and your turtle beach's and
personally<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.810> think<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.200> reason<00:02:34.470> why<00:02:34.590> they

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
personally I think the reason why they

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.850 
personally I think the reason why they
did<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.520> was<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> business<00:02:36.330> decision

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
did this it was a business decision

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.820 
did this it was a business decision
