00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the batteries and into the car it's so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.830 
the batteries and into the car it's so
complicated<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.610> fact<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.940> make<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> price<00:00:42.540> that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
complicated in fact to make a price that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
complicated in fact to make a price that
a<00:00:43.440> recent<00:00:43.710> study<00:00:44.010> found<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> long

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a recent study found that in the long

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.310 
a recent study found that in the long
term<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.090> does<00:00:45.120> more<00:00:45.420> environmental<00:00:46.020> damage

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
term it does more environmental damage

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.069 
term it does more environmental damage
than<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.620> Land<00:00:46.829> Rover<00:00:47.070> Discovery<00:00:47.539> but<00:00:48.539> no<00:00:48.930> it's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
than a Land Rover Discovery but no it's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.840 
than a Land Rover Discovery but no it's
true<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.820> it<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.090> least<00:00:51.120> economical

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
true but it is at least economical

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:01.639 
true but it is at least economical
always<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> bmw<00:00:58.890> m3<00:01:00.079> it<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.230> not

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
always it this is a bmw m3 it is not

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.410 
always it this is a bmw m3 it is not
designed<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.640> economical<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.449> possible

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
designed to be as economical as possible

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.000 
designed to be as economical as possible
to<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.570> fast<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:08.750> 10<00:01:09.750> laps<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> track<00:01:10.350> let's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
to be fast so 10 laps of the track let's

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.700 
to be fast so 10 laps of the track let's
see<00:01:11.280> which<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:11.880> uses<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.540> least<00:01:12.780> fuel

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.340 

the<00:01:20.520> price<00:01:20.820> would<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.240> driven<00:01:21.510> as<00:01:21.750> fast<00:01:22.080> as

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the price would be driven as fast as

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.250 
the price would be driven as fast as
possible<00:01:22.890> all<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> had<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.910> BMW<00:01:24.260> was

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
possible all I had to do in the BMW was

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.520 
possible all I had to do in the BMW was
people<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.860> okay<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:26.850> there's<00:01:27.120> a<00:01:27.180> 1.5<00:01:28.140> liter

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
people up okay so there's a 1.5 liter

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
people up okay so there's a 1.5 liter
four-cylinder<00:01:29.430> engine<00:01:29.730> in<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.910> price<00:01:30.150> in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
four-cylinder engine in the price in

this a 414 brake horsepower 4 liter v8

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.590 
this a 414 brake horsepower 4 liter v8
you<00:01:36.990> would<00:01:37.140> expect<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> use<00:01:38.600> massively

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you would expect this to use massively

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.390 
you would expect this to use massively
more<00:01:39.990> fuel

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.390
