00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.860

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.750
 say that there is a cultural 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.610
 offer almost completely missing the right 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.890

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.780
 a cultural life is lost 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.950
 if our social human rights 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.510
 our state does not manage its 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.620
 specially written rights for humans 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.170
