00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.600
 micheal book format came to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.110
 kill a lot of people for a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.200
 box to separate the things that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.020

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.850
 that video class before reform to kt 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.239
 organizes in boxes so he gets a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.449
 aspect of the hell hole it snows it seems okay 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.739
 more messed up by organizing that the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.559
 We wanted to change this. 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.320
 some things I preserve with this 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.020
 box already had the elastics of hair 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.619
 all within just so it was 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.500
 doing was collecting was scattered 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.390
 snowed state and was only there 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.320
 I think of hair 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.640
 piranha organizer and clip you 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.950

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.490
 meet 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.590
