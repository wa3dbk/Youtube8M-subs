gotta do is go into your building tools

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.190 
gotta do is go into your building tools
make<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> clock<00:01:59.270> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.630> you'll<00:02:00.810> let<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
make a clock and then you'll let you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.930 
make a clock and then you'll let you
attach<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.560> ceiling<00:02:02.190> right<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.700> floor

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and that's how you get one half way out

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.190 
and that's how you get one half way out
there<00:02:04.830> now<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.330> more<00:02:06.630> common
