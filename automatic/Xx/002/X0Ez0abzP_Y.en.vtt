00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.260 
to speak instead of the front now when
we<00:01:40.680> come<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.189> shoot<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:41.700> we're<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
we come up to shoot because we're in the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060 
we come up to shoot because we're in the
middle<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> brush<00:01:42.869> we're<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.590> nearly<00:01:43.890> as

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
middle of the brush we're not nearly as

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.800 
middle of the brush we're not nearly as
noticeable<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.729> catch<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.119> ducks<00:01:45.360> off-guard

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
noticeable we catch the ducks off-guard

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.990 
noticeable we catch the ducks off-guard
a<00:01:46.020> whole<00:01:46.170> lot<00:01:46.350> easier<00:01:46.579> camouflage<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.759> blind

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
a whole lot easier camouflage the blind

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.179 
a whole lot easier camouflage the blind
in<00:01:48.210> several<00:01:48.540> different<00:01:48.659> layers<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.500> try<00:01:50.130> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
in several different layers we try to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.710 
in several different layers we try to
fluff<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> speak

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
fluff it up so to speak

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.310 
fluff it up so to speak
make<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.439> look<00:01:52.590> give<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.490> cushion<00:01:53.939> effect

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
make it look give it that cushion effect

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.870 
make it look give it that cushion effect
and<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> looks<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.340> brush<00:01:56.579> pile

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and I think it looks like a brush pile

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.330 
and I think it looks like a brush pile
just<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.240> big<00:01:57.810> bulldozer<00:01:58.229> pile<00:01:58.649> or<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> thicket

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
just a big bulldozer pile or a thicket

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
just a big bulldozer pile or a thicket
right<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.820> middle<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> field

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
right out in the middle of the field

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.959 
right out in the middle of the field
instead<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.409> square<00:02:01.680> boxy<00:02:02.130> look<00:02:02.340> really

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
instead of that square boxy look really

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.969 
instead of that square boxy look really
works<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.270> lot<00:02:03.390> better<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:04.290> little<00:02:04.530> feature<00:02:04.710> we

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
works a lot better one little feature we

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.899 
works a lot better one little feature we
added<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.430> our<00:02:05.490> duck

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
added to our duck

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.660 
added to our duck
mine<00:02:06.060> was<00:02:06.359> a<00:02:06.390> screen<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.320> both<00:02:07.859> ends<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
mine was a screen on both ends of the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.059 
mine was a screen on both ends of the
blind<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.179> other<00:02:09.420> words<00:02:09.629> here's<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.679> edge<00:02:10.860> of

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
blind in other words here's the edge of

blind in other words here's the edge of
the<00:02:11.129> blind<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:12.120> built<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> screen<00:02:12.780> with<00:02:13.019> wire

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the blind we built the screen with wire

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.119 
the blind we built the screen with wire
we<00:02:14.129> staked<00:02:14.640> these<00:02:15.090> trees<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:16.650> give<00:02:16.830> us<00:02:16.980> a

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
we staked these trees in to give us a

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.880 
we staked these trees in to give us a
little<00:02:17.430> buffer<00:02:18.209> or<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> little<00:02:18.660> cover<00:02:18.959> between

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
the blind and the screen how many times

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.570 
the blind and the screen how many times
have<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.410> been<00:02:22.440> outside<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.129> blind<00:02:23.370> maybe

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
have you been outside the blind maybe

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.369 
have you been outside the blind maybe
