I<00:02:20.670> really<00:02:20.940> wanted<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.270> painting<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.750> almost

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
I really wanted this painting to almost

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.880 
I really wanted this painting to almost
be<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:23.420> portrayal<00:02:24.420> not<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.290> earthly

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
be a portrayal not just of a earthly

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.980 
be a portrayal not just of a earthly
place<00:02:26.100> but<00:02:26.460> maybe<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.760> glimpse<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.570> heavenly

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
place but maybe a glimpse of a heavenly

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:42.070 
place but maybe a glimpse of a heavenly
realm<00:02:28.020> or<00:02:28.920> perhaps<00:02:29.930> somewhere<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.080> between

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.140
