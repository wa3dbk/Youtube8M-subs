00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 last week we showed with a 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.480
 difficulty with licensing 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.400
 environment is an obstacle to 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.099
 development of fish farming in 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.740
 tanks installed in yours today. 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.590
 second article on thaís fish farming 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.410
 you see that not even these difficulties and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.170
 prevented the northern part of the state from 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.160
 structure in rolândia is the largest 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.900
 breeder of the country's fry in the tank 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.750
 selected breeders 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.690
 genetically the search is by females with 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.960
 mouthful of eggs per month each 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.899
 provides from 1,000 to 1,500 fertilization 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.480
 of cans is external but just collects 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.210
 the eggs for protection and stay with them 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.289
 in the mouth for about five days without 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.210
 to feed 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.399
 the staff collect the eggs 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.949
 daily and take them to this 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.379
 laboratory where they are a kind of 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.350
 incubator until they explode 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.809
 the fry in the no-light with about half 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.949
 centimeter and spend six days in 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.229
 Note 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.470
 then transferred to the tanks 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.080
 where they receive feed several times a day 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.950
 In this phase reversal is made to 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.110
 sexual 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.970
 We have to make the transformation. 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.700
 that she is born with defined sexes, people 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.650
 works with feed and temperature where it is 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.689
 that turns all the male fish and there 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.390
 goes through customer success in the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.790
 fattening when they reach a gram of 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.130
 weight the fingerlings are brought to these 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.710
 tanks in the boarding lounge 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.409
 they spend up to 24 hours here in a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.840
 process which is a period of time 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.110
 cleaning the bowel so that the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.630
 fish may travel in clean water from 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.000
 thousand and a thousand they are packed in bags 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.159
 well resilient and distributed to 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.200
 whole brazilian fish farmers 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.180
 only this business unit of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.970
 production of rolled fingerlings and 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.790
 provides for the paraná são paulo minas 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.189
 general and santa catarina are from four to 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.439
 five million fingerlings every month 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.170
 and production does not stop even in winter 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.610
 when the water in the tanks gets colder 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.890
 the company on the market since 1997 has 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.480
 greenhouses to compensate for the difficulty of 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.920
 climate we have a customer 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.290
 today they are clients who work with 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.569
 production and sale for the refrigerator they 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.730
 need to make monthly stands 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.540
 with this we have the greenhouses where 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.200
 that we can even 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.519
 Winter 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.909
 I would say that it is the secret of this business 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.840
 to work well in 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.110
 itu 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.269
 This is the secret this company has. 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.150
 quality that already prepares a 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.970
 unit in the northeast of the country to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.040
 the demand of that region and the week 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.980
 come on you will see how the northern region of 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.360
 paraná was also structured in fattening and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.360
 in the slaughter of fish
