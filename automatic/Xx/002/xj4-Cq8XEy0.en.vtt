going around it I hit the pocket a lot
struck<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> lot<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.400> my<00:02:20.550> mistakes<00:02:20.940> they're<00:02:21.269> open

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
struck a lot of my mistakes they're open

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.650 
struck a lot of my mistakes they're open
so<00:02:22.370> maybe<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.489> should<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:23.820> moved<00:02:23.970> right<00:02:24.239> and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
so maybe I should have moved right and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.479 
so maybe I should have moved right and
played<00:02:25.080> them<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.739> end-over-end

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
played them for end-over-end

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:40.550 
played them for end-over-end
have<00:02:27.000> your<00:02:27.150> role<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.750> less<00:02:27.959> hood

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.960 

we<00:02:41.560> talked<00:02:41.799> about<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.040> ball<00:02:42.220> change<00:02:42.519> Robert

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
we talked about the ball change Robert

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.530 
we talked about the ball change Robert
Sandler's<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.480> weaker<00:02:43.780> ball<00:02:45.480> then<00:02:46.480> he

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
Sandler's on the weaker ball then he

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.330 
Sandler's on the weaker ball then he
used<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.780> first<00:02:47.049> game<00:02:47.290> why<00:02:48.099> do<00:02:48.159> you<00:02:48.250> think

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
used the first game why do you think

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.470 
used the first game why do you think
that<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.640> way<00:02:48.790> deeper<00:02:48.879> for<00:02:49.120> reasons<00:02:49.390> are

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
that is way deeper for reasons are

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.380 
that is way deeper for reasons are
behind<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:50.340> think<00:02:51.340> he<00:02:51.430> wants<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.849> to<00:02:52.269> move

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
behind that I think he wants to to move

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.809 
behind that I think he wants to to move
further<00:02:52.690> right<00:02:52.930> into<00:02:53.290> into<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:53.980> drive<00:02:54.280> and

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
further right into into the drive and

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.940 
further right into into the drive and
try<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.629> angle<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.110> up<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.470> fight<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.739> lion

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
try to angle it up and fight the lion

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:14.550 
try to angle it up and fight the lion
upward<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.430> more<00:03:13.230> teetering<00:03:14.230> on<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.470> edge

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
upward with more teetering on the edge

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.240 
upward with more teetering on the edge
