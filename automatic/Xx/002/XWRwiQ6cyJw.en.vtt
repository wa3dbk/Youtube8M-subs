00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.370

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.440
 whiskey store the meeting place pan 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.759
 Ghosts and today is for me like that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.070
 required hour 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.140
 Today I have chosen one to try 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.500
 The church is not quite my thing 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 although a bit I am myself 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.130
 convert there are also very great 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.930
 whiskey belong I have my whole 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.380
 had tried before Christmas 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.450
 and there was one or the other 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.270
 it has even tasted me there 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.550
 I am usually too sweet today 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.350
 I have an Irish whiskey liqueur with me 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.620
 and a whiskey from the group of 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.059
 honey liqueurs and the bushmills 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 irish hanni a spirit drink is here 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.559
 on it is that the new classification 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.410
 of liquors spirit drinks 1 1 liter 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.030
 bottle 35 volume percent so for 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:10.740
 comparatively strong and stands here 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:14.610
 in the haniels real arian hanni so 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.770
 with real Irish honey and real 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.310
 other natural flavors 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.259
 my deep deep aroma profile with 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.860
 to achieve a soft rich finish 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:36.079
 yes, politician irish honey 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.079
 of course also 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.000
 screw cap commodity 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.100
 yes, I say it only because the higher quality 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.390
 Bushmills come in the cork and the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.979
 simple potentials in the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.539
 screw cap come when the the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.539
 then make the screw 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:09.360
 mass goods are no idea logi 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:11.099
 finish how much sweetmouth now in such 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.610
 look far in it is always hard to 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.269
 say 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.610
 you get to taste with factual 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:21.150
 you could do what you can do 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.799
 Taking the money for wine of her 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.580
 other straight crap might be there 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.910
 also experience 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.350
 yes you could still spindles I have 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.549
 here time determination of the alcohol content 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.650
 a video shot 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.390
 and then I played liqueur too 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.569
 and she would have but you get so did 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.920
 not really out because of the heavy train 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.780
 now was always good and the spindle 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.340
 more buoyant was pleased that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.069
 the difference between displayed 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.620
 Alcohol content in real gold too 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:53.239
 castell trainers work out so then 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:56.900
 maybe not so cute 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:04.880
 no, not sweet at all 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.880
 Herbs that's what that is 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:19.450
 In any case, behind it lies the honey 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:23.290
 clearly before that are fruits and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.860
 do not separate herbs like that 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.239
 like oregano and herbs of provence 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.970
 or something like that, but they are 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.440
 lavender heather as likely 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.180
 Everything in Ireland there on the 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:44.780
 Meadows and fields at home is anwÃ¤ltin 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:47.780
 at the edge of the forest at the edge of the field not out 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.830
 But herbs are definitely like that 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.830
 so try 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.940
 I just made so much from nothing 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.160
 a lot of honey and sweet is not in it 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.560
 So much for the alcohol 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.590
 Cover and the whole thing smarter 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.780
 It is dangerous to do everything 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.310
 Our youth suffers from alcohol 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.669
 plus sweetness on top 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:30.030
 because this flat rate fits right with 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:30.030
 in and then after that comes one 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.990
 marshmallow note yes a bit 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:46.110
 put on sweet and and babette behind it 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:49.479
 not the provence lavender right now 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:55.330
 from provence you look at the fields 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:59.950
 the ascend leaves briefly the honey 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:03.070
 stay tuned and which channel 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:08.470
 xd would not have been so insane 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:13.260
 long not so old it just falls to me 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:18.130
 the dime could be that this 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:22.150
 not even whiskey has seen 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.190
 that this is just an irish hanni and 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.510
 so it is not a cracked comedian but 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.510
 a spirit drinks 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:40.880
 back standing on it glare of triple 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.580
 distillers maria riesch anni and other 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.480
 natural flavors no word of whiskey 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.370
 that's the same as his fight 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:54.350
 that used to be in whiskey liqueur and 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:58.270
 At some point it was a spirit drink exactly 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:03.410
 So the location has saved a lot 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:06.250
 bushmills bushmills great thing yes 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.590
 look in our shop system 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.500
 maybe he needs my aunt or 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.889
 You yourself this bottle as a thank you 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.889
 for watching
