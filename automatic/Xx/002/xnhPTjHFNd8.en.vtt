00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.329
 There are two mice, 2 pairs of headphones and 10 a 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.370
 10 what you will learn later 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.810
 let's start with the mouse because as if well 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.260
 what keyboard can we have without 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.680

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.420
 In general, the mouse on the malakon is those 40 Gandhi 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.709
 vacancy together as previously read and even 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.650

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.310
 I got it and immediately take it off 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.739
 general mouse she possesses a side 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.689
 which has generally many firms 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.609
 who in scad game devices namely 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:56.480

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:13.459
 nice benefit very cool think what 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.780
 it is generally uncomfortable rather the opposite but 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.549
 it is unlikely they made such an unusual 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.769
 the form of transactions I am not comfortable to read either 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.530
 writing it would be silly too 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.419

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:53.060
 differ only in color and this this this 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.780
 I'll take it off right away 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:01.340

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.250
 and I read maybe wrong but you 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.389
 they understood these headphones are in two 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.129
 devil colors and 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:10.430
 angel is naturally black 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.780
 white color and how cool they are 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.250
 twist and a what first they look 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.109
 very cool look what an unusual 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.680
 calamus design there is water practice behind 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:21.500
 and evil christmas she's like that 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.670
 they look and these headphones possess 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.250
 sound system 7 and 1 virtuality 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.170
 to 7 and 1 so i'm sorry interrupted me 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.410
 such up headphones here these tesoro 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.030
 have a sound system 71 appears to 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.200
 just awesome design u like here 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.780
 the picture can be seen here 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.870
 account equipment they still have over here 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.730
 written that or the complete 71 virtuoso 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.090
 Well, that is a virtual sound card itself 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:50.080
 one extension ie wire 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.210
 2 meter extension and and and and and and and 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.130
 connection system so I understand which 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.260
 shares exactly the microphone and yourself 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.270
 Headphones he as all as a rule 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.860

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.360
 Build and microphone about quality 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.760
 the microphone can't say anything to them 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.310
 I didn’t have headphones, but I think 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.010
 winners of various contests normal fund 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.840
