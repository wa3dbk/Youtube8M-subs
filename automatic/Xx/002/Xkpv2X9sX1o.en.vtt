had kind of the architecture of the
whole<00:00:53.220> piece<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.730> mind<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:54.630> every<00:00:54.930> year

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
whole piece in mind but then every year

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.950 
we got this gestation period of a year
to<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:58.110> about<00:00:58.380> each<00:00:58.620> segment<00:00:59.579> each<00:00:59.969> year<00:01:00.420> we

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to think about each segment each year we

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.690 
to think about each segment each year we
didn't<00:01:01.170> film<00:01:01.380> every<00:01:01.739> year<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.670> know

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
didn't film every year you know

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.399 
didn't film every year you know
sometimes<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> was<00:01:03.360> 18<00:01:03.690> months<00:01:03.780> sometimes<00:01:04.110> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
sometimes it was 18 months sometimes it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
sometimes it was 18 months sometimes it
was<00:01:04.469> nine<00:01:04.710> months<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.129> roughly<00:01:05.430> once<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.850> year

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
was nine months but roughly once a year

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539 
was nine months but roughly once a year
but<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.290> tone<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.950> film<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.430> was

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
but the the tone of the film I was

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.850 
but the the tone of the film I was
trying<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> capture<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> way<00:01:10.290> life<00:01:10.320> kind

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
trying to capture just the way life kind

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.649 
trying to capture just the way life kind
of<00:01:10.950> unfolds<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.700> maybe<00:01:11.880> how<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.090> remember

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
of unfolds or maybe how you remember

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.860 
of unfolds or maybe how you remember
your<00:01:12.810> life<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.620> wait<00:01:14.100> time<00:01:14.460> works<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
your life or the wait time works you

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.539 
your life or the wait time works you
know<00:01:15.900> through<00:01:16.350> through<00:01:16.650> our<00:01:16.740> lives<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.310> that's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
know through through our lives so that's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.580 
know through through our lives so that's
what<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> was<00:01:17.850> trying<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.150> capture<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.350> not

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
what I was trying to capture and a not

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.609 
what I was trying to capture and a not
too<00:01:20.210> dramatic<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.409> said<00:01:22.470> earlier

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
too dramatic way but like I said earlier

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.820 
too dramatic way but like I said earlier
I<00:01:22.979> felt<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:23.940> would<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.409> cumulative<00:01:25.409> power

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I felt there would be a cumulative power

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.570 
I felt there would be a cumulative power
to<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.369> drama<00:01:26.940> would<00:01:27.710> when<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.520> about

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
to the drama would when you think about

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.580 
to the drama would when you think about
your<00:01:29.820> own<00:01:29.880> life<00:01:30.000> how<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.689> there<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.320> kind

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
your own life how it there is this kind

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.130 
your own life how it there is this kind
of<00:01:31.799> build<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:33.000> becomes<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.479> drama<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.020> our

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
of build and it becomes a drama in our

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.740 
of build and it becomes a drama in our
minds<00:01:34.650> because<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.549> never<00:01:35.760> let<00:01:35.970> him<00:01:36.060> watch<00:01:36.240> no

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
minds because I never let him watch no

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.929 
minds because I never let him watch no
one<00:01:36.900> ever<00:01:37.049> saw<00:01:37.320> footage<00:01:37.590> until<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.820> recently

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
one ever saw footage until just recently

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.640 
one ever saw footage until just recently
they<00:01:39.330> started<00:01:39.750> watching<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> movies<00:01:40.409> which

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
they started watching the movies which

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.670 
they started watching the movies which
I'm<00:01:40.799> very<00:01:40.830> grateful<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.500> avoided<00:01:43.500> being

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
I'm very grateful for I avoided being

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.740 
I'm very grateful for I avoided being
very<00:01:43.950> self-conscious<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.330> very<00:01:45.540> likely

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
very self-conscious and it's very likely

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.450 
very self-conscious and it's very likely
that<00:01:45.930> i<00:01:46.049> might<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.740> become<00:01:46.860> self-conscious

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
that i might have become self-conscious

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.700 
that i might have become self-conscious
if<00:01:47.850> i<00:01:47.970> had<00:01:48.330> been<00:01:48.479> allowed<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.810> watch<00:01:49.170> any<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.470> it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
if i had been allowed to watch any of it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.800 
if i had been allowed to watch any of it
you<00:01:49.920> know<00:01:49.950> growing<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.880> mean<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you know growing up I mean it's it was a

and much less a kid if you think about

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.300 
and much less a kid if you think about
it<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.720> know<00:03:06.750> getting<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.170> six-year-old<00:03:07.770> to

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
agree to do something for 12 years I

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.930 
agree to do something for 12 years I
mean<00:03:10.530> that's<00:03:10.620> technically<00:03:11.100> illegal<00:03:11.459> i<00:03:11.730> think

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
mean that's technically illegal i think

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.080 
mean that's technically illegal i think
i<00:03:12.830> think<00:03:13.830> also<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.280> was<00:03:14.400> kind<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.820> blessing

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
i think also it was kind of a blessing

that was important but he was just kind

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.190 
that was important but he was just kind
of<00:05:26.370> an<00:05:26.520> ethereal<00:05:27.120> thoughtful<00:05:27.690> kid<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.080> just

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
like talking to him and he kind of grew

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.540
