been able to sort of come through
I<00:02:31.390> think<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.720> key<00:02:32.900> issue<00:02:33.080> here<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.800> three

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
I think the key issue here is that three

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.270 
I think the key issue here is that three
years<00:02:34.250> ago<00:02:34.400> before<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.330> economic<00:02:35.660> crisis<00:02:36.500> we

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
were already transforming the company so

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.980 
were already transforming the company so

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
we've been on that journey since 2006

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.890 
we've been on that journey since 2006
and<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:43.100> have<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> clear-cut<00:02:43.790> four-point<00:02:44.600> plan

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
and we have a clear-cut four-point plan

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.100 
and we have a clear-cut four-point plan
