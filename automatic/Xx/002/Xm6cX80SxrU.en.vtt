00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
didn't know maybe it could be something

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.369 
didn't know maybe it could be something
to<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> formation<00:00:49.050> or<00:00:49.170> something

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to do with the formation or something

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.799 
to do with the formation or something
like<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.860> um<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.510> fantastic<00:00:51.510> header

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
like that but um a fantastic header

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
like that but um a fantastic header
their<00:00:52.140> leads<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> force<00:00:53.370> save<00:00:53.610> off<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969

Norwich<00:00:54.239> keeper<00:00:54.539> ruddy<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.899> think<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
Norwich keeper ruddy I think is the

keeper<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.100> them<00:00:56.250> still<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.719> Merkel<00:00:57.719> gets

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
keeper for them still and Merkel gets

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.470 
keeper for them still and Merkel gets

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.679 
a nice ball through to Muriel and that
was<00:01:29.159> actually<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.610> really<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.390> lucky

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
was actually a really really lucky

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
was actually a really really lucky
because<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.049> pressed<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.310> try<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
because I pressed a there to try and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.300 
because I pressed a there to try and
pass<00:01:33.030> across<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> goal<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:34.950> actually

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
pass across the goal but it was actually

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
pass across the goal but it was actually
regard<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:36.000> an<00:01:36.210> own<00:01:36.450> goal<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.900> Bennett<00:01:37.259> there

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
regard as an own goal from Bennett there

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
regard as an own goal from Bennett there
so<00:01:37.860> I'm<00:01:38.250> pretty<00:01:38.610> lucky<00:01:38.820> when<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.210> came<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
so I'm pretty lucky when it came to that

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.270 
so I'm pretty lucky when it came to that
but<00:01:39.750> still<00:01:39.990> whether<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.770> nila<00:01:41.070> three

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
but still whether it be to nila three

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.280 
but still whether it be to nila three

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
board and that's very important so we

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.760 
board and that's very important so we
need<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> keep<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.290> try

need to keep this up see if we can try

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.960 
need to keep this up see if we can try
and<00:01:46.829> create<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.100> bit<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.369> roll<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:47.759> as

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and create a bit of a roll because as

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.060

fortunately I feel so the right result
came<00:05:10.590> out<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:10.890> we<00:05:10.950> want<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.370> nil<00:05:11.580> over<00:05:11.940> England

again it was an international friendly

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.760 
again it was an international friendly
so<00:05:14.160> it<00:05:14.400> didn't<00:05:14.880> mean<00:05:15.000> too<00:05:15.180> much<00:05:15.210> but

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
so it didn't mean too much but

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.170

really<00:05:53.400> really<00:05:53.760> good<00:05:54.090> against<00:05:54.510> Tottenham

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
really really good against Tottenham

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.290 
really really good against Tottenham
because<00:05:55.470> it<00:05:55.560> would<00:05:55.680> obviously<00:05:55.790> make<00:05:56.790> sure

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
because it would obviously make sure

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.760 
because it would obviously make sure
they<00:05:57.450> came<00:05:57.600> away<00:05:57.840> with<00:05:57.960> nothing<00:05:58.080> and<00:05:58.410> make

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
they came away with nothing and make

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.830 
they came away with nothing and make
sure<00:05:58.919> we<00:05:59.100> came<00:05:59.310> away<00:05:59.460> with<00:05:59.729> three<00:06:00.240> points<00:06:00.630> so

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
sure we came away with three points so

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.350 
sure we came away with three points so
you<00:06:01.560> know<00:06:01.680> a<00:06:01.710> 433<00:06:02.640> and<00:06:02.850> we<00:06:02.970> kind<00:06:03.150> of<00:06:03.210> had<00:06:03.330> that

that later on in the game as you guys
can<00:06:19.080> see<00:06:19.140> though<00:06:19.440> Tottenham<00:06:20.040> were<00:06:20.250> such<00:06:20.640> a

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
can see though Tottenham were such a

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.540 
can see though Tottenham were such a
strong<00:06:21.240> side<00:06:21.540> I<00:06:22.260> felt<00:06:22.680> as<00:06:22.800> though<00:06:22.950> in<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:23.340> game

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
strong side I felt as though in the game

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.670 
strong side I felt as though in the game
it<00:06:24.090> was<00:06:24.300> a<00:06:24.330> very<00:06:24.660> much<00:06:24.870> back<00:06:25.110> and<00:06:25.140> forth<00:06:25.350> there

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
it was a very much back and forth there

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.409 
it was a very much back and forth there
were<00:06:25.830> a<00:06:25.860> few<00:06:26.250> opportunities<00:06:26.850> I<00:06:27.030> believe<00:06:27.270> in

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
were a few opportunities I believe in

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.210 
were a few opportunities I believe in
the<00:06:27.540> entire<00:06:27.930> game<00:06:28.290> there<00:06:28.830> were<00:06:28.950> only<00:06:29.070> nine

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
the entire game there were only nine

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.670 
the entire game there were only nine
shots<00:06:29.640> on-target<00:06:29.849> five<00:06:30.780> against<00:06:31.169> me<00:06:31.289> and<00:06:31.440> four

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
against them I felt as though though my

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.330 
against them I felt as though though my
shots<00:06:33.990> on-target<00:06:34.140> were<00:06:34.560> definitely<00:06:35.039> a<00:06:35.130> lot

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340
