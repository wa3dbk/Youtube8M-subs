00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.810
 locally identified as the victory 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.900
 actually the exact name of the wreck of 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.689
 framura Ã¨ colosso was launched in 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.610
 February of the 42 belonged to the class 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.770
 of greedy and was built near the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.340
 river shipyards by order 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.230
 of the Italian navy 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.150
 the wreck is located with precision a 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.309
 about half a mile away from 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.059
 coast in the stretch between the municipality 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.980
 of fragura and the town of bonassola 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.110
 he went to perfect recline 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.140
 navigation structure on a backdrop of 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.620
 40 meters with the bow facing west and 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.570
 the hull parallel to the shoreline 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.729
 reasons for the foundation are uncertain 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.449
 there are those who claim because of a bomb 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.670
 plane 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.799
 others instead due to the torpedo 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.799
 of the unit he was towing 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.479
 sometimes made invisible by 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.149
 other suspension like today entirely 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.570
 already visible at least 20 meters from the 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.570
 surface 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.100
 we fully exploit the conditions 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.409
 optimal that the sea binds us to the e 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.340
 pausing to observe it entirely 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.200
 a circular structure from bow to stern 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.520
 attracts our attention is one 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.590
 antiaircraft station 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.899
 the base that bears witness to this 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.899
 He claimed one of the on-board weapons 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.119
 we reach the deck passed one of the 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.969
 arms that were used for winging 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.019
 and save the lifeboat 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.459
 we head to the bow from this point of 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:18.319
 recovery we have a global vision 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.750
 of the ship the bridge bridges the whole 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.299
 profile and even the circular turret 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.840
 similar to that on the quarterdeck 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.840
 of the test rig 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.960
 high is straight in front of us dominates 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.910
 the bow follows perfectly the 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.910
 technical drawing of the 40s 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.130
 right above the sea â€‹â€‹we can 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.750
 observe a second circular tower 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.290
 in which took place the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.290
 machine gun 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.870
 below the military post chen salva 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.940
 it is still in good condition and we succeed in 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.940
 distinguish it and gears and must 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.970
 Yup 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.050
 we head a little along the way 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.290
 we also overcome the superstructures of the 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.290
 tug 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.780
 are those of the control form on 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.760
 which stands out the presence of portholes in the 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.570
 corridors all environments easily 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.570
 recognizable 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:51.050
 the fire system of the colossus is 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.489
 still perfectly recognizable 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.619
 in fact we distinguish a long line of 

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:58.949
 water inlets and two large ones 

00:04:55.619 --> 00:05:01.019
 spears the wreck and apparently 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.869
 intact there are no visible traces 

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:07.309
 on the cause of the sinking only 

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:07.309
 this area has collapsed 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.510
 at the height of the garden they are located 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.030
 still in their place the lances for 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.360
 the water also intended to tame the 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.360
 fire 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.920
 the stern even if low and round 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.870
 typical me tugs however gives a 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.870
 sense of power and vigor 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:07.550
 here is the rudder and the large propeller a 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.710
 four blades 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.659
 both are oversized for 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.949
 guarantee power to the tugboat 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:14.949
 required for towing 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.730
 plank meeting we find what remains 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.570
 of the funnel is the point from which it descended 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.570
 down to the engine room 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:12.419
 on the deck we can still visit 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.900
 the whole area destined to the government of the 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:18.389
 ship let's take a last look at the wreck 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.539
 of the colossus before starting the 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:20.539
 ski
