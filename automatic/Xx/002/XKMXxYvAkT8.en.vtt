00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
percent less in the tank how can you say

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.469 
percent less in the tank how can you say
that<00:01:41.439> much<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.189> still<00:01:42.430> keep<00:01:42.610> running<00:01:42.970> first

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
that much and still keep running first

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.779 
that much and still keep running first
of<00:01:43.689> all<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:44.110> get<00:01:44.259> one<00:01:44.470> extra<00:01:44.710> gear<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:45.189> instead

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
of all we get one extra gear I instead

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.510 
of all we get one extra gear I instead
of<00:01:45.880> seven

sound energy recovery system has been

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.229 
sound energy recovery system has been
enhanced<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.260> new<00:02:11.440> ers<00:02:11.920> now<00:02:12.250> has<00:02:12.430> two<00:02:12.760> motor

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
enhanced the new ers now has two motor

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.830 
enhanced the new ers now has two motor
generator<00:02:13.720> units<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.970> new<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.360> powered

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
generator units the new one is powered

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.009 
generator units the new one is powered
by<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.019> flow<00:02:17.349> of<00:02:17.379> hot<00:02:17.709> exhaust<00:02:18.040> gases<00:02:19.019> the

by the flow of hot exhaust gases the

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.750 
by the flow of hot exhaust gases the
other<00:02:20.170> one<00:02:20.319> still<00:02:20.620> uses<00:02:20.980> brake<00:02:21.220> energy<00:02:21.400> from

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
other one still uses brake energy from

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.059 
other one still uses brake energy from
the<00:02:21.849> rear<00:02:22.030> wheels<00:02:22.239> it's<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.260> lot<00:02:23.530> more<00:02:23.709> powerful

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
the rear wheels it's a lot more powerful

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.670 
the rear wheels it's a lot more powerful
now<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:25.269> better<00:02:25.450> impact<00:02:25.840> now<00:02:26.079> stores<00:02:26.410> ten

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
now the better impact now stores ten

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.650 
now the better impact now stores ten
times<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.160> amount<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.489> energy<00:02:27.700> that's<00:02:28.299> enough

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
times the amount of energy that's enough

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.259 
times the amount of energy that's enough
for<00:02:28.840> 33<00:02:29.349> seconds<00:02:29.739> per<00:02:29.920> lap<00:02:29.950> rather<00:02:30.400> than<00:02:30.579> 6.6

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
for 33 seconds per lap rather than 6.6

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.990 
for 33 seconds per lap rather than 6.6
as<00:02:31.450> before<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.380> double<00:02:32.769> boost<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.190> 160

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
as before and a double boost of 160

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.220 
as before and a double boost of 160
horsepower<00:02:35.849> therefore<00:02:36.849> more<00:02:37.209> torque<00:02:37.569> which

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
horsepower therefore more torque which

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.900 
horsepower therefore more torque which
means<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:38.650> tougher<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.950> control<00:02:39.370> getting<00:02:39.819> on

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
means it's tougher to control getting on

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.539 
means it's tougher to control getting on
the<00:02:39.940> power<00:02:40.349> so<00:02:41.349> we<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.620> expect<00:02:41.950> lots<00:02:42.310> more

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
the power so we can expect lots more

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.630 
the power so we can expect lots more
battles

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
battles

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.610 
battles
the<00:02:44.940> outside<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.690> aerodynamics<00:02:46.290> have

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
the outside and the aerodynamics have

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.010 
the outside and the aerodynamics have
also<00:02:46.950> changed<00:02:47.160> quite<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.520> lot<00:02:47.640> our<00:02:48.270> fetal<00:02:48.750> down

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
also changed quite a lot our fetal down

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.660 
also changed quite a lot our fetal down
because<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> nose<00:02:49.709> comes<00:02:50.040> down<00:02:50.250> for<00:02:50.520> safety

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
because the nose comes down for safety

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.990 
because the nose comes down for safety
reasons<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:52.470> front<00:02:52.740> wing<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.010> narrower<00:02:53.370> down
