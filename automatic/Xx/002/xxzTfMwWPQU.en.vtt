00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.710
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.940
 I am Bulgarian 67 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.680
 and I finally bought you an e50 and u 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.430
 I already have my first thoughts on this 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.860
 about 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.349
 Immediately I would like to say to me 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.179
 in many tanks is very important 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:26.029
 his mobility and here at e50 with this clearly 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:29.419
 serious problems as you can see i play with 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.660
 105 and octane gasoline and so me 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.850
 nine hundred and ninety horsepower 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.080
 that is, plus 10 to his 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.140
 nine hundred and still he rides I would 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.860
 said not the length and even the same vcm though 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.050
 generally considered a heavy tank but what 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.720
 we have replacements we have reservations 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.660
 let's see we have 150 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.540
 millimeters booking and i'm here are the exact 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.310
 I did not find the scheme exactly what I was 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.550
 I was interested in the angle of inclination of the wind 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.360
 and I understand it here about 35 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.450
 percent horizontal and 35 degrees 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.730
 I apologize, this means that 150 can 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:17.090
 multiply by somewhere 08 then runs n plus 80 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.400
 percent is somewhere around 250 260 millimeters 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.940
 given armor is of course very 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.010
 cool 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.020
 although experience shows is 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.950
 punch us and in the forehead the same pt 10 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.510
 say yes it happens is the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.470
 more with new precision is very easy 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.680
 to aim nld 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.870
 no one has yet canceled this but 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.360
 no less in this fight why am I showing 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.550
 exactly 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.920
 hang up by the way yes let me remind you I'm playing here 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.040
 I only have drains here and the engine and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.730
 even top towers yet 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.150
 I have a stock gun 88 mm 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.660
 Panthers 2 and I must tell you that this 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.540
 tanchik 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.150
 requires a lot of credit to play 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.820
 stock because often switching 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.170
 on gold well we play somewhere minus 30 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.510
 minutes forty thousand plus 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.390
 octane gasoline and so we get 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.100
 it happens that at -50 is 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.229
 that we put 2 and a half three thousand 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.570
 damage it still does not save because 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.120
 that the damage to these snaryadik of very 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.040
 small and very often shooting gold 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.090
 we went very well minus plus 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.870
 garden repair gold first-aid kit and that 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.209
 Generally yes such are the tricks but not 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.520
 less I want to tell you we are all 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.890
 know why we are playing on it now 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.690
 tank because ahead of us e50 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.370
 modified exactly top 10 is 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.180
 the best haircut on the tenth level 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.620
 Yes, you can please me 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.930
 tell me how so well I tell you 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.299
 I say for sure if I didn't play 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.269
 test for and letters and you i would probably have this 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.459
 the car would sell in 1 vanity 10 fights on 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.730
 what kind of 10 first two or three fights I would have him 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.980
 would have sold this fight here I will need 12 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.570
 and 13 fight here I am showing you now 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.150
 I just did not tolerate freedom 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.130
 still opened the engine and after because 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.580
 Well, absolutely this tank does not know how 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.130
 ride 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.290
 drains therefore it is still not complete 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.480
 stock and I already somehow have a little bit even 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.090
 I'm starting to love this tank because well 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.610
 if you liked panther 2 then this 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.530
 you'll like too single tank 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.780
 just that he really knows how to tank 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.380
 you will see it now 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.100
 chanted 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.250
 from t54 he got to vld completely without 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.170
 options there for 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.450
 it was all there and for the number and the second time 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.420
 I don't know where he shot me at night and 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.060
 see what a funny suspender 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.860
 look she doesn't even see me she 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.230
 doesn't even look at it while not even 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.140
 bush by the way look he plays with 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.110
 ml-20 from the cumulative 250 punch it to me 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.810
 does not break clearly in the forehead and told you 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.459
 here at a right angle and I would rather 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.360
 just did not break already so tilted 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.760
 everything is 400 millimeters should probably 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.830
 write a guide for such unics i'm all 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.970
 more often in the randomness I see people playing 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.980
 700 fourth with stock gun with 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.810
 Su-152 must probably buy it to write 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.370
 Hyde explain to people that you do not put 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:15.610
 equipment there before the gun there 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:18.370
 top bl-10 put very very 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.019
 just without stock thickly solely 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.330
 that you will not put any grids 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.120
 camouflage work rammer and and other 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.100
 but how can you on the fourth fourth play on 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.340
 stock gun 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.740
 oh well this thing is as you see 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.660
 I peace tanks though heavyku shit on 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.850
 our armor 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.410
 Yes, it was difficult to tank because 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.300
 he was on top I was on the bottom of armor 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.220
 leveled and that there probably remained 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.800
 180 millimeters of armor but it's not even 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.210
 funny here we even possible and kvass 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.510
 any can at such an angle 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.660
 punch if a good alpha has flown and 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.419
 of how you see from the coolest dough 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.410
 vs cake vs heavy vs vs 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.870
 54-ki 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.030
 I go out alive of course pretty 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.130
 battered and here look at 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.320
 work on the corpse fly shot I 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.020
 I understand that I did not glow in the light though 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.000
 how is it possible the bulbs didn't catch fire 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.840
 Apparently I'm too early and you look at them 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.940
 what I undertake I am going this way and 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.110
 see here 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:22.180
 buns blows a landmine over the corpse 54 which 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.500
 I died before I do not understand what 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.600
 is it happening whether someone shines me 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.520
 constantly on not shoot you i 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.140
 I assume that the boor is sitting here on 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.220
 grief 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.260
 write in the comments what you think 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.790
 because i'm at a loss 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.120
 i don't understand whether i really was 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.360
 in light of whether it's just an art scam 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.370
 the blind and 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.810
 I almost killed and by the way maybe 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.070
 she really thought that I still 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.480
 there for the pipes flew away because of the corpse 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.630
 throw but I already realized that art 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.090
 is on k1 it is understandable and I go here 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.830
 but boorish that's where I got to 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.920
 perplexed just don't understand how it is 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.990
 happens apparently all the same they are the blinds 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.180
 threw hoping for the fact that they are lucky and 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.520
 almost lucky by the way see how 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.810
 shoots e drink on the go quite to yourself 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.460
 perfectly shoots on the go 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.860
 but still would not shoot on the go she 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.360
 practically can't ride there 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.610
 there should be no scatter 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.520
 again I remind you that this is a stock gun 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.410
 and I still can not show you and 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.950
 the beauty of this tank is well two and a half 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.930
 three thousand damage to fill quite real 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.820
 all the more against a dozen I had fights 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.830
 against sevens well, that is, it shows 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.990
 quite interesting because 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.560
 against sevens on any tank level 9 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.920
 will bend and that's how we are 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.050
 this fight was dragged I must say thank you 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.510
 e75 and heviku of course and 75 could and 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.480
 do something with their direct duties 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.460
 I mean to tank houses but with this 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.770
 I had to do well, and what to do 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.880
 75 so he decided to play a little 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.760
 sniper well let 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.740
 but of course he's a lot nadamazhil coats 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.420
 put on and khevik behind me covered if 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.010
 if not these two guys, then most likely I would 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.410
 Of course there is not for most likely a hundred 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.110
 percent I would die there left to finish 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.120
 the last 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.430
 artilleryman and on this the battle is over here 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.270
 such an interesting fight sign nas laz 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:12.630
 first degree speak your opinion 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.520
 Tanchik good bad I see that 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.740
 Tanchik fine only course 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.420
 his mobility she just freezes 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.360
 because it does not eat and 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.010
 it is such a moving rod and so 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.050
