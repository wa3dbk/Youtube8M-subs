00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.670 
well I think there's two different ways
to<00:00:18.330> categorize<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.230> first<00:00:19.380> I'm<00:00:19.560> just

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
to categorize this so first I'm just

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.140 
to categorize this so first I'm just
gonna<00:00:19.800> talk<00:00:19.949> money<00:00:20.189> because<00:00:20.760> even<00:00:21.029> though

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
gonna talk money because even though

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.910 
gonna talk money because even though
you've<00:00:21.330> got<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.689> new<00:00:21.960> rookie<00:00:22.350> wage<00:00:22.560> scale

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
you still get paid a lot more in the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.970 
you still get paid a lot more in the
first<00:00:24.840> job<00:00:25.080> than<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> second

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
first job than you do in the second

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.230

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960 
round you've got players like Ryan
Tannehill<00:00:27.630> Bruce<00:00:28.050> Irvin<00:00:28.439> argue<00:00:29.310> maybe<00:00:29.550> Shea

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
Tannehill Bruce Irvin argue maybe Shea

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.089 
Tannehill Bruce Irvin argue maybe Shea
McClellin<00:00:30.300> who<00:00:30.689> don't<00:00:31.050> belong<00:00:31.380> at<00:00:31.679> least

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
McClellin who don't belong at least

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.650

where<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> first<00:00:33.090> round<00:00:33.300> maybe

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
where they are in the first round maybe

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.209 
where they are in the first round maybe
should<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> second<00:00:34.739> round<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.950> think<00:00:35.130> we

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
should be in the second round I think we

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.620

Claiborne<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:12.000> thought<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.450> maybe<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
Claiborne was thought to maybe be the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.510 
Claiborne was thought to maybe be the
third<00:01:13.320> pick<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> draft<00:01:13.770> slides<00:01:14.280> down<00:01:14.490> a

third pick in the draft slides down a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.070 
third pick in the draft slides down a
few<00:01:14.790> spots<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.210> lands<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.689> perfect

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
few spots but lands in a perfect

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
few spots but lands in a perfect
location<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.250> Fletcher<00:01:17.520> Cox<00:01:17.880> down<00:01:18.210> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
location just like Fletcher Cox down to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.149 
location just like Fletcher Cox down to
12<00:01:18.630> usually<00:01:19.380> could<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.650> gone<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> top

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159

tackle<00:01:43.170> i<00:01:43.259> guess<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:43.649> depends<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.040> what's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
tackle i guess it all depends on what's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.889 
tackle i guess it all depends on what's
most<00:01:44.460> important<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.210> i<00:01:45.360> mean<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.780> can

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
most important to you i mean if you can

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:46.999 
most important to you i mean if you can
get<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.259> situation<00:01:46.770> something

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
get in the right situation something

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.980 
get in the right situation something
with<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> draft<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.640> usually<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.090> if<00:01:48.899> you

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
with the draft is usually because if you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.270 
with the draft is usually because if you
get<00:01:49.110> drafted<00:01:49.320> higher<00:01:49.649> you're<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.130> team

get drafted higher you're going to team
that's<00:01:50.460> not<00:01:50.579> very<00:01:50.729> good<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.540> this

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that's not very good right but in this

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.999 
that's not very good right but in this

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.370 
then I worry about Chandler Jones I
think<00:02:35.360> he's<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.510> great<00:02:35.780> pick<00:02:36.020> for<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.260> New

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
think he's a great pick for the New

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.450 
think he's a great pick for the New
England<00:02:36.500> Patriots<00:02:36.710> I<00:02:37.070> think<00:02:37.250> eventually

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
England Patriots I think eventually

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.100 
England Patriots I think eventually
he'll<00:02:37.850> be<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.120> right<00:02:38.270> guy<00:02:38.300> but<00:02:38.810> he's<00:02:38.930> another

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
he'll be the right guy but he's another

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.020 
he'll be the right guy but he's another
one<00:02:39.350> who<00:02:39.440> has<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.740> much<00:02:39.890> work<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.220> do<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:41.000> I

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
one who has so much work to do that I

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.640 
one who has so much work to do that I
just<00:02:41.090> wonder<00:02:41.630> if<00:02:41.660> it's<00:02:41.990> not<00:02:42.140> gonna<00:02:42.260> look<00:02:42.440> kind

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
just wonder if it's not gonna look kind

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.320 
just wonder if it's not gonna look kind
of<00:02:42.710> unpleasant<00:02:43.040> they<00:02:43.760> get<00:02:43.880> right<00:02:44.060> he's<00:02:44.240> a

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
of unpleasant they get right he's a

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.910 
of unpleasant they get right he's a
young<00:02:44.540> kid<00:02:44.570> now<00:02:45.020> he's<00:02:45.170> gonna<00:02:45.290> be<00:02:45.470> asked<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.800> do

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
young kid now he's gonna be asked to do

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.230 
young kid now he's gonna be asked to do
a<00:02:45.950> lot<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.220> things<00:02:46.490> in<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:46.730> Willie<00:02:46.940> McGinest

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
a lot of things in that Willie McGinest

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.790 
a lot of things in that Willie McGinest
position<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.020> may<00:02:48.110> be<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.260> little<00:02:48.440> bit<00:02:48.650> too

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
position that may be a little bit too

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.230 
position that may be a little bit too
much<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.220> absorb<00:02:49.310> right<00:02:49.670> away<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:49.940> think

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
much to absorb right away I think

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.400 
much to absorb right away I think
Hightower's<00:02:50.720> numbers<00:02:51.020> will<00:02:51.110> be<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.230> little

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
Hightower's numbers will be a little

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.980 
Hightower's numbers will be a little
bigger<00:02:51.650> near<00:02:51.950> one<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.850> still<00:02:53.330> go<00:02:53.630> back<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.900> the

McCoy Estill earned the right to compete
for<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.570> position<00:03:29.810> Weeden's<00:03:30.770> 28<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.400> going

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
for that position Weeden's 28 is going

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.370 
for that position Weeden's 28 is going
to<00:03:31.610> be<00:03:31.730> 29<00:03:32.180> but<00:03:32.360> if<00:03:32.420> he<00:03:32.510> takes<00:03:32.660> one<00:03:32.930> year<00:03:32.960> so

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
to be 29 but if he takes one year so

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.530 
to be 29 but if he takes one year so
what<00:03:33.620> I'd<00:03:34.250> really<00:03:34.550> be<00:03:34.730> disappointed<00:03:35.360> if<00:03:35.450> they
