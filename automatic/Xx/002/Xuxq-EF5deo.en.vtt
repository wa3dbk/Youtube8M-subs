00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
 we are going to present to you how to do 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.190
 massive pecan nut 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:12.030
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:14.830
 two or more nuts 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.900
 hunosa with water 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.900
 and a two-liter bottle 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:28.180
 a scissor or thumbtack 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.330
 as you presi want and land 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.330
 black 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.400
 first step 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.680
 the cup of water and put 4 nuts or more or 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 what you want to be able 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.210
 They will appreciate that twice over 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.640
 five days they will be up or some 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.820
 are going to come down for example these 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.060
 in this case open walnuts by the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.519
 time that has already happened these times because no 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.689
 they serve and are listening to a lot of liquid 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.689
 it's so for planting 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.369
 second step will be to keep a warehouse 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.920
 about half as much as you 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.869
 want if you want something like that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.930
 after that you'll have to make some 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.900
 eggs 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.160
 so it's water light we have four 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.160
 Bajitos is what you want 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.039
 third 2 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.300
 given the powers that we have cut 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:42.000
 this part 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.000
 and give him land you gave him 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.270
 Half the half 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.729
 less than half land 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.740
 black earth put here 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:02.130
 our own garden or a buy it 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.130
 in a video 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.840
 then we will have to put 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.530
 the nuts that are with him 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.530
 I propose to put voices 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.650
 after they see for their 25 days cover 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.080
 with 2 centimeters 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.080
 of Earth 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.050
 and this is going to last three two or three 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:37.520
 months to grow the plant after 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.040
 that will be able to move it to a bigger place 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.970
 a jar of what they have and then 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.030
 pass the earth that will last about three or 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.460
 four years to give them good fruits 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.590
 I hope you liked it they have to 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.040
 watering it always always have to water 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.719
 own ones like 2 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.830
 in the script are rather all the 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:02.380
 materials 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.380
 step by step thank you very much I'm from
