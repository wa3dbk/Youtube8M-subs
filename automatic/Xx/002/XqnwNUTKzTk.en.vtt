 Already many products are always sold 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.920

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.280
 This can always make the products 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.420
 We already know that we have got involved 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.280
 In the evening always a few doors confessed 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.830

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.830

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.540
 Yes 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.079
 so it came to new challenge 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:03.379
 got the faces of new business 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.740
 nothing new is nothing and she is not 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.110
 on nothing unknown like 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.479

 The contract has now expired 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.690
 So it was always annual contracts that 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.210
 a lot of skin was a year one man 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.000

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.420
 people speak 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.380
 the shop operators become studio operators 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.380

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.610

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.129
 made always says yes immediately makes out 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.209
 the point where the deep somehow so with 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.459
 made the impression because that 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.470
 I wanted to go away and there I am 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.540
 first time at home but so 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.079
 For 56 years , there is always 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.670
 more to keep their power is always 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.790

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.760
 12 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.590

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.209

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.440
 Product what I like the most 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.630
 actually used is the visual 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.550
 neutral so that means no dye 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.590
 no sweeteners no flavors nothing 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.190
