00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.220
 this was May there are also pleasing so I am pleased that is the 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.390
 Thought of social justice 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.599
 there was nothing funny 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.700
 What makes me happy is that the idea of ​​social justice is always 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.710
 greater popularity in this country even in the SPD so 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.520
 after the great ideas of humanity 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.230
 the basic security is always prevail against Altena resistances percent 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.910
 So when introducing the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.409
 Euro bottle 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.510
 I do not mean the Verheugen Rheine 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.510
 Dr 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.950
 KS defender of the credit ear 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.980
 in the formation of inflation and also tax evasion 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.160
 Good ideas are just through 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.030
 the poverty 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.090
 a good keyword which has long interested me as Abbott announced 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 actually the child poverty in this 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.730
 b if I have our staff in Berlin at their responsible the chest and 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.090
 Listening to Dirk Lottner, Mama gave you the impression that child poverty was a plague 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.670
 the percentage has come over Germany is like GC so Labbadia 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.130
 Kreisliga a 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.130
 So who is a blessing? 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.420
 Ari Head Research of the perpetrators if they ask who organizes the so 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.200
 Poverty of children in this country the crisis has come to child poverty 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.050
 where our social leaders for decades nothing Andrews 8 million than 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.780
 Family association and again Kind of Brabant so that the child poverty on none 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.590
 Fall to prevent child labor because there is promoted or is 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.870
 Child poverty maybe 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.240
 an integral part of the system 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.340
 the Federal Constitutional Court held years ago that families 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.380
 with children in this country extremely because after the perpetrators already at the second 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.350
 Child threatens the risk of poverty so 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.460
 Of course, we also know why this is because that parents so 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.600
 know how with children 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.919
 the DFA to the childless 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.930
 extremely the detrimental welfare state in this band 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.249
 even the childless 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.799
 the numbers the narros as much social tasks as the parents 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.799
 but of course I have the families with children less money to live 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.739
 as the children out 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:25.779
 if then 

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:28.719
 For example, the VAT increases, the rising 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.579
 Cost of living like the Kreke family 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.619
 therefore comes the child poverty 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:37.019
 Although the stone is effective if the one from the continues to suffer from the competitors 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.009
 frets 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.950
 Everyone knows that basically everything is put out of one hand 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.899
 but 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.360
 it can be hard to change 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.659
 as the food 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.959
 and that is needed very urgently elsewhere 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:55.040
 There are other needy people in this country, such as the banks 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.429
 there from 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:11.689
 the hall this the Hornby the industry credit bank the the Mr. Steinbrück 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:12.979
 March with 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.099
 the estimates are different 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.980
 as Matt 2 billion I read as Cook 5 up to 2 2 times 2 billion 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.279
 save must be visible 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.279
 as a sticking point 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.959
 Antje the state-owned Kreditanstalt zur Wiederaufbau already with 40 percent 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.939
 must be involved 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.400
 direct Werder is already tax money Trend and so comedian 5 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.889
 billion 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.639
 but also the Landesbanken also left money for the top 5 billion 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.200
 Labbadia says the bavaria-lb Euro 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.009
 All three have been the money 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.409
 understands so that can continue to exist yes 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.959
 it goes into the double-digit billion Hambrecht the 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:49.990
 Monitor business 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.130
 It should be easier optimally supplied it is about the 20 billion pieces one 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.610
 should consider how much is actually one billion of the center 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.179
 are millions of euros 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:01.939
 as they are very tight banking crisis when 20 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:06.819
 Billions cost that is 20% billion euros for comparison 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.379
 The market should be on Alpe Adria or Dada Life Forever 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.439
 Heidfeld Relaño one of the places in the land of ideas far because there is very behavior 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.740
 when editing comparison 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.740
 guide her normal thinking along the way 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.090
 in the adjustment of the child benefit 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.340
 It's about one who made it 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.340
 and that is very difficult to find 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.569
 and of course the children eliminate poverty 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:54.740
 Steinbrück 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.500
 Of course, but now he has now in the concerns whether he even the 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.330
 long overdue adjustment of child benefit 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.479
 to the increased cost of living 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.680
 but the grumpy Rome 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.969
 even now 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:09.620
 mostly too 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.620
 So her husband would have to work with this staff in Berlin 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.159
 watch 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.110
 pa do not know 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.029
 cool 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:18.289
 that she 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.289
 according to system procedure 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.479
 and that's what we should do too 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.050
 because of the proposal 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.539
 But go to the bank every morning 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.539
 and against their savings 8 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.809
 in the answer 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:39.219
 There are many who believe the train when they are at home but still 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:40.620
 by Philipp Hadorn 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.620
 Emperor 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.590
 no ruckus to your bank and that's why he's always there where you still are 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.740
 see if engines have 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.740
 so that is unemployed 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.389
 have lots of fun with it
