00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:10.769
 baboo crazy price plans 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.660
 gbagbo hello to all and welcome to 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.250
 the interview of the week today me 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.839
 that's all yellow and blue dressed for 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.010
 welcome wesley fofana in this 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.369
 week of two cup finals 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.230
 europe 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.740
 hello and thank you we have 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.960
 joined at the stadium marcel michelin for 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.840
 before departure to saint-etienne 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.060
 how was this after 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.130
 match I was not part of the group the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.210
 last week 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.320
 what has already been said about this 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.309
 match early in the week but 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.100
 I guess you could switch 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.629
 pretty fast on the next rocking enough 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.570
 soon learn anyway anyway 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.829
 spoke of the game here franck has us 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.059
 tell what's there what she's going to tell me 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.960
 was not l were not happy 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.430
 necessarily and so here I think that 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.260
 everyone everyone understood 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.899
 everyone will work compared 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.070
 to that and that's it's matches 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.489
 who are coming in and you have to do it 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.290
 do with 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.390
 to switch right away on a 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.790
 again on the european cup if half 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.840
 final you refocus any site there 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.670
 on it is something that you 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.420
 wait in what state of mind you 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.460
 you do not necessarily want to 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.590
 win this semi final already so that's it 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.290
 we do everything we can to make it happen 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.180
 the carbon is gone in internship in internship 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.630
 to really be together and 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.220
 work well as it should be 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.740
 all the little details 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.260
 it reassures but it is sure will speak to each other 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.570
 the priora be it who has not kinÃ© or 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.310
 on the ground or 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.170
 this is shared between us outside 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.740
 it was important it was this little 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.570
 stay forward advance the process 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 when we see again this team of 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.940
 saracens and compared to the year 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.800
 last you have an account there has 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.220
 met pardon just in semifinal 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.150
 this season he was in your hen 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.270
 do you see any differences 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.180
 in their game of differences I know 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.150
 not always a team very 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.619
 pragmatic and who always plays very 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.570
 simple but very effective 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.880
 unfortunately and so that's who is trying 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.530
 to find to find the small flaw 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.750
 at the opponent's doing it 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.520
 make mistakes and put him 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.840
 a big pressure so that's enough 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.979
 pretty recurrent anyway but that 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.720
 come back again this year 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.280
 but now we know them we know them 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.440
 rather well is known about both 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.130
 matches that took place in matches of 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.510
 hen this season 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.600
 what can you do 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.530
 hold low roof will tell what I know 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.160
 that I just said after this is a 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.660
 team it's a team that goes that goes 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.280
 play to fault English that's going to 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.959
 who's going to have a strategy and who's going who 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.270
 will stay on it so we if we 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.920
 can not stop what we have 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.200
 woke up his aura saw the week we go 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.200
 to say that will already be a big step in 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.440
 will talk about the time the victory bridge in 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.180
 anyway we think it's the roofs for 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.580
 you player what does it make you 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.530
 to go play in this cauldron is 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.000
 awesome that's how I said it's 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.470
 did not go far at all so we get 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.989
 consider we 'll say a little bit at home 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.670
 us for this match and even if the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.660
 English will have a lot of public I write 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.760
 I can understand 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.220
 I think we will still be 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.360
 well push it's true we'll be 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.880
 well pushed and I think it's very 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.580
 important to have all our supporters 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.770
 from us who push us 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.510
 it's a big advantage in France language 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.400
 the forgiveness atmosphere of geoffroy guichard 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.830
 you know her as supporters of 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.870
 football also yeah that's it's a 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.560
 fun for rugby fans but true 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.740
 I saw I saw a lot will match 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.420
 me especially when I beat 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.730
 the paris saint germain moves to 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.770
 Saint-Etienne is always great 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.780
 matches super stadium so I love it 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.550
 you will be on the dust will be and 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.990
 Clermont supporters in the stands 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.090
 here I think it's even better 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.790
 that mr ice cream without some chills 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.360
 hoping that this theme ends 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.020
 in the best way for us and 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.150
 for supporters 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.040
 when I say we sell it very well 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.040
 I thank you good song Saturday 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.110
