00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:22.730
 straight about planning the day as the main 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:23.990
 the point where all our goals converge with us 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.310
 be another technology which 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.160
 called rigidly flexible algorithms 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.820
 planning which will allow us 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.350
 make graphics more flexible 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.670
 adequate 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.930
 changeable depending on what 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.680
 us going within our worker 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.750
 day scheduling algorithm zero step 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.090
 we have already been planning it 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.320
 this is before we painted all the routine 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.020
 fix the main thing of the day is 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.489
 makes a strategic carton in my 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.010
 diary under it a special line 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.110
 from above and with this sign is important 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.739
 the matter of the day that is the first thing you do 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.110
 before planning you looked 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.160
 strategy carton and you fixed 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.800
 which is not urgent but important over took today 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.030
 there is a five step algorithm 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.440
 first step on the timeline 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.259
 schedule the so -called hard 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.330
 a meeting 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.380
 page share in half 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.270
 diary page divided in half 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.160
 on the left will be tough out holds flexible 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.770
 if talking about Loki on the left will 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 calendar to the right of flexible tasks and here 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.869
 in this left side tough meeting 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:37.030
 for example from 11 to 12 meetings from 14 to 15 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.220
 customer will arrive 17 to 18 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.300
 the presentation draw your attention not 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.880
 all day is painted 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.429
 and I am only a very small number of temporary 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.869
 Here are the plots gap clog those 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.149
 what has a specific exact time 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.310
 start has melted the arrangement and 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.179
 pre- known time so called 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.880
 tough meeting 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.380
 2 flexible tasks on the right we write all 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.530
 what would you like to do today 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.660
 but it can here at different times 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.420
 prepare a protocol following the meeting 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.530
 I can do any time during the day 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.429
 let's say a client will come my something 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.569
 agree to make quotes 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.330
 write a commercial offer 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.129
 the results of the sky presentation are ready to slides 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.590
 you need to review them again 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.910
 edit and send to anyone 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.220
 deal with the technical side 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.810
 The presentation still took the phone and call 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.440
 supervisor clarify 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.330
 options 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.090
 annual report still needed 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.330
 control the preparation for the exhibition 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.640
 which will soon still need to buy 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.290
 flowers to wife and so on there is some 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.580
 a set of tasks that I want to do today 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.840
 but you can do at any time of the day 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.940
 the third step among these flexible tasks 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.400
 highlight here begins 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.590
 complexity is important and necessary without it 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.380
 no need it yesterday it 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.030
 sure to eat like everything is important here 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.890
 here it is necessary to put a hard border 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.660
 you know there is such a training 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.510
 team building here us groups 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.489
 let's say the same in the company we're on 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.310
 submarines boat sinks 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.530
 half an hour left there are three space suits here 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.690
 decide we have half an hour to solve 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.060
 who dignity and spacesuit people so much 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.310
 new must interesting enters 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.290
 such gambling begins 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.379
 creep out here the same 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.420
 I advise 2 maximum 3 priority 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.459
 call us alone we already have the main thing 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.410
 matter of the day accordingly account from here still 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.359
 a couple of highlighted two priority 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.060
 prioritization is painful 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.130
 process because this one is like everyone else 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.959
 I would like to save the spacesuit just 2 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.940
 while this does not mean that we will not 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.040
 do the rest priority is in 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.440
 the transfer of who goes first understood that 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.420
 first in terms of quality time 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.959
 paid attention go these red 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.319
 task 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:49.069
 and the rest is already 4 step 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.019
 budgeting for the main thing of the day and here 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.810
 these priorities highlight the budget 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.079
 not a plan and budget for example the main thing 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.419
 day I do for an hour for example 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:03.680
 work on iso 9001 2000 standards 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:05.590
 which we introduce the very proposal 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.079
 for the client they will borrow from me 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.959
 half an hour and preparation of presentation slides 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.060
 it will take me half an hour for what 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.910
 need memory budgeting very important 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.530
 the test question is the sum of all hard and 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.560
 all you forget rowan them should be no 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.880
 more than 70 percent of the workday 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.070
 check meeting client meetings 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.710
 presentation 3 hours + 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.380
 the main thing of the day is four plus these two 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.430
 half an hour 55 hours from an 8-hour worker 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.950
 it's okay for the day 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.020
 somewhere just 60 percent with something you 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.950
 are getting 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.530
 accordingly for what budgeting 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.500
 this is a test question we make sure 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.380
 what we have time to do exactly hard 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.270
 what is planned 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.360
 time and we definitely have time to do 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.250
 priority and we still have 30 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.350
 percent on working off surprises 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.330
 if surprises do not occur then we 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.520
 we will do the rest of the flexible tasks to 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.300
 I have such a saying about 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.910
 time management 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.500
 give manju this is how to do it all 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.910
 sometimes regional workshop partners so 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.030
 trying to call that black oil like everyone else 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.340
 I prosper, and to suppress it and explain that 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.440
 all the time we can not influence it 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.960
 we can't know if we all have time 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.140
 all we wrote here in the morning of the same 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.970
 hallucination we would like to have a day 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.230
 evolved so that we to spend that 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.810
 such time management is not like 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.550
 to do everything so how to do the main thing is 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.010
 very big time management difference 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.850
 This is how to catch the main thing here we are currently 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.950
 guaranteed 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.900
 that we have time hard have time 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.090
 priority is we have time important 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.930
 we still have a reserve everything else 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.910
 how lucky and advice you know for people 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.980
 who studied excellent in school 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.900
 get a gold medal red diploma 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.000
 these people are usually very tormented 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.720
 when they are not made at the end of the day there 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.500
 don't cross out where I'm not an excellent student 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.500
 bad up 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:06:00.190
 bless let go give indulgence 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:01.960
 completely normal to have more here 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.389
 tasks and how you can do it realistically 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.129
 it is absolutely normal important that 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.650
 realistic looked at tight and on 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:12.159
 the priority for everything else is ours 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.900
 success hypothesis well we do not have time 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:15.460
 had time for something else more important 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.470
 moved the next day nothing 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.580
 scary and perfectly normal here it is 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.000
 algorithm rigid flexible planning 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:25.479
 fifth step is natural adjustment 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.800
 changing the day the signals that change 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.710
 Come if the customer calls and says 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.240
 listen and here we have thunder announced 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.440
 it is clear that you have some priority 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.659
 review and add another another 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.460
 task to list add it high 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:41.680
 priority meeting will naturally 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.900
 move for some reason and due 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.789
 reserves in will always respond to and 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.069
 movement that is and pray what happens 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.169
 it turns out a plan that breathes lives and 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:52.539
 reacts to the situation and it has 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.729
 element and hard skeleton skeleton 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:58.469
 which keeps our commitment to eat 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:58.469
 elements of the flexible here to respond
