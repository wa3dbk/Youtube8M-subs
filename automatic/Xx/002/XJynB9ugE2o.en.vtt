mean I think we would probably not want
to<00:02:40.549> do<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.819> until<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.180> knew<00:02:41.299> if<00:02:41.390> they<00:02:41.510> had<00:02:41.629> a

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
to do that until we knew if they had a

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.569 
to do that until we knew if they had a
neck<00:02:41.870> injury<00:02:41.900> or<00:02:42.349> not<00:02:42.500> well<00:02:42.829> that<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.220> not

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
neck injury or not well that is that not
