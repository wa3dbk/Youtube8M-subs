00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
awkward having one pass button is really

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.349 
awkward having one pass button is really
really<00:01:18.140> stupid<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:19.100> just<00:01:19.310> makes<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.700> stupid

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
really stupid it just makes a stupid

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:21.929 
really stupid it just makes a stupid
game<00:01:20.539> play<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:20.840> just<00:01:21.229> doesn't<00:01:21.679> make<00:01:21.770> sense

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
game play and just doesn't make sense

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.899 
game play and just doesn't make sense
they<00:01:22.939> is<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:24.049> no<00:01:24.229> sprint<00:01:24.590> button<00:01:24.770> I<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.009> agree

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
they is the no sprint button I I agree

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.080 
they is the no sprint button I I agree
with<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.119> makes<00:01:26.600> sense<00:01:26.929> but<00:01:27.679> they<00:01:28.579> they<00:01:28.909> need

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
with that makes sense but they they need

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.880 
with that makes sense but they they need
to<00:01:29.210> be<00:01:29.359> able<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.689> make<00:01:29.719> work<00:01:30.259> that<00:01:30.439> out<00:01:30.560> somehow

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
to be able to make work that out somehow

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.859 
to be able to make work that out somehow
I<00:01:31.159> would<00:01:31.579> prefer<00:01:31.789> them<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.329> go<00:01:32.479> back<00:01:32.689> to<00:01:32.840> the

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869

rugby<00:01:33.170> 08<00:01:33.320> style<00:01:33.829> of<00:01:33.950> gameplay<00:01:34.159> I'm<00:01:34.549> sure<00:01:34.969> they

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
rugby 08 style of gameplay I'm sure they

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.330 
rugby 08 style of gameplay I'm sure they
still<00:01:35.390> have<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.689> files<00:01:35.929> I'm<00:01:36.200> sure<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:37.189> they

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
still have the files I'm sure that they

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.889

can<00:01:37.520> do<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.729> really<00:01:38.060> good<00:01:38.299> job<00:01:38.329> with<00:01:38.539> it<00:01:38.659> because

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
can do a really good job with it because

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.139 
can do a really good job with it because
if<00:01:39.200> fights<00:01:39.499> fun<00:01:39.829> gameplay<00:01:40.159> that's<00:01:40.789> why<00:01:40.939> reg

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
if fights fun gameplay that's why reg

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.730 
if fights fun gameplay that's why reg
boa<00:01:41.390> it's<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.689> best<00:01:41.869> game<00:01:42.020> because<00:01:42.289> it's<00:01:42.409> fine
