my first video which of course if you
haven't<00:00:25.270> watched<00:00:25.480> you<00:00:25.690> should<00:00:25.900> do<00:00:26.050> so<00:00:26.289> already

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
haven't watched you should do so already

I've already been quite busy here
building<00:00:29.680> a<00:00:29.970> quite<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.119> base<00:00:31.300> at<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.690> moment

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
building a quite the base at the moment

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.250 
building a quite the base at the moment
and<00:00:32.550> everything<00:00:33.550> in<00:00:33.670> this<00:00:33.850> base<00:00:34.180> is<00:00:34.420> protected

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
and everything in this base is protected

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.369 
and everything in this base is protected
nobody<00:00:35.980> can<00:00:36.160> open<00:00:36.370> my<00:00:36.670> chest<00:00:37.059> nobody<00:00:38.019> can<00:00:38.229> take

can do is come up here open this door
and<00:00:43.659> walk<00:00:43.929> around<00:00:44.170> inside<00:00:44.859> now<00:00:45.789> if<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:46.149> don't

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
and walk around inside now if I don't

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.569 
and walk around inside now if I don't
want<00:00:46.690> them<00:00:46.839> to<00:00:46.960> get<00:00:47.079> in<00:00:47.229> here<00:00:47.710> instead<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.489> a

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
want them to get in here instead of a

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.270 
want them to get in here instead of a
wooden<00:00:48.969> door<00:00:49.239> all<00:00:49.569> I<00:00:49.629> have<00:00:50.229> to<00:00:50.350> do<00:00:50.530> is<00:00:50.799> put<00:00:51.159> in

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
wooden door all I have to do is put in

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.270 
wooden door all I have to do is put in
an<00:00:51.399> iron<00:00:51.699> door<00:00:51.999> an<00:00:52.269> iron<00:00:53.139> door<00:00:53.409> with<00:00:53.679> button<00:00:54.069> or

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
an iron door an iron door with button or

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.759 
an iron door an iron door with button or
a<00:00:54.309> lever<00:00:54.579> would<00:00:55.269> prevent<00:00:55.659> anybody<00:00:56.170> from<00:00:56.379> even

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
a lever would prevent anybody from even

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.189 
a lever would prevent anybody from even
being<00:00:56.979> able<00:00:57.069> to<00:00:57.190> get<00:00:57.309> inside<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.729> building

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
being able to get inside the building

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.219 
being able to get inside the building
because<00:00:59.199> they<00:00:59.319> can't<00:00:59.589> destroy<00:01:00.010> any<00:01:00.280> blocks<00:01:00.579> if

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
because they can't destroy any blocks if

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.229 
because they can't destroy any blocks if
you<00:01:02.229> use<00:01:02.409> a<00:01:02.440> pressure<00:01:02.859> pad<00:01:03.159> though<00:01:03.489> they<00:01:04.059> would

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
you use a pressure pad though they would

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.060 
you use a pressure pad though they would
still<00:01:04.570> be<00:01:04.780> able<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.080> open<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.590> door

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
still be able to open the door

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.340 
still be able to open the door
pressure<00:01:06.549> pads<00:01:06.970> are<00:01:07.210> on<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.510> exception<00:01:08.110> list

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
pressure pads are on the exception list

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.280 
pressure pads are on the exception list
and<00:01:08.710> so<00:01:09.310> as<00:01:09.520> pressure<00:01:09.880> pads<00:01:10.240> can<00:01:10.630> be<00:01:10.750> used<00:01:11.080> as

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
and so as pressure pads can be used as

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.740 
and so as pressure pads can be used as
automatic<00:01:12.130> sensors<00:01:12.610> now<00:01:13.300> in<00:01:13.450> this<00:01:13.570> particular

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
automatic sensors now in this particular

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.770 
automatic sensors now in this particular
case<00:01:14.260> though<00:01:14.560> we<00:01:15.370> now<00:01:15.580> want<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.880> see<00:01:16.150> my<00:01:16.390> claim

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
case though we now want to see my claim

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.870 
case though we now want to see my claim
so<00:01:17.110> I<00:01:17.140> right<00:01:17.410> click<00:01:17.440> inside<00:01:18.040> my<00:01:18.280> claim<00:01:18.550> with<00:01:18.730> my

so I right click inside my claim with my

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.880 
so I right click inside my claim with my
stick<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:19.540> sure<00:01:20.020> enough<00:01:20.080> there<00:01:20.620> are<00:01:20.650> the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
stick and sure enough there are the

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.550 
stick and sure enough there are the
claim<00:01:21.160> blocks<00:01:21.490> from<00:01:21.790> before<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.450> now<00:01:23.260> want<00:01:23.530> to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
of one of the blocks notice it says it's

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.760 
of one of the blocks notice it says it's
resizing<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.430> claim<00:01:54.820> if<00:01:55.150> I<00:01:55.720> now<00:01:55.930> walk<00:01:56.200> o<00:01:56.260> to<00:01:56.530> be

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
resizing the claim if I now walk o to be

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.950 
resizing the claim if I now walk o to be
larger<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.610> right-click<00:01:57.850> again<00:02:00.150> my<00:02:01.150> claim<00:02:01.600> is
