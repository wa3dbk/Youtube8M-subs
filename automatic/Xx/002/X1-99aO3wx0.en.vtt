hello again and welcome to the SF
recovery<00:00:08.440> team<00:00:08.940> today<00:00:09.940> we're<00:00:10.150> going<00:00:10.240> to<00:00:10.330> take

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:10.509 
recovery team today we're going to take

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.690 
recovery team today we're going to take
a<00:00:10.539> look<00:00:10.749> at<00:00:10.870> that<00:00:10.990> Thomas<00:00:11.440> compressor<00:00:12.009> you<00:00:12.490> see

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
a look at that Thomas compressor you see

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.299 
a look at that Thomas compressor you see
why<00:00:13.450> I<00:00:13.480> wasn't<00:00:13.749> pumping<00:00:14.169> enough<00:00:14.409> air<00:00:14.679> in<00:00:15.099> the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
why I wasn't pumping enough air in the

valves<00:00:21.220> crack<00:00:21.940> and<00:00:22.390> break<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.980> so<00:00:24.730> we<00:00:24.880> open<00:00:25.180> her

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
valves crack and break so so we open her

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.160 
valves crack and break so so we open her
up<00:00:25.300> and<00:00:25.600> take<00:00:25.780> a<00:00:25.810> look<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:28.300> compressor<00:00:28.840> we<00:00:28.990> use

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
up and take a look the compressor we use

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.230 
up and take a look the compressor we use
in<00:00:29.410> was<00:00:29.710> originally<00:00:30.280> designed<00:00:30.490> for<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.060> air

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
in was originally designed for the air

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.810 
in was originally designed for the air
suspension<00:00:31.480> and<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.169> rear<00:00:32.200> of<00:00:32.559> an<00:00:32.860> h2<00:00:33.280> it's

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
suspension and the rear of an h2 it's

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.380 
suspension and the rear of an h2 it's
capable<00:00:34.030> of<00:00:34.480> 100<00:00:34.870> psi<00:00:35.410> and<00:00:35.770> as<00:00:36.130> a<00:00:36.160> sealed<00:00:36.520> unit

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.840 

but<00:00:40.390> when<00:00:40.780> it<00:00:40.900> was<00:00:41.050> in<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.260> h2<00:00:41.800> it<00:00:42.130> wasn't<00:00:42.730> able

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
but when it was in the h2 it wasn't able

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.060 
but when it was in the h2 it wasn't able
to<00:00:43.030> pump<00:00:43.329> up<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:43.720> up<00:00:43.810> air<00:00:44.110> to<00:00:44.560> keep<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.890> rear

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
to pump up and up air to keep the rear

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.400 
to pump up and up air to keep the rear
end<00:00:45.280> up<00:00:45.460> anymore<00:00:45.810> so<00:00:46.810> we<00:00:46.899> got<00:00:47.050> to<00:00:47.140> pull<00:00:47.320> the

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
end up anymore so we got to pull the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:01:10.020 
end up anymore so we got to pull the
head<00:00:47.590> off<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:48.220> see<00:00:48.430> what<00:00:48.579> was<00:00:48.700> wrong

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.639 

in<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.240> head<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.539> compressor<00:01:12.170> there's<00:01:12.560> a

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
in the head of the compressor there's a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:13.919 
in the head of the compressor there's a
cover

corrosion that we need to take care of
that<00:01:29.719> must<00:01:30.020> have<00:01:30.170> been<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.409> problem<00:01:30.859> why<00:01:31.189> it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
that must have been the problem why it

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:42.209 
that must have been the problem why it
wasn't<00:01:31.520> pumping<00:01:31.849> up<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.299> full<00:01:32.509> pressure

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.010 

because<00:01:43.219> the<00:01:43.369> recovery<00:01:43.640> team<00:01:44.060> operates<00:01:44.750> on<00:01:44.989> a

because the recovery team operates on a
small<00:01:45.349> budget<00:01:45.560> we<00:01:46.399> decided<00:01:46.969> to<00:01:47.179> clean

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
small budget we decided to clean

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.119 
small budget we decided to clean
everything<00:01:47.810> up<00:01:47.929> rather<00:01:48.439> than<00:01:48.619> spend<00:01:49.039> the

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:49.129 
everything up rather than spend the

00:01:49.129 --> 00:02:14.259 
everything up rather than spend the
money<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.610> buy<00:01:49.849> a<00:01:49.879> rebuild<00:01:50.360> kit

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.300 

the<00:02:15.269> only<00:02:15.390> gasket<00:02:16.049> is<00:02:16.200> between<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.799> top<00:02:17.010> valve

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the only gasket is between the top valve

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.610 
the only gasket is between the top valve
and<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.700> cover<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.330> that's<00:02:18.870> where<00:02:19.140> most<00:02:19.349> of

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
and the cover and that's where most of

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
and the cover and that's where most of
the<00:02:19.739> corrosion<00:02:20.040> was<00:02:25.819> so<00:02:26.819> we<00:02:27.000> had<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.330> get<00:02:27.480> a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the corrosion was so we had to get a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.449 
the corrosion was so we had to get a
little<00:02:27.870> more<00:02:28.049> aggressive<00:02:28.260> with<00:02:28.830> cleaning<00:02:29.340> up

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
little more aggressive with cleaning up

00:02:29.459 --> 00:03:00.590 
little more aggressive with cleaning up
those<00:02:29.670> parts

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.880 

even<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:01.750> all<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.020> parts<00:03:02.319> clean

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
even with all the parts clean

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.680 
even with all the parts clean
we<00:03:03.069> still<00:03:03.340> had<00:03:03.490> a<00:03:03.520> little<00:03:03.730> bit<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:04.030> pitting<00:03:04.300> in

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
we still had a little bit of pitting in

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.260 
we still had a little bit of pitting in
both<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.260> aluminum<00:03:05.740> cover<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.459> intermediate

both the aluminum cover and intermediate

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.930 
both the aluminum cover and intermediate
plate<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:08.440> we<00:03:08.470> decided<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.310> seal<00:03:09.760> everything

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
plate so we decided to seal everything

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.390 

we<00:03:26.900> had<00:03:27.050> to<00:03:27.200> make<00:03:27.319> sure<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:27.650> we<00:03:27.950> had<00:03:28.100> a<00:03:28.130> good

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
we had to make sure that we had a good

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.370 
we had to make sure that we had a good
seal<00:03:28.700> between<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.450> intake<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.350> exhaust

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
seal between the intake and the exhaust

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.680 
seal between the intake and the exhaust
side<00:03:32.319> as<00:03:33.319> well<00:03:34.310> as<00:03:34.730> sealing<00:03:35.270> all<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.569> way

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
side as well as sealing all the way

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.649 
side as well as sealing all the way
around<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.140> outside

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.380 

as<00:03:43.890> we<00:03:44.890> were<00:03:45.010> assembling<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.670> plates<00:03:45.909> we<00:03:46.209> had

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
as we were assembling the plates we had

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.910 
as we were assembling the plates we had
to<00:03:46.510> make<00:03:46.659> sure<00:03:46.689> that<00:03:47.140> we<00:03:47.230> put<00:03:47.439> things<00:03:47.680> together

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
to make sure that we put things together

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.339 
to make sure that we put things together
properly<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:49.000> we<00:03:49.120> had<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.299> valve<00:03:49.599> that<00:03:49.750> works<00:03:50.049> as

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
properly so we had a valve that works as

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.559 
properly so we had a valve that works as
intake<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.549> valve<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:52.030> works<00:03:52.269> as<00:03:52.510> the

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
intake and a valve that works as the

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:21.529 

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:24.049 

well<00:07:22.529> now<00:07:23.219> that<00:07:23.339> we<00:07:23.520> got<00:07:23.550> the<00:07:23.789> compressor

00:07:24.049 --> 00:07:24.059 
well now that we got the compressor

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:26.179 
well now that we got the compressor
fixed<00:07:24.629> and<00:07:24.899> pumping<00:07:25.229> air<00:07:25.409> and<00:07:26.039> all<00:07:26.159> the

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:26.189 
fixed and pumping air and all the

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:28.309 
fixed and pumping air and all the
plumbing<00:07:26.639> done<00:07:26.789> the<00:07:27.389> last<00:07:27.599> thing<00:07:27.869> is

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 
plumbing done the last thing is

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.919 
plumbing done the last thing is
awareness<00:07:28.889> for<00:07:29.159> the<00:07:29.249> electrical<00:07:29.749> but<00:07:30.749> as

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:30.929 
awareness for the electrical but as

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:33.260 
awareness for the electrical but as
usual<00:07:31.409> things<00:07:32.099> don't<00:07:32.399> quite<00:07:32.580> work<00:07:32.669> the<00:07:32.939> way

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.270 
usual things don't quite work the way

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.689 
usual things don't quite work the way
you<00:07:33.300> plan<00:07:33.449> I<00:07:34.129> thought<00:07:35.129> I<00:07:35.159> could<00:07:35.429> use<00:07:35.580> the

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 
you plan I thought I could use the

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:37.820 
you plan I thought I could use the
pressure<00:07:35.939> switch<00:07:36.300> to<00:07:37.050> run<00:07:37.229> the<00:07:37.349> circuit<00:07:37.679> for

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:37.830 
pressure switch to run the circuit for

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.189 
pressure switch to run the circuit for
the<00:07:37.919> compressor<00:07:38.330> but<00:07:39.330> unfortunately<00:07:39.990> there's

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 
the compressor but unfortunately there's

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:41.809 
the compressor but unfortunately there's
too<00:07:40.349> much<00:07:40.499> of<00:07:40.709> a<00:07:40.800> voltage<00:07:41.159> drop<00:07:41.339> to<00:07:41.729> the

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 
too much of a voltage drop to the

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:44.389 
too much of a voltage drop to the
contacts<00:07:42.300> in<00:07:42.689> the<00:07:42.839> pressure<00:07:43.050> switch<00:07:43.379> and<00:07:43.740> not

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:44.399 
contacts in the pressure switch and not

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:46.369 
contacts in the pressure switch and not
enough<00:07:44.759> left<00:07:44.999> over<00:07:45.179> to<00:07:45.509> run<00:07:45.749> the<00:07:45.839> compressor

00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:46.379 
enough left over to run the compressor

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:50.179 
enough left over to run the compressor
so<00:07:46.589> it'll<00:07:47.369> pump<00:07:47.550> off<00:07:47.759> the<00:07:47.939> full<00:07:48.119> pressure<00:07:49.189> so

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:50.189 
so it'll pump off the full pressure so

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:52.070 
so it'll pump off the full pressure so
what<00:07:50.309> we're<00:07:50.399> going<00:07:50.550> to<00:07:50.610> have<00:07:50.759> to<00:07:50.939> do<00:07:51.089> is<00:07:51.839> use

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 
what we're going to have to do is use

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.909 
what we're going to have to do is use
the<00:07:52.259> pressure<00:07:52.499> switch<00:07:52.860> to<00:07:53.759> drive<00:07:54.029> selenite<00:07:54.919> to

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 
the pressure switch to drive selenite to

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.290 
the pressure switch to drive selenite to
open<00:07:56.189> and<00:07:56.309> close<00:07:56.459> the<00:07:56.639> circuit<00:07:57.029> for<00:07:57.209> the

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300 
open and close the circuit for the

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.739 
open and close the circuit for the
compressor<00:07:58.039> let's<00:07:59.039> do<00:07:59.219> it<00:07:59.279> in<00:07:59.399> next<00:07:59.610> week<00:07:59.909> I'll

00:08:00.739 --> 00:08:00.749 
compressor let's do it in next week I'll

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:02.320 
compressor let's do it in next week I'll
show<00:08:00.959> you<00:08:01.020> how<00:08:01.229> we're<00:08:01.379> going<00:08:01.499> to<00:08:01.559> do<00:08:01.709> that

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:02.330 
show you how we're going to do that

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.580 
show you how we're going to do that
