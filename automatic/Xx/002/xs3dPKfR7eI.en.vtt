00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.469
 barbes shakes to all the guys here 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.449
 your spectre and today I present to you the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.309
 sixth guide to battlefield weapons 4 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.990
 where we will discover the characteristics of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.529
 light machine gun of origin 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.089
 German mg 4 as you can see from the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.669
 the damage is superimposed 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.830
 of the weapon and medium of 5 closely and 18 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.660
 from afar respectively 4 and 6 with the most 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 erroneous proceed with fire e 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.030
 relatively high being 800 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.550
 strokes 3 minutes as the m2 49 tape 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.140
 ammunition is very large 200 mendo 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 cartridges of a single box of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.750
 munitions 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 the unlikely event that he should 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 recharge should be recharged such 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.140
 process will take 6.2 seconds either 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.260
 boxes out of stock with a hit in 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 reed again equal to m2 49 la 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.920
 sprint speed and average for the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.550
 machine guns read 620 meters per 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.410
 second or 330 with the silencer la 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.300
 precision in nothing special being 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.690
 identical to the tape guns from the damage 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.429
 average 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.070
 by now you know the story of the 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.930
 machine guns is accurate from standstill if you 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.520
 move aiming the projectiles will go 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.680
 everywhere while my summer is 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.390
 simply not competitive though 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.560
 averages 4 can survive short 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.360
 radius thanks to the act of fire 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.440
 above average 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.180
 at this point you will stay 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.020
 asking what the heck is the difference 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.360
 among the averages 49 lmg 4 and lies precisely in the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.310
 nightmare how you can observe the recoil 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.620
 vertical is higher than the 2 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.980
 49 being equal to 0 4 while that 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.440
 horizontal it tends to the right with 04 towards 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.680
 right precisely e02 to the left 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.120
 the recovery is like the m2 49 equal to 12 ed 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.100
 the multiplier of the first shot is 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.510
 neutral pair 1 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.040
 the difference between the beautiful miter and 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.380
 the German one essentially that lemme 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.480
 g4 boot in the vertical ass and less 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.460
 horizontal while my two 49 has 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.410
 more horizontally while also holding towards 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.600
 left instead of right and less 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.620
 vertical given nature easily 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.480
 controllable of displacement 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.510
 vertical emmegi 4 results 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.280
 simply better than the micro-rod 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.950
 we are now the final verdict and mine 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.390
 opinion about co star but enemies 4 is 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.220
 a versatile machine gun ed 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 efficient gave to cover several 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.459
 roles and medium distance 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.170
 high weapon mobility due to 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.700
 generous fire zone allow a 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.210
 very aggressive use of this 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.340
 mentality 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.110
 even if short range suffers anyway 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.060
 of the characteristic disadvantages of the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.380
 machine guns the good precision in 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.180
 aiming mode and the very generous 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.240
 ability to create a weapon more than capable 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.190
 to defend objective positions in a 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.960
 nutshell excellent maneuverability and capacity 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.410
 sea suppression in the ass and consumption 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.970
 of relatively high ammunition the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.530
 I now recommend a combo of accessories 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.600
 similar to that given in the episode of the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.270
 m2 big hero because I know practically 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.800
 I recommend the same as a viewfinder 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.270
 the metal one that guarantees you a 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.950
 extra bit of zoom is that of 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.560
 4 months and clear enough for 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.410
 be used as an accessory yes 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.090
 you guessed the laser pointer like 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.410
 cane I recommend the compensator for 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.180
 be more precise on medium and long 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.350
 distances 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.760
 I know you never would have said it but how 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.000
 handle I recommend to those 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.280
 Romanesque now as it was mine 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.650
 experience with this but one would suffice 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.240
 boring word after trying 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.220
 at least 49 that I liked 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.780
 discreetly I didn't feel the need to 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.010
 use the same weapon with a skin 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.480
 different 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.190
 I can't tell you why 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.140
 I didn't enjoy the day with this weapon 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.640
 which offers a discreet challenge for the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.140
 recoil control the management of 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.970
 short bursts despite being 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.800
 generally simple to use like 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.790
 all weapons from the high fire rat but 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.890
 this is another story 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.600
 but I can say that in the parties I have 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.180
 I never had as much fun as I did 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.190
 for example with the qb min 95 taipei kate 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.760
 is for me the fun is all in 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.710
 game 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.300
 the advice to use it was sought one 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.770
 competitive machine gun 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.570
 don't expect to find a weapon 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.160
 particularly fun even if it is 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.720
 very subjective from this point of 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.950
 view 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.570
 having said that I hope the video is there 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.680
 liked and I hope it was useful 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.270
 I hope to see you at my neighbor 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.560
 video and what else to say which one is yours 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.560
 spectre or if I close
