00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
football so it's impossible to

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.680 
football so it's impossible to
completely<00:01:06.670> unclip<00:01:07.000> from<00:01:07.150> everything<00:01:07.420> so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
completely unclip from everything so

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.480 
completely unclip from everything so

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
to walk us through just some of the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
to walk us through just some of the
basics<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.220> how<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.850> interact<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
course here's the first element on the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.070 
course here's the first element on the
other<00:01:38.670> course<00:01:38.940> around<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.570> little

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
other course around it's a little

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.830 
other course around it's a little
teeter-totter<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:41.240> but<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.690> can<00:01:42.780> see

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
teeter-totter thing but as you can see

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
teeter-totter thing but as you can see
there's<00:01:43.080> tons<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.770> cables<00:01:44.190> are<00:01:44.370> wrapped<00:01:44.550> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
there's tons the cables are wrapped so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.820 
there's tons the cables are wrapped so
it's<00:01:45.330> really<00:01:45.540> not<00:01:45.660> that<00:01:45.720> rough<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.620> next

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
it's really not that rough the next

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's really not that rough the next
alamut's<00:01:47.190> like<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.370> little<00:01:47.610> netting<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
alamut's like a little netting there and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.950 
alamut's like a little netting there and
then<00:01:49.200> once<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.470> little<00:01:49.710> bridge<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.280> between

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
then once a little bridge going between

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.710 
then once a little bridge going between
some<00:01:51.960> knitting<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.530> looks<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.940> slog<00:01:53.940> there

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
some knitting it looks like a slog there

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.290 
some knitting it looks like a slog there
a<00:01:55.170> few<00:01:55.979> other<00:01:56.010> little<00:01:56.310> swing<00:01:56.610> kings<00:01:56.970> but

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
a few other little swing kings but

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.340 
a few other little swing kings but
everything's<00:01:57.690> flipped<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.200> low

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
everything's flipped in really low

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.880 
everything's flipped in really low
bosses<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.920> are<00:01:59.100> yellow<00:01:59.670> course<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.740> is

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
bosses that are yellow course so this is

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.550 
bosses that are yellow course so this is
yellow<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.050> kind<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.320> tricky

beam going across here we've got some
Wiggly<00:02:56.950> X's<00:02:57.519> there<00:02:58.090> through<00:02:58.629> our<00:02:58.930> blue

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
Wiggly X's there through our blue

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.420 
Wiggly X's there through our blue
handers<00:02:59.560> got<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.799> climb<00:03:00.010> down<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:00.370> ladder

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
handers got to climb down this ladder

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.690 
handers got to climb down this ladder
here<00:03:00.879> that<00:03:02.220> Wiggles<00:03:04.049> quite<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.079> bit<00:03:05.319> there<00:03:05.700> and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
here that Wiggles quite a bit there and

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.069 
here that Wiggles quite a bit there and
then<00:03:06.760> x1<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.959> little<00:03:08.860> crisscross<00:03:10.079> e-logs

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
then x1 is a little crisscross e-logs

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.009 
then x1 is a little crisscross e-logs
here<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:12.340> then<00:03:12.819> there's<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.329> bail<00:03:13.510> out<00:03:13.540> on<00:03:13.900> this

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
here and then there's a bail out on this

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.210 
here and then there's a bail out on this
one<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.410> if<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.620> don't<00:03:14.769> want<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:14.980> go<00:03:15.069> any

one so if you don't want to go any

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.300 
one so if you don't want to go any
farther<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.579> can<00:03:15.609> stop<00:03:15.879> there's<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:17.310> little

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
farther you can stop there's a little

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.970 
farther you can stop there's a little
dangling<00:03:18.700> log<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.569> tricky<00:03:19.900> one<00:03:20.049> becomes

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
dangling log and the tricky one becomes

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.339 
dangling log and the tricky one becomes
a<00:03:21.220> lot<00:03:21.430> more<00:03:21.459> upper-body<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.720> blue<00:03:22.959> starts<00:03:23.290> to

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
a lot more upper-body so blue starts to

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.140 
a lot more upper-body so blue starts to
really<00:03:23.500> surprise<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.160> with<00:03:24.670> how<00:03:24.819> much<00:03:25.030> you

the unsteadiness

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.010 
the unsteadiness
there's<00:04:02.170> my<00:04:02.350> andrews<00:04:02.650> about<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:03.010> attempt<00:04:03.340> here

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
there's my andrews about to attempt here

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.820 
there's my andrews about to attempt here
so<00:04:05.020> the<00:04:05.890> idea<00:04:06.280> how<00:04:06.400> Wiggly<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.880> is<00:04:07.530> by<00:04:08.530> watching

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
so the idea how Wiggly it is by watching

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.880 
so the idea how Wiggly it is by watching
him<00:04:09.070> go<00:04:09.250> through<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:11.080> it's<00:04:11.260> just<00:04:11.320> we<00:04:11.440> roll<00:04:11.680> over

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
him go through so it's just we roll over

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.640 
him go through so it's just we roll over
play<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.280> just<00:04:12.520> upper<00:04:12.790> body<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.350> lot<00:04:14.350> there

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
play so you just upper body a lot there

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.729 
play so you just upper body a lot there
so<00:04:18.329> now<00:04:19.329> some<00:04:19.600> require<00:04:19.900> led<00:04:20.049> by<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.410> one<00:04:20.650> we

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
so now some require led by the one we
