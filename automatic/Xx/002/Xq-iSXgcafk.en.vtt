so<00:00:04.319> you<00:00:04.380> have<00:00:04.500> enough<00:00:04.770> space<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> move<00:00:07.040> over

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
so you have enough space to move over

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.200 
so you have enough space to move over
the<00:00:08.160> head<00:00:08.400> around<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.330> body<00:00:09.570> spin<00:00:10.309> down<00:00:11.309> over

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
the head around the body spin down over

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.330 
the head around the body spin down over
their<00:00:12.360> head<00:00:12.540> around<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.019> body<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.950> second

their head around the body on the second

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.130 
their head around the body on the second
spin<00:00:14.670> down<00:00:16.550> backwards<00:00:17.550> if<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.150> same

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
spin down backwards if you like same

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.320 
spin down backwards if you like same
thing

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
thing

00:00:20.330 --> 00:01:16.140 
thing
okay<00:00:21.330> practices<00:00:21.869> thanks<00:00:22.140> spin

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.749 

okay<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:17.210> quick<00:01:17.630> review<00:01:18.050> so<00:01:18.920> we<00:01:19.040> have<00:01:21.759> first

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
okay so quick review so we have first

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.240 
okay so quick review so we have first
figure-eight<00:01:23.979> stop

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
figure-eight stop

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.779 
figure-eight stop
we<00:01:25.340> have<00:01:25.460> side<00:01:25.700> propeller<00:01:27.430> forward<00:01:28.430> propeller

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
we have side propeller forward propeller

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.570 
we have side propeller forward propeller
right<00:01:29.030> or<00:01:29.240> from<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.600> front<00:01:29.750> right<00:01:30.110> here<00:01:30.580> we

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
right or from the front right here we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.529 
right or from the front right here we
have<00:01:31.700> over<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.090> head

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
have over the head

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.410 
have over the head
helicopter<00:01:33.500> we'll<00:01:33.679> call<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:34.039> right<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:35.300> have

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
helicopter we'll call it right we have

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.320 
helicopter we'll call it right we have
catches<00:01:36.140> on<00:01:36.289> the<00:01:36.410> body<00:01:36.850> catches<00:01:37.850> on<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.119> body

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
catches on the body catches on the body

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.430 
catches on the body catches on the body
catches<00:01:38.869> with<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.050> spin<00:01:39.850> spinning<00:01:40.850> around<00:01:41.440> like

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
catches with a spin spinning around like

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.320 
catches with a spin spinning around like
that<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:43.310> now<00:01:43.429> we're<00:01:43.580> gonna<00:01:43.670> figure<00:01:44.149> eight

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
that and now we're gonna figure eight

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.359 
that and now we're gonna figure eight
moving<00:01:44.780> forward<00:01:45.259> with<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:45.470> spin<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.130> side

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
moving forward with a spin to the side

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.520 
moving forward with a spin to the side
and<00:01:46.700> then<00:01:46.880> moving<00:01:47.210> backwards<00:01:47.750> with<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.050> spin<00:01:48.350> to

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
and then moving backwards with a spin to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.740 
and then moving backwards with a spin to
the<00:01:48.649> side<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.940> could<00:01:50.149> change<00:01:50.330> directions

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
the side and you could change directions

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:19.640 
the side and you could change directions
the<00:01:51.080> same<00:01:51.289> thing

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:38.110 

I<00:02:23.450> see<00:02:24.450> you

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.180 

you
