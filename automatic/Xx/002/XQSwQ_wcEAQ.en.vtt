this camera to record for more than two

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.910 
this camera to record for more than two
minutes<00:00:08.910> at<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.120> time<00:00:09.389> I've<00:00:10.170> tried<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.620> video

minutes at a time I've tried this video

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.100 
minutes at a time I've tried this video
now<00:00:11.130> it's<00:00:11.309> like<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.519> 15th<00:00:12.000> time<00:00:12.330> I've<00:00:12.719> tried

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
now it's like the 15th time I've tried

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.200 
now it's like the 15th time I've tried
to<00:00:13.290> make<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.530> video<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.639> camera<00:00:15.030> keeps

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
to make this video and the camera keeps

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.880

reason<00:00:17.900> driving<00:00:18.900> me<00:00:18.990> insane<00:00:19.109> have<00:00:19.619> broken<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
reason driving me insane have broken the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.840 
reason driving me insane have broken the
tripod<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.510> fit<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.750> rage<00:00:22.490> which<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.640> regret

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
tripod in a fit of rage which I regret

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.720 
tripod in a fit of rage which I regret
now<00:00:24.199> but<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.439> think<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.160> fix<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.490> don't<00:00:26.609> think

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
now but I think I can fix I don't think

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.490 
now but I think I can fix I don't think
it's<00:00:26.820> beyond<00:00:27.060> repair<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.930> fingers<00:00:28.289> crossed

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
it's beyond repair but fingers crossed

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.679 
it's beyond repair but fingers crossed
this<00:00:29.070> video<00:00:29.369> will<00:00:29.609> work<00:00:29.760> otherwise<00:00:30.510> I'm

this video will work otherwise I'm

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.030

there to go on your belt don't fall off
and<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.090> blade<00:01:00.300> itself<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:02.000> 3.75

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and then the blade itself it's a 3.75

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000 
and then the blade itself it's a 3.75
inch<00:01:03.180> blade<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.080> about<00:01:04.229> nine<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
inch blade which is about nine and a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.490 
inch blade which is about nine and a
half<00:01:05.129> centimeters<00:01:05.990> stainless<00:01:06.990> steel<00:01:07.260> they

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
half centimeters stainless steel they

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.740 
half centimeters stainless steel they
don't<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.270> carbon<00:01:09.270> steel<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.630> some

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
don't do this in carbon steel for some

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.399 
don't do this in carbon steel for some
reason<00:01:10.020> which<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.170> strange<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.159> more<00:01:12.350> now<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
reason which is strange for more now the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
reason which is strange for more now the
one<00:01:13.590> difference<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
one difference to this is that in the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.820 
one difference to this is that in the
handle<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:17.270> light<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.420> fire<00:01:18.830> fire

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
handle here we have a light my fire fire

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.300 
handle here we have a light my fire fire
steel<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.869> just<00:01:21.869> demonstrate<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.770> now<00:01:22.950> these

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
steel I just demonstrate it now these

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149 
steel I just demonstrate it now these
are<00:01:23.520> pretty<00:01:24.360> much<00:01:24.600> considered<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> best<00:01:25.799> fire

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
are pretty much considered the best fire

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.219 
are pretty much considered the best fire
steel<00:01:26.400> makers<00:01:27.590> in<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.829> world<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:30.049> it<00:01:31.049> should

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
steel makers in the world so it should

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.780 
steel makers in the world so it should
be<00:01:31.350> pretty<00:01:31.500> good<00:01:31.619> quality<00:01:32.100> hopefully<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.729> can

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
be pretty good quality hopefully you can

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.010 
be pretty good quality hopefully you can
see<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> sparks<00:01:33.360> coming<00:01:33.540> off<00:01:33.630> letting<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
see the sparks coming off letting the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.429 
see the sparks coming off letting the
sunlight<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:36.270> clips<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> bottom<00:01:37.229> here

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439

before I still in there that kind of
impedes<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.590> any<00:02:01.740> further<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.189> it's

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
impedes it going any further so it's

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.140 
impedes it going any further so it's
still<00:02:03.000> quite<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> long<00:02:04.259> tang

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
still quite a long tang

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.680 
still quite a long tang
but<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.390> compare<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.810> with<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.229> companion<00:02:09.690> as

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
but to compare it with the companion as

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.300 
but to compare it with the companion as
you<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:10.929> see<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.290> blade<00:02:11.500> is<00:02:11.770> quite<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.160> bit

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
you can see the blade is quite a bit

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.070 
you can see the blade is quite a bit
smaller<00:02:12.640> it's<00:02:12.819> about<00:02:13.330> half<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.660> centimeter

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
smaller it's about half a centimeter

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.870 
smaller it's about half a centimeter
shorter<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.920> about<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.520> quarter<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.849> a

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
shorter and about a quarter of a

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.059 
shorter and about a quarter of a
centimeter<00:02:16.150> thinner<00:02:16.630> which<00:02:17.530> really<00:02:17.830> does

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
centimeter thinner which really does

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.780 
centimeter thinner which really does
make<00:02:18.970> quite<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.239> difference<00:02:20.280> if<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.580> see

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
make quite a difference if you can see

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.290 
make quite a difference if you can see
that<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:23.790> personally<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.819> would<00:02:25.120> rather

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
that there and personally I would rather

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.509 
that there and personally I would rather
have<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.230> companion<00:02:26.739> I'd<00:02:26.860> rather<00:02:27.040> have<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
have the companion I'd rather have the

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.610 
have the companion I'd rather have the
better<00:02:27.700> quality<00:02:27.910> blade<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.599> just<00:02:28.720> carry<00:02:29.050> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
better quality blade and just carry the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.030 
better quality blade and just carry the
fire<00:02:29.860> still<00:02:30.130> separately<00:02:30.670> because<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.860> me<00:02:33.010> a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
fire still separately because to me a

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.890 
fire still separately because to me a
decent<00:02:33.760> blade<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.269> more<00:02:34.420> important<00:02:34.750> not

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
decent blade is more important not

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.280 
decent blade is more important not
there's<00:02:35.110> anything<00:02:35.290> particularly<00:02:35.920> wrong<00:02:36.130> with

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
there's anything particularly wrong with

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.610 
there's anything particularly wrong with
the<00:02:38.290> fire<00:02:38.860> steels<00:02:39.190> blade<00:02:39.549> but<00:02:40.540> it's<00:02:41.319> just<00:02:41.440> it

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
the fire steels blade but it's just it

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.090 
the fire steels blade but it's just it
seems<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:42.010> bit<00:02:42.280> too<00:02:42.310> thin<00:02:43.380> personally<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.620> bit

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
seems a bit too thin personally a bit

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.380 
seems a bit too thin personally a bit
too<00:02:45.280> small<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.610> don't<00:02:45.700> know<00:02:45.910> why<00:02:46.030> they've<00:02:46.239> done

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
too small I don't know why they've done

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.360 
too small I don't know why they've done
that<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.870> don't<00:02:47.650> know<00:02:47.709> if<00:02:47.769> it's<00:02:47.890> just<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.160> cheap

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
that I don't know if it's just a cheap

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.610 
that I don't know if it's just a cheap
out<00:02:48.640> but<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.780> thing<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.019> this<00:02:50.110> isn't<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.440> cheap

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
out but the thing is this isn't a cheap

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.220 
out but the thing is this isn't a cheap
knife<00:02:50.830> in<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> UK<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.760> mean<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.660> what

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
knife in the UK I mean that is what

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.039 
knife in the UK I mean that is what
twelve<00:02:53.560> pound<00:02:53.890> 50<00:02:54.280> $12.99<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.239> got<00:02:55.930> that

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
twelve pound 50 $12.99 I got that

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.750 
twelve pound 50 $12.99 I got that
another<00:02:56.200> 25<00:02:56.709> pound<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.160> had<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.370> pay<00:02:57.519> for<00:02:57.549> that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
another 25 pound I had to pay for that

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.390 
another 25 pound I had to pay for that
and<00:02:58.170> that's<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.350> cheapest<00:02:59.739> I<00:02:59.799> could<00:02:59.950> find<00:03:00.160> it

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
and that's the cheapest I could find it

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.759 
and that's the cheapest I could find it
I<00:03:00.489> mean<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:01.030> most<00:03:01.180> places<00:03:01.390> that's<00:03:01.870> 30<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.290> 35

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
I mean in most places that's 30 to 35

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.479 
I mean in most places that's 30 to 35
pounds<00:03:03.090> which<00:03:04.090> is<00:03:04.209> quite<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.420> lot<00:03:04.569> of<00:03:04.630> money

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
pounds which is quite a lot of money

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.400 
pounds which is quite a lot of money
compared<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.549> most<00:03:07.150> Moroz<00:03:07.660> which<00:03:07.840> are<00:03:08.260> usually

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
compared to most Moroz which are usually

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.860 
compared to most Moroz which are usually
quite<00:03:08.739> cheap<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:10.480> guess<00:03:10.660> we're<00:03:10.840> just

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
quite cheap and I guess we're just

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.090 
quite cheap and I guess we're just
paying<00:03:11.230> for<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.470> gimmick<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:14.380> personal

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
paying for the gimmick and personal

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.680 
paying for the gimmick and personal
anything<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:15.489> worth<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.940> if<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.209> knife<00:03:16.390> was

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
anything it's worth it if the knife was

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.860 
anything it's worth it if the knife was
the<00:03:16.720> same<00:03:17.230> quality<00:03:17.680> as<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:18.459> companion<00:03:19.000> with<00:03:19.450> the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
the same quality as a companion with the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.660 
the same quality as a companion with the
fire<00:03:20.049> still<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.500> but<00:03:20.680> there<00:03:21.310> never<00:03:21.400> been<00:03:21.640> a

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
fire still in the but there never been a

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.780 
fire still in the but there never been a
lot<00:03:21.820> happier<00:03:22.150> but<00:03:22.420> for<00:03:22.870> an<00:03:22.959> inferior<00:03:23.380> blade

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
lot happier but for an inferior blade

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.729 
lot happier but for an inferior blade
but<00:03:24.790> over<00:03:25.540> twice<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.930> price<00:03:26.140> just<00:03:26.470> for<00:03:26.590> the

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
but over twice the price just for the

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.530 
but over twice the price just for the
sake<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.070> fire<00:03:27.310> still<00:03:27.609> in<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.820> butt<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.030> just

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
sake of a fire still in the butt I just

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.330 
sake of a fire still in the butt I just
don't<00:03:28.750> think<00:03:28.900> it's<00:03:29.019> worth<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.890> America

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
don't think it's worth it in America

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.599 
don't think it's worth it in America
they<00:03:30.459> are<00:03:30.609> in<00:03:30.730> America<00:03:31.239> there<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.320> need<00:03:32.980> you

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
they are in America there I need you

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.759 
they are in America there I need you
know<00:03:33.730> sort<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.000> 15<00:03:34.390> 20<00:03:34.810> dollars<00:03:35.140> in<00:03:35.260> America

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
know sort of 15 20 dollars in America

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.039 
know sort of 15 20 dollars in America
which<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.069> you<00:03:36.400> know<00:03:36.519> 1215<00:03:37.239> pound<00:03:37.540> over<00:03:37.870> here

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
which is you know 1215 pound over here

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.500 
which is you know 1215 pound over here
if<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.799> could<00:03:38.950> have<00:03:39.040> got<00:03:39.130> that<00:03:39.160> for<00:03:39.430> 15<00:03:40.030> even<00:03:40.390> 20

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
if I could have got that for 15 even 20

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.849 
if I could have got that for 15 even 20
pound<00:03:41.160> well<00:03:42.160> no<00:03:42.819> I<00:03:43.090> think<00:03:43.319> 1718<00:03:44.319> pounders<00:03:44.739> as

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
pound well no I think 1718 pounders as

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.319 
pound well no I think 1718 pounders as
most<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.310> would<00:03:45.370> wanted<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.760> pay<00:03:45.910> for<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.239> be

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
most I would wanted to pay for it to be

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.490 
most I would wanted to pay for it to be
honest<00:03:46.510> thing<00:03:46.630> that's<00:03:46.810> this<00:03:46.930> isn't<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.319> most

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
honest thing that's this isn't the most

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.180 
honest thing that's this isn't the most
it's<00:03:47.769> worth<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:50.650> hard<00:03:50.859> for<00:03:50.980> me<00:03:51.069> to

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
it's worth so it's hard for me to
