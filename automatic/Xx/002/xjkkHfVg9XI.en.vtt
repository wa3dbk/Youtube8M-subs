think<00:05:10.380> he<00:05:10.530> could<00:05:10.770> have<00:05:10.889> sometimes<00:05:11.100> our<00:05:11.400> keeper

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
think he could have sometimes our keeper

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.190 
think he could have sometimes our keeper
is<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:11.820> beast<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.360> sometimes<00:05:12.690> he<00:05:12.810> just<00:05:12.840> makes

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
is a beast and sometimes he just makes

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.230 
is a beast and sometimes he just makes
the<00:05:13.320> stupidest<00:05:13.710> mistakes<00:05:14.100> but<00:05:14.820> look<00:05:15.000> at<00:05:15.120> this

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
the stupidest mistakes but look at this

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.969 
the stupidest mistakes but look at this
so<00:05:15.750> he<00:05:15.840> takes<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.260> shot<00:05:16.290> right<00:05:16.680> there<00:05:16.860> our

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
so he takes the shot right there our

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.950

defender<00:05:17.430> kind<00:05:17.700> of<00:05:17.850> kind<00:05:18.240> of<00:05:18.419> maybe<00:05:18.600> he<00:05:18.750> might

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
defender kind of kind of maybe he might

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.840 
defender kind of kind of maybe he might
have<00:05:19.110> missed<00:05:19.229> our<00:05:19.440> keeper<00:05:19.740> up<00:05:19.889> but<00:05:20.160> it<00:05:20.639> looked
