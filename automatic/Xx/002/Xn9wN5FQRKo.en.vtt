00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.140
 professionals like to work with good materials both in terms of 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.760
 Tool protection though they are you are as a construction company are on 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.820
 materials and therefore wants the prophet to be in good condition to meet what they desire 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.240
 to be able to satisfy the customer's professional since ten years and it 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.560
 number of great opportunities for culture for the French industry focused and 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.819
 work together under the name 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:31.460
 Meanwhile, wholesalers throughout the Netherlands have filed under this name 

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:32.739
 the construction industry that offer 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.760
 the central statistical office 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.809
 none of those works for the products provided at the sites 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.489
 there are several statements from the head of 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.450
 try not to be won or it all here we have seven times 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.390
 it is absurd 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.050
 can unload words 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.390
 alverna to get the contract value of destination but of course 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.810
 also nice to get on the road 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.580
 nv opens the neighborhood 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.300
 about 40 percent per day 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.040
 Robin is a partnership of seven 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.950
 wholesalers in the netherlands focused on also building piece of industry 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.830
 in construction we live all the materials needed for the construction of a project 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.090
 except to get the goalkeeper like a stand from Siemens made FC Utrecht 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.150
 what we see here is one too 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.869
 After he received the bulk item and through the item we must think about it 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.670
 what we receive by truck or receive more than one pillar 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.980
 for the loved ones 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.650
 were this space is that we can handle large volumes 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.760
 volumes 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.480
 who benefits from purchasing 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.869
 but that can also continue for the customers 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.829
 that suddenly because a group that must otherwise cannot deliver 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.560
 comes to us and questions about being able to deliver quickly can be climbers 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.509
 that can be the rest of percent fasteners or nothing 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.840
 on the board end 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.600
 and therefore all kinds of articles 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.000
 those supplied by technical wholesalers to wholesalers 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.819
 Robin distinguishes itself especially in the market with a brands 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.079
 Branding is important because we know the crisis is over that 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.069
 Sometimes they come up with their intentions which we also know we have our constant fixed free 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.619
 time 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.539
 The beer cynical stock is basically developing from the site 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:15.820
 locations present 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.679
 but the large numbers are stored in it 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.419
 they can be represented at the logistics sites at any time 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.889
 handling is highly developed from the branches working at a central 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:32.099
 digital network but from the servers in zwolle they cannot be there quickly and 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.229
 error-free ordering and the opportunity 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.279
 the food supply is tailored to 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.279
 mainly from the construction companies 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.509
 in installation companies it is wonderful that regional location is more than 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:49.889
 20,000 items also has the stock that you also have in camps 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.899
 the client must be earned on the side to be trained 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:58.289
 so many were good 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.359
 the replacement of the possibilities to continue talking there are rumors that 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.689
 telephone and internet 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.919
 but why 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.609
 that's what it calls the question 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.060
 as long as people on the side of contractors can just choose one 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.779
 against of 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.829
 besi batter amersfoort work and you name it 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.779
 and which repair department 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:17.779
 the virus 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.419
 on behalf of mainz machines have broken all parts that need to be replaced 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.319
 denominator on one of them 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.389
 the problem is actually 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.139
 a timber supplier to me for twelve years 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.449
 and actually a little bit, but his predecessors have gotten closer to you 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.079
 the star would pick it up and walk in 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.769
 yes actually we have the most and later to the road user we have very 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.299
 also books with regard to tools end and chain 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.219
 we always do the work that we do and check as a result 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.419
 again it is clear for all problems they have a solution 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.229
 they deliver 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.529
 and for all five ordered the next day to be delivered on the ball or wares 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:56.849
 The Netherlands 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.919
 so we are strong recordings 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.469
 and our own people expertly well trained by having the chair in addition 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:04.809
 will put on the ball 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:09.269
 then we can see the people well from is also professional and then comes the 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.340
 Next step is to trust the number of people what people say 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.499
 we get a lot of questions 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:17.529
 the pre-trial detention speed in scheveningen 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:22.189
 the least important in the construction process that applies to marijke very buyers 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:26.710
 certainly also for implementation as the toppers leerdammer jos pass on it 

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:30.669
 the headlines in the newspaper 60 watt then again the barracks 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.719
 more common 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.180
 for the in other words back to the Netherlands 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.659
 last year a project in Amsterdam 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.319
 source was also the driver and that with others 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.659
 the problems put the blame the percent higher up on our turn 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:49.949
 away for the feet 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.680
 they get out 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.150
 what we see here 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.419
 a huge multitude to translate the firm's sign of life 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.400
 of the record stores 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.560
 it is on subjects that there are so many suppliers in the field of 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.669
 construction materials 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.669
 but every layer in this space is filled 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.540
 mark a known total 4 it is more or less a customer has come to ask and we 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.159
 to deliver 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.249
 I look forward to the future of your problem particularly favorably because 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.990
 especially on medium-sized buildings do not sit on very large construction projects in the construction industry again 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.389
 a lot to do a lot with renovation projects 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.849
 customers know to try to find good 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.909
 not just to undertake major projects on the head 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.250
 total body weight
