00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.770 
before I went to summer camp and the
band<00:01:46.140> posters<00:01:46.619> she<00:01:46.950> hung<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.189> her<00:01:47.280> wall<00:01:47.520> I

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
band posters she hung on her wall I

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.510 
band posters she hung on her wall I
remembers<00:01:48.780> Dean's<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.860> most<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.189> all<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
Boston to see shows and thinking how I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.030 
Boston to see shows and thinking how I
wanted<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.920> her<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.280> day

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
wanted to be just like her one day

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.100 
wanted to be just like her one day
playing<00:01:57.730> gone<00:01:58.030> home<00:01:58.300> made<00:01:58.540> me<00:01:58.690> remember<00:01:59.080> a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
playing gone home made me remember a

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.810 
playing gone home made me remember a
part<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.440> my<00:01:59.560> adolescence<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.370> had<00:02:00.490> buried

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
part of my adolescence that had buried

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.150 
part of my adolescence that had buried
in<00:02:00.940> my<00:02:01.060> heart<00:02:01.360> after<00:02:01.540> escaping<00:02:02.080> suburbia<00:02:02.710> very

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
in my heart after escaping suburbia very

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.860 
in my heart after escaping suburbia very
real<00:02:03.400> part<00:02:03.730> of<00:02:03.790> my<00:02:03.910> life<00:02:04.120> I<00:02:04.300> often<00:02:04.660> try<00:02:04.810> to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
real part of my life I often try to

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.900 
real part of my life I often try to
forget<00:02:05.230> that<00:02:05.770> shaped<00:02:05.980> Who<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.160> am<00:02:06.250> as<00:02:06.520> an<00:02:06.640> adult

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
forget that shaped Who I am as an adult

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.790 
forget that shaped Who I am as an adult
I<00:02:07.120> can't<00:02:07.540> think<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.870> a<00:02:07.960> single<00:02:07.990> other<00:02:08.470> game

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
I can't think of a single other game

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.499 
I can't think of a single other game
that<00:02:09.009> has<00:02:09.130> done<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:09.670> completely<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.479> I

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
that has done that so completely and I

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.760 
that has done that so completely and I
can<00:02:10.630> only<00:02:10.720> think<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.140> handful<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.680> I've

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
can only think of a handful that I've

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.010 
can only think of a handful that I've
ever<00:02:11.890> really<00:02:12.130> tried<00:02:12.460> games<00:02:13.420> have<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.810> power

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
ever really tried games have the power

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.140 
ever really tried games have the power
to<00:02:14.260> move<00:02:14.440> us<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.830> such<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.130> unique<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.760> complete

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.360 
to move us in such a unique and complete
way<00:02:16.390> they<00:02:16.810> can<00:02:16.960> be<00:02:17.080> emotionally<00:02:17.770> cathartic<00:02:18.220> to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
way they can be emotionally cathartic to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.280 
way they can be emotionally cathartic to
us<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.700> help<00:02:18.880> us<00:02:19.030> understand<00:02:19.570> who<00:02:19.780> we<00:02:19.930> are<00:02:19.960> as

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.830 
us and help us understand who we are as
people<00:02:20.500> but<00:02:21.070> only<00:02:21.250> if<00:02:21.580> we<00:02:21.760> let<00:02:21.940> them<00:02:22.180> only<00:02:22.570> if

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
people but only if we let them only if

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.600 
people but only if we let them only if
we<00:02:22.960> embrace<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.440> real<00:02:23.680> worlds<00:02:24.070> can<00:02:24.250> be<00:02:24.370> just

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
we embrace that real worlds can be just

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.640 
we embrace that real worlds can be just
as<00:02:24.730> emotionally<00:02:25.300> moving<00:02:25.660> as<00:02:25.840> heroic<00:02:26.440> ones

as emotionally moving as heroic ones
just<00:02:27.400> because<00:02:27.580> we<00:02:27.730> can<00:02:27.940> make<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.210> rule<00:02:28.420> to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
just because we can make a rule to

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.270 
just because we can make a rule to
escape<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.050> doesn't<00:02:29.500> mean<00:02:29.620> we<00:02:29.800> should<00:02:29.980> shut<00:02:30.130> at

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
escape to doesn't mean we should shut at
