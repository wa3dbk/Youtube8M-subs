00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.970
 Look today I'm going to talk more or less to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:13.590
 You're like I made this stairway in 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.480
 Castle format is I could not 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.650
 record the step by step but I'll try 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.810
 explaining to you is now very easy only 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.939
 looks pretty good but it's super simple 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.689
 do 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:34.860
 It is made with boxes or box of juice 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:38.250
 box of milk and I made it so you 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.420
 put it here will make a format of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.520
 ladder places a two places poses 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.460
 three places four makes the size that 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.910
 you want and then you involve them with 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.910
 a crepe tape for her to be well June 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.859
 had so 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.100
 There you will pass crepe tape around. 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.150
 of all for the one in that unibloco block 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.720
 is joined and 6/3 is then joined and 6 2 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:19.229
 there you go in mindanao places hold 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.450
 passes and made about three involves all 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.400
 she gets stuck all prey 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:31.130
 Then when you do, you will. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:37.860
 start to cover the step 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:39.060
 You're going to pick me up, I glue it with hot glue. 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.630
 same 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.610
 then you move oh I think about 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.689
 almost 20 cm this box or 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.530
 feeling 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:57.240
 then you cut the mp to you ó is clipped 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.659
 you can crop an entire sheet 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.509
 this size 20 centimeters 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.450
 There you cut it, it will stay like that. 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.869
 Entire there you only have to paste 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.310
 You get a little bit here behind the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.400
 break then do not get amended 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:24.730
 appearing with a little bit and trade 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:35.470
 offs doing it there you expect a 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:43.799
 sheet for you to understand see has a 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:43.799
 whole leaf you do so dry 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:52.540
 Well, here you are. 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.680
 There you stand on the step. 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.989
 then you come rolling rather slow when there 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.360
 They were to record if you cling like this is 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:06.819
 take the shape of the step down here 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.980
 You're ready to do this. 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.920
 op so you will when I met 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:22.510
 put on the mouse 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:26.170
 There you go , you 'll get it. 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.200
 turn it over so you will not see what it is 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.450
 cassol en-to demonstrate a little but I 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.870
 I have a video showing you step by step 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.790
 of the chop of the straight is the way to do 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.100
 ladder will be the one she thinks 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.769
 I did with a styrofoam 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.220
 but I left it well explained 1 until 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:48.700
 easier for you to understand here 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:53.470
 You're going to put this part here over 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:57.639
 mba place here on the idea to 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:01.690
 cbt this part here for you to draw 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:05.470
 what will this part be like here? 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:09.370
 to get easier you will get 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:14.140
 everything here will be like this, come 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:18.540
 You'll pass a toothpick here too. 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.240
 here is the format here 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.850
 on the side of the stairs 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.510
 Then after you've done that, you put 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.630
 step there you come and collateral 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:36.280
 you can put some spare and the work 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.590
 cassinha also sorry I left a 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.740
 niece and can even round off the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.310
 tips can leave you more leftovers if you 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.740
 I want to want to make you hot that 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.080
 You know you're going to end up like this. 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.730
 also in the bank 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.180
 there after this collateral of the 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:02.230
 two sides 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:05.440
 then I picked up and embroidered English 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.570
 he has a little more than a finger on his finger 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.570
 and a half wide but you put 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.340
 Width you want too, only then I 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.120
 I came here 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.150
 was very delicate and has already taken 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.090
 Nor days was not an amendment 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.070
 did not need to put the best 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.650
 but as it is the theme of the forest is a bit 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:32.320
 gentler and I wanted 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:35.800
 put there I put the 3rd and 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.430
 this castle here I follow the step to 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.930
 step of a video that was on the internet 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:46.690
 and I just added these two pictures 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:50.919
 but the rest I copied from the video on 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:54.910
 same internet and and the base I made of 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:57.850
 styrofoam and I just tried to know and mitchell 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.479
 of blue that I found all white not 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:04.720
 I was highlighting very well I painted this 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:10.720
 part of the blue that she imagined was 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:14.700
 something like that would make flakes of 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.940
 snow to be a little glue 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:24.480
 and paste by purina you have a video too 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:29.070
 showing how the flock only there I 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:33.180
 I made those flakes there and I made the flake and 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.980
 if I put in the blue and in that 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.760
 From here I put white I found the 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:43.440
 blue is better and here you find me 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:46.170
 I used the same thing I did here 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.390
 in the video above shows also I used 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:52.640
 roll is not aluminum foil a little 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:55.560
 thicker of those kilos an office 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.210
 So I have about 30 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.280
 inches tall and made a 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.690
 I also made a little hat here 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.220
 little window and pasted the side of the houses 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:15.600
 here too that she was 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:20.850
 single loose né ai com le gall que 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:26.010
 liked because of the phrase is very pulling 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:27.900
 The castle is snowy things then it has 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.020
 enough to give 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.780
 there just missing I never back 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.610
 just for you to see how you walk or 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:41.190
 juice box 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:45.360
 here i am good finished in qatar priest 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:48.660
 white is white and it stays like this I stole it 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:52.380
 a little styrofoam gave me this 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:56.750
 idea is actually to scroll styrofoam play 

00:07:52.380 --> 00:08:01.260
 on the scale and she teaches to stay 

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:03.360
 similar to a snowflake that is 

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.660
 taking all these things 

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:11.240
 I thought it was pretty cool, pretty. 

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.240
 I liked you, I hope you like it too.
