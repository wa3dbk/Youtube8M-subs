00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
really fit her eye shape and it would be

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.780 
really fit her eye shape and it would be
nice<00:04:02.630> if<00:04:02.660> they<00:04:02.870> included<00:04:03.320> a<00:04:03.440> smaller<00:04:03.830> maybe<00:04:04.670> a

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
nice if they included a smaller maybe a

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.180 
nice if they included a smaller maybe a
smaller<00:04:05.180> lip<00:04:05.540> brush<00:04:05.780> just<00:04:06.590> something<00:04:06.980> for

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
smaller lip brush just something for

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.280 
smaller lip brush just something for
somebody<00:04:07.400> with<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.730> smaller<00:04:08.060> eyes<00:04:08.269> so<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.630> would

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
somebody with a smaller eyes so it would

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.350 
somebody with a smaller eyes so it would
be<00:04:09.350> a<00:04:09.380> lot<00:04:09.500> easier<00:04:09.560> for<00:04:09.920> us<00:04:10.070> to<00:04:10.160> apply<00:04:11.030> our

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
didn't like that all the brushes didn't

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.999 
didn't like that all the brushes didn't
come<00:04:20.250> with<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.430> brush<00:04:20.609> guard<00:04:21.019> as<00:04:22.019> you<00:04:22.620> can<00:04:22.800> see

destination<00:04:34.669> some<00:04:35.669> of<00:04:35.789> our<00:04:35.880> brushes<00:04:36.270> were

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
destination some of our brushes were

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.590 
destination some of our brushes were
kind<00:04:36.600> of<00:04:36.690> misshapen<00:04:36.990> because<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.860> i<00:04:38.789> guess

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
kind of misshapen because of the i guess

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.840 
kind of misshapen because of the i guess
because<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:40.289> being<00:04:40.740> squashed<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.550> not<00:04:41.669> having

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
because of being squashed and not having

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.670 
because of being squashed and not having
the<00:04:42.060> guard<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:43.110> would<00:04:43.259> have<00:04:43.289> been<00:04:43.410> nice<00:04:43.650> to

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
the guard so it would have been nice to

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.950 
the guard so it would have been nice to
have<00:04:43.979> a<00:04:44.520> brush<00:04:44.820> guard<00:04:45.120> for<00:04:45.360> all<00:04:45.509> of<00:04:45.810> my

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
have a brush guard for all of my

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.969 
have a brush guard for all of my
precious<00:04:46.490> um<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:48.690> indifferent<00:04:49.410> which<00:04:49.800> is

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
precious um and the indifferent which is

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.480 
precious um and the indifferent which is
not<00:04:50.130> really<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.759> much<00:04:51.240> on<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:52.530> quality<00:04:52.919> is

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
not really that much on the quality is

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.850 
not really that much on the quality is
the<00:04:54.060> quality<00:04:54.270> Peters<00:04:55.259> between<00:04:55.650> bad<00:04:55.830> and

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
the quality Peters between bad and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.999 
the quality Peters between bad and
different<00:04:56.460> simply<00:04:57.270> because<00:04:57.500> my<00:04:58.500> brushes<00:04:58.770> were

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
different simply because my brushes were

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.260 
different simply because my brushes were
ok<00:04:59.310> but<00:04:59.699> I<00:05:00.060> do<00:05:00.509> know<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:01.289> people<00:05:01.830> whose<00:05:02.639> brushes

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
ok but I do know of people whose brushes

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.240 
ok but I do know of people whose brushes
again<00:05:03.539> has<00:05:03.810> fallen<00:05:04.050> apart<00:05:04.410> so<00:05:04.710> the

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
again has fallen apart so the

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.400 
again has fallen apart so the
consistency<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.270> quality<00:05:06.870> is<00:05:06.990> something

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
consistency of the quality is something

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.730 
consistency of the quality is something
that<00:05:07.560> really<00:05:07.860> should<00:05:08.130> be<00:05:08.160> improved<00:05:08.639> and

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
that really should be improved and

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.689 
that really should be improved and
another<00:05:10.740> thing<00:05:10.979> that<00:05:11.160> I'm<00:05:11.280> kind<00:05:11.580> of

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
another thing that I'm kind of

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.240 
another thing that I'm kind of
indifferent<00:05:12.000> about<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.780> because<00:05:13.440> I<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.830> see<00:05:14.130> the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
indifferent about it because I I see the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.650 
indifferent about it because I I see the
good<00:05:14.370> points<00:05:14.639> and<00:05:14.669> I<00:05:14.789> see<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.000> bad<00:05:15.150> points<00:05:15.360> is

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
good points and I see the bad points is

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.810 
good points and I see the bad points is
the<00:05:16.199> fact<00:05:16.410> that<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.680> brushes<00:05:17.039> are<00:05:17.220> named<00:05:17.520> in

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
the fact that the brushes are named in

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.939 
the fact that the brushes are named in
fashioned<00:05:18.419> exactly<00:05:18.930> after<00:05:19.110> mac<00:05:19.409> brushes<00:05:19.620> I

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
fashioned exactly after mac brushes I

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.000 
fashioned exactly after mac brushes I
see<00:05:20.789> the<00:05:20.880> positives<00:05:21.389> but<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.440> also<00:05:22.680> see<00:05:22.919> the

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
see the positives but I also see the

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.279 
see the positives but I also see the
negative<00:05:23.240> now<00:05:24.240> one<00:05:24.449> thing<00:05:24.479> that<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:24.780> have<00:05:25.020> heard

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
negative now one thing that I have heard

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.070 
negative now one thing that I have heard
is<00:05:25.500> that<00:05:25.560> a<00:05:26.130> sigma<00:05:27.060> will<00:05:27.270> be<00:05:27.389> renaming<00:05:27.810> their

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
is that a sigma will be renaming their

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.219 
is that a sigma will be renaming their
brushes<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.620> do<00:05:28.680> not<00:05:28.979> know<00:05:29.039> how<00:05:29.400> accurate<00:05:29.970> and

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
brushes I do not know how accurate and

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.480 
brushes I do not know how accurate and
exact<00:05:31.229> that<00:05:31.380> is<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.740> haven't<00:05:31.919> heard<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:32.190> from

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
exact that is I haven't heard that from

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.140 
exact that is I haven't heard that from
a<00:05:33.470> sigma<00:05:34.470> representative<00:05:35.190> but<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.610> have<00:05:35.880> heard

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
a sigma representative but I have heard

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.210 
a sigma representative but I have heard
it<00:05:36.300> from<00:05:36.479> somebody<00:05:36.810> who<00:05:37.710> is<00:05:37.949> a<00:05:37.979> pretty

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
it from somebody who is a pretty

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.159 
it from somebody who is a pretty
reliable<00:05:38.760> source<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.300> they<00:05:39.659> told<00:05:39.930> me<00:05:40.050> that

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
reliable source and they told me that

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.529 
reliable source and they told me that
Sigma<00:05:41.039> will<00:05:41.220> be<00:05:41.340> renaming<00:05:41.639> renaming<00:05:42.240> their

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
Sigma will be renaming renaming their

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.800 
Sigma will be renaming renaming their
brushes<00:05:42.780> so<00:05:43.080> that's<00:05:43.620> a<00:05:43.740> really<00:05:43.770> good<00:05:44.190> thing
