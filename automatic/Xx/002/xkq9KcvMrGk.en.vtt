00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.060 

I'm<00:00:16.309> using<00:00:16.640> four<00:00:17.210> pounds<00:00:17.779> of<00:00:18.020> stoneware<00:00:18.829> clay

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
I'm using four pounds of stoneware clay

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.400 
I'm using four pounds of stoneware clay
I<00:00:20.050> attach<00:00:21.050> the<00:00:21.320> clay<00:00:21.500> to<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.740> bat<00:00:21.860> and<00:00:23.110> then<00:00:24.110> I

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
I attach the clay to the bat and then I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.760 
I attach the clay to the bat and then I
Center<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.130> clay<00:00:28.689> so<00:00:29.689> after<00:00:30.079> I<00:00:30.110> Center<00:00:30.619> the

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
Center the clay so after I Center the

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:46.460 
Center the clay so after I Center the
clay<00:00:30.919> I<00:00:31.309> open<00:00:31.820> up

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.490 

once<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:48.010> clay<00:00:48.190> has<00:00:48.340> opened<00:00:48.790> up<00:00:48.910> I<00:00:49.500> start

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
once the clay has opened up I start

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.860 
once the clay has opened up I start
bringing<00:00:50.860> up<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.370> walls<00:00:51.610> with<00:00:52.450> equal

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
bringing up the walls with equal

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.549 
bringing up the walls with equal
pressure<00:00:53.910> inside<00:00:54.910> hand<00:00:55.180> outside<00:00:55.629> hand<00:00:55.960> at

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
pressure inside hand outside hand at

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.979 
pressure inside hand outside hand at
about<00:00:56.920> 3<00:00:57.519> or<00:00:57.550> 4<00:00:57.850> o'clock<00:00:57.879> I<00:01:00.989> deliberately

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
about 3 or 4 o'clock I deliberately

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.930 
about 3 or 4 o'clock I deliberately
leave<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.250> walls<00:01:03.489> of<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.690> form<00:01:05.050> thick

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
leave the walls of the form thick

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.219 
leave the walls of the form thick
knowing<00:01:06.940> that<00:01:07.150> I'm<00:01:07.270> going<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.450> be<00:01:07.600> pushing<00:01:07.960> it

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
knowing that I'm going to be pushing it

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.740 
knowing that I'm going to be pushing it
out<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:09.190> make<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.550> form<00:01:09.850> from<00:01:10.030> a<00:01:10.180> cylinder

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
out to make the form from a cylinder

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.499 
out to make the form from a cylinder
into<00:01:11.050> a<00:01:11.290> rounded<00:01:11.830> shape<00:01:17.490> after<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.820> pull<00:01:19.360> the

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
into a rounded shape after I pull the

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.740 
into a rounded shape after I pull the
form<00:01:19.810> up<00:01:20.110> I<00:01:21.509> next

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
form up I next

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:33.320 
form up I next
smooth<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.710> with<00:01:24.009> a<00:01:24.039> rubber<00:01:24.340> rib

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.410 

and<00:01:34.330> then<00:01:35.200> I<00:01:35.230> use<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:36.040> tool<00:01:36.490> called<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:37.120> Steve

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
and then I use a tool called a Steve

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:51.710 
and then I use a tool called a Steve
tool<00:01:37.780> that<00:01:38.110> creates<00:01:38.940> vertical<00:01:39.940> texture

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.440 

next<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:52.930> apply<00:01:53.130> sodium<00:01:54.130> silicate<00:01:54.730> with<00:01:55.420> a

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
next I apply sodium silicate with a

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:09.389 
next I apply sodium silicate with a
brush<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:06.220> get<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.520> sodium<00:02:06.820> silicate<00:02:08.039> hard<00:02:09.039> on

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
brush to get the sodium silicate hard on

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:19.069 
brush to get the sodium silicate hard on
the<00:02:09.610> form<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:10.500> use<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.530> heat<00:02:11.830> gun

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.220 

after<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.200> sodium<00:02:20.590> silicate<00:02:21.099> is<00:02:21.870> dry<00:02:22.870> and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
after the sodium silicate is dry and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.220 
after the sodium silicate is dry and
firm<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.950> can<00:02:24.370> no<00:02:24.489> longer<00:02:24.760> use<00:02:24.939> any<00:02:25.450> water<00:02:25.810> on

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
firm I can no longer use any water on

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.009 
firm I can no longer use any water on
the<00:02:26.560> outside<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.159> form<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:28.299> shaping<00:02:28.870> of

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
the outside of the form the shaping of

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.920 
the outside of the form the shaping of
the<00:02:29.200> form<00:02:29.530> comes<00:02:30.159> all<00:02:30.579> from<00:02:30.939> pressure<00:02:31.299> with<00:02:31.750> my

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
the form comes all from pressure with my

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:45.330 
the form comes all from pressure with my
inside<00:02:32.500> hand<00:02:32.549> pushing<00:02:33.549> out<00:02:43.409> it<00:02:44.409> takes<00:02:44.739> several

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
inside hand pushing out it takes several

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.559 
inside hand pushing out it takes several
attempts<00:02:45.939> to<00:02:46.150> push<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.689> from<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.500> top<00:02:47.709> down

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
attempts to push it from the top down

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.839 
attempts to push it from the top down
bulging<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.689> out<00:02:49.840> until<00:02:50.379> I<00:02:50.439> get<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:51.159> cracks<00:02:51.489> to

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
bulging it out until I get the cracks to

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.020 
bulging it out until I get the cracks to
form<00:02:51.879> and<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.959> achieve<00:02:53.379> the<00:02:53.620> profile<00:02:54.189> that<00:02:54.970> I

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
form and I achieve the profile that I

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.759 
form and I achieve the profile that I
want<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:57.400> cracking<00:02:58.030> follows<00:02:58.689> the<00:02:59.019> lines<00:02:59.290> that

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
want the cracking follows the lines that

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.390 
want the cracking follows the lines that
were<00:02:59.950> made<00:03:00.129> by<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.400> steep<00:03:00.819> tool<00:03:05.010> after<00:03:06.010> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
were made by the steep tool after the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.780 
were made by the steep tool after the
lip<00:03:06.579> is<00:03:06.790> refined<00:03:07.359> I<00:03:07.689> use<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.290> needle<00:03:08.530> tool<00:03:08.950> to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
lip is refined I use a needle tool to

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:25.830 
lip is refined I use a needle tool to
trim<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.209> evenly<00:03:10.599> and<00:03:10.930> then<00:03:11.379> I<00:03:11.409> round<00:03:11.739> it<00:03:11.919> out

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.309 

I<00:03:25.930> cut<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:27.220> section<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.180> bottom<00:03:28.540> off<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:29.170> get

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
I cut a section of the bottom off to get

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.330 
I cut a section of the bottom off to get
the<00:03:29.440> profile<00:03:29.980> more<00:03:30.910> graceful

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.580 

when<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.459> pot<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.700> completed<00:03:38.629> I<00:03:38.810> take<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.260> wire

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
when the pot is completed I take a wire

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.459 
when the pot is completed I take a wire
tool<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:40.909> cut<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.239> removing<00:03:41.989> it<00:03:42.109> from<00:03:42.140> the

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:42.469 
tool and I cut it removing it from the

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.680 
tool and I cut it removing it from the
bat
