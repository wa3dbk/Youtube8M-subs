in the beginning of this arrangement of
America<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.920> Beautiful<00:02:07.070> we<00:02:07.940> have<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.179> basic

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
America the Beautiful we have a basic

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.150 
America the Beautiful we have a basic
legato<00:02:09.110> stroke<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:13.370> blends<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.300> D<00:02:14.750> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
legato stroke that blends the D and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.310 
legato stroke that blends the D and
includes<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.550> strings<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:17.959> have<00:02:18.170> to

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
includes the a strings so you have to

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.090 
includes the a strings so you have to
think<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:18.830> terms<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.370> smoothness<00:02:20.920> both<00:02:21.920> in

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
think in terms of smoothness both in

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.220 
think in terms of smoothness both in
terms<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.430> your<00:02:22.610> left<00:02:22.940> hand<00:02:23.300> as<00:02:23.540> well<00:02:23.930> as<00:02:24.080> your

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
terms of your left hand as well as your

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.720 
terms of your left hand as well as your
right

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.540 

we<00:02:29.120> bring<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.720> string

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.760 

and<00:02:33.640> then<00:02:34.150> we<00:02:34.270> play<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.930> devil<00:02:35.230> stop<00:02:35.500> at<00:02:35.680> the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
and then we play the devil stop at the

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.260 
and then we play the devil stop at the
end<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.130> first<00:02:36.340> measure<00:02:36.640> on<00:02:36.850> both<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.240> a

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
end of the first measure on both the a

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.500 
end of the first measure on both the a
and<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:38.200> D<00:02:38.230> string<00:02:38.680> likewise<00:02:39.670> for<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.120> second

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
and the D string likewise for the second

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.670 
and the D string likewise for the second
measure<00:02:43.410> lending<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.610> then<00:02:46.540> bringing<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
measure lending and then bringing the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.710 
measure lending and then bringing the
fourth<00:02:47.950> finger<00:02:48.190> down<00:02:51.240> let<00:02:52.240> me<00:02:52.330> play<00:02:52.510> those<00:02:52.690> two

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
fourth finger down let me play those two

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.960 
fourth finger down let me play those two
measures<00:02:53.290> for<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.620> again<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.160> little<00:02:54.700> bit

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
measures for you again a little bit

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:07.430 
measures for you again a little bit
faster

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.910 

and<00:03:08.440> then<00:03:08.740> we<00:03:08.830> go<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.400> third<00:03:09.640> measure

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
and then we go on to the third measure

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.380 

very<00:03:12.460> rock<00:03:12.880> over<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.600> g-string

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.630 

so<00:03:18.140> there's<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.380> rocking<00:03:18.860> motion<00:03:18.890> in<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.490> bow

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
so there's a rocking motion in the bow

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.940 
so there's a rocking motion in the bow
arm

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.170 

over<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.219> G

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.500 

and<00:03:32.689> then<00:03:32.870> there's<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.110> slight<00:03:33.620> shift<00:03:34.129> up<00:03:34.819> we

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
and then there's a slight shift up we

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.309 
and then there's a slight shift up we
execute<00:03:36.110> b-flat<00:03:36.860> with<00:03:37.040> their<00:03:37.189> first<00:03:37.489> finger

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
execute b-flat with their first finger

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.350 
execute b-flat with their first finger
and<00:03:39.319> we<00:03:39.680> bring<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.069> fourth<00:03:40.340> finger<00:03:40.700> down<00:03:40.939> a

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
and we bring the fourth finger down a

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.380 
and we bring the fourth finger down a
fourth<00:03:42.140> above<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.829> B<00:03:42.980> flat<00:03:43.220> for<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.819> harmonic

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
fourth above the B flat for a harmonic

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.380 
fourth above the B flat for a harmonic
effect<00:03:47.590> let<00:03:48.590> me<00:03:48.709> play<00:03:48.920> measure<00:03:49.280> four<00:03:49.790> for<00:03:50.269> you

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
effect let me play measure four for you

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:59.770 
effect let me play measure four for you
again<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.439> known<00:03:57.680> as<00:03:58.269> an<00:03:59.269> artificial

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
again this is known as an artificial

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.839 
again this is known as an artificial
harmonic<00:04:00.439> we<00:04:00.590> have<00:04:00.769> a<00:04:00.799> stop<00:04:01.250> note<00:04:01.609> which<00:04:01.819> is

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
harmonic we have a stop note which is

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.210 
harmonic we have a stop note which is
the<00:04:02.090> B<00:04:02.269> flat<00:04:02.409> and<00:04:03.409> then<00:04:03.470> an<00:04:04.400> E<00:04:04.819> flat<00:04:06.069> which<00:04:07.069> is

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
the B flat and then an E flat which is

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.020 
the B flat and then an E flat which is
played<00:04:07.459> lightly<00:04:09.400> accomplishing<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.489> harmonic

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
played lightly accomplishing a harmonic

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.960 
played lightly accomplishing a harmonic
now<00:04:11.690> let's<00:04:11.900> go<00:04:12.049> on<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.379> the<00:04:12.500> pickup<00:04:12.739> into<00:04:13.220> the

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
now let's go on to the pickup into the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.460 
now let's go on to the pickup into the
fifth<00:04:14.329> measure<00:04:14.889> we<00:04:15.889> have<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:16.070> single<00:04:16.519> note<00:04:17.470> in

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
fifth measure we have a single note in

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.120 
fifth measure we have a single note in
the<00:04:18.650> second<00:04:19.100> position<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:19.669> F<00:04:19.910> natural<00:04:21.130> and

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
the second position and F natural and

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.110 
the second position and F natural and
then<00:04:22.669> we<00:04:22.789> begin

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
then we begin

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:36.180 
then we begin
the<00:04:25.690> trilling<00:04:26.169> portion

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.250
