this<00:00:09.360> week's<00:00:09.420> super<00:00:09.809> cool<00:00:09.990> fold<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.559> found<00:00:10.889> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
this week's super cool fold is a found a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.610 
this week's super cool fold is a found a
sample<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.849> was<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> mailer<00:00:12.389> from<00:00:12.750> marlborough

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
sample I was a mailer from marlborough

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.310 
sample I was a mailer from marlborough
and<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.950> think<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.330> format<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.780> clever<00:00:16.139> I

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
and I think this format is so clever I

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.990 
and I think this format is so clever I
think<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.650> could<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.859> used<00:00:17.039> across<00:00:17.340> lots<00:00:17.850> of

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
think it could be used across lots of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.640 
think it could be used across lots of
different<00:00:18.300> categories<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.410> think<00:00:19.560> you're

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
different categories and I think you're

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.779 
different categories and I think you're
going<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.220> simple<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:20.640> it's

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
going to like it it's simple but it's

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.640 
going to like it it's simple but it's
got<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> really<00:00:21.240> cool<00:00:21.510> surprise<00:00:21.960> element<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.529> it

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
got a really cool surprise element in it

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.980 
got a really cool surprise element in it
so<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.460> basic<00:00:23.820> format<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.330> actually<00:00:24.660> an

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
so the basic format is actually an

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.800 
so the basic format is actually an
eight-page<00:00:25.380> broadside<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.210> opens

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
eight-page broadside and so it opens

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.620 
eight-page broadside and so it opens
like<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:29.510> then<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:32.600> now<00:00:33.600> I

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
like this and then like this now I

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.270 
like this and then like this now I
actually<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.230> kind<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.530> hold<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.980> closed

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
actually have to kind of hold it closed

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.729 
actually have to kind of hold it closed
because<00:00:35.520> i<00:00:35.730> only<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:36.590> sample<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
because i only have the one sample and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.740 
because i only have the one sample and
so<00:00:37.980> i<00:00:38.040> had<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> tear<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.579> open<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.030> when<00:00:39.600> it's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
so i had to tear it open but when it's

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.959 
so i had to tear it open but when it's
when<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.140> fully<00:00:40.649> sealed<00:00:41.040> down<00:00:41.460> there's<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
when it's fully sealed down there's a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.420 
when it's fully sealed down there's a
pocket<00:00:42.620> right<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:46.039> others<00:00:47.039> little<00:00:47.280> die

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
pocket right here and others little die

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.010 
pocket right here and others little die
cut<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.120> their<00:00:48.270> logo<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:48.780> there's<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
cut here of their logo but there's a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.569 
cut here of their logo but there's a
packet<00:00:49.500> right<00:00:49.649> here<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.070> holds<00:00:50.219> some

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
packet right here that holds some

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.150 
packet right here that holds some
coupons<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.360> things<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.949> is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
coupons and things so when this is
sealed<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:54.270> can't<00:00:54.510> even<00:00:54.629> tell<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.170> looks

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
sealed you can't even tell it just looks

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.010 
sealed you can't even tell it just looks
like<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> poster<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.360> look<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
like a poster but if we look at the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.529 
like a poster but if we look at the
actual<00:00:58.469> shape<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.340> there's<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> little

extra<00:01:00.960> panel<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.340> die-cut

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
extra panel here that that is die-cut

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.039 
extra panel here that that is die-cut
