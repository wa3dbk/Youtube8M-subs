African music or any other type of music
I<00:01:02.879> think<00:01:02.910> myself<00:01:03.329> playing<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> European

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.940 
I think myself playing as a European
musician<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:05.970> are<00:01:06.060> some<00:01:06.710> rhythms<00:01:07.710> for

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
musician but there are some rhythms for

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.670 
musician but there are some rhythms for
instances<00:01:08.400> patterns<00:01:09.000> which<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.510> steal<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
instances patterns which I can steal and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.190 
instances patterns which I can steal and
program<00:01:11.070> into<00:01:11.340> my<00:01:11.369> rhythm<00:01:11.729> machine<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.510> then

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
program into my rhythm machine and then

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.399 
program into my rhythm machine and then
try<00:01:13.799> writing<00:01:14.250> stuff<00:01:14.850> around<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.509> rhythms

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
try writing stuff around it and rhythms

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.580 
try writing stuff around it and rhythms
like<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> spine<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> music<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.380> body

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
like a spine up is a music and the body

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.030 
like a spine up is a music and the body
that<00:01:19.799> forms<00:01:20.159> around<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:21.080> will<00:01:22.080> vary<00:01:22.350> according

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that forms around it will vary according

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.950 
that forms around it will vary according
to<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> shape<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> rhythm<00:01:23.939> pattern<00:01:24.420> yeah

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
to the shape of the rhythm pattern yeah

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
to the shape of the rhythm pattern yeah
did<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.409> start<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.070> also<00:01:26.729> program<00:01:27.090> some

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
did you start with a also program some

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.730 
did you start with a also program some
