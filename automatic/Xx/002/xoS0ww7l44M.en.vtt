00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the connector that we're going to be

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459 
the connector that we're going to be
connecting<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> t<00:00:32.669> harness<00:00:32.969> into<00:00:33.260> we<00:00:34.260> want<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
connecting the t harness into we want to

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.030 
connecting the t harness into we want to
go<00:00:34.559> ahead<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.950> push<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:36.020> locking<00:00:37.020> tab<00:00:37.739> here

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
go ahead and push the locking tab here

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.790 
go ahead and push the locking tab here
on<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> inside<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:39.270> release<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:40.469> pop<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
on the inside to release it just pop it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.889 
on the inside to release it just pop it
right<00:00:40.829> off<00:00:40.950> there<00:00:41.309> I'm<00:00:42.059> gonna<00:00:42.300> go<00:00:42.420> ahead<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
right off there I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.229 
right off there I'm gonna go ahead and
take<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> T<00:00:43.379> connector<00:00:44.870> don't<00:00:45.870> work<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.140> well

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.369 

here<00:00:49.239> on<00:00:49.359> the<00:00:49.420> driver's<00:00:49.719> side<00:00:49.750> you<00:00:49.899> see<00:00:50.199> we've

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
here on the driver's side you see we've

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.770 
here on the driver's side you see we've
got<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.820> loom<00:00:51.820> connection<00:00:52.390> here<00:00:52.510> that's<00:00:52.659> going

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
got a loom connection here that's going

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.500 
got a loom connection here that's going
to<00:00:52.839> be<00:00:52.929> for<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.109> ground<00:00:54.179> you<00:00:55.179> could<00:00:55.329> probably

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
to be for the ground you could probably

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.020 
to be for the ground you could probably
go<00:00:55.659> ahead<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.010> attach<00:00:57.010> that<00:00:57.250> right<00:00:57.850> here

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
go ahead and attach that right here

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.399 
go ahead and attach that right here
we're<00:00:58.120> gonna<00:00:58.180> drill<00:00:58.449> a<00:00:58.479> hole<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:58.659> kamana<00:00:59.229> with

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
we're gonna drill a hole and kamana with

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:06.240 
we're gonna drill a hole and kamana with
the<00:00:59.530> self-tapping<00:01:00.190> screws<00:01:00.550> they<00:01:00.699> provided<00:01:05.250> do

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
the self-tapping screws they provided do

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.410 
the self-tapping screws they provided do
you<00:01:06.340> want<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.580> make<00:01:06.670> sure<00:01:06.850> there's<00:01:07.149> nothing

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
you want to make sure there's nothing

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.230 
you want to make sure there's nothing
behind<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:08.220> before<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.490> drill<00:01:09.729> so<00:01:10.060> that<00:01:10.180> you

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
behind you before you drill so that you

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.740 
behind you before you drill so that you
can<00:01:10.360> throw<00:01:10.479> them<00:01:10.630> in<00:01:10.689> any<00:01:10.840> components<00:01:12.570> okay

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
can throw them in any components okay

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.880 
can throw them in any components okay
now<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.049> we've<00:01:14.140> put<00:01:14.170> went<00:01:14.619> ahead<00:01:14.680> and

it is just it's gonna have to drop quite
way<00:01:31.299> down<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:31.750> do<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.869> tight<00:01:32.140> space<00:01:32.409> so<00:01:32.679> I'm

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
way down and do a tight space so I'm

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.180 
way down and do a tight space so I'm
going<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.159> go<00:01:33.250> ahead<00:01:33.399> and<00:01:34.530> use<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.709> light<00:01:35.890> piece

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
going to go ahead and use a light piece

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.160 
going to go ahead and use a light piece
