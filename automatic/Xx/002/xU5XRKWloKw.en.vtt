right<00:00:47.980> off<00:00:48.190> of<00:00:48.219> the<00:00:48.489> spawn<00:00:48.789> here<00:00:49.000> for<00:00:49.120> the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
right off of the spawn here for the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.000 
right off of the spawn here for the
ghost<00:00:49.420> spawn<00:00:49.750> you're<00:00:50.260> running<00:00:50.410> through<00:00:50.800> this

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
ghost spawn you're running through this

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.740 
ghost spawn you're running through this
building<00:00:51.460> up<00:00:51.579> here<00:00:51.730> now<00:00:51.969> it<00:00:52.090> is<00:00:52.149> a<00:00:52.210> really<00:00:52.510> long

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
building up here now it is a really long

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.660 
building up here now it is a really long
line<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:52.989> sight<00:00:53.289> so<00:00:53.559> I<00:00:53.590> chose<00:00:54.039> to<00:00:54.219> go<00:00:54.340> down<00:00:54.550> in

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
line of sight so I chose to go down in

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.250 
line of sight so I chose to go down in
this<00:00:54.820> lower<00:00:55.180> tunnel<00:00:55.629> here<00:00:55.840> so<00:00:56.020> that<00:00:56.170> they

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
this lower tunnel here so that they

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.990 
this lower tunnel here so that they
can't<00:00:56.500> see<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:56.800> up<00:00:56.920> in<00:00:56.949> that<00:00:57.129> top<00:00:57.550> one<00:00:57.609> and

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
can't see you up in that top one and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.459 
can't see you up in that top one and
then<00:00:58.480> you're<00:00:58.600> going<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.780> use<00:00:58.899> these<00:00:59.050> walls<00:00:59.289> to

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
then you're going to use these walls to

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.139 
then you're going to use these walls to
your<00:00:59.590> advantage<00:00:59.800> curl<00:01:00.250> around<00:01:00.430> them<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:00.910> cut

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
your advantage curl around them and cut

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.520 
your advantage curl around them and cut
through<00:01:01.390> this<00:01:01.510> little<00:01:01.719> tune<00:01:02.019> here<00:01:02.050> as<00:01:02.469> a

through this little tune here as a

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.190 
through this little tune here as a
another<00:01:03.430> way<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.609> like<00:01:04.059> canceling<00:01:04.720> there<00:01:04.990> any

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.200 
another way of like canceling there any

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.840 
another way of like canceling there any
opportunity<00:01:05.740> they<00:01:05.770> have<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:06.310> get<00:01:06.460> those<00:01:06.610> long

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
opportunity they have to get those long

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.310 
opportunity they have to get those long
