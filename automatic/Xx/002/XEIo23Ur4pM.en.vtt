00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
makes will be quite different so when

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.540 
makes will be quite different so when
that<00:02:15.980> happened

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
that happened

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.370

here you can see the seeds clearly and

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.170 
here you can see the seeds clearly and
this<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.709> how<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:24.950> make<00:02:25.459> any<00:02:25.640> noodles<00:02:25.910> with<00:02:26.150> a
