dolphins penguins nor whales and whales

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.609 
dolphins penguins nor whales and whales
and<00:01:52.920> including<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.729> new<00:01:54.060> biome<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.500> go

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and including a new biome and here we go

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.679 
and including a new biome and here we go
we<00:01:55.740> got<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> cooked<00:01:56.219> steak<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.360> no

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
we got the cooked steak and I have no

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.959 
we got the cooked steak and I have no
idea<00:01:58.110> why<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.469> cooked<00:01:58.770> steak<00:01:59.100> I'm<00:01:59.430> guessing

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
idea why it's cooked steak I'm guessing

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
idea why it's cooked steak I'm guessing
it's<00:02:00.149> because<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.780> their<00:02:00.930> color<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.439> their

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it's because of their color of their

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.280 
it's because of their color of their
sort<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.159> skin<00:02:02.850> color<00:02:03.180> I'm<00:02:03.540> there<00:02:03.869> they<00:02:04.140> are

that<00:03:49.410> maybe<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.800> model<00:03:50.100> can<00:03:50.280> be<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> little<00:03:50.640> bit

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
that maybe the model can be a little bit

mod I'm gonna give this mod a maybe a 6
or<00:04:11.370> 7<00:04:11.760> ok<00:04:12.150> maybe<00:04:12.630> lower<00:04:13.080> that<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.530> down<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.980> a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
or 7 ok maybe lower that that down to a

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.820 
or 7 ok maybe lower that that down to a
6<00:04:14.340> because<00:04:14.700> we<00:04:14.820> saw<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.000> walrus<00:04:15.780> across<00:04:16.620> real

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
6 because we saw that walrus across real

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.470 
6 because we saw that walrus across real
crazy<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.430> they<00:04:17.489> go<00:04:17.609> really<00:04:17.850> fast<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.359> wish

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
crazy and they go really fast I wish

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.449 
crazy and they go really fast I wish
they're<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.780> little<00:04:18.959> bit<00:04:19.140> slower<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:20.010> I<00:04:20.040> think

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
they're a little bit slower so I think

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.470 
they're a little bit slower so I think
you<00:04:20.549> guys<00:04:20.640> watching<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.359> have<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> nice<00:04:22.109> day
