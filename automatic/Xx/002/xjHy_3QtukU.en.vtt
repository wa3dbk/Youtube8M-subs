00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.400 
the size of pc maps cannot be converted
to<00:01:54.680> xbox<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.090> that's<00:01:56.540> a<00:01:56.630> condor<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.230> think

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
to xbox so that's a condor so I think

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.330 
to xbox so that's a condor so I think
it's<00:01:57.560> like<00:01:59.140> 864<00:02:00.140> blocks<00:02:00.650> it<00:02:00.890> wasn't<00:02:01.190> something

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
it's like 864 blocks it wasn't something

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.310 
it's like 864 blocks it wasn't something
like<00:02:01.610> that<00:02:01.820> is<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.330> size<00:02:02.660> that<00:02:02.900> that<00:02:03.050> you<00:02:03.140> can

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
like that is a size that that you can

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.620 
like that is a size that that you can
convert<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.980> arm<00:02:04.250> from<00:02:04.490> pc<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:04.850> xbox<00:02:05.300> anything

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
convert to arm from pc to xbox anything

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.210 
convert to arm from pc to xbox anything
bigger<00:02:05.840> than<00:02:05.900> that<00:02:06.080> basically<00:02:06.980> you<00:02:07.040> have<00:02:07.160> to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
bigger than that basically you have to

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.700 
bigger than that basically you have to
choose<00:02:07.490> what<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.700> want<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.060> cut<00:02:08.330> out<00:02:08.710> but

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
choose what you want to cut out but

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.110 
choose what you want to cut out but
they're<00:02:09.950> like<00:02:10.100> there's<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.399> whole<00:02:10.610> lot<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.090> can

Lee done to these are PC maps have been
converted<00:02:58.239> over<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.930> like<00:02:59.500> basically

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
converted over and like basically

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.259 
converted over and like basically
everything<00:03:00.220> stays<00:03:00.489> like<00:03:00.700> beside<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.150> other

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
version of these get xbox version are so

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.800 
version of these get xbox version are so
some<00:03:06.910> blocks<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.269> are<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.480> pc<00:03:07.780> version

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
some blocks that are in the pc version

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.170 
some blocks that are in the pc version
aren't<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> xbox<00:03:08.980> version<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:09.849> when<00:03:10.090> they

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
aren't in the xbox version so when they

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.520 
aren't in the xbox version so when they
do<00:03:10.239> can<00:03:10.510> convert<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.930> over<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.349> have<00:03:11.440> to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
do can convert it over you have to

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.809 
do can convert it over you have to
choose<00:03:11.709> what<00:03:11.860> flock<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.280> want<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.459> put<00:03:12.640> there

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
choose what flock you want to put there

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.520 
choose what flock you want to put there
basically<00:03:13.480> they<00:03:13.599> said<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.019> on<00:03:14.260> with<00:03:14.500> a

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
basically they said you can on with a

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.170 
basically they said you can on with a
converter<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.040> can<00:03:15.160> just<00:03:15.340> choose<00:03:15.519> 0<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.090> then

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
converter you can just choose 0 and then

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.580 
converter you can just choose 0 and then
afterwards<00:03:16.660> come<00:03:16.810> in<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.019> change<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.349> blocks

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
afterwards come in and change the blocks

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.380 
afterwards come in and change the blocks
or<00:03:17.829> view<00:03:18.099> it<00:03:18.250> gives<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.549> suggestive<00:03:19.180> block

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
or view it gives you a suggestive block

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.539 
or view it gives you a suggestive block
you<00:03:19.870> change<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.319> into<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.220> can<00:03:21.340> choose

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
you change it into and you can choose

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.250 
you change it into and you can choose
that<00:03:21.700> block<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:22.390> i'd<00:03:22.480> say<00:03:22.690> probably<00:03:22.720> just<00:03:23.140> go

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
that block but i'd say probably just go

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.870 
that block but i'd say probably just go
with<00:03:23.410> 0<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.980> then<00:03:24.099> go<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.370> map<00:03:24.579> you<00:03:24.790> have

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
with 0 and then go in the map you have

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.100 
with 0 and then go in the map you have
to<00:03:24.940> find<00:03:25.090> out<00:03:25.180> what<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.390> block<00:03:25.599> was<00:03:25.840> and

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
to find out what that block was and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.900 
to find out what that block was and
there's<00:03:26.560> basically<00:03:26.709> change<00:03:27.099> it<00:03:27.250> back<00:03:27.430> get

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
there's basically change it back get

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.729 
there's basically change it back get
your<00:03:28.030> nice<00:03:28.120> little<00:03:28.239> speed<00:03:28.569> boat<00:03:28.720> Danny<00:03:28.989> I'm

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
pretty snazzy snazzy but a sign arm it's

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.729 
pretty snazzy snazzy but a sign arm it's
a<00:03:33.670> look<00:03:33.880> with<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:34.930> sign<00:03:35.110> is<00:03:35.260> still<00:03:35.530> there

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739

that<00:05:51.740> you<00:05:51.979> can<00:05:52.130> have<00:05:52.220> always<00:05:52.610> burning<00:05:52.940> because

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.700 
that you can have always burning because
there's<00:05:53.419> nothing<00:05:53.660> in<00:05:53.810> there<00:05:53.930> to<00:05:54.110> burn<00:05:54.319> it<00:05:54.530> so

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
there's nothing in there to burn it so

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.200 
there's nothing in there to burn it so
there<00:05:54.889> should<00:05:55.280> be<00:05:55.370> any<00:05:55.550> reason<00:05:55.759> why<00:05:56.030> that<00:05:58.210> is
