00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.180
 ja is the prime minister 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.799
 I have lost my life 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.579
 Because the record has not disappeared 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.969
 Two 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.119
 I started one past 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.689
 I remember the memory of the race together 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.349
 Now I will remember a lot 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.569
 Format 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.659
 linked 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.979
 Temporary contract of many memories 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.060
 Even like a chain 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.280
 Holding the heart of human 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.420
 It is not Mr. Kosuke who demonstrates my power 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.790
 Because it is something that untie and reconnect 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.210
 Everyone's memory is 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.130
 I have not heard 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.910
 Then you can get it back 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400
 In life 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.400
 The memory that I reconnected on my own is rotten the same 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.020
 I once cried for 10 days 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.750
 Then, collect the fragments of memories scattered in the back of my heart 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.350
 It is to restore the chain of small 6 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.900
 I think it takes 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 But maybe go 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.500
 Maybe not 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.390
 This time I'm helping the stage 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.060
 I got it 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 I was left to something 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.490
 Wait a minute 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 Once while keeping the chain of memory in this seal 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Valid response 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.390
 It is a pity that what happened here 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.920
 I can not put out this 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 The same thing is also possible 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 I have no choice but to 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.270
 I was destined 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.510
 Choose one 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.380
 Instead of losing Shiga's memory 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.570
 Do you regain your memories again 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.850
 Instead of keeping a record in white 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.850
 While I lost my precious memories 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.169
 I chose 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.599
 Restored 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.609
 You should check the wireless lan for 10 years 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.929
 I wanted a really important person 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.929
 I want to remember the tip 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.019
 Anyone 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.019
 3. 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.819
 The tokyofeb 626 model was sold 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.139
 Accounting takes some time 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.769
 I leave it to me 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.450
 That's why I'm going to make videos of meters 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.799
 Seventeen yen 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.269
 No other than Sendai City 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.549
 It was recorded in gmail 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.549
 Responding to Geghi in Nine 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.189
 That started 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.089
 Everyday life improvement mind 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.089
 The famous water of Heisei 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.209
 I understood 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.479
 Oh 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.979
 It has started 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.989
 Open to contrast 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.439
 I think it was really good 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.139
 Also so far 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.719
 I came into my overtime 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.719
 I was shooting while remembering the name 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.019
 High 2:28 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.019
 Usually from the beginning 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.710
 Question 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.960
 27 minutes 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.130
 It's not a goodbye. 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.120
 It was about 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.120
 And I became a true friend what happened 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.360
 Nagano 2 Hiroshima Calculation is big 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.319
 About 1 million yen on that 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:55.249
 Last column shows $ 460 million worth of payment order 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.599
 Such promised memories 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.479

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.279

 * Around 1000 yen 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.319
 My participation 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.039
 I should be sorry 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.819
 I am sunk in my heart 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.400
 One that does not let one by one is 7329 yen 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.969
 -Participated 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.089
 The seventh game is unusual 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:54.039
 December 272 people 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.039
 Glow in the dark 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:00.029
 I made one thought under it 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.400
 I have a memory I saw from the perspective of the prefectural 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.619
 Human beings come back 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:07.619
 It was important 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.110
 Yasuma name riding 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.110
 Though I changed shape by power 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:17.339
 I thought that I had a salad 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:19.069
 It returned to the true form
