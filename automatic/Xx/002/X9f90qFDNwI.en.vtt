00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.220
 understanding you know something was going to 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.710
 say about social networks this 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.840
 I do not live here and as much as 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.330
 I want to keep in touch with me what I 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.240
 I do is put on the internet this follow 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.390
 the marches and follow sometimes is that I 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.500
 they call me my friend says my what tells me 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.790
 mind this I do not know what is going on 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.829
 this sees this 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.540
 but already with the things I do there 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.709
 Sometimes I do not have time to be so 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:22.660
 pending but yesterday something happened to me 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:26.160
 pretty weird that on twitter they send me 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.410
 the message like that our dear 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.419
 capriles radonski who has left that 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.780
 skin of truth what representation so 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.440
 wonderful we have 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.620
 they had told me and I in the middle of all the 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.440
 madness that I'm doing this had 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.500
 said that privilege I do not know what he sent 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.540
 they were to us to do and I 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.160
 crazy and desperate sent a twitter 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.980
 where he said not that they leave for such 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.510
 place let's not all go to the place 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.910
 and then someone wrote to me 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.250
 and if you are seeing me at this time, 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.710
 is that I'm going to apologize no but 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.540
 this told me you are very irresponsible to 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.420
 send that clear message because I am 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.880
 following almost the wave but understand but 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.730
 When it comes to the truth, my message is me 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.440
 me as a human being and then as an artist 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.750
 that there are many people who follow us 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.360
 I as a human being the only thing that 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.430
 I can tell my campaign 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.240
 self-love for a long, long time 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.280
 time and always putting on twitter 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.590
 self-esteem is what this country needs 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.910
 because with self-love you do not know 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.310
 They give a chance to anyone using them 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.100
 lack of respect that's what that's the 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.740
 only key we have in life for 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.070
 to be able to move forward to love us more 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.550
 in order to respect ourselves and respect the 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.550
 our 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.569
 plus 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.590
 Thank you 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.530
 because it allows me to clarify that on twitter 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.629
 you have to be very careful because 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.120
 many false accounts and nothing else in my 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:12.280
 case I do not know how for less like 10 and 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.229
 these fake accounts seek to generate 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.969
 just that now and 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.409
 maliciously then publishes some 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.780
 tweets that are tremendously 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.729
 irresponsible I want Venezuela 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.039
 know that my account is what you are going to see 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.969
 on screen at luisa tennis 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.860
 certified has has a 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.259
 certification and today has a 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.520
 million eight hundred and thousand 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:32.110
 followers when you look for a 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.400
 mind that you have that amount called 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.409
 to be seen in how many followers 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.689
 they have one million eight hundred and something 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:40.759
 then I propose something 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:43.419
 if you tie with me I can have 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.419
 those followers 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.440
 when you speak 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:07.060
 when the first thing that comes to mind 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.060
 is that one of difference 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.880

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.100
