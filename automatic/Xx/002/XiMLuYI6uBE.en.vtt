00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.270
 want discount to enter college 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.940
 I want access point point bag br 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.209
 Hello, welcome to the picture today. Come on. 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.820
 talk about two bacterial diseases 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.490
 associated with cardiovascular systems 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.440
 emphatic diseases are fever 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.110
 maculosa and plague 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.540
 Do you know the characteristics of them? 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.090
 see this on this album starting with 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.000
 macular fever which is an important disease 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.749
 also transmitted by bacteria 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.539
 the etiological agent of this disease 

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:38.879
 means the causative agent is the bacterium 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.409
 rickettsia rickettsii and where these 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.329
 bacteria are found 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:45.210
 good staff these bacteria are 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.129
 found in various animals and they are 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.579
 found mainly in a 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.519
 very common tick of the southeast region 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.640
 and is known as star tick 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.280
 this tick can be found in 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.449
 several steps and he is that tick 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.089
 very big 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.729
 it's very easy to be recognized then 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.960
 these bacteria can be found 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.450
 in these animals 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.270
 but how the ticks become with tannin 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 adult tick or the languages ​​that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.090
 are the famous millions become contaminated 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.520
 when they suck the blood of other animals 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.130
 which are also contaminated and which 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.149
 animals are these ticks can become 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.700
 contaminate 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.450
 through birds through animals 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.609
 wild like tapirs capybaras 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.549
 or through domestic animals 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:38.369
 like horses and once contaminated 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.070
 it can sting and transmit these 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.369
 bacteria for man so personal a lot 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.090
 be aware that this tick is the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.820
 spotting fever transmitter 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.380
 then we say that it is the vector 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.539
 of this disease 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.539
 good but still going on when 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.060
 tick man piccolo inoculates the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.340
 bacteria and which are the cells that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.060
 these bacteria will attack the bacteria 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.610
 of spotted fever mainly affect 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.120
 the cells lining the vessels 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.740
 blood vessels of the circulatory system 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.470
 when the bacterium 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.830
 these cells can happen several of 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.960
 studies circulatory disorders by 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.980
 example bleeding 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.230
 this is why several red spots 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.220
 appear on the skin of the person with a fever 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.330
 maculosa 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.430
 these personal blemishes arises because of 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.630
 subcutaneous hemorrhages but beyond 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.320
 red spots 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.400
 there are other symptoms that are fever 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:47.280
 headache nausea and vomiting fever 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.990
 maculosa is not treated in time. 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.360
 can cause death 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.460
 the treatment for spotted fever is 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.610
 made with the use of antibiotics 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.100
 and if the disease is treated 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.670
 time the person is not at risk of dying 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.670
 and is cured but there are also good 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.400
 prophylactic measures against fever 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.980
 and what measures are these 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.900
 Good when I already said this disease is 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.720
 caused by a vector 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.920
 then if we have vector the first measure 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.410
 prophylactic we are going to put here is 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.320
 against the vector and how it can be done 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.690
 this combat is the combat to the vector can 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.540
 be done in the pasture with the use of 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.360
 chemicals or animals 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.620
 infected is very much like for example the 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.360
 Farmers give bath in horses 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.280
 which are substances which 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.160
 they kill ticks 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.060
 it is also very important to avoid places 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.410
 infested by ticks and protect 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.520
 against them 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.920
 a good form of protection is the use of 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.290
 repellent wearing boots pants and blouses 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.420
 fulfilled mainly when visiting 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.000
 unknown pastures 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.990
 the second disease that 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.780
 I want to speak 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.959
 this is probably what you should already have 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.420
 heard about black plague in class 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.600
 of history that was that disease that 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.299
 decimated much of western Europe 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.090
 only that the personal plague exists to this day and 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.460
 Do you know how well it is transmitted to 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.580
 plague is also a transmitted disease 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.600
 by bacteria and these bacteria can 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.710
 to be 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.530
 fleas of various animals and fleas 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.400
 are found in animals as per 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.070
 example the mice if a flea sting a 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.340
 mouse is contaminated it will also 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.370
 contaminated with the bacteria and 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.130
 from it it can contaminate others 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.830
 animals or else man himself 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.650
 and when the flea contaminated man peak 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.870
 it inoculates the bacteria 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.020
 and there personal much attention beyond this 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.420
 form of contamination via fleas 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.630
 there is also a form of contamination 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.180
 direct and with which this contamination 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.480
 in this case the bacteria can be 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.490
 transmitted from injury or 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.660
 scratches caused by animals 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.670
 infected animals such as dogs and cats 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.890
 if a person is injured by these 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.280
 contaminated animals it can also 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:28.530
 acquiring directly to the bacterium then 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.870
 much personal attention that these two 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.590
 forms of transmission are quite different 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.960
 and the two usually fall into good tests 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.490
 continuing now let's talk about the 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.560
 plague symptoms 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.320
 if a person is contaminated what it 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.440
 may have this bacteria can fall into the 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.650
 the bloodstream and be taken to the 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.590
 lymph vessels and then it starts to attack 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.660
 the cells of the lymphatic vessels 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.600
 those cells that were then attacked 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.750
 begin to die and in response to this 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.660
 a very painful swelling 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:07.020
 usually the swelling occurs in the region 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.100
 armpits and also in the 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.380
 groin 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.830
 in these regions are found in 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.320
 lymph nodes and this swelling is accompanied by 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.110
 of fever and if a person with foot if not 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.400
 is treated it can die within 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.800
 few weeks 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.570
 there is already a treatment that is done 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.900
 also with the use of antibiotics 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.720
 and this treatment can lead to 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.660
 cure of the disease but there are also 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.840
 important prophylactic measures against 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:41.460
 These measures include first the 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.889
 fleas and also rats 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.860
 fight the rats we avoided 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:49.440
 flea contamination we can place 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.110
 here also direct flea combat 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.780
 with the use of chemical substances and 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.180
 treatment of infected animals 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:01.470
 it is also very important 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.990
 avoid contact with unknown animals 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:08.479
 Good folks, this is it for the next class, let's go. 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.479
 Talk about typhus, I'll wait for you there, see you later.
