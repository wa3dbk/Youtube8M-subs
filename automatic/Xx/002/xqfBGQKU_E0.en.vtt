00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.350
 Well, the machine is naturally more understandable with 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.119
 robot today want to work out 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.160
 a little look try with 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.510
 automatically understand everything good in principle, 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.059
 plus the fact that he has a manual 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.940
 manual robot switching I would say 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.250
 there is this moment of course which 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.170
 stretches temper when you 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.030
 like waiting for a switch she doesn't 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.040
 it is as if some 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.489
 time I think that this is a matter of habit 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.980
 how about everything anything man 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 gets used and sooner or later it will be no longer 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.660
 wonderful things a little bit not quite 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.899
 clear algorithm when you start 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.540
 park when switching definitely 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.920
 Do not forget to press the brake because 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.810
 that the transfer just won't turn on 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.580
 survive and all that is we want to still go 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.880
 this moment try it in different 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.130
 pull modes when some 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.080
 emergency when you parks him 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.360
 urgently need a quick car 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.380
 reject and leave or vice versa 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.170
 leave therefore more questions of course 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.280
 exactly to the robot machine automatic as 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.060
 the whole machine works like honest 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.060
 fine
