00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.590
 The flowers are back on the fields. A cold winter is over 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:41.530
 And the lovers lie together In warm sunshine 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:53.690
 Have a beer on the boulevard and laugh a lot with friends 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.690
 Hey! 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.750
 It is summer time again The world is too good to be true 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.360
 And the joy of that warmth, yes, you can feel it everywhere 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.490
 How beautiful a Dutch summer can be 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:34.899
 I wander with my girl on the crowded square 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.259
 We take another ice cream together That's how it always had to be 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:56.869
 We are just like children again And the whole city looks like gold! 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:57.929
 Hey! 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:06.570
 It is summer time again The world is too good to be true 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.379
 And the joy of that warmth, yes, you can feel it everywhere 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.920
 How beautiful a Dutch summer can be 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.400
 Hey! 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:27.819
 It is summer time again The world is too good to be true 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.620
 And the joy of that warmth, yes, you can feel it everywhere 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.849
 How beautiful a Dutch summer can be 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.480
 And I say: 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480
 Hey! 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.170
 It is summer time again The world is too good to be true 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.050
 And the joy of that warmth, yes, you can feel it everywhere 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.139
 How beautiful a Dutch summer can be
