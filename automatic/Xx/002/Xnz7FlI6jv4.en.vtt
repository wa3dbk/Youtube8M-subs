these<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.689> think<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> price<00:00:30.960> they're

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
these up I think for the price they're

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
these up I think for the price they're
definitely<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> price<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.300> can't

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
definitely right for the price you can't

go<00:00:34.050> wrong<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.649> that's<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:34.980> reason

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
go wrong and I think that's one reason

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.549 
go wrong and I think that's one reason
why<00:00:35.309> KD<00:00:35.820> sixes<00:00:36.300> are<00:00:36.420> winning<00:00:36.750> they're<00:00:37.260> not

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
why KD sixes are winning they're not

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.260 
why KD sixes are winning they're not
