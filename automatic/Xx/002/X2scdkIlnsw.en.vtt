let's<00:03:47.160> talk<00:03:47.370> about<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.910> out<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.239> balcony

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
let's talk about going out of balcony

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.550 
let's talk about going out of balcony
there's<00:03:50.099> an<00:03:50.879> a<00:03:51.090> combo<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.959> think<00:03:52.440> is

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
there's an a combo that I think is

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.830 
there's an a combo that I think is
really<00:03:52.949> effective<00:03:53.519> at<00:03:53.790> least<00:03:54.269> in<00:03:54.449> punks<00:03:54.720> and

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
really effective at least in punks and

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.569 
really effective at least in punks and
matchmaking<00:03:55.290> when<00:03:55.739> trying<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.250> get<00:03:56.430> out<00:03:56.549> of

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
matchmaking when trying to get out of

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.699 
matchmaking when trying to get out of
balcony<00:03:57.090> because<00:03:57.269> getting<00:03:58.139> out<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.379> balcony

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
balcony because getting out of balcony

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.039 
balcony because getting out of balcony
is<00:03:58.829> actually<00:03:59.250> quite<00:03:59.430> hard<00:03:59.819> if<00:04:00.359> you<00:04:00.599> just<00:04:00.659> want

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
is actually quite hard if you just want

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.439 
is actually quite hard if you just want
to<00:04:01.109> run<00:04:01.290> out<00:04:01.319> with<00:04:01.620> guns<00:04:01.889> right<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.639> not<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.180> lot

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
to run out with guns right and not a lot

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.659 
to run out with guns right and not a lot
of<00:04:03.480> flashes<00:04:03.989> are<00:04:04.139> effective<00:04:04.620> because<00:04:04.799> they

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
of flashes are effective because they

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.349 
of flashes are effective because they
can<00:04:06.060> see<00:04:06.389> a<00:04:06.419> coming<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:08.849> floor<00:04:09.150> just

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
can see a coming and this the floor just

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.020 
can see a coming and this the floor just
blocks<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.840> lot<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:10.169> it<00:04:10.319> for<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.620> pit<00:04:10.919> player<00:04:11.129> so

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
blocks a lot of it for the pit player so

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.839 
blocks a lot of it for the pit player so
a<00:04:12.389> good<00:04:12.659> way<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.870> actually<00:04:13.169> do<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.919> after

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
a good way to actually do it is after

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.370 
a good way to actually do it is after
you<00:04:14.940> get<00:04:15.150> here<00:04:15.479> and<00:04:15.659> you<00:04:15.750> know<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.139> know
