stuff<00:02:11.489> left<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.719> could<00:02:12.870> take<00:02:13.109> four<00:02:13.709> five

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
stuff left in it it could take four five

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.250 
stuff left in it it could take four five
six<00:02:14.849> times<00:02:15.150> depends<00:02:15.599> on<00:02:15.689> how<00:02:15.810> dirty<00:02:15.870> your

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
six times depends on how dirty your

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.520 
six times depends on how dirty your
biodiesel<00:02:16.950> was

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
biodiesel was

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.900 
biodiesel was
and<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.640> just<00:02:18.790> gets<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:20.290> all<00:02:20.710> of<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.130> excess

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
and this just gets the all of the excess

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.270 
and this just gets the all of the excess
lie<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.660> had<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:22.990> there<00:02:23.260> gets<00:02:24.040> all<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
lie that you had in there gets all the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.890 
lie that you had in there gets all the
soap<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.700> everything<00:02:25.090> out<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.360> there<00:02:25.510> just<00:02:25.780> I

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
soap and everything out of there just I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.450 
soap and everything out of there just I
mean<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.170> literally<00:02:26.440> cleans<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.070> biodiesel

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
mean it literally cleans the biodiesel

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.120 
mean it literally cleans the biodiesel
that's<00:02:28.090> what<00:02:28.270> it's<00:02:28.390> doing<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.890> how<00:02:30.070> you

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that's what it's doing so that's how you

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.949 
that's what it's doing so that's how you
clean<00:02:30.430> biodiesel<00:02:31.290> with<00:02:32.290> water<00:02:32.820> again<00:02:33.959> we're

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
clean biodiesel with water again we're

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.830 
clean biodiesel with water again we're
slow<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.770> got<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.430> do<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.700> slow<00:02:36.940> if<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.240> mix<00:02:37.720> it

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
slow you got to do it slow if you mix it

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.140 
slow you got to do it slow if you mix it
and<00:02:37.990> stir<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.350> up<00:02:38.440> real<00:02:38.680> fast<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.880> might<00:02:40.090> as

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
and stir it up real fast you might as

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.690 
and stir it up real fast you might as
well<00:02:40.209> just<00:02:40.900> go<00:02:41.350> ahead<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.650> throw<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.890> away

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
well just go ahead and throw it away

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.620 
well just go ahead and throw it away
I<00:02:42.730> had<00:02:43.480> one<00:02:43.690> here<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.110> other<00:02:44.140> day<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:45.630> kept

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
I had one here the other day I kept

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.449 
I had one here the other day I kept
because<00:02:47.320> I<00:02:47.470> wanted<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.830> use<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.100> as<00:02:48.190> an<00:02:48.340> example

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
because I wanted to use it as an example

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.330 
because I wanted to use it as an example
I<00:02:48.880> can't<00:02:49.180> find<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.570> now<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.860> looked<00:02:51.220> like

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
I can't find it now but it looked like

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.520 
I can't find it now but it looked like
the<00:02:51.580> bottom<00:02:51.910> does<00:02:52.120> here<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.540> stayed<00:02:53.020> that<00:02:53.470> way

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
the bottom does here and stayed that way

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.710 
the bottom does here and stayed that way
that's<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.430> way<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.700> stayed<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.270> didn't<00:02:55.570> it

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
that's the way it stayed it didn't it

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.710 
that's the way it stayed it didn't it
never<00:02:55.930> separated<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.910> even<00:02:58.209> put<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.510> in<00:02:58.630> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
never separated and I even put it in the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.990 
never separated and I even put it in the
Sun<00:02:59.010> trying<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.190> heat<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.459> back<00:03:00.489> up<00:03:00.580> to

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
Sun trying to heat it back up to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.720 
Sun trying to heat it back up to
separate<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.200> didn't<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:03.400> there<00:03:03.610> you

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
separate it and it didn't so there you

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.699 
separate it and it didn't so there you
see<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.390> know<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.660> distinct<00:03:05.140> line<00:03:05.350> from

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
see the you know the distinct line from

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.370 
see the you know the distinct line from
the<00:03:05.830> water<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.580> oil<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:08.200> wall

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
the water to the oil and this wall

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.560 
the water to the oil and this wall
settled<00:03:08.890> down<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.970> what<00:03:10.090> I'll<00:03:10.180> do<00:03:10.300> is<00:03:10.450> I'll

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
settled down and what I'll do is I'll

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.400 
settled down and what I'll do is I'll
drain<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.930> off<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.820> then<00:03:12.820> do<00:03:13.570> it<00:03:13.690> again<00:03:13.780> I'll

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
drain it off and then do it again I'll

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.500 
drain it off and then do it again I'll
wash<00:03:14.680> this<00:03:14.980> for<00:03:15.250> five<00:03:15.670> six<00:03:16.120> times<00:03:16.270> however

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
wash this for five six times however

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.020 
wash this for five six times however
many<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:16.959> takes<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.500> then<00:03:18.160> I'll<00:03:18.280> go<00:03:18.430> ahead<00:03:18.790> and

know it looks kind of funny this was and

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.340 
know it looks kind of funny this was and
I<00:03:27.640> know<00:03:27.700> we've<00:03:27.970> all<00:03:28.180> seen<00:03:28.480> them<00:03:28.630> this<00:03:28.959> is<00:03:29.140> those

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
those fish tanks that sat in the corner

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.330 
those fish tanks that sat in the corner
of<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.170> house<00:03:32.320> that<00:03:32.560> were<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.860> real<00:03:33.040> big<00:03:33.310> thing

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
little bubbles it and the fish floated

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.800 
little bubbles it and the fish floated
up<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.100> down<00:03:42.250> left<00:03:42.610> all<00:03:42.790> this<00:03:42.940> was<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.450> just

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
up and down left all this was I just

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.319 
up and down left all this was I just
mounted<00:03:44.110> it<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.260> some<00:03:44.500> PVC<00:03:44.799> my<00:03:45.730> Center<00:03:46.060> port

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
mounted it to some PVC my Center port

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.420 
mounted it to some PVC my Center port
obviously<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.019> for<00:03:47.200> my<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:48.160> was<00:03:48.250> where<00:03:48.400> I

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
obviously is for my it was where I

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.100 
obviously is for my it was where I
hooked<00:03:48.670> up<00:03:48.760> my<00:03:48.820> aerator<00:03:49.299> for<00:03:49.600> my<00:03:49.720> pump<00:03:49.959> I

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
hooked up my aerator for my pump I

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.360 
hooked up my aerator for my pump I
actually<00:03:50.410> hook<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.620> over<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.829> my<00:03:50.920> hot<00:03:51.100> plate

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
actually hook it over to my hot plate

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.120 
actually hook it over to my hot plate
and<00:03:51.610> got<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.660> get<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:52.930> there<00:03:53.110> then<00:03:53.769> this<00:03:53.890> blue

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
and got it get it there then this blue

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.100 
and got it get it there then this blue
port<00:03:54.400> here<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:54.730> my<00:03:54.880> oil<00:03:55.090> drain<00:03:55.510> that's<00:03:55.930> the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
port here is my oil drain that's the

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.960 
go down to just where the oil level
would<00:05:04.840> be<00:05:04.900> that<00:05:05.800> way<00:05:05.980> and<00:05:06.250> I'll<00:05:06.490> put<00:05:06.670> a<00:05:06.700> funnel

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.320 
here and what happens when I add my air
to<00:05:29.470> this<00:05:29.710> it<00:05:30.100> runs<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.610> air<00:05:30.730> bubbles<00:05:31.120> up

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
to this it runs the air bubbles up

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.050 
to this it runs the air bubbles up
through<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:32.070> biodiesel<00:05:33.070> and<00:05:33.190> it<00:05:33.610> just<00:05:33.820> does<00:05:34.030> a

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
through the biodiesel and it just does a

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.870 
through the biodiesel and it just does a
final<00:05:34.660> scrub<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:35.260> believe<00:05:35.440> it<00:05:35.560> or<00:05:35.650> not<00:05:35.740> I<00:05:36.070> can

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
final scrub and believe it or not I can

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.190 
final scrub and believe it or not I can
come<00:05:37.030> off<00:05:37.180> with<00:05:37.360> about<00:05:37.540> a<00:05:37.570> quarter<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:37.990> an<00:05:38.080> inch

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
come off with about a quarter of an inch

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.040 
come off with about a quarter of an inch
of<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.440> white<00:05:38.680> foam<00:05:38.980> when<00:05:39.910> I'm<00:05:40.030> done<00:05:40.330> with<00:05:41.020> it

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
of that white foam when I'm done with it

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.230 
of that white foam when I'm done with it
so<00:05:41.230> I<00:05:41.410> know<00:05:41.560> my<00:05:42.010> biodiesel<00:05:42.670> is<00:05:42.790> as<00:05:42.910> clean<00:05:43.120> as

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
so I know my biodiesel is as clean as

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.720 
so I know my biodiesel is as clean as
it's<00:05:43.360> possibly<00:05:43.780> gonna<00:05:43.900> get<00:05:44.170> so<00:05:45.070> what<00:05:45.550> I'll<00:05:45.640> do

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
it's possibly gonna get so what I'll do

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.320 
it's possibly gonna get so what I'll do
is<00:05:45.880> I'll<00:05:45.970> drain<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.390> down<00:05:47.130> to<00:05:48.130> about<00:05:48.430> maybe<00:05:49.060> an

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
is I'll drain it down to about maybe an

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.460 
is I'll drain it down to about maybe an
eighth<00:05:49.480> inch<00:05:49.510> to<00:05:49.900> a<00:05:49.960> quarter<00:05:50.140> of<00:05:50.290> an<00:05:50.350> inch

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
eighth inch to a quarter of an inch

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.230 
eighth inch to a quarter of an inch
below<00:05:50.740> this<00:05:51.130> water<00:05:51.400> level<00:05:51.760> so<00:05:51.850> I<00:05:51.880> have<00:05:52.060> an

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
below this water level so I have an

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.430 
below this water level so I have an
eighth<00:05:52.390> an<00:05:52.570> inch<00:05:52.720> or<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:52.900> quarter<00:05:53.080> of<00:05:53.290> an<00:05:53.380> inch

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
eighth an inch or a quarter of an inch

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.490 
eighth an inch or a quarter of an inch
of<00:05:53.680> oil<00:05:53.950> below<00:05:54.430> this<00:05:54.640> water<00:05:54.910> line<00:05:55.180> here<00:05:55.500> I'll

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
of oil below this water line here I'll

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.260 
of oil below this water line here I'll
drain<00:05:56.890> the<00:05:56.950> water<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:57.520> water<00:05:57.730> drain<00:05:58.030> is<00:05:58.150> on

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
drain the water the water drain is on

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.240 
drain the water the water drain is on
this<00:05:58.450> side<00:05:58.600> over<00:05:58.720> here<00:05:58.920> that's<00:05:59.920> my<00:06:00.070> water

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
this side over here that's my water

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.520 
this side over here that's my water
drain<00:06:00.640> so<00:06:01.270> I'll<00:06:01.360> drain<00:06:01.570> that<00:06:01.720> water<00:06:01.780> down<00:06:02.170> so

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
drain so I'll drain that water down so

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.980 
drain so I'll drain that water down so
it<00:06:02.620> comes<00:06:02.770> down<00:06:02.890> just<00:06:03.220> a<00:06:03.310> little<00:06:03.340> bit<00:06:03.640> and<00:06:03.990> then

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
it comes down just a little bit and then

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.600 
it comes down just a little bit and then
what<00:06:05.470> I<00:06:05.500> do<00:06:05.590> is<00:06:05.680> I<00:06:05.860> just<00:06:05.890> siphon<00:06:06.220> off<00:06:06.460> the

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
what I do is I just siphon off the

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.460 
what I do is I just siphon off the
biodiesel<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.330> I'm<00:06:07.960> left<00:06:08.320> with<00:06:09.960> that<00:06:10.960> you

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
biodiesel and I'm left with that you

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.620 
biodiesel and I'm left with that you
know<00:06:11.590> dirty<00:06:12.580> water<00:06:12.910> on<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.240> bottom<00:06:13.480> there<00:06:13.600> and

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
know dirty water on the bottom there and

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.240 
know dirty water on the bottom there and
I<00:06:13.720> can<00:06:13.840> just<00:06:13.960> dump<00:06:14.110> it<00:06:14.170> out<00:06:14.290> clean<00:06:14.530> clean<00:06:15.190> the

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
I can just dump it out clean clean the

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.270 
I can just dump it out clean clean the
machine<00:06:15.520> so<00:06:16.330> that's<00:06:17.080> not<00:06:17.290> necessary<00:06:17.860> and<00:06:18.160> we

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
machine so that's not necessary and we

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.040 
machine so that's not necessary and we
remember<00:06:18.550> like<00:06:18.670> I<00:06:18.760> told<00:06:18.940> you<00:06:19.030> before<00:06:19.120> you

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
remember like I told you before you

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.350 
remember like I told you before you
don't<00:06:20.200> even<00:06:20.320> have<00:06:20.470> to<00:06:20.560> clean<00:06:20.740> biodiesel<00:06:21.360> you

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
don't even have to clean biodiesel you

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.580 
don't even have to clean biodiesel you
couldn't<00:06:22.630> you<00:06:22.750> can<00:06:22.900> make<00:06:23.050> your<00:06:23.200> test<00:06:23.380> batch

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
couldn't you can make your test batch

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.650 
couldn't you can make your test batch
like<00:06:23.770> we<00:06:23.920> did<00:06:24.130> and<00:06:24.280> go<00:06:24.910> ahead<00:06:25.060> and<00:06:25.240> throw<00:06:25.480> it<00:06:25.540> in

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
like we did and go ahead and throw it in

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.270 
like we did and go ahead and throw it in
your<00:06:25.750> tractor<00:06:26.200> or<00:06:26.440> throw<00:06:26.770> it<00:06:26.800> in<00:06:26.950> your<00:06:27.070> truck

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
your tractor or throw it in your truck

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.500 
your tractor or throw it in your truck
or<00:06:27.430> your<00:06:27.520> car<00:06:27.700> or<00:06:27.760> whatever<00:06:27.910> you<00:06:28.150> want<00:06:28.330> you

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
or your car or whatever you want you

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.410 
or your car or whatever you want you
don't<00:06:28.660> have<00:06:28.870> to<00:06:29.080> clean<00:06:29.290> it<00:06:29.520> I<00:06:30.520> just<00:06:31.090> prefer<00:06:31.390> to

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
don't have to clean it I just prefer to

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.550 
don't have to clean it I just prefer to
clean<00:06:31.690> it<00:06:31.810> because<00:06:31.870> it's<00:06:32.110> a<00:06:32.170> better<00:06:32.320> quality

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
clean it because it's a better quality

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.930 
clean it because it's a better quality
fuel<00:06:33.160> and<00:06:33.400> that's<00:06:33.460> why<00:06:33.670> we're<00:06:33.820> making

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
fuel and that's why we're making

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.550 
fuel and that's why we're making
biodiesel<00:06:34.420> because<00:06:34.810> it's<00:06:34.960> better<00:06:35.110> for<00:06:35.380> our

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
biodiesel because it's better for our

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.160 
biodiesel because it's better for our
vehicles<00:06:36.550> better<00:06:36.820> for<00:06:37.120> our<00:06:37.240> environment<00:06:37.510> so

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
vehicles better for our environment so

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.980 
vehicles better for our environment so
that's<00:06:38.560> why<00:06:38.800> I<00:06:38.830> do<00:06:39.010> what<00:06:39.280> I<00:06:39.310> do

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
that's why I do what I do

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.070 
that's why I do what I do
so<00:06:40.990> that's<00:06:41.590> your<00:06:42.420> that's<00:06:43.420> your<00:06:43.600> lesson<00:06:43.960> on

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
so that's your that's your lesson on

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.480 
so that's your that's your lesson on
making<00:06:44.440> biodiesel

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
making biodiesel

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.950 
making biodiesel
