00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
what I'm doing now is throwing an

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.840 
what I'm doing now is throwing an
outline<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.260> I've<00:00:19.920> got<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> guide<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.699> my

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
outline so I've got a guide to do my

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.730 
outline so I've got a guide to do my
painting<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.449> I'm<00:00:22.020> actually<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> draw

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
painting and I'm actually going to draw

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.939 
painting and I'm actually going to draw
the<00:00:23.580> face<00:00:23.850> much<00:00:24.269> bigger<00:00:24.570> than<00:00:24.750> my<00:00:24.869> own<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the face much bigger than my own so the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.109 
the face much bigger than my own so the
features<00:00:26.369> overlap<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> painted<00:00:28.590> I

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
features overlap and when I painted I

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:38.660 
features overlap and when I painted I
can<00:00:30.119> easily<00:00:30.480> hide<00:00:30.900> with<00:00:31.320> an<00:00:31.439> inner
