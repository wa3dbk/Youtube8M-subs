that I wanted to work in TV but not

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.220 
that I wanted to work in TV but not
really<00:00:29.580> knowing<00:00:29.759> what<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> best<00:00:31.080> thing

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
really knowing what was the best thing

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.810 
really knowing what was the best thing
to<00:00:31.289> study<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> thought<00:00:32.430> I'd<00:00:32.550> study

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
to study so I thought I'd study

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
to study so I thought I'd study
something<00:00:33.120> solid<00:00:33.840> an<00:00:34.170> old-fashioned<00:00:34.830> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
something solid an old-fashioned that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.619 
something solid an old-fashioned that
would<00:00:35.220> look<00:00:35.400> good<00:00:35.580> on<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.760> certificate<00:00:36.420> and

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
would look good on a certificate and

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.830 
would look good on a certificate and
then<00:00:37.230> i<00:00:37.350> wrote<00:00:38.280> millions<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.180> letters<00:00:39.300> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
then i wrote millions of letters to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.139 
then i wrote millions of letters to
different<00:00:39.870> parts<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> BBC<00:00:41.070> because<00:00:41.579> i<00:00:41.670> was

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
different parts of the BBC because i was

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.369 
different parts of the BBC because i was
fairly<00:00:42.360> sure<00:00:42.539> i<00:00:42.600> wanted<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> work<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> BBC

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
fairly sure i wanted to work for the BBC

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.310 
fairly sure i wanted to work for the BBC
and<00:00:43.920> i<00:00:44.670> eventually<00:00:44.820> got<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> job<00:00:45.629> interview<00:00:45.809> at

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and i eventually got a job interview at

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350 
and i eventually got a job interview at
BBC<00:00:46.680> Southampton<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:48.030> think<00:00:48.210> it's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
BBC Southampton and I think it's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
BBC Southampton and I think it's
probably<00:00:48.660> quite<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> good<00:00:49.410> tip<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.649> people<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
probably quite a good tip for people to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.060 
probably quite a good tip for people to
target<00:00:50.760> smaller<00:00:51.120> outposts<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:52.260> broadcasters

to end up being a producer for the BBC
what<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> didn't<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.340> at<00:01:05.730> 21<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.660> do

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
what I didn't know at 21 was how to do

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.830 
what I didn't know at 21 was how to do
that<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.980> I<00:01:08.160> thought<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.270> best<00:01:09.420> thing<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.660> do

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that and I thought the best thing to do

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
that and I thought the best thing to do
was<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.050> get<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> job<00:01:10.620> at<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:10.830> BBC<00:01:11.270> probably<00:01:12.270> in

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
was to get a job at the BBC probably in

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.520 
was to get a job at the BBC probably in
the<00:01:12.390> right<00:01:12.630> neck<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.080> woods<00:01:13.320> in

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the right neck of the woods in

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.890 
the right neck of the woods in
production<00:01:14.190> so<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.760> thought<00:01:15.420> about<00:01:15.660> applying

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
production so I thought about applying

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.330 
production so I thought about applying
for<00:01:16.380> unrelated<00:01:16.910> jobs<00:01:17.910> in<00:01:18.450> admin<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.340> things

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
for unrelated jobs in admin or things

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.710 
for unrelated jobs in admin or things
that<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.730> I<00:01:20.760> decided<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.270> end<00:01:21.300> it's<00:01:21.540> best

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
that and I decided in the end it's best

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.800 
that and I decided in the end it's best
to<00:01:21.840> try<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.500> least<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:23.010> on<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.310> right

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
to try and at least get on the right

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.300 
to try and at least get on the right
ladder<00:01:24.810> even<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:25.800> you're<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.190> get

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
ladder even if you're not going to get

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520 
ladder even if you're not going to get
very<00:01:26.370> high<00:01:26.730> up<00:01:26.760> it<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.080> job<00:01:28.320> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
very high up it so I got a job in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.410 
very high up it so I got a job in
regional<00:01:29.220> news<00:01:29.400> production<00:01:29.760> for<00:01:30.120> that<00:01:30.210> reason

regional news production for that reason

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.310 
regional news production for that reason
I<00:01:30.780> knew<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> wanted<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> end<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.610> working<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.320> as

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
I knew I wanted to end up working in as

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.930 
I knew I wanted to end up working in as
a<00:01:34.380> program<00:01:35.070> producer<00:01:35.550> hopefully<00:01:35.880> in

children's programs but as I say it was

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.800 
children's programs but as I say it was
very<00:01:38.430> difficult<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.910> know<00:01:39.000> how<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.330> actually

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
very difficult to know how to actually

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.310 
very difficult to know how to actually
get<00:01:40.050> there<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.470> am<00:01:41.190> I'm<00:01:42.120> from<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.780> small<00:01:42.930> town<00:01:43.080> in
