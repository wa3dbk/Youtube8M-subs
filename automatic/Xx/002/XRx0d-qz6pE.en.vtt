00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
is set the light first it's going to be

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.910 
is set the light first it's going to be
quite<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.110> moody<00:00:11.480> picture<00:00:12.559> everything<00:00:13.559> else

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
quite a moody picture everything else

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.920 
quite a moody picture everything else
can<00:00:14.429> be<00:00:15.170> painted<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.190> it's<00:00:17.400> as<00:00:17.820> though<00:00:18.240> you

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
can be painted in and it's as though you

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.400 
can be painted in and it's as though you
are<00:00:18.960> shining<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:21.170> spotlight<00:00:22.250> on<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.970> that

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
are shining a spotlight on to that

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.240 
are shining a spotlight on to that
painting<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.250> looks<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.699> bit<00:00:26.730> radical<00:00:28.250> but

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
painting so it looks a bit radical but

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.099 
painting so it looks a bit radical but
this<00:00:29.580> will<00:00:29.820> die<00:00:30.060> back<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.539> using<00:00:30.750> Payne's

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
this will die back I'm using Payne's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.770 
this will die back I'm using Payne's
grey<00:00:31.500> because<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.099> quite<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> staining

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
grey because it's quite a staining

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.770 
grey because it's quite a staining
colour<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.410> won't<00:00:34.860> start<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.780> shift

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
colour and it won't start to shift

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.660 
colour and it won't start to shift
around<00:00:37.020> underneath<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:40.649> washers<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> I'm

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
around underneath the washers that I'm

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.160 
around underneath the washers that I'm
going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> put<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.149> top<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.969> just

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
going to put on top of here so just

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.250 
going to put on top of here so just
gently<00:00:46.309> peeling<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.520> down<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.230> see

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
gently peeling that down so you can see

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.430 
gently peeling that down so you can see
that<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.949> looks<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:54.110> this<00:00:55.110> until<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.620> use

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
that it looks just like this until I use

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.820 
that it looks just like this until I use
some<00:00:58.440> cloud<00:00:58.770> down<00:00:59.160> here

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.560 

as<00:01:05.790> part<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.680> composition<00:01:08.210> just<00:01:09.210> using

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
as part of the composition just using

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.220 
as part of the composition just using
the<00:01:09.630> side<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> brush<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:11.070> this

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
the side of the brush there to get this

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.780 
the side of the brush there to get this
broken<00:01:13.230> effect<00:01:14.870> on<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:16.560> roof<00:01:17.010> paper<00:01:17.550> it's<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
broken effect on the roof paper it's a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.700 
broken effect on the roof paper it's a
roof<00:01:18.000> pipe<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.510> musing<00:01:19.020> because<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.440> want<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
roof pipe that musing because I want to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.170 
roof pipe that musing because I want to
get<00:01:19.950> quite<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> bit<00:01:20.940> of<00:01:21.800> texture<00:01:22.800> in<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.250> yeah

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
get quite a bit of texture in there yeah

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.680 
get quite a bit of texture in there yeah
I'm<00:01:24.300> just<00:01:24.450> ignoring<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.850> walls<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.390> time

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
I'm just ignoring the walls for the time

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.230 
I'm just ignoring the walls for the time
being<00:01:27.990> where<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> walls<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:29.240> because

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
being where the walls are because

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.610 
being where the walls are because
they're<00:01:30.980> quite<00:01:31.980> dark<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:33.240> spins<00:01:33.750> great<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
they're quite dark it spins great and

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.490 
they're quite dark it spins great and
some<00:01:35.070> lemon<00:01:35.640> yellow<00:01:36.060> therefore<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.780> green<00:01:37.320> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
some lemon yellow therefore the green of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.670 
some lemon yellow therefore the green of
the<00:01:37.530> grass<00:01:37.880> got<00:01:38.880> down<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:39.420> some<00:01:39.660> more<00:01:39.900> raw

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the grass got down here some more raw

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.719 
the grass got down here some more raw
Sienna<00:01:41.190> a<00:01:46.040> bit<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.250> red<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
Sienna a bit of red in there it's a

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.280 
Sienna a bit of red in there it's a
wintry<00:01:50.729> kind<00:01:51.150> of<00:01:51.300> thing<00:01:51.510> it's<00:01:51.690> not<00:01:51.900> standard

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
wintry kind of thing it's not standard

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.920 
wintry kind of thing it's not standard
level<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:52.979> quite<00:01:53.250> strong<00:01:53.850> against<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
level really quite strong against the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.520 
level really quite strong against the
sky<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.610> roof<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:58.200> all

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
sky there so this roof here it's all

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.100 
sky there so this roof here it's all
been<00:01:58.950> planned<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.479> doesn't<00:02:00.660> just<00:02:00.900> happen

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
been planned it's it doesn't just happen

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.570 
been planned it's it doesn't just happen
to<00:02:01.410> be<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.860> dark<00:02:02.640> roof<00:02:03.000> against<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.869> cloud<00:02:04.200> of

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
to be a dark roof against that cloud of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.190 
to be a dark roof against that cloud of
deliberately<00:02:05.580> placed<00:02:06.330> an<00:02:06.600> adjacent<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.170> each

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
deliberately placed an adjacent to each

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.320 
deliberately placed an adjacent to each
other<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.740> we've<00:02:07.890> got<00:02:08.100> dark<00:02:08.700> against<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
other so we've got dark against the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.960 
other so we've got dark against the
light<00:02:09.540> it's<00:02:09.989> all<00:02:10.260> standing<00:02:11.010> out<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.370> terms<00:02:11.730> of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
light it's all standing out in terms of

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:39.890 
light it's all standing out in terms of
two

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:54.160 

you

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.230 

you
