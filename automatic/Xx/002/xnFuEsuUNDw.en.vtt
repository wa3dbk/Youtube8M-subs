figuring out how to get to this

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.020 
figuring out how to get to this
instrument<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.100> know<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.820> my

instrument you know when do I have my

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.850 
instrument you know when do I have my
sticks<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.780> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.050> stuff<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.829> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
sticks and all that kind of stuff one of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.350 
sticks and all that kind of stuff one of
the<00:00:56.039> negative<00:00:56.460> things<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.760> comes<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the negative things that comes out of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
the negative things that comes out of
that<00:00:57.390> sometimes<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.160> musicians

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that sometimes is that we as musicians

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.330 
that sometimes is that we as musicians
don't<00:01:00.030> become<00:01:00.629> connected<00:01:01.230> enough<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
don't become connected enough to the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.490 
don't become connected enough to the
expressive<00:01:02.879> elements<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.930> some<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
expressive elements or some of the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.890 
expressive elements or some of the
elements<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.460> internalize<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
elements that we internalize about the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
elements that we internalize about the
music<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.439> singing<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> way<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
music and singing is really the way to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.660 
music and singing is really the way to
push<00:01:09.420> through<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.630> barrier<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.200> get

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
push through that barrier and get

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.310 
push through that barrier and get
immediately<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.299> those<00:01:12.510> aspects<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.229> music

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
immediately to to those aspects of music

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.530 
immediately to to those aspects of music
making<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.010> are<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.340> incredibly<00:01:14.970> important

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
making that are so incredibly important

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.020 
making that are so incredibly important
and<00:01:16.380> by<00:01:16.920> taking<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> sticks<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.909> your

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and by taking the sticks out of your

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
it you you learn a lot very quickly

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.719 
it you you learn a lot very quickly
about<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.100> important<00:01:26.610> about

about what you think is important about

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.109 
about what you think is important about
the<00:01:27.119> music<00:01:27.799> why<00:01:28.799> that's<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.220> great<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.729> chamber

other<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:53.070> develop<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.549> closer

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
other and you develop a closer

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.630 
other and you develop a closer
relationship<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:55.020> terms<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.399> think

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
relationship in terms of what you think

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.090 
relationship in terms of what you think
the<00:01:56.729> music<00:01:57.060> should<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.390> doing<00:01:57.810> by<00:01:58.710> going

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the music should be doing by going

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490 
the music should be doing by going
through<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.399> process<00:01:59.670> a<00:02:00.180> lot<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.020> times<00:02:01.259> when

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
through this process a lot of times when

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.929 
through this process a lot of times when
we're<00:02:01.619> talking<00:02:01.770> about<00:02:02.009> interpreting<00:02:02.610> music

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
we're talking about interpreting music

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.270 
we're talking about interpreting music

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
different options about ways you could

different options about ways you could
do<00:02:08.099> things<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.300> feel<00:02:09.450> comfortable<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
do things I think I feel comfortable I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.360 
do things I think I feel comfortable I

think we feel comfortable say
that<00:02:11.670> singing<00:02:12.180> will<00:02:12.690> never<00:02:13.080> ever<00:02:13.409> have<00:02:13.769> a

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
that singing will never ever have a

that singing will never ever have a
negative<00:02:14.370> effect<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:16.230> way<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.440> you

negative effect on the way that you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190 
negative effect on the way that you
develop<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> music<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.269> you're<00:02:18.540> working<00:02:18.930> on

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
develop the music that you're working on

develop the music that you're working on
it'll<00:02:19.709> only<00:02:19.920> help<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.580> will<00:02:20.610> only<00:02:20.819> be

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
it'll only help and it will only be

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.270 
it'll only help and it will only be
positive<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:22.260> almost<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.860> think<00:02:23.129> of<00:02:23.220> a

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
positive I can almost not think of a

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.220 
positive I can almost not think of a
situation<00:02:23.489> where<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.180> would<00:02:24.299> be<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.780> bad<00:02:25.200> thing

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
situation where it would be a bad thing

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.140 
situation where it would be a bad thing
to<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.769> or<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> waste<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.400> time<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:26.819> we<00:02:26.909> highly

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
to do or a waste of time so we highly

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.119 
to do or a waste of time so we highly
highly<00:02:27.299> recommend<00:02:28.049> it<00:02:28.200> well<00:02:28.709> we're<00:02:28.890> going<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
highly recommend it well we're going to

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.649 
highly recommend it well we're going to
demonstrate<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.970> first<00:02:30.180> few<00:02:30.450> letters

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
demonstrate just the first few letters

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.380 
demonstrate just the first few letters
of<00:02:31.110> 3rd<00:02:31.590> construction<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.730> show<00:02:32.909> you<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.120> little

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
of 3rd construction to show you a little

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.199 
of 3rd construction to show you a little
bit<00:02:33.629> about<00:02:33.989> our<00:02:34.799> process<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.610> working<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
bit about our process of working on the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.229 
bit about our process of working on the
piece<00:02:36.450> as<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.110> evolved<00:02:37.560> especially<00:02:38.239> with

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
piece as it evolved especially with

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.960 
piece as it evolved especially with
regard<00:02:39.629> to<00:02:40.099> memorizing<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.190> piece<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.819> this

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
regard to memorizing the piece so this

00:02:41.970 --> 00:04:13.400 
regard to memorizing the piece so this
is<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.390> first

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.699 

so<00:04:14.410> as<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:15.040> can<00:04:15.190> see<00:04:15.690> it's<00:04:16.690> also<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:17.049> lot<00:04:17.290> of<00:04:17.440> fun

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
so as you can see it's also a lot of fun

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.550 
so as you can see it's also a lot of fun
especially<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:19.180> think<00:04:19.480> all<00:04:19.660> of<00:04:19.720> us<00:04:19.989> would

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
especially I think all of us would

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.710 
especially I think all of us would
consider<00:04:20.709> ourselves<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.549> be<00:04:21.640> drummers<00:04:22.420> first

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
consider ourselves to be drummers first

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.280 
consider ourselves to be drummers first
and<00:04:23.130> vocalists<00:04:24.130> maybe<00:04:24.570> 50th<00:04:25.570> or<00:04:25.810> something

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
and vocalists maybe 50th or something

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.409 
and vocalists maybe 50th or something
it's<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:26.950> not<00:04:27.280> necessarily<00:04:27.910> something<00:04:28.090> that

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
it's it's not necessarily something that

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.030 
it's it's not necessarily something that
comes<00:04:28.660> naturally<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.290> all<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.650> us<00:04:29.800> as

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
comes naturally to all of us as

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.370 
comes naturally to all of us as
percussionist<00:04:30.790> but<00:04:31.419> it<00:04:31.630> connects<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.200> a

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
percussionist but it connects you to a

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.920 
percussionist but it connects you to a
different<00:04:32.710> side<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.280> music<00:04:33.940> making<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.480> it

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
different side of music making and it

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.150 
different side of music making and it
forces<00:04:35.560> you<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:36.180> confront<00:04:37.620> being<00:04:38.620> in<00:04:38.890> close

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
forces you to confront being in close

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.010 
forces you to confront being in close
contact<00:04:39.550> with<00:04:40.030> each<00:04:40.150> other<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.630> knowing<00:04:40.960> each

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
contact with each other and knowing each

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.350 
contact with each other and knowing each
other's<00:04:41.320> parts<00:04:41.650> really<00:04:41.919> well<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:42.370> hopefully

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
other's parts really well and hopefully

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.240 
other's parts really well and hopefully
you<00:04:43.660> guys<00:04:43.870> got<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.410> sense<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.919> fact<00:04:45.100> that

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
you guys got the sense of the fact that

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.090 
you guys got the sense of the fact that
because<00:04:45.610> we've<00:04:45.790> memorized<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.800> we<00:04:47.800> are<00:04:47.919> not

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
because we've memorized it we are not

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.890 
because we've memorized it we are not
just<00:04:48.400> thinking<00:04:48.760> about<00:04:48.880> what's<00:04:49.300> happening<00:04:49.780> in

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
just thinking about what's happening in

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.659 
just thinking about what's happening in
our<00:04:49.960> own<00:04:50.020> parts<00:04:50.440> in<00:04:50.590> our<00:04:50.680> own<00:04:50.830> heads<00:04:51.070> part<00:04:51.550> of

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
our own parts in our own heads part of

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.700 
our own parts in our own heads part of
our<00:04:51.790> version<00:04:52.660> of<00:04:52.780> learning<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.230> piece<00:04:53.470> is

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
our version of learning the piece is

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.130 
our version of learning the piece is
actually<00:04:54.370> about<00:04:54.669> how<00:04:55.240> we<00:04:55.300> interact<00:04:55.750> with<00:04:56.020> each

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
actually about how we interact with each

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.920 
actually about how we interact with each
other<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:56.710> my<00:04:57.340> third<00:04:57.820> measure<00:04:58.120> in<00:04:58.450> my<00:04:58.600> 9th

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
other and my third measure in my 9th

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.990 
other and my third measure in my 9th
measure<00:04:59.290> or<00:04:59.530> whatever<00:04:59.800> wouldn't<00:05:00.700> mean<00:05:00.820> the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
measure or whatever wouldn't mean the

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.490 
measure or whatever wouldn't mean the
same<00:05:01.210> thing<00:05:01.479> to<00:05:01.660> me<00:05:01.780> if<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:01.960> was<00:05:02.080> only<00:05:02.320> thinking

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
same thing to me if I was only thinking

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.800 
same thing to me if I was only thinking
about<00:05:02.710> my<00:05:03.040> line<00:05:03.280> as<00:05:03.580> they<00:05:04.120> do<00:05:04.180> when<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.660> know

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
about my line as they do when I know

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.659 
about my line as they do when I know
that<00:05:04.930> Eric's<00:05:05.470> coming<00:05:05.710> in<00:05:05.890> and<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.160> mean<00:05:06.490> that<00:05:06.640> I
