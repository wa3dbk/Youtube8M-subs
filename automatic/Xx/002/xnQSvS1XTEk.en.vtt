00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:03.850 
alright this is Zack lesson number 18 is

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.699 
alright this is Zack lesson number 18 is
Halloween<00:00:04.450> and<00:00:04.749> in<00:00:05.019> this<00:00:05.169> lesson<00:00:05.379> I'm<00:00:05.589> going

00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:05.709 
Halloween and in this lesson I'm going

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:07.380 
Halloween and in this lesson I'm going
to<00:00:05.769> go<00:00:05.830> over<00:00:05.859> the<00:00:06.189> most<00:00:06.490> the<00:00:06.759> basic<00:00:07.149> footwork

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.390 
to go over the most the basic footwork

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.440 
to go over the most the basic footwork
and<00:00:08.019> this<00:00:08.440> I<00:00:08.710> think<00:00:09.639> that<00:00:09.790> footwork<00:00:10.059> is<00:00:10.240> super

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
and this I think that footwork is super

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.150 
and this I think that footwork is super
important<00:00:10.900> and<00:00:10.990> the<00:00:11.049> reason<00:00:11.379> is<00:00:11.530> because<00:00:11.710> lots

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
important and the reason is because lots

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.530 
important and the reason is because lots
of<00:00:12.309> liquid<00:00:12.639> dancers<00:00:12.969> when<00:00:13.120> I<00:00:13.179> watch<00:00:13.360> them

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
of liquid dancers when I watch them

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.539 
of liquid dancers when I watch them
dance<00:00:13.719> they<00:00:14.169> will<00:00:14.320> stay<00:00:14.559> here<00:00:14.589> and<00:00:15.339> they

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
dance they will stay here and they

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.859 
dance they will stay here and they
really<00:00:15.849> won't<00:00:15.999> move<00:00:16.209> around

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
really won't move around

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.450 
really won't move around
they'll<00:00:17.109> just<00:00:17.289> be<00:00:17.350> in<00:00:17.529> this<00:00:17.619> like<00:00:17.859> box<00:00:18.160> area

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
they'll just be in this like box area

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.339 
they'll just be in this like box area
but<00:00:19.060> it's<00:00:19.180> so<00:00:19.390> much<00:00:19.570> better<00:00:19.720> when<00:00:19.960> you<00:00:20.080> can<00:00:20.230> go

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
but it's so much better when you can go

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.710 
but it's so much better when you can go
from<00:00:20.500> here<00:00:20.830> to<00:00:21.460> different<00:00:21.970> positions<00:00:22.449> you

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
from here to different positions you

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.900 
from here to different positions you
have<00:00:23.109> different<00:00:23.500> footwork<00:00:23.800> techniques<00:00:24.310> it

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
have different footwork techniques it

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.150 
have different footwork techniques it
actually<00:00:25.390> completely<00:00:26.050> changes<00:00:26.650> how<00:00:26.800> it<00:00:26.830> looks

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
actually completely changes how it looks

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.759 
actually completely changes how it looks
so<00:00:27.730> we're<00:00:28.240> going<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.689> go<00:00:28.779> over<00:00:28.810> really<00:00:29.320> basic

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
so we're going to go over really basic

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.369 
so we're going to go over really basic
ways<00:00:29.949> of<00:00:30.310> stepping<00:00:31.029> moving<00:00:31.449> forward<00:00:31.900> moving

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
ways of stepping moving forward moving

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.060 
ways of stepping moving forward moving
back<00:00:32.770> and<00:00:33.219> turning<00:00:33.790> 90<00:00:34.480> degrees<00:00:34.840> okay<00:00:35.649> so

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
back and turning 90 degrees okay so

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.100 
back and turning 90 degrees okay so
we're<00:00:36.160> going<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:36.309> start<00:00:36.610> out<00:00:36.820> with<00:00:37.090> just<00:00:37.899> a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110

this is what's doing it with the motion
it<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.400> makes<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:29.909> bit<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.180> flu<00:01:31.460> okay
