culture is the scientific name these
fish<00:00:54.180> should<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.449> kept<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> 20<00:00:55.140> gallon<00:00:55.289> or

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
fish should be kept in a 20 gallon or

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.099 
fish should be kept in a 20 gallon or
larger<00:00:56.059> some<00:00:57.059> people<00:00:57.270> say<00:00:57.420> 50<00:00:57.750> gallons<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
larger some people say 50 gallons a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.389 
larger some people say 50 gallons a
larger<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:58.890> they're<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> pair

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
larger but that's when they're in a pair

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.510 
larger but that's when they're in a pair
because<00:00:59.699> they'll<00:00:59.850> be<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.329> aggressive

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
because they'll be really aggressive

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.149 
because they'll be really aggressive
like<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> said<00:01:02.699> these<00:01:02.969> fish<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.329> peaceful<00:01:03.930> fish

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
like I said these fish are peaceful fish

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.899 
like I said these fish are peaceful fish
but<00:01:05.159> when<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:06.500> breed<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.670> eggs

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
but when they breed and they have eggs

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.440 
but when they breed and they have eggs
and<00:01:09.270> fry<00:01:09.510> these<00:01:09.570> guys<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:11.610> very<00:01:12.270> very

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and fry these guys are really very very

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
and fry these guys are really very very
aggressive<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:15.210> temperature<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
aggressive on the temperature in the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.120 
aggressive on the temperature in the
tank<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:18.119> should<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.750> 72<00:01:19.290> 282<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
tank they should be in is 72 282 so

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.310 
tank they should be in is 72 282 so
they're<00:01:20.280> pretty<00:01:20.520> tolerable<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.299> most<00:01:22.110> fish

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
they're pretty tolerable but most fish

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.260 
they're pretty tolerable but most fish
around<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:22.979> 72<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> 82<00:01:23.880> degrees<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.979> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
around that are 72 to 82 degrees to the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.240 
around that are 72 to 82 degrees to the
KH<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.750> don't<00:01:27.900> really<00:01:28.020> test<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.100> it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
KH I don't really test this but it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.850 
KH I don't really test this but it

fish<00:02:47.110> you're<00:02:47.470> going<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.709> need<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.830> cave<00:02:48.790> or

fish you're going to need a cave or
something<00:02:49.890> like<00:02:50.890> this<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.720> little

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
something like this this is a little

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.530 
something like this this is a little
cave<00:02:54.069> that<00:02:54.400> they<00:02:54.550> can<00:02:54.700> go<00:02:54.819> in<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.090> out<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.239> its

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
cave that they can go in and out of its

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.199 
cave that they can go in and out of its
pretty<00:02:55.810> big<00:02:55.989> for<00:02:56.170> both<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.410> them<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.590> fit<00:02:56.769> in<00:02:56.950> a

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
pretty big for both of them to fit in a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.830 
pretty big for both of them to fit in a
lot<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.269> people<00:02:58.600> have<00:02:58.959> used<00:02:59.170> coconut<00:02:59.560> shells

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
lot of people have used coconut shells

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.170 
lot of people have used coconut shells
which<00:03:01.840> are<00:03:02.110> also<00:03:02.319> good<00:03:02.709> they're<00:03:03.310> not<00:03:03.910> going<00:03:04.090> to

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
which are also good they're not going to

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.030 
which are also good they're not going to
breed<00:03:04.420> most<00:03:04.660> likely<00:03:05.050> unless<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.590> have<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.739> cave

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
breed most likely unless you have a cave

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.750 
breed most likely unless you have a cave
or<00:03:06.840> also<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.200> use<00:03:08.230> pots<00:03:08.830> like<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.519> I

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
or also you can use pots like this I

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.090 
or also you can use pots like this I
have<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.910> little<00:03:10.140> cave<00:03:11.140> right<00:03:11.410> here<00:03:11.709> out<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:11.950> a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
have a little cave right here out of a

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.060 
have a little cave right here out of a
terracotta<00:03:12.430> pot<00:03:14.519> that's<00:03:15.519> pretty<00:03:15.850> small<00:03:16.209> um

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
terracotta pot that's pretty small um

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.310 
terracotta pot that's pretty small um
the<00:03:18.070> diet<00:03:18.880> for<00:03:19.209> these<00:03:19.329> fish<00:03:19.540> should<00:03:19.870> be<00:03:20.079> a

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
the diet for these fish should be a

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.910 
the diet for these fish should be a
really<00:03:20.620> meaty<00:03:21.100> food<00:03:22.019> but<00:03:23.019> more<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.680> the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
really meaty food but more of the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.069 
really meaty food but more of the
vegetable<00:03:24.519> algae<00:03:25.030> side<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:25.810> all<00:03:26.500> those<00:03:27.310> good

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
vegetable algae side so all those good

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.370 
vegetable algae side so all those good
algae<00:03:29.079> veggie<00:03:29.920> foods<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.549> have<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.790> lot<00:03:31.030> of

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
algae veggie foods that have a lot of

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.979 
algae veggie foods that have a lot of
like<00:03:32.380> spirulina<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.430> stuff<00:03:33.820> so<00:03:34.150> those<00:03:34.720> fish

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
like spirulina and stuff so those fish

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.270 
like spirulina and stuff so those fish
are<00:03:35.110> omnivores<00:03:37.590> breedings<00:03:38.590> relatively<00:03:39.160> easy

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
are omnivores breedings relatively easy

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.030 
are omnivores breedings relatively easy
you<00:03:39.519> just<00:03:39.549> need<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.880> cave<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:41.079> male<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:41.980> a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
you just need a cave and a male and a

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.340 
you just need a cave and a male and a
female<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.720> maybe<00:03:43.720> some<00:03:43.959> live<00:03:44.140> plants<00:03:46.350> one

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
female and maybe some live plants one

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.110 
female and maybe some live plants one
thing<00:03:47.620> when<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.280> need<00:03:48.549> to<00:03:48.640> know<00:03:48.820> when<00:03:49.000> you're

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
thing when you need to know when you're

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.000 
thing when you need to know when you're
breeding<00:03:49.299> is<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.310> pH<00:03:51.730> will<00:03:53.940> make<00:03:54.940> it

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
breeding is that the pH will make it

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.090 
breeding is that the pH will make it
okay<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:57.510> alkaline<00:03:58.620> predominantly<00:03:59.620> all<00:03:59.859> the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
okay so alkaline predominantly all the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.150 
okay so alkaline predominantly all the
fry<00:04:00.340> are<00:04:00.549> going<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.730> turn<00:04:00.850> into<00:04:00.970> males<00:04:01.239> and

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
fry are going to turn into males and

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.280 
fry are going to turn into males and
asks<00:04:03.160> acidic<00:04:03.790> water<00:04:04.660> they're<00:04:04.930> all<00:04:05.079> going<00:04:05.200> to

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
asks acidic water they're all going to

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.190 
asks acidic water they're all going to
be<00:04:05.350> females<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.190> think<00:04:06.370> it's<00:04:06.489> 7.2<00:04:07.209> which<00:04:08.019> is

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
be females and I think it's 7.2 which is

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.500 
be females and I think it's 7.2 which is
when<00:04:08.350> they're<00:04:08.530> both<00:04:08.739> male<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.250> female<00:04:09.940> spread

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
when they're both male and female spread

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.050 
when they're both male and female spread
up<00:04:10.690> so<00:04:11.620> these<00:04:11.769> fish<00:04:12.040> are<00:04:12.630> born<00:04:14.519> or<00:04:15.519> altered

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
up so these fish are born or altered

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.089 
up so these fish are born or altered
their<00:04:16.419> sex<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:16.810> altered<00:04:17.169> by<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.289> pH<00:04:17.709> which

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
their sex is altered by the pH which

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.250 
their sex is altered by the pH which
they're<00:04:18.519> born<00:04:18.849> in

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
they're born in

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.860 
they're born in
so<00:04:20.590> yeah<00:04:21.070> guys<00:04:24.300> now<00:04:25.300> we're<00:04:25.510> just<00:04:25.540> going<00:04:25.720> to
