00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello everyone, now I 'm going to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.669
 teach how to make a cookie shampoo 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.999
 let's use water nails and slits 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:14.999
 cinnamon and what they are going to do now is go 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:17.480
 to put your water to boil on the stove 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:20.190
 that is well boiled and they will put 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.380
 pieces of piloncillo for 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.380
 add a little sugar in your 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.700
 blender will add cookies marias 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.510
 and we are going to add one package at a time 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.660
 your cookies are going to be added and then 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.400
 we are going to use this evaporated milk in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.100
 our case then we are using 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.400
 butcher 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:50.210
 and we're going to add the whole can to the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.210
 blender and since you have all your milk 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.090
 together with the cookies you're going to 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.090
 liquefy 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.530
 until they are well mixed 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.659
 since you have your cookies and milk 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.880
 mixed by the in a pan to go what 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.880
 we are separating 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.630
 this procedure a few times 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.870
 until you have the desired amount 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.100
 as you will see here we are already filling the 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.500
 pan so we're just going to go it 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.900
 doing now what we are going to put 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.030
 let's put more cookies we're going to 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.979
 add a few teaspoons of 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.660
 cocoa and stir it together with milk and 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.490
 this is to add the flavor to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.430
 chocolate so depending on what 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.649
 so much chocolate you want too we are going to 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.720
 use this granny chocolate we're going to 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.840
 break into pieces and then we're going to 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.840
 put in the blender with a little bit of 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:02.990
 milk this is so that it does not take so long 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 to be done and be better diluted so 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.429
 just put on chocolate add the milk and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.790
 start to beat 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.730
 until you have this consistency now 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.900
 beat the water mixture the nails and the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.299
 cinnamon and strain it to remove all 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.189
 the impurities that cinnamon brings and 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.370
 nails 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.889
 and you can do this twice for 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.510
 make sure you do not have anything left 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:32.939
 you'll see here was a bit of 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.329
 piloncillo just throws the water again and 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:40.300
 Sneak it again as it is your mix 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:42.850
 pour the chocolate 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.210
 in the mix so that it starts 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.940
 incorporate the flavor and start to beat 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.150
 from the moment from this moment to 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.600
 that does not stick to your pot and is not 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.370
 smoked 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.800
 and add the mix you made of 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.000
 chocolates and milk we use a gallon 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.430
 whole milk and about two cans 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.740
 of milk carnation but everything is 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.490
 depending on your 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.090
 and that you like it so just continue 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.660
 beating the mixture 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.879
 until it is ready and this is how 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.920
 You made a cookie cut 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.980
