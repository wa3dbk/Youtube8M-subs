00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.230
 ah 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.080
 hello good morning my name is antonio 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.040
 I'm 27 years old and I'm a computer 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.420
 I am currently in search 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.550
 active employment since I have been without 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.720
 work about a year we have come to 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.220
 your facebook to give us your 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.870
 tips on group interviews 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.240
 since several companies in what we 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.830
 they're asking good guys let's see 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.330
 what are the dynamics of the 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.340
 group is worth they are asking now 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.660
 many companies because they are processes of 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.660
 selection in which the active one is very 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.520
 fast and the only thing they are looking for is how 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.920
 we interact with the rest of our classmates 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.510
 What role we assumed within within 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.980
 a group because then that's what it 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.890
 will reflect in our work as 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.300
 professionals if you are more talkative 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.699
 you have better capabilities 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.070
 communication if you are more introverted or 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.559
 if you have the leader's role normally 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.110
 last 30 or 45 minutes and what is exposed 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.230
 it's an invented case without an answer 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.340
 concrete or real and then the only thing that 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.350
 you have to defend is the position that 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.180
 we think advises us is that 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.430
 we have to wake up over the rest 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.620
 Well, the truth is that the role that 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.080
 ask within group dynamics 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.700
 is a role that is conciliatory as it is not 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.829
 the same explain a group dynamics 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.400
 to participate in it I invited a 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.200
 person 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.000
 human courses of the base group is called 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.680
 Raquel was going to do a group dynamic 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.990
 real with you to value our 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.960
 Profiles 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.180
 hello good guys wanting days 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.009
 start the group interview yes good 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.540
 come on let's go for it we're going to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.060
 do as if you were in a shelter 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.710
 nuclear agreement you only stay 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.630
 a few in the world and you 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.729
 you have to locate the enclosure two 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.920
 triad characters worth to see how 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.720
 we managed to repopulate the world according 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.100
 there you have to debate a bit between 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.000
 you 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.000
 with friends 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.240
 there are two roles that have been a little 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.409
 leaders and have not listened to the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.900
 rest opinion 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.880
 you are antonio and hector is worth what there is 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.590
 what to try is always to give the opinion 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.910
 that each one has respecting that of the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.300
 others and you have imposed a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.790
 little bit your way of seeing it in your 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.760
 case laura has had a role a little bit 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.070
 more than shy more introverted then 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.290
 What I advise you is to procures in 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.600
 the next dynamics explain more 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.060
 point of view and that you look for a gap and 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.500
 in the case of Robert and Danny to the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.060
 true that you have had a very 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.760
 good in the group because you have 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.070
 been empaths you have listened to the rest 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.019
 you have contributed your ideas and good 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.640
 It is the most important thing you hear 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.130
 to others if you do not usually put yours 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.110
 opinion therefore also very well and 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.160
 already taking note along with alice to 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.870
 as you were doing the 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.950
 group interview totally agree 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.360
 with what she is a bit has been 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.370
 transmitted from attitudes that who a 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.200
 little improve I think they have all been 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.420
 positive remember that here there is no 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.500
 good postures or bad postures about 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.300
 everything is important that we are three 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.670
 you are natural as you are 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.880
 of agreement and so logically it will be all 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.100
 much more fluid and more 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.080
 of course 6 all invited to spend 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.670
 for the group offices you will be able to 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.530
 meet colleagues who go through this 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.800
 kind of agreement processes and that already 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.800
 they are working 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.950
 Hello welcome 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.390
 alvaro, I have to make a 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.310
 group interview and I need your 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.470
 tips I'm a little nervous I have 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.320
 given a series of tips but I need 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.060
 something footprint because obviously you do not 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.040
 truth is that when I came to do the 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.290
 dynamic I got a little nervous but 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.910
 at the end you do not wait for each one 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.500
 tell your point of view there are people who 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.810
 will always try to step on you to pass 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.760
 above you but I wait for my 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.820
 moment and I think in the end it worked 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.620
 many Alvaro authorities now I am 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.310
 prepared to face a 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.310
 group interview
