00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.099
 rapid exploitation in the star wars look 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.050
 was there a new war of the stars? 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.450
 space game without anyone 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.519
 By no means what we have heard here 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.650
 play is the space mode of the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.510
 online roleplaying star wars the old 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.270
 republic already full of gray 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.710
 dashing railshooter mission thinks of 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.810
 can this shock finally 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.210
 overcome because the developer bioware 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.849
 has just in time for the second birthday of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.980
 dior republic a brand new in space 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.320
 Mode called galactic starfighter 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.910
 tinkered instead of the well-known 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.800
 player ship we fight in the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.079
 battles with special space hunters 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.540
 already from character level 1 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.879
 between them lasers albums through the vacuum 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.649
 and magnificent explosions sweeten us 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.899
 every shot we have in the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.090
 cockpits and crashed into the laser thunderstorm 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.710
 and besides what explores in the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.449
 old republic during the last months 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.449
 else has done so 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.530
 in galactic starfighter we have the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.719
 choice between three spaceship types here 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.790
 we see the scout is making me funny 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.530
 that's just a quick manoeuver 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.450
 enlightener with whom we are here too 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.310
 start of the game as rushed by wukies 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.500
 go ahead and one in three 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.360
 Conquer valuable capture points 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.220
 All we have to do is defeat them 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.740
 keep away and for a while around it 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.750
 fly when the satellite is green 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.150
 belonged to us as long as we got the point 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.520
 The team gives the victory points 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.380
 first collects 1000 but wins with 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.659
 It is not enough to conquer alone 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.490
 the enemy does not sleep and soon 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.259
 are the first enemy scouts dar 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.030
 to win the victory point again 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.159
 They should only try to take away 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.380
 our scout has severe heat 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.899
 torpedoes and fast fire laser 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.409
 the short process with the opponents here 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.930
 do 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.000
 even better in space fight is the fat 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.740
 Hunting bomber to hot galactic 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.899
 starfighter the all-rounder for the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.610
 heavily armed and unfortunately a bit sluggish 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.290
 are here but save us 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.780
 leisurely control and we scratch 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.860
 narrowly on this throw over high 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.630
 that was close 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.880
 our bomber here is fat 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.980
 ion cannons quad readers and sponge 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.870
 rockets equipped with jews 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.729
 cannons we have the ship in front of us 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.410
 back shields blown away now 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.450
 we keep the unprotected trunk with 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.660
 the mighty quad laser until the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.460
 adversary ransacks hit bombers 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.500
 also keep a lot off and have 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.210
 thick shields and if we are from the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.460
 be pursued enemy rocket 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.820
 we simply turn with special skill 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.620
 180 degrees what distracts the floor of the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.120
 opponent is also surprised 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.670
 and we would give him a few with the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.260
 readers read what our co pilot also 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.830
 enthusiastically commented on the insidious 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.050
 Combat ship is a real one 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.060
 play spoilers instead of bravely in the 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.920
 it lurks like a dog to fall 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.080
 last call of duty sniper am 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.510
 the edge of the field and targets enemies 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.580
 his fat railgun with it the fat 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.440
 need but also really rankles shootas 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.930
 we push it by pressing fire button 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.430
 charge and since the enemies meanwhile not 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.440
 stand still and the cannon in now 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.090
 limited fire angle has it 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.630
 damn hard with the part too 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.840
 to meet 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.180
 look ma times to already over 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.220
 but when we meet something is the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.930
 damage big and thanks to plasma charge 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.650
 we even cause a harm over 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.150
 time effect bull be after the battle 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.860
 allowed to hangar at our ship 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.170
 admire and run to your heart's content 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.000
 so rumschrauben fairly to every part 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.950
 our machine can be exchanged 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.260
 primary weapons secondary weapons shields 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.060
 drive reactor just all that 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.250
 Selection is huge and every component 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.320
 can be aufgemotzt again 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.000
 but not only the hardware counts 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.390
 the types in the ships play one 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.739
 role 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.870
 For example, we have this 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.480
 gnarled kitten kneels offensive 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.640
 officer and co-pilot promoted for it 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.590
 Donate us never pull ammo and 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.750
 a fighting skill if we, on the other hand 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.640
 These eager servants serve truiden 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.290
 we can take ours instead 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.769
 Repair the ship in the fight 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.810
 who route laser beams to mainstream 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.600
 in addition, can still be found in the 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.640
 cosmetics menu romp with black red 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.100
 oranges and lasers we meet though 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.540
 also not better but it has purpose 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.430
 can still the whole ship new 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.620
 but it costs to paint 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.620
 Schnickschnack more expensive 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.420
 real money but galactic starfighter was 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.670
 not the only update for the old 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.040
 republic since april he put neat 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.229
 content for example here newer 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.609
 flashpoint where we are against the corrupt 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.440
 Group boss fight 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.940
 By the way, he has the stupidest critters 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.500
 The galaxy bred itself 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.130
 killing each other as far as they are concerned 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.470
 touch 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.340
 no wonder the checker group 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.740
 went broke 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.810
 without his dum dum india, the boss has 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.430
 but nothing more even in the hard 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.290
 fashion creates each team the new 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.139
 flashpoints without much effort 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.660
 actually a pity is a lot harder 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.970
 already the gloomy planet oikon the 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.810
 the worst world in the whole star wars 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.580
 universe 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.620
 that is because here the whole 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.020
 hiding very nasty fright master 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.520
 have these renegade sith lords 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.889
 years since the ground game 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.970
 and here is the frightful war 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.979
 also his end 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.260
 oracle looks like the little brother 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.900
 from mordor and everywhere lurking hard 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.789
 Opponents like these dredd hosts became the ones 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.850
 in the german version by the way as 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.130
 fearfully translated to the east meal 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.260
 during the attack on oregon was 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.419
 a republican operational fleet 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.280
 decomposed therefore lie everywhere here 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.229
 fracks and rescue capsules rum 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.669
 after we have done all the opponents 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.750
 let's search in the capsules 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.750
 surviving soldiers 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.250
 Bioware has been under the line for the last few years 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.919
 months done the whole job and the 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.750
 old republic steadily expanded the new ones 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.639
 content is convincing in the first place 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.470
 successful galactic starfighter 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.789
 However, the developers should the 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.440
 battles better in the 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.330
 embedding character development 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.560
 There is money and experience, in fact 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.300
 no rewards 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.220
 unfortunately we do not do anything for ours 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.889
 hero himself or his player ship 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.650
 free or so bio should be who 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.539
 update tempo hold galactic starfighter 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.160
 continue to expand and finally the 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.050
 classes stories of the characters 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.940
 continue then should our 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.070
 Bounty hunter here too 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.199
 have enough to do after done 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.250
 work gear named part in shabby 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.250
 dance bars
