 impressed with how they have it

 have the proper care 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.360
 waiting for the law at some point 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.310
 be revoked and continue with the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.100
 shows that started life 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.170
 of the circus they claim they now have a 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.210
 50 percent of the public they had 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.729
 previously with the presentation of 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.970
 functions with animals because we follow 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.679
 defending us from this law looking for the 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.409
 lawyers are trying to get a 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.659
 amparo before the supreme court of justice 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.599
 so that they separate after this law that is

 circus and that lacks generality 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.299
 that they must have up laws while 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.490
 that legal options are sought for 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.110
