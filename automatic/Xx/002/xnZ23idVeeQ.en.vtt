is really built to last nothing comes

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.959 
is really built to last nothing comes
off<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.719> nuts<00:00:37.039> I<00:00:38.039> really<00:00:38.699> I<00:00:38.730> was<00:00:38.940> really

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
off of it nuts I really I was really

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.969 
off of it nuts I really I was really
surprised<00:00:39.569> by<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.109> that<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> grips<00:00:40.710> didn't

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:40.979 
surprised by that that the grips didn't

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:43.430 
surprised by that that the grips didn't
you<00:00:41.039> come<00:00:41.309> off<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.839> there's<00:00:42.839> not<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.109> brake

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
you come off that there's not a brake

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.700 
you come off that there's not a brake
cable<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.039> this<00:00:44.249> or<00:00:44.489> anything<00:00:44.729> to<00:00:45.690> take<00:00:46.469> off

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
cable on this or anything to take off

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
cable on this or anything to take off
which<00:00:47.429> is<00:00:47.609> probably<00:00:48.329> why<00:00:49.280> they<00:00:50.280> didn't<00:00:51.149> put<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
which is probably why they didn't put a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.360 
which is probably why they didn't put a
brake<00:00:52.139> on<00:00:52.319> there<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:52.679> the<00:00:52.859> grips<00:00:53.069> don't

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
brake on there because the grips don't

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430 
brake on there because the grips don't
come<00:00:53.519> off<00:00:53.670> if<00:00:54.479> you<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.749> to<00:00:54.809> take<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.079> off<00:00:55.229> or

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
come off if you want to take it off or

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.509 
come off if you want to take it off or

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
about buying one and then decided not to

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.970 
about buying one and then decided not to
because<00:02:29.450> it's<00:02:29.629> ten<00:02:29.840> dollars<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:30.769> it's<00:02:30.890> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
because it's ten dollars and it's a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.500 
because it's ten dollars and it's a
little<00:02:31.189> more<00:02:31.370> than<00:02:31.670> your<00:02:31.819> regular<00:02:32.000> priced

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510

if<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:58.939> bike<00:02:59.150> here<00:02:59.359> would<00:02:59.510> be<00:02:59.629> five<00:02:59.900> or<00:03:00.049> six

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
if this bike here would be five or six

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.839 
if this bike here would be five or six
ounces<00:03:00.590> heavier<00:03:00.769> than<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.340> other<00:03:01.579> bike

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
ounces heavier than that other bike

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
have the sad thing about this bike is

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.429 
have the sad thing about this bike is
you<00:03:09.379> can't<00:03:09.590> put<00:03:10.010> pegs<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.439> really

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
you can't put pegs on it so I really

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.440 
you can't put pegs on it so I really
like<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.829> really<00:03:13.370> think<00:03:13.549> this<00:03:13.669> bike<00:03:13.939> is<00:03:14.209> neat

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
like I really think this bike is neat

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.440 
like I really think this bike is neat
and<00:03:14.659> I<00:03:15.139> wanted<00:03:15.409> to<00:03:15.500> put<00:03:15.650> pegs<00:03:15.859> on<00:03:16.099> it<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.459> then

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
and I wanted to put pegs on it and then

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.659 
and I wanted to put pegs on it and then
I<00:03:17.480> realized<00:03:18.169> that<00:03:18.409> there<00:03:19.069> wasn't<00:03:19.340> anything<00:03:19.519> to

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
I realized that there wasn't anything to

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.879 
I realized that there wasn't anything to
put<00:03:19.909> pegs<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:20.329> with<00:03:20.569> so<00:03:20.900> it's<00:03:21.650> kind<00:03:21.829> of

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
put pegs on with so it's kind of

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.180 
put pegs on with so it's kind of
disappointed<00:03:22.459> about<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:23.799> you<00:03:24.799> might<00:03:24.979> want

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
disappointed about that you might want

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.979 
disappointed about that you might want
to<00:03:25.370> go<00:03:25.519> up<00:03:25.669> if<00:03:25.849> you<00:03:26.030> wanted<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.359> have<00:03:26.479> pays<00:03:26.780> on

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.000 
to go up if you wanted to have pays on
you<00:03:27.109> might<00:03:27.290> want<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.470> go<00:03:27.590> out<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.829> buy<00:03:27.979> one

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
buying one and then just decided not to

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.830 
buying one and then just decided not to
because<00:03:44.449> of<00:03:44.599> the<00:03:44.689> price<00:03:44.949> you<00:03:45.949> really<00:03:46.129> should
