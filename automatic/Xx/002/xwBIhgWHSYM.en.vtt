 information literacy people could 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.870
 generally oriented ineffective 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:12.889
 engaged in one of these first projects 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.590

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.780
 moment 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:28.750
 big bets do exactly electronic 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:32.660
 format and as part of this project we 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.030

 who became his deputy in this 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.320
 advice 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.949

 higher than ministers on the one hand with 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:13.789
 the other side is my hunger 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:17.960
 and in this sense it is quite logical 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:21.050
 but I think that work and activities 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.550
 Here is specifically this advice those tasks 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.430
