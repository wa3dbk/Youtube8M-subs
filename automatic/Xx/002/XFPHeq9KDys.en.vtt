00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
kill maybe a one shot kill if you get a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.639

head shot in your at close range you get
super<00:00:56.190> super<00:00:56.340> lucky<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> don't<00:00:58.050> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
super super lucky but you know I don't I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
super super lucky but you know I don't I
don't<00:00:58.230> know<00:00:58.410> too<00:00:58.469> many<00:00:58.710> people<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.100> can<00:00:59.219> aim

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
don't know too many people that can aim

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.310 
don't know too many people that can aim
for<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.699> head<00:00:59.820> every<00:01:00.270> single<00:01:00.300> time<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
for the head every single time and get a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.260 
for the head every single time and get a
head<00:01:01.500> shot<00:01:01.530> every<00:01:02.190> single<00:01:02.489> time<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.239> know

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
head shot every single time so you know

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.670 
head shot every single time so you know
you<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.660> pretty<00:01:03.840> lucky<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.350> do<00:01:04.500> that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you have to be pretty lucky to do that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.130 
you have to be pretty lucky to do that
so<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.519> really<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> 44<00:01:06.840> Magnum

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
so it's really just like a 44 Magnum

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.560 
so it's really just like a 44 Magnum
it's<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> normal<00:01:07.619> revolver<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.420> only

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it's like a normal revolver but the only

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.250 
it's like a normal revolver but the only
difference<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.340> primary<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> it's

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
difference is this is a primary so it's

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.590 
difference is this is a primary so it's
basically<00:01:13.530> worse<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.790> eyes<00:01:15.000> than<00:01:15.330> all<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
basically worse in my eyes than all the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.210 
basically worse in my eyes than all the
other<00:01:15.750> revolvers<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.320> pass<00:01:16.650> call<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.009> duty's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
other revolvers and pass call of duty's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.359 
other revolvers and pass call of duty's
because<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.150> isn't<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> primer<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.530> yeah

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
because it isn't a primer because yeah

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.370 
because it isn't a primer because yeah
because<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> secondary<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
because it's not a secondary and it is a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.109 
because it's not a secondary and it is a
primary<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.250> instead<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.610> using<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
primary so instead of using like a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.600 
primary so instead of using like a
sniper<00:01:24.570> rifle<00:01:24.810> earn<00:01:25.560> assault<00:01:26.040> rifle<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.520> know

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
sniper rifle earn assault rifle you know

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
sniper rifle earn assault rifle you know
this<00:01:26.850> has<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.540> only<00:01:27.720> gun<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.259> your

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this has to be like the only gun on your

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.350 
this has to be like the only gun on your
class<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.009> kind<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.729> fucks<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
class and that kind of fucks you in the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.880 
class and that kind of fucks you in the
ass<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.750> personally<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.500> think<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.829> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
ass so personally I don't think this is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.649 
ass so personally I don't think this is
really<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.220> gun<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.670> want<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.000> for

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
really a gun that you want to go for

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.600 
really a gun that you want to go for

idea<00:02:36.570> because<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:38.040> know<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.340> gun<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.970> m1<00:02:39.390> as

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
idea because you know this gun the m1 as

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.380 
idea because you know this gun the m1 as
a<00:02:39.660> primary<00:02:40.140> weapon<00:02:40.770> isn't<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.670> best<00:02:41.880> but<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
a primary weapon isn't the best but it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.720 
a primary weapon isn't the best but it
compared<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.050> secondary<00:02:43.680> weapons<00:02:44.130> this

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
compared to the secondary weapons this

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.780 
compared to the secondary weapons this
thing<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.660> God<00:02:46.140> gun<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.920> amazing

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
thing is a God gun it is amazing

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.010 
thing is a God gun it is amazing
compared<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.240> all<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.330> other<00:02:48.510> secondary

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
compared to all the other secondary

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.680 
compared to all the other secondary
weapons<00:02:49.350> like<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.890> pretty<00:02:50.160> much<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.460> RW<00:02:51.450> one

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
to rely on it's amazing to have your

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.890 
to rely on it's amazing to have your
secretary<00:03:29.820> but<00:03:30.030> like<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.240> said<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:30.510> just<00:03:30.600> can't

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
secretary but like I said it just can't

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.510 
secretary but like I said it just can't
hang<00:03:31.080> as<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.230> primer<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.830> is<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.950> lot<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.220> fun<00:03:32.400> to

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
hang as a primer it is a lot of fun to

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.070 
hang as a primer it is a lot of fun to
use<00:03:32.730> but<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:33.360> would<00:03:33.630> definitely<00:03:33.810> recommend

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
use but I would definitely recommend

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.690 
use but I would definitely recommend
putting<00:03:34.650> on<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:34.890> overkill<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.370> having<00:03:35.610> an

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700

ASM<00:03:36.120> one<00:03:36.300> or<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:37.320> better<00:03:37.800> gun<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.490> general

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
ASM one or just a better gun in general

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.970
