00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.230
 I 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.920
 Maybe around the time this crank is released 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.730

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.770
 The school name is 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.400
 Palm lure made in order to catch this kind of a shell fish 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.860
 Ugh gonna named beast hunter So in the sense Tteyuu impel the Beast 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.860

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.730
 It Yossha machine, which has been

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.100
 It came out 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.640

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.760

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:43.260
 I was able to go home again when I started out in town after hitting a little 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.820
 I was stuck both when coming up now, but I started back 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.120

 Use a certain system color 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.410
 I changed it to such a reaction system chart and repeated variously. 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:13.210
 But money maa little reverse 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.320
