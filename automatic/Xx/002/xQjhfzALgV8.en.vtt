welcome<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.319> lecture<00:00:01.530> online<00:00:01.770> and<00:00:02.100> now

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
welcome to a lecture online and now

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.619 
welcome to a lecture online and now
we're<00:00:02.340> starting<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.760> brand<00:00:03.000> new<00:00:03.090> chapter<00:00:03.360> in

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
we're starting a brand new chapter in

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.900 
we're starting a brand new chapter in
astronomy<00:00:03.990> chapter<00:00:04.650> seven<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.190> it's<00:00:05.670> about

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
astronomy chapter seven and it's about

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.550 
astronomy chapter seven and it's about
the<00:00:06.089> solar<00:00:06.359> system<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:06.870> we're<00:00:07.170> talking

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
the solar system that we're talking

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.589 
the solar system that we're talking
about<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.830> solar<00:00:08.069> system<00:00:08.519> in<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.880> unique<00:00:09.330> way

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
about the solar system in a unique way

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.240 
about the solar system in a unique way
we're<00:00:10.050> going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.349> do<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.679> what<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:10.889> call

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
we're going to do it in what we call

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.910 
we're going to do it in what we call
comparative<00:00:12.030> planetology<00:00:12.530> we're<00:00:13.530> going<00:00:13.799> to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
comparative planetology we're going to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.530 
comparative planetology we're going to
compare<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.400> different<00:00:14.910> planets<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.389> all

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
compare the different planets in all

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.300 
compare the different planets in all
kinds<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> different<00:00:16.350> ways<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.529> get<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> feel

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
kinds of different ways to get a feel

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.450 
kinds of different ways to get a feel
for<00:00:17.340> our<00:00:17.970> solar<00:00:18.600> system<00:00:19.020> now<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.740> course<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
for our solar system now of course the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.250 
for our solar system now of course the
basic<00:00:20.880> shape<00:00:21.119> or<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> basic<00:00:21.750> structure<00:00:22.230> of

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
basic shape or the basic structure of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.779 
basic shape or the basic structure of
our<00:00:22.380> solar<00:00:22.680> system<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.220> at<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> very<00:00:23.730> center

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
our solar system is at the very center

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.750 
our solar system is at the very center
we<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.660> Sun<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.650> Sun<00:00:25.890> contains<00:00:26.220> way

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
we have the Sun the Sun contains way

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.910 
we have the Sun the Sun contains way
more<00:00:27.060> than<00:00:27.240> 99%<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> mass<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
more than 99% of all the mass of the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.220 
more than 99% of all the mass of the
whole<00:00:29.039> solar<00:00:29.369> system<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.029> almost<00:00:30.750> all<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
whole solar system so almost all the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.780 
whole solar system so almost all the
masses<00:00:31.560> right<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.430> then<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.759> some

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
masses right here but then we have some

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.670 
masses right here but then we have some
very<00:00:32.969> interesting<00:00:33.360> things<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> rest<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
very interesting things in the rest of

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.709 
very interesting things in the rest of
the<00:00:34.770> solar<00:00:34.980> system<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.460> special<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.910> course<00:00:35.969> but

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the solar system a special of course but

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.750 
the solar system a special of course but
their<00:00:36.870> planet<00:00:37.290> where<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.469> live<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.610> have

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
their planet where we live but we have

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
their planet where we live but we have
of<00:00:38.910> course<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> four<00:00:39.750> terrestrial<00:00:40.410> planets

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
of course the four terrestrial planets

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.950 
of course the four terrestrial planets
then<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> asteroid<00:00:42.149> belt<00:00:42.420> then<00:00:42.870> we

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
then we have the asteroid belt then we

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.049 
then we have the asteroid belt then we
have<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> four<00:00:43.469> gas<00:00:43.770> planets<00:00:44.370> also<00:00:44.700> known<00:00:44.910> as

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
have the four gas planets also known as

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.840 
have the four gas planets also known as
the<00:00:45.210> jovian<00:00:45.719> planets<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.550> what

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the jovian planets and then we have what

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.910 
the jovian planets and then we have what
we<00:00:47.969> call<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> copper<00:00:48.780> belt<00:00:48.989> beyond<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.649> now

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
we call the copper belt beyond that now

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.310 
we call the copper belt beyond that now
we<00:00:49.980> used<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.579> pluto<00:00:51.149> as<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> nine

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
we used to have pluto as one of the nine

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.500 
we used to have pluto as one of the nine
planets<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.039> Pluto's<00:00:53.460> no<00:00:53.670> longer<00:00:53.969> considered

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
planets but Pluto's no longer considered

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.810 
planets but Pluto's no longer considered
a<00:00:54.690> planet<00:00:54.930> now<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:55.980> find<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.550> there's<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
a planet now we find that there's a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.760 
a planet now we find that there's a
whole<00:00:56.940> bunch<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.390> objects<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.079> Pluto<00:00:58.410> out

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
whole bunch of objects like Pluto out

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.849 
whole bunch of objects like Pluto out
there<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.670> call<00:00:59.879> them<00:01:00.090> trans-neptunian

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
there so we call them trans-neptunian

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.090 
there so we call them trans-neptunian
objects<00:01:01.859> objects<00:01:02.699> are<00:01:02.820> beyond<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.449> orbit<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
objects objects are beyond the orbit of

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.560 
objects objects are beyond the orbit of
neptune<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.309> course<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.700> realize<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.060> Pluto

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
neptune of course we realize that Pluto

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.000 
neptune of course we realize that Pluto
for<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:07.049> short<00:01:07.110> period<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.619> time

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
for a very short period of time

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670 
for a very short period of time
every<00:01:08.490> 248<00:01:09.240> years<00:01:09.540> comes<00:01:09.930> within<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> orbit

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
every 248 years comes within the orbit

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.340 
every 248 years comes within the orbit
of<00:01:11.010> Neptune<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:12.210> by<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.600> large<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
of Neptune but by and large the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
of Neptune but by and large the
trans-neptunian<00:01:13.920> objects<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.790> farther<00:01:15.210> away

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
trans-neptunian objects are farther away

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.899 
trans-neptunian objects are farther away
on<00:01:15.630> average<00:01:15.990> than<00:01:16.290> neptune<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.610> there's<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
on average than neptune and so there's a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:18.980 
on average than neptune and so there's a
bunch<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.210> those<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.630> call<00:01:18.810> them

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
bunch of those so we call them

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.870 
bunch of those so we call them
trans-neptunian<00:01:19.439> objects<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.369> also<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
trans-neptunian objects are also the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
trans-neptunian objects are also the
dwarf<00:01:21.210> planets<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:22.080> course<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.500> hoping<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
dwarf planets of course is hoping to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.010 
dwarf planets of course is hoping to
comets<00:01:23.369> out<00:01:23.460> there<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.759> well<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.630> Kuiper<00:01:24.869> belt

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
comets out there as well the Kuiper belt

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
comets out there as well the Kuiper belt
is<00:01:25.320> kinda<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> doughnut<00:01:26.340> shaped<00:01:26.670> ring

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
is kinda like a doughnut shaped ring

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.080 
is kinda like a doughnut shaped ring
around<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.380> inner<00:01:28.950> solar<00:01:29.430> system<00:01:29.579> that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
around the inner solar system that

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
around the inner solar system that
includes<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> planets<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> asteroid

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
includes the planets and the asteroid

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100 
includes the planets and the asteroid
belt<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> same<00:01:33.299> plane<00:01:33.750> called

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
belt and it's in the same plane called

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.350 
belt and it's in the same plane called
the<00:01:34.259> ecliptic<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.340> plane<00:01:35.670> that's<00:01:35.909> made<00:01:36.180> up

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the ecliptic the plane that's made up

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.120 
the ecliptic the plane that's made up
pretty<00:01:36.570> well<00:01:36.659> funded<00:01:37.290> from<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> orbits<00:01:38.009> of

terrestrial<00:03:22.560> planets<00:03:22.949> to<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.159> gas<00:03:23.310> planets

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
terrestrial planets to the gas planets

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.610 
terrestrial planets to the gas planets
and<00:03:24.090> then<00:03:24.540> we're<00:03:24.659> going<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.840> compare<00:03:25.169> all<00:03:25.409> the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
and then we're going to compare all the

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.039 
and then we're going to compare all the
planets<00:03:26.009> in<00:03:26.099> terms<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.549> size<00:03:26.909> this<00:03:27.689> is<00:03:27.900> from

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
planets in terms of size this is from

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.219 
planets in terms of size this is from
the<00:03:28.169> Sun<00:03:28.579> density<00:03:29.579> rotational<00:03:30.479> speed<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.049> so

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
the Sun density rotational speed and so

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.990 
the Sun density rotational speed and so
forth<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:32.430> we'll<00:03:32.549> look<00:03:32.609> at<00:03:32.729> all<00:03:32.819> those

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
forth and we'll look at all those

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.119 
forth and we'll look at all those
various<00:03:33.329> aspects<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:33.930> we<00:03:34.019> get<00:03:34.139> a<00:03:34.169> good<00:03:34.859> picture

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
various aspects so we get a good picture

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.249 
various aspects so we get a good picture
of<00:03:35.310> what<00:03:35.790> our<00:03:35.939> solar<00:03:36.209> system<00:03:36.599> is<00:03:36.750> about<00:03:36.870> in

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:37.259 
of what our solar system is about in

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.170 
of what our solar system is about in
comparison<00:03:38.189> to<00:03:38.310> one<00:03:38.459> another<00:03:38.759> and<00:03:38.970> then<00:03:39.060> of

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
comparison to one another and then of

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.369 
comparison to one another and then of
course<00:03:39.209> we're<00:03:39.659> going<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.900> go<00:03:40.019> into<00:03:40.169> more

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
course we're going to go into more

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.020 
course we're going to go into more
detail<00:03:40.799> about<00:03:40.829> talking<00:03:41.400> about<00:03:41.459> each<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.939> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
detail about talking about each of the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.059 
detail about talking about each of the
planets<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.659> asteroids<00:03:43.169> their<00:03:43.439> moons<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.889> so

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
planets the asteroids their moons and so

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.009 
planets the asteroids their moons and so
forth<00:03:44.400> but<00:03:44.909> we're<00:03:45.060> going<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.359> start<00:03:45.599> out<00:03:45.720> more

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
forth but we're going to start out more

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.020 
forth but we're going to start out more
in<00:03:46.139> general<00:03:46.500> terms<00:03:46.759> comparing<00:03:47.759> all<00:03:47.879> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
in general terms comparing all the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.360 
in general terms comparing all the
planets<00:03:48.479> in<00:03:48.599> various<00:03:48.959> aspects<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.919> get<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.069> feel

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
planets in various aspects to get a feel

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.099 
planets in various aspects to get a feel
of<00:03:50.400> what<00:03:50.639> our<00:03:50.669> solar<00:03:50.970> system<00:03:51.359> is<00:03:51.449> like<00:03:51.479> so

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
of what our solar system is like so

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.629 
of what our solar system is like so
we'll<00:03:52.560> start<00:03:52.799> with<00:03:52.889> this<00:03:53.129> this<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.549> the
