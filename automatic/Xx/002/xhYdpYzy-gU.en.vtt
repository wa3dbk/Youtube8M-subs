with a coat of my stabilizer give it a
good<00:00:37.780> even<00:00:38.739> coat<00:00:39.699> we're<00:00:40.149> going<00:00:40.269> to<00:00:40.329> let<00:00:40.570> it

soak in for 24 hour period if it drips
that's<00:00:43.750> just<00:00:44.050> fine<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:45.309> whole<00:00:45.519> idea<00:00:45.699> is<00:00:46.000> to

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
that's just fine the whole idea is to

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.869 
that's just fine the whole idea is to
let<00:00:46.629> this<00:00:46.840> soak<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:47.949> thoroughly<00:00:48.309> just<00:00:48.760> to

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
let this soak in thoroughly just to

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.579 
let this soak in thoroughly just to
prevent<00:00:49.210> any<00:00:49.420> rot<00:00:49.809> from<00:00:50.140> continuing<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.129> occur

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
prevent any rot from continuing to occur

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.319 
prevent any rot from continuing to occur
let<00:00:53.589> that<00:00:53.769> sit<00:00:54.129> up<00:00:54.250> for<00:00:54.489> a<00:00:54.550> good<00:00:54.699> 24<00:00:55.179> hour

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
let that sit up for a good 24 hour

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.380 
let that sit up for a good 24 hour
period<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:57.280> I<00:00:57.309> can<00:00:57.550> come<00:00:57.789> to<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:58.030> pre

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
period and then I can come to a pre

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.020 
period and then I can come to a pre
treated<00:00:58.780> area<00:00:59.109> over<00:00:59.410> here<00:00:59.440> of<00:00:59.949> damage<00:01:00.460> then

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
treated area over here of damage then

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.329 
treated area over here of damage then
I'm<00:01:01.149> going<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.390> use<00:01:01.600> my<00:01:01.809> two-part<00:01:02.320> epoxy<00:01:02.499> to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
I'm going to use my two-part epoxy to

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.810 
I'm going to use my two-part epoxy to
fill<00:01:03.640> I've<00:01:04.030> got<00:01:04.540> both<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:05.250> resin<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.430> a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
fill I've got both a resin and a

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.900 
fill I've got both a resin and a
hardener<00:01:07.510> material<00:01:08.230> I'm<00:01:08.920> going<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.340> mix<00:01:09.610> equal

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
hardener material I'm going to mix equal

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.650 
hardener material I'm going to mix equal
parts<00:01:10.210> resin<00:01:11.050> and<00:01:11.170> hardener<00:01:11.770> together<00:01:12.280> and

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
parts resin and hardener together and

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.080 
parts resin and hardener together and
it's<00:01:13.660> rather<00:01:13.930> putty<00:01:14.620> like<00:01:14.740> when<00:01:15.550> you<00:01:15.670> get<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.060> a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
it's rather putty like when you get to a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.810 
it's rather putty like when you get to a
uniform<00:01:16.720> color<00:01:16.990> then<00:01:17.440> you<00:01:17.470> know<00:01:17.740> you've<00:01:17.980> mixed

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
uniform color then you know you've mixed

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.550 
uniform color then you know you've mixed
it<00:01:19.030> in<00:01:19.150> pretty<00:01:19.450> thoroughly<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.140> you'll<00:01:20.440> be

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
it in pretty thoroughly and you'll be

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.640 
it in pretty thoroughly and you'll be
ready<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.860> apply<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.340> you've<00:01:22.000> got<00:01:22.180> about<00:01:22.650> 20-30

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
ready to apply it you've got about 20-30

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.530 
ready to apply it you've got about 20-30
minutes<00:01:23.920> before<00:01:24.460> it<00:01:24.550> begins<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:24.940> harden<00:01:25.240> so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
minutes before it begins to harden so

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.690 
minutes before it begins to harden so
you've<00:01:25.660> got<00:01:25.810> some<00:01:25.990> time<00:01:26.260> to<00:01:26.560> mix<00:01:27.430> it<00:01:27.610> up

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
you've got some time to mix it up

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.030 
you've got some time to mix it up
thoroughly<00:01:28.230> I've<00:01:29.230> used<00:01:29.650> this<00:01:29.860> particular

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
thoroughly I've used this particular

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.840 
thoroughly I've used this particular
material<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:31.090> fill<00:01:31.300> cracks<00:01:31.630> in<00:01:31.930> deck<00:01:32.440> posts

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
material to fill cracks in deck posts

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.760 
material to fill cracks in deck posts
hardens<00:01:33.850> up<00:01:34.000> great<00:01:34.360> you<00:01:34.960> can<00:01:35.170> then<00:01:35.350> go<00:01:35.560> over

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
hardens up great you can then go over

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.530 
hardens up great you can then go over
and<00:01:36.130> sand<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.210> stain<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:40.000> now<00:01:40.480> you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
and sand it and stain it here now you

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.690 
and sand it and stain it here now you
could<00:01:40.930> use<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.170> putty<00:01:41.500> knife<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:42.010> further<00:01:42.400> shape

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
could use a putty knife to further shape

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.320 
could use a putty knife to further shape
it<00:01:42.970> this<00:01:43.570> particular<00:01:44.260> damage<00:01:44.770> here<00:01:45.150> seems<00:01:46.150> to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
it this particular damage here seems to

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.420 
it this particular damage here seems to
work<00:01:46.510> just<00:01:46.540> fine<00:01:47.110> by<00:01:47.590> working<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.160> in<00:01:48.280> with

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
work just fine by working it in with

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.300 
work just fine by working it in with
your<00:01:48.580> fingers<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:50.020> may<00:01:50.440> not<00:01:50.620> need<00:01:50.830> all<00:01:50.890> of<00:01:51.070> the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
your fingers you may not need all of the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.610 
your fingers you may not need all of the
material<00:01:52.210> that<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.480> grabbed<00:01:52.810> initially<00:01:53.440> and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
that's fine so just loosely form it into

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.590 
that's fine so just loosely form it into
the<00:01:57.010> shape<00:01:57.100> don't<00:01:57.670> worry<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.180> you're<00:01:58.360> not
