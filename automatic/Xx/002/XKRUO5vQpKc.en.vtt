00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.499 
hair is my lens I would highly recommend
to<00:02:08.170> get<00:02:08.380> them<00:02:08.560> cut<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.429> blended<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:10.330> the

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
to get them cut and blended in the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.600 
to get them cut and blended in the
reason<00:02:10.810> for<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.019> is<00:02:11.230> because<00:02:11.370> they<00:02:12.370> were

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
reason for that is because they were

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.870 
reason for that is because they were
look<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:15.040> they<00:02:15.459> won't<00:02:15.549> look<00:02:15.820> that

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
look that like they won't look that

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.000 
look that like they won't look that
natural<00:02:16.600> because<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.320> reason<00:02:17.650> being<00:02:17.799> is<00:02:17.980> that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
natural because the reason being is that

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.280 
natural because the reason being is that
they're<00:02:18.310> super<00:02:18.640> thick<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.690> how<00:02:19.900> did<00:02:19.959> these

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
they're super thick so how did these

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.069 
they're super thick so how did these
lights<00:02:20.590> thinned<00:02:21.100> out<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.670> tad<00:02:22.420> bit<00:02:22.750> not<00:02:23.049> too

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
lights thinned out a tad bit not too

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.530 
lights thinned out a tad bit not too
drastically<00:02:23.950> but<00:02:24.370> had<00:02:25.170> hadn't<00:02:26.170> hit<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.440> thin

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
drastically but had hadn't hit a thin

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.670 
drastically but had hadn't hit a thin
had<00:02:28.540> them<00:02:28.720> thinned<00:02:28.989> out<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.500> they<00:02:29.620> were

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
had them thinned out so they were

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.310 
had them thinned out so they were
blending<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.400> lot<00:02:30.640> more<00:02:30.820> better<00:02:31.320> absolutely

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
blending a lot more better absolutely

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.740 
blending a lot more better absolutely
over<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.280> moon<00:02:33.370> with<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.760> result<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.360> do<00:02:34.480> like

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
over the moon with the result I do like

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.479 
over the moon with the result I do like
it<00:02:34.959> i<00:02:35.019> think<00:02:35.079> they<00:02:35.320> blend<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.950> lot<00:02:36.280> more

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
it i think they blend in a lot more

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.580 
it i think they blend in a lot more
better<00:02:36.640> now<00:02:36.970> as<00:02:37.150> are<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.510> color<00:02:37.780> has<00:02:38.079> come<00:02:38.410> out
