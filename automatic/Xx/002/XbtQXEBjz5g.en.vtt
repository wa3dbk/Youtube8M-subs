00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
I tried this one by itself and I found

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.330 
I tried this one by itself and I found
that<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.269> was<00:03:18.420> looking<00:03:18.780> really<00:03:19.080> really<00:03:19.440> light

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
that I was looking really really light

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.570 
that I was looking really really light
it's<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.300> like<00:03:21.680> half<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.800> shade<00:03:22.980> lighter<00:03:23.400> than

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
it's just like half a shade lighter than

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.509 
it's just like half a shade lighter than
I<00:03:23.850> am<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.420> looks<00:03:24.690> kind<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.930> weird<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.200> me<00:03:25.519> so

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
I am so it looks kind of weird to me so

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.720 
I am so it looks kind of weird to me so
what<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.820> did<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.390> mixed<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:27.959> with<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:29.280> darkest

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
shade that they carry which is mocha so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.070 
shade that they carry which is mocha so
this<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:34.860> number<00:03:35.010> 11<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.640> his<00:03:35.820> number<00:03:36.090> 12<00:03:36.330> so

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
this is number 11 is his number 12 so

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.320 
this is number 11 is his number 12 so
basically<00:03:37.410> what<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.620> did<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.890> did<00:03:38.220> one<00:03:38.550> full<00:03:38.970> pomp

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
of the cappuccino and then I did like a

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.620 
of the cappuccino and then I did like a
little<00:03:43.980> like<00:03:44.430> not<00:03:44.670> even<00:03:44.850> half<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> pump<00:03:45.420> like<00:03:45.540> I

just wish that they had a color between
the<00:04:58.830> two<00:04:59.540> one<00:05:00.540> thing<00:05:00.750> about<00:05:00.930> Revlon<00:05:01.410> wife

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.590 
the two one thing about Revlon wife
always<00:05:01.860> been<00:05:02.130> hesitant<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.670> try<00:05:03.120> them<00:05:03.390> is

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
always been hesitant to try them is

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.970 
always been hesitant to try them is
because<00:05:04.170> I<00:05:04.320> feel<00:05:04.740> like<00:05:06.320> they<00:05:07.320> never<00:05:07.620> have

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
because I feel like they never have

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.810 
because I feel like they never have
enough<00:05:08.700> colors<00:05:09.390> for<00:05:09.690> ethnic<00:05:10.050> skin<00:05:10.350> I<00:05:10.820> feel

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
enough colors for ethnic skin I feel

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.550 
enough colors for ethnic skin I feel
like<00:05:12.000> it's<00:05:12.270> all<00:05:12.450> like<00:05:12.630> really<00:05:13.020> light<00:05:13.200> colors

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
like it's all like really light colors

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.370 
like it's all like really light colors
and<00:05:13.800> then<00:05:13.980> they<00:05:14.130> have<00:05:14.600> like<00:05:15.600> three<00:05:15.990> darker

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
and then they have like three darker

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.510 
and then they have like three darker
colors<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.870> one<00:05:19.110> above<00:05:19.650> this<00:05:19.950> one<00:05:20.010> is

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
colors and the one above this one is

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.070 
colors and the one above this one is
pretty<00:05:21.090> light<00:05:21.390> so<00:05:22.490> that's<00:05:23.810> probably<00:05:24.810> one

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
pretty light so that's probably one

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.020 
pretty light so that's probably one
thing<00:05:25.320> that<00:05:25.560> I<00:05:25.590> would<00:05:25.710> say<00:05:25.950> that<00:05:25.980> I'm<00:05:26.430> not<00:05:26.970> a
