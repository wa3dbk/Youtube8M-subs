00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
and mal pocket is gonna go whoa said oh

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.629 
and mal pocket is gonna go whoa said oh
that<00:04:55.020> makes<00:04:55.169> eight<00:04:55.350> gates<00:04:55.590> right<00:04:55.770> here<00:04:56.070> so

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
that makes eight gates right here so

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.490 
that makes eight gates right here so
eight<00:04:56.850> gates<00:04:57.150> ah<00:04:57.419> I<00:04:57.870> have<00:04:58.169> a<00:04:58.200> hard<00:04:58.410> time

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
eight gates ah I have a hard time

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.260 
eight gates ah I have a hard time
imagining<00:04:58.710> this<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.340> gonna<00:04:59.520> work<00:04:59.790> of<00:05:00.060> course

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
imagining this is gonna work of course

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.460 
imagining this is gonna work of course
everything<00:05:00.660> is<00:05:00.750> suppose<00:05:00.990> anything<00:05:01.410> is

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
everything is suppose anything is

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.530 
everything is suppose anything is
possible<00:05:01.560> it's<00:05:02.430> gonna<00:05:02.610> hit<00:05:02.790> a<00:05:02.820> little<00:05:03.240> quicker

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
possible it's gonna hit a little quicker

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.909 
possible it's gonna hit a little quicker
but<00:05:03.720> we<00:05:03.840> already<00:05:03.990> see<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.229> first<00:05:04.470> roaches<00:05:04.830> in

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
but we already see the first roaches in

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.530 
but we already see the first roaches in
production<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.820> is<00:05:05.940> great<00:05:06.120> games<00:05:06.389> since
