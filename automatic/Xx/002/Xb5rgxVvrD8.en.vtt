00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
of my pajamas so I'm gonna show you how

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.690 
of my pajamas so I'm gonna show you how
to<00:00:07.200> play<00:00:07.440> welcome<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.950> night<00:00:08.099> Vale<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
to play welcome to night Vale on the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.000 
to play welcome to night Vale on the
piano<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.170> just<00:00:10.349> what<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.559> figured

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
piano and this is just what I figured

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.810 
piano and this is just what I figured
out<00:00:11.099> by<00:00:11.340> ear

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
out by ear

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.880 
out by ear
so<00:00:12.300> it's<00:00:12.599> not<00:00:13.790> 100%<00:00:14.790> right<00:00:15.150> but<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.890> actually

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
so it's not 100% right but I actually

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.980 
so it's not 100% right but I actually
made<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> video<00:00:17.550> about<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.150> earlier<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.720> my

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
made a video about this earlier on my

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.779 
made a video about this earlier on my
other<00:00:19.199> channel<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.920> used<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.310> webcam<00:00:20.760> to

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
other channel but I used a webcam to

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.460 
other channel but I used a webcam to
film<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.390> was<00:00:21.480> terrible<00:00:21.810> quality<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.410> I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
film and it was terrible quality and I

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.349 
film and it was terrible quality and I
said<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> would<00:00:22.949> redo<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.210> just

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
said I would redo it and this is just

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.060 
said I would redo it and this is just

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.910 

yeah<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:05.929> you<00:02:05.990> actually<00:02:06.350> do<00:02:06.500> play<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.710> very

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
yeah so you actually do play the very

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.039 
yeah so you actually do play the very
beginning<00:02:07.159> again<00:02:08.060> at<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.360> end<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.899> then<00:02:09.019> it

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
beginning again at the end and then it

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.610 
beginning again at the end and then it
just<00:02:09.259> kind<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.530> fades<00:02:09.769> out<00:02:10.129> a<00:02:10.160> bit<00:02:10.569> so<00:02:11.620> and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
just kind of fades out a bit so and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.559 
just kind of fades out a bit so and
that's<00:02:12.799> all<00:02:12.950> there<00:02:13.099> is<00:02:13.129> to<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.580> it's<00:02:13.730> actually

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
that's all there is to it it's actually

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.530 
that's all there is to it it's actually
pretty<00:02:14.750> easy<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.230> made<00:02:16.190> this<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.849> figured<00:02:17.420> it

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
pretty easy I made this and figured it

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.059 
pretty easy I made this and figured it
all<00:02:17.629> out<00:02:17.690> by<00:02:17.870> ear<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.410> wasn't<00:02:18.680> too<00:02:18.769> hard<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.040> just

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
all out by ear it wasn't too hard I just

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.729 
all out by ear it wasn't too hard I just
listened<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.610> song<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.849> million<00:02:20.150> times<00:02:20.510> um

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
listened to the song a million times um

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.069 
listened to the song a million times um
because<00:02:22.130> there<00:02:22.280> was<00:02:22.489> no<00:02:22.819> sheet<00:02:23.239> music<00:02:23.630> for<00:02:23.900> it

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
because there was no sheet music for it

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.440 
because there was no sheet music for it
or<00:02:24.620> anything<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.310> did<00:02:25.459> actually<00:02:25.670> make<00:02:26.150> sheet

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
or anything I did actually make sheet

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.000 
or anything I did actually make sheet
music<00:02:26.780> for<00:02:27.019> it<00:02:27.200> it's<00:02:28.099> right<00:02:28.310> above<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:30.010> I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
music for it it's right above that I

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.059 
music for it it's right above that I
don't<00:02:31.940> have<00:02:32.030> note<00:02:32.269> lengths<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.079> just<00:02:33.410> have<00:02:33.650> what

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
don't have note lengths I just have what

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.750 
don't have note lengths I just have what
they<00:02:34.190> actually<00:02:34.370> are<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:35.599> that's<00:02:35.840> my<00:02:35.989> little

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
they actually are and that's my little

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.890 
they actually are and that's my little
written<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.120> will<00:02:38.329> follow<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.630> into<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
written of I will follow you into the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.559 
written of I will follow you into the
dark<00:02:39.079> which<00:02:39.489> I'm<00:02:40.489> probably<00:02:40.819> not<00:02:41.329> going<00:02:41.480> to

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
dark which I'm probably not going to

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.180 
dark which I'm probably not going to
make<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> tutorial<00:02:41.900> for<00:02:42.470> because<00:02:42.829> I'm<00:02:42.980> learning
