00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.069 
which and I've got you can see that
they've<00:02:05.369> got<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> range<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.090> colors<00:02:06.509> here<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
they've got a range of colors here and

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.650 
they've got a range of colors here and
they've<00:02:07.439> got<00:02:07.740> ones<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.789> they<00:02:08.879> call<00:02:09.090> Naturals

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
they've got ones that they call Naturals

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.720 
they've got ones that they call Naturals
and<00:02:09.959> then<00:02:10.080> ones<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.470> are<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:10.739> got<00:02:11.430> three

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
and then ones that are like got three

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.540 
and then ones that are like got three
tones<00:02:12.060> to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
tones to

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.510 
tones to
in<00:02:13.060> them<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:14.410> ones<00:02:14.560> I've<00:02:14.800> got<00:02:15.040> are<00:02:15.160> actually

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
in them the ones I've got are actually

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.700 
in them the ones I've got are actually
it<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.910> 3m<00:02:16.240> I'll<00:02:16.390> see<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.630> they<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.170> such<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
it is 3m I'll see that they have such a

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.560 
it is 3m I'll see that they have such a
big<00:02:18.040> range<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.760> think<00:02:19.210> it's<00:02:19.330> completely

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
big range I think it's completely

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.590 
big range I think it's completely
dependent<00:02:20.200> on<00:02:20.290> what<00:02:20.500> your<00:02:20.620> original<00:02:20.710> color<00:02:21.340> is

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
dependent on what your original color is

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.120 
dependent on what your original color is
of<00:02:22.600> your<00:02:22.810> eyes<00:02:22.960> if<00:02:23.260> your<00:02:23.380> eyes<00:02:23.560> are<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.830> dark

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
of your eyes if your eyes are a dark

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.710 
of your eyes if your eyes are a dark
brown<00:02:24.370> like<00:02:24.640> mine<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:25.210> you<00:02:25.330> might<00:02:25.480> want<00:02:25.660> to

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
brown like mine then you might want to

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.780 
brown like mine then you might want to
go<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:26.140> something<00:02:26.320> if<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.830> want<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.310> go<00:02:27.460> for<00:02:27.760> a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
go for something if you want to go for a

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.790 
go for something if you want to go for a
brown<00:02:28.660> color<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.110> might<00:02:29.260> want<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.470> go<00:02:29.590> for

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
brown color you might want to go for

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.280 
brown color you might want to go for
more<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.190> hazely<00:02:30.700> honey<00:02:30.940> color<00:02:31.240> so<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.110> makes

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
more of a hazely honey color so it makes

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.500 
more of a hazely honey color so it makes
your<00:02:32.440> eyes<00:02:32.590> appear<00:02:33.010> lighter<00:02:33.610> brown<00:02:34.060> but<00:02:34.390> if

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
your eyes appear lighter brown but if

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.690 
your eyes appear lighter brown but if
you've<00:02:34.810> got<00:02:34.840> blue<00:02:35.320> eyes<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.860> will<00:02:36.490> probably

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
you've got blue eyes I will probably

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.880 
you've got blue eyes I will probably
suggest<00:02:37.210> go<00:02:37.360> for<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.750> darker<00:02:37.960> Brown<00:02:38.410> if<00:02:38.680> you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
suggest go for a darker Brown if you

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.670 
suggest go for a darker Brown if you
wanted<00:02:39.190> brown<00:02:39.820> eyes<00:02:40.140> because<00:02:41.140> your<00:02:41.290> eyes<00:02:41.440> are

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
wanted brown eyes because your eyes are

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.860 
wanted brown eyes because your eyes are
originally<00:02:41.800> quite<00:02:42.430> light<00:02:42.700> now<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.090> contacts

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
originally quite light now the contacts

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.230 
originally quite light now the contacts
originally<00:02:44.350> come<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.130> solution<00:02:45.670> box<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.180> you

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
originally come in a solution box so you

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.060 
originally come in a solution box so you
get<00:02:46.540> two<00:02:47.320> pairs<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:47.980> contacts<00:02:48.580> like<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.480> and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
get two pairs of contacts like so and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.400 
get two pairs of contacts like so and
you<00:02:51.070> get<00:02:51.280> them<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.970> contact<00:02:52.600> solution<00:02:53.230> now

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
you get them in a contact solution now

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.470 
you get them in a contact solution now
what<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.710> want<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.010> do<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.730> want<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:54.940> open

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
want to put them in the contact case

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.910 
want to put them in the contact case

the contact case for at least 12 to 24
hours<00:03:18.550> this<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.989> allow<00:03:20.230> them<00:03:20.470> to

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
hours this is just to allow them to

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.830 
hours this is just to allow them to
soften<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.459> get<00:03:21.610> used<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.180> use<00:03:22.600> of

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
I can't just think I know how to pick my

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.410 
I can't just think I know how to pick my
contact<00:03:51.190> lenses<00:03:51.550> I<00:03:51.700> don't<00:03:51.910> pick<00:03:52.150> them<00:03:52.300> with<00:03:52.390> a

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
contact lenses I don't pick them with a

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.229 
contact lenses I don't pick them with a
dock<00:03:52.690> ring<00:03:53.080> on<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.350> outside<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.820> go<00:03:55.000> for

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
dock ring on the outside and I go for

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.210 
dock ring on the outside and I go for
ones<00:03:55.360> that<00:03:55.540> are<00:03:55.720> fairly<00:03:56.080> light<00:03:56.470> because<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.070> my

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
ones that are fairly light because of my

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.520 
ones that are fairly light because of my
dark<00:03:57.489> colored<00:03:57.790> eyes<00:03:58.000> now<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:58.870> thought<00:03:59.170> I'd<00:03:59.320> got

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
dark colored eyes now I thought I'd got

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.660 
dark colored eyes now I thought I'd got
it<00:03:59.560> right<00:03:59.860> but<00:04:00.160> obviously<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.670> can<00:04:01.090> say<00:04:01.300> I<00:04:02.670> look

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
it right but obviously I can say I look

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.340 
it right but obviously I can say I look
very<00:04:04.030> scary<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.840> don't<00:04:05.050> think<00:04:05.170> I'll<00:04:05.290> be

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
very scary and I don't think I'll be

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.020 
very scary and I don't think I'll be
wearing<00:04:05.530> them<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:05.920> guess<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.520> can<00:04:06.670> wear<00:04:06.850> them

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
wearing them I guess you can wear them

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.520 
wearing them I guess you can wear them
