it<00:00:11.610> crossed<00:00:11.969> our<00:00:12.210> minds<00:00:12.870> but<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.040> know<00:00:14.309> he<00:00:14.700> would

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
it crossed our minds but I know he would

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.269 
it crossed our minds but I know he would
have<00:00:14.969> been<00:00:15.120> professional<00:00:16.250> personally<00:00:17.250> I

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
have been professional personally I

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.290 
have been professional personally I
think<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.670> would<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:17.820> been<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.000> tough

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
think it would have been a tough

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.009 
think it would have been a tough
position<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.619> put<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.890> player<00:00:20.130> like<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.580> in

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.990 

it's<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.199> hard<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:26.400> know<00:00:26.519> in

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
it's just hard to do you know in

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.820 
it's just hard to do you know in
additionally<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.990> would<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.289> three<00:00:28.470> point

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
additionally we would have three point

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.070 
additionally we would have three point
guards<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.670> know<00:00:29.760> all<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> which<00:00:30.390> we're<00:00:30.900> very

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
guards you know all of which we're very

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.500 
guards you know all of which we're very
highly<00:00:31.320> paid<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.759> doesn't<00:00:33.030> make

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
highly paid and it just doesn't make

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.530 
highly paid and it just doesn't make
sense<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.440> know<00:00:35.160> put<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.329> much

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
sense to you know put that much

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.750 
sense to you know put that much
resources<00:00:37.290> into<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:37.829> position<00:00:38.309> knowing<00:00:38.520> that

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
resources into one position knowing that

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.549 
resources into one position knowing that
if<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> most<00:00:39.270> two<00:00:39.600> players<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.230> split<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
if the most two players can split the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.639 
if the most two players can split the
time<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.899> it<00:00:42.899> probably<00:00:43.140> wouldn't<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.559> made

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
time and it probably wouldn't have made

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.100 
time and it probably wouldn't have made
our<00:00:43.920> job<00:00:44.160> easier<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> coach<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.629> well<00:00:45.660> to
