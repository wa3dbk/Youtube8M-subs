00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:10.920
 Today is important 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.920
 You can occasionally ask questions about how to get involved with people who are not going to change 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:18.580
 People do not say I want to change as I coach counselor is that Rutte as coach 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.660
 How to get involved with them 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:28.150
 Well, I think some of the people who ask me already have an answer 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:32.410
 After all, even after all forced to encourage want to ask on behalf of the cover error Western 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:36.200
 It becomes eco-persuasion and becomes forced 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.579
 I think you know that you will not change 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:47.839
 The secret of being cute to people who are not trying to change 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:51.810
 De it is not trying to think in correcting what the thing is not trying tiles and to the people 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:55.230
 If you really want to be replaced 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.340
 First of all, make sure that you have a human relationship with that person 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.800
 By making human relations firm 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.880
 Make a relationship of trust and it 's fine if it's a separate family. 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.280
 That's fine. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:15.479
 If you have anything to do with creating relationships, you have no relationship with you 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.700
 I want you to do this in the message or I think this way 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.890
 Because is why not get Toria' 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 Because 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.830
 First of all, respect the other person and take time with the other person 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.450
 I think it's about creating a relationship with r 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.820
 On top of that, if there is a request from you or from whom you have an interest, 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.479
 That 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:43.870
 What I would like to ask then I would like you to consider in your thoughts 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.659
 What about because door I think whether I want to ask you this 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.319
 a 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.469
 Please tell me what you mean 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.469
 so 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:58.920
 Oh dear 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:01.150
 The man still but I'm coming to receive the coaching counseling in what some reason 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.140
 Willing to change independently 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.229
 There is no help in Liang, but this is fine or impossible. 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.319
 Let's say it was in this state 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.319
 And this is the same thing 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.120
 Anyway, it means that it is good 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.140
 That person is basically 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:27.010
 Believed that someone who has himself and feels the possibility in the future 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:31.689
 I When Once you have more this saying I'm supposed good standing open the I mean the place 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:35.500
 I can't feel hope in my future, or I can't imagine how it will go 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:40.900
 a or in self-confidence and then in human relationships 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.420
 Human beings give up and be lethargic when it is to be disappointed in a community 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.280
 I would tend to mean that I'm becoming 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.710
 The in First I mean attitude you Tsu is'm it ok what I do not know what happened 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.120

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.000
 I want you to 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.370
 so 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:14.040
 I want you to hear about your favorite stories and fun things that you like or 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:18.630
 I would like you to hear that you think that it is strange that the person's home is strange 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:23.370
 The point is that the quality also increases as you like 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.820
 Because I am a person Toka can contribute I would like you involved in as either a reliable and rises 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.600
 When 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:31.470
 Some emotions of the person move 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.530
 That I mean bought it's whether spicy I do not want to fun it Toka or reverse 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.920
 I just want you to give to hear the story in from the 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.940
 Then what can be connected to where you really want to be 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.730
 it can 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:49.840
 There's a solid relationship with you and something is your win, between you 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:55.520
 Tteyuu can trust that you and put up in the role Toka has been accepted or at least a 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:59.840
 Get to a little listening to his mouth and a little Toka their own fun story made the situation 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:06.730
 It seems that it is so so as not to force change while making it the entrance. 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.730
 Actually in wonder if good if it has become a kind of wind I that I want to support it 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:15.830
 Let's try to create the direction of the future by force somehow and keep trying there or the future minus 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:20.660
 Whether work hard to show because I become this way and I I go in this state is 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:24.960
 Of course it's good , but it's good to be in front of it 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.840
 The person is a bit in a relationship with you 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.160
 Mind is open Toka to from it 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:36.550
 It's kind of you that you can trust me something ok 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:41.620
 I mean that you want to make such a condition by all means 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:48.740
 Do not try to change the people who do not want instead ask whether the Anta familiar with the relationship with you 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:54.440
 Afford to stop and think a little it something get a little feel the coziness in the relationship 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.729
 Space location today is that Why is it that you'll make with 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.449
