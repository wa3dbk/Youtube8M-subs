about the robocall thing and how it
could<00:03:18.790> be<00:03:18.819> harassing<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.569> a<00:03:19.599> lot<00:03:19.690> of<00:03:19.720> people<00:03:19.840> oh

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
could be harassing to a lot of people oh

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.949 
could be harassing to a lot of people oh
they<00:03:20.530> know<00:03:20.739> in<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.159> economy<00:03:21.549> kind<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.150> not

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
they know in this economy kind of not

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:23.789 
they know in this economy kind of not
think<00:03:23.139> it<00:03:23.199> could<00:03:23.349> fly<00:03:23.530> under<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.709> radar

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
think it could fly under the radar

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.890 
think it could fly under the radar
possibly<00:03:24.609> who<00:03:24.699> knows<00:03:24.879> you<00:03:25.209> know<00:03:25.329> and<00:03:25.569> with<00:03:25.659> so

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
possibly who knows you know and with so

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.689 
possibly who knows you know and with so
many<00:03:25.989> things<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.829> doesn't<00:03:27.040> seem<00:03:27.310> as<00:03:27.400> salacious

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699 
many things it doesn't seem as salacious

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.219 
many things it doesn't seem as salacious
enough<00:03:28.150> for<00:03:28.359> when<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:28.569> jump<00:03:28.840> on<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.049> say<00:03:29.169> you

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:29.229 
enough for when I jump on and say you

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:30.869 
enough for when I jump on and say you
know<00:03:29.470> he's<00:03:29.620> putting<00:03:29.859> out<00:03:29.949> robo<00:03:30.459> calls<00:03:30.729> because

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
know he's putting out robo calls because

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.490 
know he's putting out robo calls because
then<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.090> could<00:03:31.479> make<00:03:31.659> him<00:03:31.750> look<00:03:31.900> bad<00:03:31.959> but<00:03:32.319> I

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
then that could make him look bad but I

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.000 
then that could make him look bad but I
think<00:03:33.159> they<00:03:33.250> can<00:03:33.370> cover<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.639> up<00:03:33.760> well<00:03:33.909> enough
