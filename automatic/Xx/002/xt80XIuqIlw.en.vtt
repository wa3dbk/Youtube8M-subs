00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 bad fame abdomen see - a new gameplay 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.930
 live commentary on clock tower goes 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.269
 to be this time and we will be with the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.620
 green as you can see I'm 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.960
 saying things that you already see 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.580
 but hey I like to give details of 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.830
 arcs and rates and not for you 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.539
 go see how the subject goes we go there 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.400
 mind more I like to go a lot 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.760
 grenades or come up here and hit me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.960
 here and pray do not come god and I 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.960
 they roar and kill me 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.390
 I did not think it was going like that it would stick in the 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.390
 coverage 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.720
 if it went wrong because whoever 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:43.460
 I was shooting not always with the 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.460
 Coverage of the pomegranate is our good 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:53.120
 fellow the isr or the sniper who 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.120
 bad person who is the sniper 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.620
 As I said, I really like the 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.769
 grenades of this eat I like 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.129
 very good we are already having the 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.129
 trick 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.800
 rather do not die 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.800
 ok kill it you do not pass anything 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.440
 there were enough shots you can go 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.370
 we'll see 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.370
 we networks after voice 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.530
 do not 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.350
 but 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.480
 ok we saved it to this 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.610
 we had one had not knocked it down 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.610
 one just came from behind 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.399
 let me remember 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.799
 I do not think that I do not know and I will tell 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.880
 you live here I can not go back 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.370
 the eyes like that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.650
 and as is 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.200
 the grenades work totally 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.030
 different is amazing 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.880
 whenever I see someone playing for 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.229
 first time and I see him throwing grenades the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.060
 it's really kind of funny 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.590
 the theme of which you throw them like in 3 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.590
 and that does not help 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.610
 thank you thank you I was already costing 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.290
 too much to kill explaining good nine 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.880
 lives we have the truth that this one is 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.030
 making it pretty easy they killed them 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.030
 time 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.400
 you come up here this headshot 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.430
 departure of the typical game that comes out 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.430
 all 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.400
 40 and just got him a sniper 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.110
 bad luck 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.730
 rather unlucky are seeing 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.230
 they and we are seeing all the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.959
 world 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.950
 this is usually usually change 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.430
 whenever you do a spectacular round 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.500
 and whenever I see I look at zero deaths 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.290
 I say I'm going to play to get zero 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.930
 deaths I go out to the first one they kill in 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.080
 all is to me so I will not say yes 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.150
 It was good if they had one less 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.420
 let's try I'm going to do the one 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.420
 root 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.130
 although he says that he is required to be wrong and 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.450
 he rolled without wanting to surely eye that what 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.450
 we have in the back 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.840
 or kellan yesterday I got a little tired 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.320
 the inconsistency of anxiety 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.689
 is that the one born is very rare 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.939
 I already want to upload something commenting 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.760
 about the night I probably do not know 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.480
 when these comments I'm recording 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.540
 to have a lot 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.760
 but usually one day I'm going to 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.379
 make a video speaking well 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.959
 in detail about the night because it's 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.239
 something that is very strange and if you 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.080
 they feel that it is weird to naser not feel 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.080
 that are the only ones 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.040
 do not feel that they are the only ones because 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.460
 night if it is rare the night is rare it is very 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.200
 rarely 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.720
 because this goes with a side that you do not know 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.720
 well where the shit lives 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.040
 I wanted to stick there in the coverage but 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.700
 I could not bad luck bad bad fame 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.940
 fame fame bad fame bad luck luck 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.940
 bad 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.989
 let's go directly to 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.030
 art where are the problems that 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.030
 they are more even 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.630
 this is the level this is level 30 and peak 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.630
 eye with this which is level 30 and peak 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.860
 the wait for the nice shot re-evaluates that and 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:47.199
 it went well for me and I did it well 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.199
 when I do things right the truth 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.380
 when you do things well 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.780
 they also applaud yielded or what good that 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.430
 and be it and that was perfect is not 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.900
 enlarged or let go 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.249
 Fuck I thought I was going to continue 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.819
 there 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:11.999
 it went wrong for me that you have to criticize t 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.889
 you also have to criticize yourself when you 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:16.169
 up and well with black code 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.059
 mamba with codes there are many people who 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.259
 mate and then relive that is bad 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:22.649
 people 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:25.499
 it's not bad fame it 's bad people that's not 

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:27.539
 does in good maine is one that 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:30.600
 now he's going to kill us all this and in 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.250
 the next round I comment 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.400
 it would be very unlucky that it kills us 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.800
 everyone 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:41.099
 what I 'm looking at more because I 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.710
 and already started I will try to help my 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.490
 partner and we do not give him the opportunity 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.830
 from one big one 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.259
 if we do not make a shot of him who is 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.720
 it goes like the wind runs like the 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.600
 wind 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.230
 of the back I was thinking that 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.260
 I was thinking about turning around but 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.450
 do not fool him, he did not say turn me around 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.969
 not because it's far away it cost him 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.879
 call man 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:12.049
 ask me prevent level thirty ok and 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:13.699
 We were 13 220 remained well 

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:16.369
 things in this the truth that not always 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:19.309
 it's like that but if they liked it they know me 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:21.759
 like help a lot and see you in 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:21.759
 another video
