hi welcome to Han Channel online snippet
a<00:00:07.830> week<00:00:07.980> I'm<00:00:08.550> your<00:00:08.580> host<00:00:08.820> John<00:00:09.120> Stallone<00:00:09.510> this

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
a week I'm your host John Stallone this

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.870 
a week I'm your host John Stallone this
week<00:00:10.380> we're<00:00:10.800> talking<00:00:10.980> about<00:00:11.250> bear<00:00:11.519> hunting

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
week we're talking about bear hunting

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.600 
week we're talking about bear hunting
and<00:00:12.030> specifically<00:00:12.780> calling<00:00:13.290> bear<00:00:13.610> most

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
and specifically calling bear most

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.070 
and specifically calling bear most
states<00:00:14.880> don't<00:00:15.030> allow<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.630> bait<00:00:15.870> bear

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
states don't allow you to bait bear

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080 
states don't allow you to bait bear
anymore<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.730> look<00:00:17.850> at<00:00:17.970> you

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
anymore so you have to look at you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.000 
anymore so you have to look at you
different<00:00:18.449> options<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.470> spot<00:00:19.859> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
different options you have the spot and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.460 
different options you have the spot and
stalk<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:21.090> have<00:00:21.180> sit<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.570> water<00:00:21.840> holes<00:00:22.109> and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
stalk you have sit on water holes and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.340 
stalk you have sit on water holes and
you<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.609> interception<00:00:24.060> game<00:00:24.420> all

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
you have the interception game all

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.089 
you have the interception game all
viable<00:00:26.060> but<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.240> think<00:00:27.810> calling<00:00:28.170> bear<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.800> is

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
viable but I think calling bear in is

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.220 
viable but I think calling bear in is
the<00:00:29.310> most<00:00:29.490> exciting<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> most<00:00:30.300> won<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the most exciting in the most won and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.310 
the most exciting in the most won and
tends<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> most<00:00:31.980> rewarding<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:33.320> couple

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
tends to be the most rewarding a couple

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.780 
tends to be the most rewarding a couple
things<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.559> need<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> remember<00:00:35.010> when<00:00:35.430> calling

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
things you need to remember when calling

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.410 
things you need to remember when calling
and<00:00:35.940> bear<00:00:36.380> first<00:00:37.430> you<00:00:38.430> need<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.700> locate<00:00:39.000> bear

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and bear first you need to locate bear

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.869 
and bear first you need to locate bear
sign<00:00:39.770> it<00:00:40.770> doesn't<00:00:41.129> really<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.670> lot<00:00:41.850> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879

good<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.510> walk<00:00:43.050> about<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> mountain<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
good to just walk about the mountain and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.970 
good to just walk about the mountain and
aimlessly<00:00:44.399> start<00:00:44.730> calling<00:00:45.120> because<00:00:46.110> most

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
aimlessly start calling because most

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.920 
aimlessly start calling because most
bear<00:00:47.280> won't<00:00:47.640> travel<00:00:47.969> great<00:00:48.300> distances<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.899> a
