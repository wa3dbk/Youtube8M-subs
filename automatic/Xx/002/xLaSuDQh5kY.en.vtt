continue<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> train<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
continue to train you just have to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.310 
continue to train you just have to
consider<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.040> few<00:00:41.370> things<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.840> first<00:00:43.110> piece

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
consider a few things so the first piece

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.389 
consider a few things so the first piece
of<00:00:43.440> information<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.920> we're<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> need

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
of information that we're going to need

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.220 
of information that we're going to need
before<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.820> design<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.120> program<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.050> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
before we design a program for you is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.160 
before we design a program for you is
what<00:00:46.950> kind<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.550> bulge<00:00:47.879> or<00:00:48.270> herniation<00:00:48.870> you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
what kind of bulge or herniation you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.220 
what kind of bulge or herniation you
have<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.969> direction<00:00:51.180> does<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.899> bulge

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
have or in what direction does it bulge

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.799 
have or in what direction does it bulge
so<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> got<00:00:53.160> your<00:00:53.280> anterior<00:00:53.850> bulge<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
so you got your anterior bulge with it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.560 
so you got your anterior bulge with it
which<00:00:54.960> essentially<00:00:55.320> means<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.890> it's

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
which essentially means that it's

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.910 
which essentially means that it's
bulging<00:00:57.570> towards<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.109> front<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:58.620> body

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
bulging towards the front of your body

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.950 
bulging towards the front of your body
you<00:00:59.309> could<00:00:59.430> imagine<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.570> lower

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you could imagine that this is a lower

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.810 
you could imagine that this is a lower
back<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> lumbar<00:01:02.010> portion<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> spine

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
back or the lumbar portion of the spine

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.990 
back or the lumbar portion of the spine
a<00:01:03.650> anterior<00:01:04.650> bulge<00:01:04.920> should<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.280> such<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
a anterior bulge should be such that the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.270 
a anterior bulge should be such that the
the<00:01:06.510> disc<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.590> I'm<00:01:07.680> assuming<00:01:07.740> most<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the disc you know I'm assuming most of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.690 
the disc you know I'm assuming most of
us<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.549> what<00:01:08.670> those<00:01:08.820> little<00:01:09.270> disks<00:01:09.720> are

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
us know what those little disks are

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.260 
us know what those little disks are
between<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.060> vertebrae<00:01:12.950> bulges<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.270> towards

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
between the vertebrae bulges in towards

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.910 
between the vertebrae bulges in towards
the<00:01:15.420> body<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:16.020> we've<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> opposite<00:01:16.770> also

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the body now we've got the opposite also

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.640 
the body now we've got the opposite also
which<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.540> posterior<00:01:18.540> bulge<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.380> means

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
which is the posterior bulge which means

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.710 
which is the posterior bulge which means
essentially<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.670> butt<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.240> Bulge<00:01:21.479> is

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
essentially the butt the Bulge is

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.620 
essentially the butt the Bulge is
pushing<00:01:22.409> backwards<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.640> again<00:01:23.909> you'd<00:01:24.180> imagine

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
pushing backwards so again you'd imagine

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.719 
pushing backwards so again you'd imagine
that<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.200> lumbar<00:01:26.100> portion<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
that this is a lumbar portion of the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.440 
that this is a lumbar portion of the
spine<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.390> pushing<00:01:28.200> towards<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.369> back<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
spine it's pushing towards the back the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.620 
spine it's pushing towards the back the
Bulge<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.079> herniating<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.240> disc<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
Bulge is herniating for the the disc is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
Bulge is herniating for the the disc is
herniated<00:01:33.810> towards<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> back<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.220> body

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
herniated towards the back of the body

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
herniated towards the back of the body
so<00:01:36.270> these<00:01:36.390> are<00:01:36.570> important<00:01:36.990> things<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.259> know

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
so these are important things to know

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.499 
so these are important things to know
and<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.009> also<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.369> lateral<00:01:38.670> bulges<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and then you also have lateral bulges so

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.550 
and then you also have lateral bulges so
if<00:01:39.659> you're<00:01:39.780> looking<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.079> someone<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
if you're looking at someone in the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.649 
if you're looking at someone in the
frontal<00:01:40.890> plane<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.790> Bulge<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.270> either<00:01:42.420> going

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
frontal plane the Bulge is either going

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.550 
frontal plane the Bulge is either going
that<00:01:42.930> way<00:01:43.140> or<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.100> way<00:01:44.159> right<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.320> reason

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
that way or that way right so the reason

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590 
that way or that way right so the reason
why<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.770> need<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.759> type<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.090> bulge

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
why we need to know what type of bulge

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.069 
why we need to know what type of bulge
it<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.920> avoid<00:01:50.869> exercises<00:01:51.869> that

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it is so we can avoid exercises that

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.090 
it is so we can avoid exercises that
push<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.530> further<00:01:53.280> into<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.479> bulging

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
push it further into the bulging

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.679 
push it further into the bulging
direction<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.520> direction<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
direction or in the direction of the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.230 
direction or in the direction of the
herniation<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.950> will<00:01:59.100> know<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.640> by<00:02:00.180> two

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
herniation you will know this by two

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.570 
herniation you will know this by two
things<00:02:00.810> number<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:01.710> you've<00:02:01.860> got<00:02:02.070> an<00:02:02.189> A

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
things number one if you've got an A

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.310 
things number one if you've got an A
terior<00:02:02.880> bollocks<00:02:03.300> basically<00:02:03.720> your<00:02:03.870> your

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
terior bollocks basically your your

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.240 
terior bollocks basically your your
bulging<00:02:04.860> your<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.780> disc<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.230> herniated<00:02:07.740> this

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
bulging your the disc is herniated this

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.280 
bulging your the disc is herniated this
way<00:02:08.460> you're<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.150> feel<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.660> lot<00:02:09.960> of<00:02:09.990> pain

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
way you're going to feel a lot of pain

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.560 
way you're going to feel a lot of pain
when<00:02:10.650> you<00:02:10.850> hyperextend<00:02:11.850> because<00:02:12.240> as<00:02:12.390> you'd

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
when you hyperextend because as you'd

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.870 
when you hyperextend because as you'd
imagine<00:02:12.690> you're<00:02:13.560> pushing<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.190> Bulge<00:02:14.460> even

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
imagine you're pushing the Bulge even

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.180 
imagine you're pushing the Bulge even
further<00:02:15.210> out<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:16.050> that's<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.860> know<00:02:16.980> can

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
further out then that's you know can

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.610 
further out then that's you know can
totally<00:02:17.580> rupture<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.660> bulge<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.410> if<00:02:19.530> you

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
totally rupture this bulge so if you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.280 
totally rupture this bulge so if you
look<00:02:19.770> at<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> force<00:02:20.520> going<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:20.910> way

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
look at the force going this way

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.930 
look at the force going this way
hyperextending<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.830> explode<00:02:23.550> out<00:02:23.760> you

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
hyperextending you can explode out you

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.520 
hyperextending you can explode out you
can<00:02:24.060> destroy<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.440> disc<00:02:25.740> right<00:02:26.010> ah<00:02:27.530> with

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
can destroy that that disc right ah with

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.380 
can destroy that that disc right ah with
someone<00:02:28.890> who<00:02:29.010> has<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.340> posterior<00:02:29.790> bulge<00:02:30.210> is

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
someone who has a posterior bulge is

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.690 
someone who has a posterior bulge is
just<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.660> exact<00:02:30.990> opposite<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:32.160> evident

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
just the exact opposite is is evident

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.370 
just the exact opposite is is evident
you're<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.420> bend<00:02:33.690> forward<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.260> you're

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
you're going to bend forward and you're

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.560 
you're going to bend forward and you're
going<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.560> feel<00:02:34.740> lots<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.430> pain<00:02:35.730> right<00:02:36.270> and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
going to feel lots of pain right and

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.860 
going to feel lots of pain right and
then<00:02:37.260> laterally<00:02:37.800> would<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.910> if<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.420> am<00:02:39.480> leaning

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
then laterally would be if I am leaning

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.900 
then laterally would be if I am leaning
this<00:02:40.140> way<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:40.800> bulging<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.280> way<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.610> lot

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
this way and it's bulging that way a lot

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.900 
this way and it's bulging that way a lot
of<00:02:41.940> pain<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.450> vice-versa<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.830> you'll<00:02:44.220> kind<00:02:44.760> of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
of pain and vice-versa so you'll kind of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.530 
of pain and vice-versa so you'll kind of
know<00:02:45.180> based<00:02:45.600> on<00:02:45.840> how<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.230> feel<00:02:46.460> but<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:48.000> best

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
know based on how you feel but the best

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.440 
know based on how you feel but the best
thing<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.900> do<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.860> an<00:02:50.040> MRI<00:02:50.460> or<00:02:50.670> an<00:02:51.030> x-ray

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
thing to do is to get an MRI or an x-ray

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.830 
thing to do is to get an MRI or an x-ray
where<00:02:52.200> they<00:02:52.320> tell<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.830> where<00:02:53.250> your<00:02:53.580> your<00:02:54.540> disc

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
where they tell you where your your disc

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.780 
where they tell you where your your disc
is<00:02:55.050> bulging<00:02:55.530> now<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.980> very<00:02:56.310> simplistic

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
is bulging now this is very simplistic

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.230 
is bulging now this is very simplistic
it<00:02:57.480> may<00:02:57.690> be<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.960> bit<00:02:58.170> more<00:02:58.410> than<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.920> may<00:02:59.040> be

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
it may be a bit more than this it may be

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.660 
it may be a bit more than this it may be
anterior<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.510> lateral<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.460> just

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
anterior and lateral so but this is just

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.820 
anterior and lateral so but this is just
a<00:03:02.790> general<00:03:03.180> idea<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.690> what<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.500> want<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.710> do

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
a general idea so what you want to do

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.470 
a general idea so what you want to do
first<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.220> all<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.340> avoid<00:03:05.820> anything<00:03:06.360> that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
first of all is avoid anything that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.800 
first of all is avoid anything that
causes<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:07.020> pain<00:03:07.230> right<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.880> if<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.570> have<00:03:09.720> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
causes the pain right so if you have the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.390 
causes the pain right so if you have the
anterior<00:03:10.110> bulbs<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.650> don't<00:03:10.830> want<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.070> do<00:03:11.190> any

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
anterior bulbs you don't want to do any

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.040 
anterior bulbs you don't want to do any
hyperextension<00:03:12.330> stay<00:03:12.720> away<00:03:12.989> from

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
hyperextension stay away from

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.410 
hyperextension stay away from
strengthening<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.250> low<00:03:14.370> back<00:03:14.610> exercises

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
strengthening the low back exercises

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.690 
strengthening the low back exercises
things<00:03:15.660> like<00:03:15.959> good<00:03:16.770> mornings<00:03:17.220> or<00:03:17.430> when<00:03:17.610> you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
things like good mornings or when you

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.940 
things like good mornings or when you
lay<00:03:17.820> on<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.030> floor<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.510> do<00:03:18.600> those

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
lay on the floor and you do those

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.949 
lay on the floor and you do those
hyperextensions<00:03:19.950> or<00:03:20.190> prone<00:03:20.459> cobras<00:03:20.970> don't<00:03:21.750> do

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
hyperextensions or prone cobras don't do

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.220 
hyperextensions or prone cobras don't do
those<00:03:22.140> there<00:03:23.100> are<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> lot<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:24.230> practitioners

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
those there are a lot of practitioners

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.740 
those there are a lot of practitioners
that<00:03:25.560> are<00:03:25.860> they<00:03:26.520> don't<00:03:27.030> totally<00:03:27.270> understand

a Donald Duck posture like I talked

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.130 
a Donald Duck posture like I talked
about<00:03:44.310> before<00:03:44.459> where<00:03:44.850> your<00:03:45.450> butt<00:03:45.690> sticks<00:03:45.989> out

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
about before where your butt sticks out

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.479 
about before where your butt sticks out
you've<00:03:46.320> got<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.500> big<00:03:46.709> curve<00:03:47.070> in<00:03:47.250> your<00:03:47.280> low

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.610 
you've got this big curve in your low
back<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.970> that's<00:03:48.420> causing<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.050> anterior

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
back and that's causing the anterior

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.560 
back and that's causing the anterior
bulge<00:03:49.830> that<00:03:50.550> person<00:03:50.970> actually<00:03:51.330> needs<00:03:51.480> to

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
bulge that person actually needs to

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.750 
bulge that person actually needs to
strengthen<00:03:52.080> their<00:03:52.260> abdominals<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.640> they

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
strengthen their abdominals so that they

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.010 
strengthen their abdominals so that they
could<00:03:53.880> be<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.000> little<00:03:54.239> bit<00:03:54.360> more<00:03:54.540> like<00:03:54.690> this<00:03:54.900> guy

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
could be a little bit more like this guy

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.540 
could be a little bit more like this guy
so<00:03:55.350> they<00:03:55.470> can<00:03:55.620> sort<00:03:55.860> of<00:03:55.890> tuck<00:03:56.130> their<00:03:56.340> butt

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
so they can sort of tuck their butt

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.090 
so they can sort of tuck their butt
under<00:03:56.700> some<00:03:57.060> drop<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.900> ribcage<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.620> get<00:03:58.860> more

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
under some drop the ribcage and get more

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.030 
under some drop the ribcage and get more
of<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.550> a<00:04:00.180> wealth<00:04:00.930> curve<00:04:01.830> blow<00:04:02.160> back<00:04:02.370> as<00:04:02.580> opposed

a part of the reason why these things
happen<00:05:55.930> is<00:05:56.050> because<00:05:56.409> of<00:05:56.530> the<00:05:56.590> muscular
