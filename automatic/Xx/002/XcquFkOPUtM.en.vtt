modified<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.160> shield<00:00:38.489> slightly<00:00:39.000> because

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
modified this shield slightly because

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.840 
modified this shield slightly because
what<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> wanted<00:00:39.690> was<00:00:40.020> an<00:00:40.230> egg<00:00:40.350> timer<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.890> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
what I wanted was an egg timer and it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.150 
what I wanted was an egg timer and it
has<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.420> with<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.500> i<00:00:43.530> did<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.800> i

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
has to be with you so what i did was i

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.060 
has to be with you so what i did was i
sold<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.789> appears<00:00:45.539> i<00:00:45.660> speaker<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.200> pin<00:00:46.379> 13<00:00:46.890> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
sold it appears i speaker to pin 13 and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.340 
sold it appears i speaker to pin 13 and
ground<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.579> super<00:00:48.510> glued<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> bottom

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
ground and super glued it to the bottom

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.130 
ground and super glued it to the bottom
so<00:00:49.950> now<00:00:50.250> i've<00:00:50.579> got<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> little<00:00:51.210> deeper<00:00:51.899> which

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
so now i've got a little deeper which

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.250 
so now i've got a little deeper which
could<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.710> pitching<00:00:53.300> now<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> inspiration

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
could be pitching now the inspiration

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.750 
could be pitching now the inspiration
for<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.500> timer<00:00:55.800> came<00:00:56.100> from<00:00:56.280> my<00:00:56.460> brother

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
for this timer came from my brother

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.360 
for this timer came from my brother
because<00:00:57.300> he<00:00:57.449> does<00:00:57.690> quite<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> bit<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.739> training

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
because he does quite a bit of training

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.060 
because he does quite a bit of training
athletic<00:01:00.210> training<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.629> home<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.649> he<00:01:01.829> needed

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
athletic training at home and he needed

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280 
athletic training at home and he needed
a<00:01:02.250> device<00:01:02.579> which<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.059> time<00:01:03.780> him<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
a device which can time him for a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.320 
a device which can time him for a
certain<00:01:04.589> interval<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.159> repeatedly<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:06.090> so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
certain interval and repeatedly do so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.200 
certain interval and repeatedly do so
and<00:01:06.740> alert<00:01:07.740> him<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.640> gets<00:01:08.909> that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and alert him when it gets that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.060 
and alert him when it gets that
particular<00:01:09.750> time<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.500> he's<00:01:10.590> been<00:01:10.740> nagging<00:01:11.040> me

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
particular time so he's been nagging me

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
with the Arduino is timing now you'll

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
with the Arduino is timing now you'll
notice<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.110> using<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.650> real<00:01:37.829> time

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
notice that I'm not using a real time

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.880 
notice that I'm not using a real time
clock<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.659> wanted<00:01:39.990> really<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.770> good

timing<00:01:41.520> what<00:01:42.030> you'll<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.780> use<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> real

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
timing what you'll do is you use a real

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
timing what you'll do is you use a real

a<00:02:03.619> ceramic<00:02:04.619> resonator<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.460> that's<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.390> there

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
a ceramic resonator so that's it there

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.660 
a ceramic resonator so that's it there
which<00:02:07.020> I'm<00:02:07.229> pointing<00:02:07.409> at<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.890> particular

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
which I'm pointing at this particular

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.220 
which I'm pointing at this particular
clone<00:02:09.300> board<00:02:09.629> has<00:02:09.899> dual<00:02:10.470> footprint

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
clone board has dual footprint

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.690 
clone board has dual footprint
which<00:02:11.319> allows<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.830> install<00:02:12.159> a<00:02:12.220> crystal

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
which allows you to install a crystal

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.910 
which allows you to install a crystal
and<00:02:12.940> its<00:02:13.120> capacities<00:02:13.720> but<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.140> one<00:02:14.349> has<00:02:14.620> a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and its capacities but this one has a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.399 
and its capacities but this one has a
resonator<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:16.360> problem<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> resonator

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
resonator the problem of the resonator

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.550 
resonator the problem of the resonator
is<00:02:17.709> low<00:02:18.159> accuracy<00:02:18.670> compared<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.540> crystal<00:02:19.930> so

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
is low accuracy compared to a crystal so

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.350 
is low accuracy compared to a crystal so
you're<00:02:20.769> looking<00:02:20.920> at<00:02:21.190> point<00:02:21.580> one<00:02:21.849> percent

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
you're looking at point one percent

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.890 
you're looking at point one percent
drift<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.500> terms<00:02:23.769> of<00:02:23.890> frequency<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:25.569> could

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
drift in terms of frequency and it could

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.559 
drift in terms of frequency and it could
be<00:02:26.170> worse<00:02:26.650> depending<00:02:27.129> on<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.580> temperature<00:02:27.879> so

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
be worse depending on the temperature so

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.750 
be worse depending on the temperature so
in<00:02:28.720> terms<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.110> timing<00:02:29.379> accuracy<00:02:29.769> it's<00:02:30.250> not<00:02:30.370> as

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
in terms of timing accuracy it's not as

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.800 
in terms of timing accuracy it's not as
accurate<00:02:31.000> as<00:02:31.390> if<00:02:31.629> you<00:02:31.810> had<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.230> real<00:02:32.440> time<00:02:32.709> clock

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
accurate as if you had a real time clock

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.920 
accurate as if you had a real time clock
so<00:02:35.099> LCD<00:02:36.099> buzzer<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:38.640> some<00:02:39.640> code<00:02:39.910> later<00:02:39.940> which

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
so LCD buzzer and some code later which

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.780 
so LCD buzzer and some code later which
I<00:02:41.079> cut<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:41.470> up<00:02:41.590> today<00:02:42.329> let<00:02:43.329> me<00:02:43.360> hook<00:02:43.599> this<00:02:43.660> up

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
I cut it up today let me hook this up

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.240 
I cut it up today let me hook this up
and<00:02:45.790> we<00:02:46.060> have<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.299> timer<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.530> problem<00:02:47.829> is<00:02:48.069> if

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
and we have a timer so the problem is if

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.819 
and we have a timer so the problem is if
you<00:02:48.430> choose<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.970> use<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.299> delay<00:02:49.629> function<00:02:49.900> on

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
you choose to use the delay function on

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.430 
you choose to use the delay function on
the<00:02:51.010> Arduino<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:52.239> delay<00:02:52.599> function<00:02:52.870> delays

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
the Arduino the delay function delays

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.050 
the Arduino the delay function delays
for<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.739> certain<00:02:54.099> amount<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.459> time<00:02:54.670> but<00:02:54.910> you

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
for a certain amount of time but you

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.449 
for a certain amount of time but you
don't<00:02:55.090> know<00:02:55.390> what<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.750> other<00:02:56.459> statements

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
don't know what the other statements

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.430 
don't know what the other statements
which<00:02:57.579> are<00:02:57.700> executed<00:02:58.239> say<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.599> loop<00:02:58.840> you

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
which are executed say in the loop you

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.559 
which are executed say in the loop you
don't<00:02:59.650> know<00:02:59.799> what<00:03:00.160> amount<00:03:00.549> of<00:03:00.670> time<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.180> used

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
don't know what amount of time is used

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.420 
don't know what amount of time is used
in<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.049> particular<00:03:02.379> or<00:03:02.829> those<00:03:03.069> particular

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
in that particular or those particular

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.759 
in that particular or those particular
statements<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.690> therefore<00:03:05.170> if<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.709> use

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
statements so therefore if you just use

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.000 
statements so therefore if you just use
delay<00:03:06.310> it's<00:03:06.640> not<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.970> very<00:03:07.209> accurate<00:03:08.010> timing

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
delay it's not a very accurate timing

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.240 
delay it's not a very accurate timing
mechanism<00:03:09.879> so<00:03:10.720> as<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.230> see<00:03:11.500> well<00:03:11.950> maybe

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
mechanism so as you can see well maybe

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.229 
mechanism so as you can see well maybe
not<00:03:12.569> hopefully<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:14.829> says<00:03:15.160> time<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.609> so<00:03:15.940> let's

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
not hopefully it says time up so let's

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.650 
not hopefully it says time up so let's
just<00:03:16.480> set<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:16.989> time<00:03:17.319> so<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.549> one<00:03:18.760> decrements

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
just set a time so this one decrements

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.420 
just set a time so this one decrements
minutes<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.200> one<00:03:20.410> increments<00:03:20.980> minutes<00:03:21.720> and

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
minutes this one increments minutes and

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.140 
minutes this one increments minutes and
this<00:03:24.430> one<00:03:24.639> increment<00:03:24.880> seconds<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:27.280> there's<00:03:28.000> a

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
this one increment seconds so there's a

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.000 
this one increment seconds so there's a
slight<00:03:28.450> button<00:03:28.840> balance<00:03:29.169> issue<00:03:29.349> there<00:03:29.709> but

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
slight button balance issue there but

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.979 
slight button balance issue there but
anyway<00:03:30.370> let's<00:03:31.060> start<00:03:31.329> timing<00:03:31.569> for<00:03:31.810> five

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
anyway let's start timing for five

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.490 
anyway let's start timing for five
seconds<00:03:32.500> five<00:03:32.980> four<00:03:33.310> three<00:03:34.560> two<00:03:35.560> one<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:37.690> it

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
seconds five four three two one and it

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.050 
seconds five four three two one and it
says<00:03:38.680> time<00:03:38.889> up<00:03:39.069> and<00:03:39.280> if<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.489> want<00:03:39.669> to<00:03:39.730> repeat

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
says time up and if you want to repeat

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.059 
says time up and if you want to repeat
the<00:03:40.209> interval<00:03:40.510> press<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.109> button<00:03:41.380> again<00:03:41.470> five

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
the interval press the button again five

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.809 
the interval press the button again five
four<00:03:43.000> three<00:03:43.889> two<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:47.109> there<00:03:48.099> you<00:03:48.190> go<00:03:48.370> you've

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
four three two and there you go you've

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.720 
four three two and there you go you've
got<00:03:48.849> an<00:03:49.389> egg<00:03:49.569> timer<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.349> I've<00:03:51.220> tested<00:03:51.639> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
got an egg timer and I've tested the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.280 
got an egg timer and I've tested the
accuracy<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.269> this<00:03:52.510> we're<00:03:52.750> looking<00:03:53.079> at<00:03:53.169> about

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
accuracy of this we're looking at about

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.589 
accuracy of this we're looking at about
maybe<00:03:53.620> three<00:03:53.769> to<00:03:54.220> four<00:03:54.489> seconds<00:03:55.030> of<00:03:55.150> drift<00:03:55.419> in

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
maybe three to four seconds of drift in

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.949 
maybe three to four seconds of drift in
every<00:03:55.840> hour<00:03:56.019> which<00:03:56.889> is<00:03:57.370> not<00:03:57.930> spectacular<00:03:58.930> but
