00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.360
 when the world demanded it and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.460
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.619
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.900
 this trick is to teleport to 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.689
 anywhere on the map the truth is 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
 that goes very well in case we want to go to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.739
 other places this trick I already uploaded it 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.869
 what happens that they patched it in a way 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.430
 well pretty easy and good then now 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.050
 a little bit is done, that is, it takes a 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.090
 little bit more but the truth is that it's going to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.649
 go perfect because even though it's not 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.320
 a piece of the trick as I always say 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.150
 the truth is that it is very good in itself 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.220
 we want to go somewhere else without having to 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.860
 take a plane or a car and load a lot 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.420
 Today we will start with the tutorial as 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.580
 good all first thing we have to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.020
 to do is to be online and what 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.330
 we will do is take the map we give to the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.280
 start we give the X and we will leave 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.290
 the map is good because now we simply 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.270
 we put where we want to go more or less 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.370
 I want to go here and the activity 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.410
 closest to the nearest mission because 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.720
 it would be this you just have to give 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.280
 the X and and then simply because we 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.710
 will say if we want to enter the activity 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.369
 we give it here yes and when we get on the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.140
 cloud 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.520
 we will see that it will be loading the menu 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.020
 options this one 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.670
 as I say, it was simply to give 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.380
 to the circle and it already appeared to leave what 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.450
 happens that now it does not work simply 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.429
 what you have to do is accept it let's read 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.229
 to confirm and well, it will turn out that 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.759
 if we want to play ourselves alone because 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.740
 there are some missions that can only be 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.960
 do with more than two people so 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.880
 we have to choose the ones with a 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.829
 person and good then when 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.170
 starting the session or we are loading 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.329
 this simply because when the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.789
 button confirm what we will have to 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.259
 to do is to give the circle and we give 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.390
 the X to accept what we want 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.250
 leave this activity and well then 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.950
 simply when we are leaving then 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.229
 we will see that we appear in the place of 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.640
 map where we have done the mission so 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.259
 say but as we have not done and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.119
 we have only given him before 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.310
 confirm leave because it will take us 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.780
 until that place and as I already say it goes 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.420
 very very well in case we want 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.369
 move from one place to another and it's so 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.259
 simple how to do that and so we 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.789
 we will save a lot of time at the time of 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.349
 move so well I hope so 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.849
