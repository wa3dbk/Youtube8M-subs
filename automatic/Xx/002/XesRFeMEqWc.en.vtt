00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.850
 Alsatian culture of bilingualism does it work 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.880
 but in the small head of his children a second language it worked very 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.630

 German speaking dialectophones remember in our classes 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.739

 the picnic radio things like that 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.430

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.400
