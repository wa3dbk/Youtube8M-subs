 the sonata of the devil 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.080
 it is told that giuseppe tartini composed 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.000
 his trill of the devil in 1713 inspired 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.710
 for a dream where he saw the evil one at the foot 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.350
 from his bed play a melody in his 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.900

 despite its beauty 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.480
 apparently it was nothing compared to what 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.720
 that he really got to hear in his 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.790
 dream 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.910
 in the monastery of san francisco de 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.250
 A tartini letter was found 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.860
 apparently it would be a letter addressed to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.310
 joseph jr where lalande astronomer 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.330
 in French that read 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.640
 one night in 1713 I dreamed I had done 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.130
 a pact with the devil and I was at my 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.070
 orders everything went wonderfully 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.990
 well all my wishes will be anticipated 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.280
 and satisfied with me for my new 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.530
 servant happened that at a given moment 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.530
 I gave myself my violin and I challenge him to play 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.270
 for me some romantic piece my 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.030
 amazement was huge when I heard it 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.820
 play with great bravery and intelligence 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.130
 a unique and romantic total area like 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.030
 I had never heard such was my 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.580
 ecstatic wonder and delight that I was left 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.650
 stunned and a violent emotion 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.290
 woke up 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.510
 I immediately took my violin wishing 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.850
 remember at least part of what 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.970
 I had just heard but it was in vain 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.240
 the sonata that I composed then is for 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.960
 far the best I have ever described and 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.880
 I still call her the sonata of the devil but 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.500
 it was so inferior to the one I had heard 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.440
 in the dream that I would have liked 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.310
 break my violin into pieces and leave 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.310
 music forever 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.080
 it's not the only case of melodies 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.840
 Inspired or dictated by the same 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.750
