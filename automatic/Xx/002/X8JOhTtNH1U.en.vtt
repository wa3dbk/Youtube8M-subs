00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
more depth on this little add-on that I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.040 
more depth on this little add-on that I
recently<00:00:24.150> found<00:00:24.769> through<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.890> website<00:00:27.050> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
recently found through this website the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.470 
recently found through this website the
add-on<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.590> called<00:00:29.310> unfold<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.330> actually

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
add-on is called unfold and it actually

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.040 
add-on is called unfold and it actually
gives<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.260> cool<00:00:32.070> effect<00:00:32.480> where<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
gives like this cool effect where it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.549 
gives like this cool effect where it
unfolds<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.730> geometry<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.110> mesh<00:00:39.500> now<00:00:40.500> I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
unfolds the geometry of the mesh now I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.420 
unfolds the geometry of the mesh now I
found<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.070> through<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.399> website<00:00:41.940> called

hahahaha you go to user and then you
find<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:46.560> unfold<00:01:47.040> transition<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.780> then

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
find the unfold transition see and then

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.840 
find the unfold transition see and then
you<00:01:49.560> check<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:52.710> even<00:01:52.950> tells<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.310> what<00:01:53.759> it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you check it it even tells you what it

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.510 
you check it it even tells you what it
does<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.390> where<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.020> find<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.520> yeah

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
does and where you can find it yeah

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.910 
does and where you can find it yeah
simple<00:01:56.850> unfold<00:01:57.360> transition<00:01:57.990> animation<00:01:58.710> will

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
simple unfold transition animation will

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.770 
simple unfold transition animation will
separate<00:01:59.340> faces<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.119> setup<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.840> armature

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.570 

so<00:02:04.170> let's<00:02:04.680> see<00:02:04.950> what<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.310> does<00:02:05.930> let's<00:02:06.930> try<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
so let's see what it does let's try to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.620 
so let's see what it does let's try to
have<00:02:08.580> something<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> little<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:09.479> more

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
have something with a little bit more

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.010 
have something with a little bit more
geometry<00:02:09.929> than<00:02:10.380> just<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.830> simple<00:02:11.670> cube<00:02:12.020> I'm

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
geometry than just this simple cube I'm

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:24.400 
geometry than just this simple cube I'm
going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.350> delete<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:14.780> shift<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:18.950> have<00:02:19.950> monkey

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.300 

all<00:02:25.410> right<00:02:27.320> I'm<00:02:28.320> just<00:02:28.560> going<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.860> move<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
all right I'm just going to move the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.660 
all right I'm just going to move the
camera<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.209> little<00:02:30.420> bit<00:02:30.570> closer<00:02:34.670> all

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
camera just a little bit closer all

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.780 
camera just a little bit closer all
right<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.709> then<00:02:37.709> we're<00:02:37.920> going<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.190> go<00:02:38.340> into

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
right and then we're going to go into

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.750 
right and then we're going to go into
the<00:02:39.000> animation<00:02:39.450> tab<00:02:39.900> while<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:41.130> monkey<00:02:41.520> is

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
the animation tab while the monkey is

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.080 
the animation tab while the monkey is
selected<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:43.440> know<00:02:43.560> make<00:02:44.010> sure<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.580> are

and then you press animate unfold now

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.180 
and then you press animate unfold now
let's<00:03:05.670> see<00:03:05.849> what<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.120> does

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
you want the folds to be you can have

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.990 
you want the folds to be you can have
them<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.000> little<00:03:24.180> bit<00:03:24.299> more<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:25.730> little<00:03:26.730> bit<00:03:26.760> more

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
random you can also have it go on a

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.309 
random you can also have it go on a
little<00:03:29.940> bit<00:03:30.060> longer<00:03:30.299> longer<00:03:31.260> than<00:03:31.879> 200<00:03:32.879> frames

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
little bit longer longer than 200 frames

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.839 
little bit longer longer than 200 frames
because<00:03:34.319> if<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.620> notice<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.069> stopped<00:03:35.670> it

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
because if you notice it stopped it

around yeah 200 frames although there

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.390

you I'm just going to delete yeah what
made<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.750> mesh<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:56.190> meshes<00:03:56.879> faces<00:03:57.680> go<00:03:58.680> all

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
made the mesh the meshes faces go all

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.369 
made the mesh the meshes faces go all
willy-nilly<00:03:59.299> was<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.510> creation<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.200> this

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
willy-nilly was the creation of this

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.500 
willy-nilly was the creation of this
little<00:04:01.650> rig<00:04:01.920> which<00:04:02.819> helped<00:04:03.420> do<00:04:03.930> all<00:04:04.079> that

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
little rig which helped do all that

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.890 
little rig which helped do all that
anyway<00:04:07.250> let's<00:04:08.250> have<00:04:08.639> another<00:04:09.299> monkey<00:04:11.900> yeah

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
anyway let's have another monkey yeah

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.039 
anyway let's have another monkey yeah
there<00:04:13.079> are<00:04:13.200> some<00:04:13.530> restrictions<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:15.049> no

there are some restrictions in that no
matter<00:04:16.200> what<00:04:16.560> even<00:04:16.769> if<00:04:17.430> your<00:04:17.639> mesh<00:04:17.849> has<00:04:18.510> soft

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
matter what even if your mesh has soft

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.159 
matter what even if your mesh has soft
shadows<00:04:20.789> or<00:04:21.180> has<00:04:23.180> yeah<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.300> has<00:04:24.450> soft<00:04:24.720> shadows

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
shadows or has yeah it has soft shadows

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.330 
shadows or has yeah it has soft shadows
the<00:04:25.470> shadows<00:04:25.700> after<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.840> unfold<00:04:28.560> are<00:04:29.039> going

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
the shadows after the unfold are going

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.779 
the shadows after the unfold are going
to<00:04:29.460> turn<00:04:30.260> like<00:04:31.260> flat<00:04:31.560> like<00:04:32.460> watch<00:04:34.520> but<00:04:35.520> put<00:04:35.699> it

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
to turn like flat like watch but put it

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.689 
to turn like flat like watch but put it
bone

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
bone

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.450 
bone
Yesi<00:04:38.699> smooth<00:04:39.449> shadows

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
Yesi smooth shadows

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.890 
Yesi smooth shadows
and<00:04:41.580> then<00:04:42.509> I'm<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:43.110> going<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.350> set<00:04:44.220> up<00:04:44.340> unfold

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
and then I'm just going to set up unfold

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.120 
and then I'm just going to set up unfold
see<00:04:46.370> yeah<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:47.460> still<00:04:47.699> does<00:04:47.910> that

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
see yeah it still does that

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.689 
see yeah it still does that
there's<00:04:50.130> also<00:04:50.310> another<00:04:50.490> restriction<00:04:51.350> and

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
there's also another restriction and

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.879 
there's also another restriction and
it's<00:04:53.699> kind<00:04:54.000> of<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.150> weird<00:04:54.479> effect<00:04:54.660> more<00:04:55.440> so<00:04:55.680> than

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
it's kind of a weird effect more so than

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.689 
it's kind of a weird effect more so than
a<00:04:55.949> restriction<00:04:56.699> I<00:04:56.850> guess<00:04:58.100> say<00:04:59.100> that<00:04:59.310> you<00:04:59.430> have

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
a restriction I guess say that you have

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.860 
a restriction I guess say that you have
a<00:05:00.210> subdivision<00:05:00.870> surface<00:05:01.680> on<00:05:02.449> your<00:05:03.449> mesh<00:05:03.830> see

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
a subdivision surface on your mesh see

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.900 
a subdivision surface on your mesh see
the<00:05:06.870> thing<00:05:07.080> is<00:05:07.259> that<00:05:07.590> it's<00:05:08.160> also<00:05:08.430> going<00:05:08.789> to

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
the thing is that it's also going to

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:15.469 
the thing is that it's also going to
subdivide<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.900> folds<00:05:13.380> themselves<00:05:14.479> but

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
subdivide the the folds themselves but

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.050 
subdivide the the folds themselves but
in<00:05:15.720> a<00:05:15.900> way<00:05:16.050> that<00:05:16.320> looks<00:05:16.530> more<00:05:17.190> like<00:05:17.250> flower

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
in a way that looks more like flower

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.140 
in a way that looks more like flower
petals<00:05:18.210> than<00:05:19.169> actual<00:05:20.900> squares<00:05:21.900> and<00:05:22.380> I'll<00:05:23.370> show

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
petals than actual squares and I'll show

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.760 
petals than actual squares and I'll show
you<00:05:25.370> see<00:05:26.370> yeah

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
you see yeah

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.010 
you see yeah
Suzanne<00:05:28.770> is<00:05:29.190> now<00:05:29.550> made<00:05:30.180> out<00:05:30.360> of<00:05:30.539> flower<00:05:30.780> petals

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
Suzanne is now made out of flower petals

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.810 
Suzanne is now made out of flower petals
by<00:05:31.889> the<00:05:31.949> way<00:05:32.070> if<00:05:32.220> you<00:05:32.310> didn't<00:05:32.520> know<00:05:32.610> who

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
by the way if you didn't know who

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.260 
by the way if you didn't know who
Suzanne<00:05:33.330> is<00:05:33.539> it's<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:34.139> monkey<00:05:34.889> head<00:05:35.270> yeah

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
Suzanne is it's the monkey head yeah

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.779 
Suzanne is it's the monkey head yeah
that's<00:05:36.510> her<00:05:36.630> name<00:05:37.070> and<00:05:38.070> it<00:05:38.190> doesn't<00:05:38.490> matter<00:05:38.639> if

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
that's her name and it doesn't matter if

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.900 
that's her name and it doesn't matter if
you<00:05:39.180> move<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.289> up<00:05:40.440> or<00:05:40.650> down<00:05:40.770> it's<00:05:41.220> still<00:05:41.490> going

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
you move it up or down it's still going

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.659 
you move it up or down it's still going
to<00:05:42.030> have<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:42.479> effect<00:05:43.099> you<00:05:44.099> can<00:05:44.220> still<00:05:44.430> use

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
to have this effect you can still use

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.490 
to have this effect you can still use
this<00:05:44.880> effect<00:05:45.330> don't<00:05:45.840> get<00:05:45.930> me<00:05:46.020> wrong<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.440> think

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
this effect don't get me wrong I think

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.589 
this effect don't get me wrong I think
it<00:05:46.740> can<00:05:46.889> still<00:05:47.160> be<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.310> very<00:05:47.370> cool<00:05:47.820> effect<00:05:47.940> you

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
it can still be a very cool effect you

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.430 
it can still be a very cool effect you
could<00:05:48.750> use<00:05:48.900> it<00:05:49.080> as<00:05:49.260> something<00:05:49.889> like<00:05:50.370> a<00:05:51.440> flower

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
could use it as something like a flower

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.159 
could use it as something like a flower
petal<00:05:53.039> creature<00:05:53.760> is<00:05:54.180> talking<00:05:54.630> to<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:54.870> or

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
petal creature is talking to you or

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:04.930 
petal creature is talking to you or
something<00:05:55.470> like<00:05:55.590> that<00:05:55.650> oh<00:05:58.070> wait<00:05:59.070> yeah

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:12.580 

yeah<00:06:10.639> pretty<00:06:11.639> cool<00:06:11.940> huh

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
yeah pretty cool huh

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.300 
yeah pretty cool huh
there<00:06:13.590> is<00:06:14.389> another<00:06:15.410> caution<00:06:16.410> that<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:16.710> do<00:06:16.800> have

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
there is another caution that I do have

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.090 
there is another caution that I do have
for<00:06:17.729> people<00:06:18.120> using<00:06:18.389> this<00:06:18.690> add-on<00:06:18.919> the<00:06:19.919> thing

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
for people using this add-on the thing

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.499 
for people using this add-on the thing
is<00:06:20.280> that<00:06:20.520> because<00:06:21.680> the<00:06:22.680> add-on<00:06:23.150> takes<00:06:24.150> apart

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
is that because the add-on takes apart

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.969 
is that because the add-on takes apart
all<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.930> phases<00:06:25.470> of<00:06:25.669> the<00:06:26.669> mesh<00:06:27.380> be<00:06:28.380> very<00:06:28.680> very

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
all the phases of the mesh be very very

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.180 
all the phases of the mesh be very very
careful<00:06:29.520> of<00:06:29.699> meshes<00:06:30.240> with<00:06:31.039> tons<00:06:32.039> of<00:06:32.520> phases<00:06:33.090> so

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
careful of meshes with tons of phases so

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.980 
careful of meshes with tons of phases so
the<00:06:35.190> more<00:06:35.370> geometry<00:06:35.729> it<00:06:36.270> has<00:06:36.479> the<00:06:36.840> more

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
the more geometry it has the more

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.850 
the more geometry it has the more
calculations<00:06:37.710> it<00:06:38.250> has<00:06:38.490> to<00:06:38.669> do<00:06:38.930> so<00:06:39.930> you<00:06:39.990> do<00:06:40.590> run

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
calculations it has to do so you do run

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.810 
calculations it has to do so you do run
the<00:06:41.010> risk<00:06:41.250> of<00:06:41.490> getting<00:06:41.669> blender<00:06:42.389> to<00:06:42.600> crash<00:06:43.820> you

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
the risk of getting blender to crash you

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.850 
the risk of getting blender to crash you
know<00:06:44.910> there<00:06:45.690> was<00:06:45.780> actually<00:06:45.900> a<00:06:46.110> point<00:06:46.289> where<00:06:46.500> I

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
know there was actually a point where I

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.680 
know there was actually a point where I
was<00:06:47.250> doing<00:06:47.520> that<00:06:47.639> with<00:06:47.820> like<00:06:48.060> a<00:06:48.090> characters

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
was doing that with like a characters

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.469 
was doing that with like a characters
face<00:06:48.990> and<00:06:49.470> it<00:06:49.590> took<00:06:49.740> like<00:06:49.949> an<00:06:50.070> hour<00:06:50.100> if<00:06:51.090> you<00:06:51.360> do

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 
face and it took like an hour if you do

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:53.810 
face and it took like an hour if you do
have<00:06:51.630> the<00:06:51.750> patience<00:06:52.380> then<00:06:52.710> go<00:06:53.160> for<00:06:53.400> it<00:06:53.550> you

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
have the patience then go for it you

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.460 
have the patience then go for it you
know<00:06:53.940> it<00:06:54.180> can<00:06:54.360> create<00:06:54.660> some<00:06:55.020> interesting

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
know it can create some interesting

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.730 
know it can create some interesting
effects<00:06:56.660> where<00:06:57.660> you<00:06:58.139> know<00:06:58.229> you<00:06:58.289> could<00:06:58.530> have<00:06:58.620> to

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
effects where you know you could have to

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.640 
effects where you know you could have to
say<00:06:58.949> have<00:06:59.400> like<00:06:59.610> a<00:06:59.639> mech<00:07:00.330> you<00:07:01.199> know<00:07:01.289> all<00:07:01.470> of<00:07:01.500> a

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
say have like a mech you know all of a

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.360 
say have like a mech you know all of a
sudden<00:07:01.919> building<00:07:02.310> themselves<00:07:02.460> together

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
sudden building themselves together

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.250 
sudden building themselves together
yeah<00:07:05.370> something<00:07:05.759> creative<00:07:06.660> like<00:07:06.690> that<00:07:09.260> yeah

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
yeah something creative like that yeah

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.650 
yeah something creative like that yeah
you<00:07:10.380> could<00:07:10.530> have<00:07:10.560> like<00:07:10.800> a<00:07:10.830> mech<00:07:11.490> helmet<00:07:12.030> all<00:07:12.330> of

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
you could have like a mech helmet all of

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.420 
you could have like a mech helmet all of
a<00:07:12.720> sudden<00:07:12.800> appearing<00:07:13.800> out<00:07:14.160> of<00:07:15.150> something

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
a sudden appearing out of something

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.110 
a sudden appearing out of something
science-fictiony<00:07:18.680> or<00:07:19.680> you<00:07:20.400> could<00:07:20.520> have<00:07:20.699> some

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
science-fictiony or you could have some

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.250 
science-fictiony or you could have some
kind<00:07:21.330> of<00:07:21.389> crystal<00:07:21.930> monster<00:07:23.300> appearing<00:07:24.300> there

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260 
kind of crystal monster appearing there

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.080 
kind of crystal monster appearing there
are<00:07:25.440> possibilities<00:07:26.130> many<00:07:26.880> many

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.090 
are possibilities many many

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:35.060 
are possibilities many many
possibilities<00:07:31.580> it's<00:07:32.580> a<00:07:32.669> cool<00:07:32.849> effect<00:07:33.180> but<00:07:34.070> do

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.070 
possibilities it's a cool effect but do

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.500 
possibilities it's a cool effect but do
keep<00:07:35.220> in<00:07:35.340> mind<00:07:35.400> that<00:07:35.699> it<00:07:35.880> does<00:07:36.060> have<00:07:36.330> some

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:36.510 
keep in mind that it does have some

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.899 
keep in mind that it does have some
restrictions<00:07:37.110> but<00:07:37.560> again<00:07:38.010> play<00:07:38.460> around<00:07:38.699> with

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:38.909 
restrictions but again play around with

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:40.129 
restrictions but again play around with
it<00:07:39.090> as<00:07:39.270> much<00:07:39.570> as<00:07:39.750> you'd<00:07:39.900> like

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:40.139 
it as much as you'd like

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.790 
it as much as you'd like
you<00:07:40.650> know<00:07:40.880> lengthen<00:07:41.880> the<00:07:42.030> time<00:07:42.560> you<00:07:43.560> can<00:07:43.680> also

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 
you know lengthen the time you can also

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.080 
you know lengthen the time you can also
scale<00:07:44.430> the<00:07:44.639> time<00:07:44.820> I<00:07:44.849> guess<00:07:45.320> but<00:07:46.320> yeah<00:07:46.669> the<00:07:47.669> time

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.090 
scale the time I guess but yeah the time

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:54.469 
scale the time I guess but yeah the time
of<00:07:48.590> how<00:07:49.590> the<00:07:49.650> unfolds<00:07:51.289> unfold<00:07:52.289> or<00:07:53.210> rather<00:07:54.210> the

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 
of how the unfolds unfold or rather the

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:57.469 
of how the unfolds unfold or rather the
face<00:07:54.690> is<00:07:54.900> unfold<00:07:55.260> so<00:07:56.220> thank<00:07:56.699> you<00:07:56.849> I<00:07:56.880> hope

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 
face is unfold so thank you I hope

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:02.060 
face is unfold so thank you I hope
