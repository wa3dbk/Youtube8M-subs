00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 justice in the land of black gold for more 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.519
 150 years old oil is one of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.679
 main fuels of the industry and 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.309
 of capitalism but it is expensive 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.100
 black gold and not just to ecology 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.949
 it costs life in Iraq in Libya in 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.960
 sub-Saharan Africa where the stranglehold 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.609
 oil companies is guaranteed by 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.990
 bombs massacres and beatings 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.119
 status 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 it costs money in France a market 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 more than 50 billion euros 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.309
 which pumping you a salary unless 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.790
 from 2.1 full of 40 liters to 1 euro 60 the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.850
 liter costs 1 this moment 64 euros on his 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.940
 64 euros 1 euro 30 at the most serve 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.430
 to pay the extraction the transport is 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.280
 60 cents refining and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.340
 distribution represent a maximum of 16 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.300
 % of the sum is 10 euros 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.059
 better 12 euros out of 64 or so spend the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.160
 cash the country of extraction touch a 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.530
 fee but varies according to 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.780
 negotiation skills and the number of 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.260
 bombs he took on the mouth this 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.000
 is not that which weighs the heaviest 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.549
 the bulk of the money pump goes back to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.220
 the French state that takes about 38 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.060
 euros or 60% of the tanker 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.490
 but the puncture of the state and the costs of 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.530
 oil remained almost stable in 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.640
 percentage since the beginning of the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.290
 new outbreak 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.890
 so it's the merchants who make 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.440
 raise prices 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.510
 how do they of course make the reality 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.830
 economic and political influence 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.260
 on the price of oil 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.450
 but why did the war in Libya 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.040
 boosts crude prices while 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.690
 this country weighs only 2% of the market 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.790
 as the CEO of total christophe says 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.960
 Margerie who wants maybe the card 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.480
 of the French Communist Party 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.080
 markets use these crises to 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.730
 justify their speculative operations 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.160
 you have to know that every day is exchanged 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.200
 on the market four times as much 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.260
 oil that the one actually produced or 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.540
 consume the merchants a sum vendin 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.490
 oil they do not have to people who 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.890
 do not buy it and it's the worker 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.520
 obliged to take the car that pays 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.860
 the bill 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.870
 sir the CEO of total just forget about 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.700
 tell us why when the course of the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.060
 oil drop it's not seen at the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.460
 bomb 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.860
 and yes because after the shock of the crisis 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.230
 2008 price of the barrel 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.710
 had decreased by 20% in three months 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.930
 but rates at the pump not total and the 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.460
 other tankers had forgotten must 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.380
 to say that they are very discreet of 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.250
 pass on to the pump the drops in 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.500
 barrel of oil 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.940
 simply and all means are 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.450
 good to keep prices high 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.580
 at sea next to the pedal boats we find everything 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.900
 a lot of weather that goes around 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.790
 during weeks 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.070
 pending the increase of the courses 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.780
 to deliver their oil at the moment the 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.460
 more conducive 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.350
 otherwise there is also the classic shot that 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.150
 consists in reducing the capacity of 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.570
 refining at the time of departures 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.150
 vacation 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.180
 we did the least when we needed it 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.820
 more logical and it works of thunder 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.330
 while the crisis is supposed to weigh on 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.480
 the economy 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.850
 total has garnered the trifle of 60 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.330
 billion euros in profits in five years 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.090
 in the midst of the oil crisis of 2008 near 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.190
 of 14 billion bingo shareholders 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.070
 are waiting for the next recession to 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.720
 rubbing hands with soaring 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.320
 real estate the most households 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.209
 modest 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.980
 workers are forced to 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.630
 to settle on the outskirts of large 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.040
 cities 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.020
 result of lack of public transport 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.940
 they pay more and more expensive 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.840
 the essence to get to work 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.940
 access to shops and recreation 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.820
 today a household living in zone 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.250
 peri-urban areas spend on average 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.670
 1500 euros per year to its expenses in 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.310
 fuel and in its 1500 euros 60% of 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.240
 taxes rather than taxing profits or 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.310
 the speculation 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.940
 these are the households that the state puts in 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.700
 the almond explanations the state perceives 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.060
 annually about 35 billion 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.550
 of revenue via the VAT and the 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.980
 tax on oil products so 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.950
 the more gasoline increases the more the state 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.890
 cash and as at the same time the ump 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.750
 guarantees the tax loopholes maintains 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.020
 the tax shield until 2012 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.500
 alain joly sf with taxes on 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.390
 fuels 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.580
 these are the most tax giveaways 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.419
 rich who are funded and by the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.210
 public services 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.260
 basically you pay the tax exemption 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.419
 the richest it's not nice that 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.220
 racket households in France misery 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.450
 peoples in southern countries to 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.090
 apparently oil rent 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.830
 by the groups the speculators and the 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.370
 family dynasties in the countries 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.600
 producers 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.220
 we see red in the land of black gold 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.070
 is possible to put a little 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.500
 of justice in this flammable country he 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.660
 already established limits 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.820
 a maximum price at the revised pump 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.979
 periodically history to curb the 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.560
 you number it would also be necessary that the state 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.229
 give the example and start himself by 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.140
 let go of people by decreasing by 5% the 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.520
 tax on petroleum products 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.350
 efa calm the pain it will take 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.510
 tackle the root of the evil to 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.840
 adopting an ambitious emergency plan 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.630
 to develop public transport 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.590
 obviously all of this has a cost but at 64 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.350
 euros full of gas 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.450
 it's not the dough that miss the 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.180
 profits of speculative trading on 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.860
 oil are growing juicier 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.410
 oil companies are fattening 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.539
 on the manna the justice and the 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.200
 cholesterol commands to put them to 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.720
 contribution 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.060
 we all know that the ecological imperative 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.100
 force us to change the mode of 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.810
 development and reduce our 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.530
 dependence on non energies 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.810
 renewable 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.060
 we're going well that the market logic and 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.740
 speculative sends us right into the 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.780
 Wall 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.700
 so both in the example by these 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.830
 justice measures proposing to our 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.510
 partners to follow us by organizing 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.979
 and World Energy Conference 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.979
 common good of humanity
