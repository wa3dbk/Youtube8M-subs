00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.420
 women feel very good when 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.400
 premieres sexy lingerie and especially 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.830
 new but very few have stopped to 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.379
 think that this beautiful lingerie could 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.089
 be full of dangerous bacteria and what 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.340
 is partner the chapelle investigated in 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.359
 our segment hidden threat and 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.359
 look what you found 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.770
 Many women buy underwear without 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.870
 knowing that they could have been used as 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.350
 worst of all that could contain 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.690
 dangerous bacteria 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.699
 these were the results after 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.710
 our production team the 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.300
 put to the test in an analysis of 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.489
 laboratory 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.309
 the exam started with the purchase of several 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.769
 intimate clothes in three stores 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.469
 different to the ones we will not identify 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.260
 This baby doll caught our attention 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.449
 not have any label despite 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.289
 be for sale so we decided 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.399
 include it in the exam 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.920
 The samples were carefully taken 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.580
 of each of them from the most 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.970
 cheap to the most expensive including 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.280
 sexy animal print nightgown the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.860
 samples were numbered and without detailing 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.619
 what it was about and sent to the team 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.580
 scientist from the university of nova de 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:27.430
 the florida which was the result the pair 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.330
 of more economic garments spent the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.259
 first free exam of e.coli but the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.149
 relief lasted little all had 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.600
 staphylococcus and when we say all 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.149
 we refer to all including 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.130
 more expensive clothes and those of reasonable price 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.470
 I had the Staphylococcus bacteria 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.380
 Staphylococcus is a skin infection 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.170
 then it can be transmitted by 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.570
 If you have a wound on your skin 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.610
 battery can enter but the surprise 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.890
 was greater when in the garments of 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.680
 modest price we found that one of 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.380
 they had the dangerous bacteria of 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.160
 e.coli and what about the sexy nightgown that 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.650
 we bought for incredible curiosity the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.430
 analysis indicated that he had both 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.920
 bacteria in staphylococci and eli with the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.500
 Underwear can be very dangerous 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.390
 as a focus of infection that could be 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.370
 an implication because women 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.030
 they have more urinary tract infections than 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.280
 mens 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.880
 with these results we go to the street 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.319
 to find reactions 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:41.959
 the ingoal and the staphylococcus 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.959
 jeans or because alcohol is already 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.690
 in the butt are a very intimate thing and 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.750
 they should not accept the change in 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.459
 stores definitely put us to 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.380
 questions if there should be a 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.290
 policy that prohibits the return of 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.660
 these clothes that's why the recommendation is 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.989
 very simple after removing the label 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.720
 your intimate garment be sure to wash it 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.680
 before using it and thus eliminates everything 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.680
 possible germ 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.160
 by women will no longer see anymore 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.720
 the clothes of that day in the stores of 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.340
 same way thanks for that report 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.470
 social chapel and by the board of 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.590
 wash them before using them for the first time 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.590
 time
