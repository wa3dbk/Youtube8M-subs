00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hi guys in today's tutorial i want to

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.470 
hi guys in today's tutorial i want to
show<00:00:02.460> you<00:00:02.490> how<00:00:02.820> you<00:00:02.879> can<00:00:03.060> build<00:00:03.240> a

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
show you how you can build a

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.720 
show you how you can build a
transportation<00:00:04.319> system<00:00:04.470> with<00:00:04.950> slime<00:00:05.460> blocks

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
transportation system with slime blocks

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.000 
transportation system with slime blocks
and<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.359> course<00:00:06.600> i'm<00:00:06.810> doing<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.620> my

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
and of course i'm doing that on my

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.500 
and of course i'm doing that on my
creative<00:00:08.460> server<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.880> can<00:00:09.120> join<00:00:09.330> as

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
creative server that you can join as

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.020 
creative server that you can join as
well<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.559> biggest<00:00:10.740> problem<00:00:10.950> was<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.670> slime

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
well the biggest problem was the slime

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.879 
well the biggest problem was the slime
block<00:00:12.240> transportation<00:00:12.840> systems<00:00:13.259> was<00:00:13.650> that

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
block transportation systems was that

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.640 
block transportation systems was that
you<00:00:14.040> got<00:00:14.219> suffocation<00:00:15.000> damage<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.650> survival

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
you got suffocation damage in survival

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.220 
you got suffocation damage in survival
minecraft<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.699> try<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> build<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.510> design<00:00:18.930> where

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
minecraft so try to build a design where

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.340 
minecraft so try to build a design where
you<00:00:19.350> get<00:00:19.560> none<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.400> almost<00:00:21.060> non<00:00:21.359> suffocation

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
you get none to almost non suffocation

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.620 
you get none to almost non suffocation
or<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.830> damage<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.119> what<00:00:24.300> i<00:00:24.330> came<00:00:24.449> up

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
or for damage and this is what i came up

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.990 
or for damage and this is what i came up
with<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.260> let<00:00:25.500> me<00:00:25.529> quickly<00:00:25.740> show<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:26.760> this

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
with so let me quickly show you how this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.310 
with so let me quickly show you how this
works<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.050> step<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.710> here<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.210> it<00:00:30.210> will

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
works you just step in here and it will

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.889 
works you just step in here and it will
push<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.529> over<00:00:31.920> until<00:00:32.210> you<00:00:33.210> reach<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.480> other

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
push you over until you reach the other

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.620 
push you over until you reach the other
side<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.620> i<00:00:35.280> don't<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:35.940> anything<00:00:36.329> but

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
side and i don't have to do anything but

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.119 
side and i don't have to do anything but
yeah<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.890> look<00:00:38.610> around<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.739> then<00:00:40.739> I'm<00:00:40.920> back

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
yeah just look around and then I'm back

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.360 
yeah just look around and then I'm back
here<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.149> side<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.649> guess<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:44.129> it's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
here on the side so I guess now it's

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.860 
here on the side so I guess now it's
time<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.670> I'll<00:00:45.030> show<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> how<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.719> can

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
time that I'll show you how you can

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.670 
time that I'll show you how you can
build<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:48.450> biggest<00:00:48.930> problem<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.559> me

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
build this the biggest problem for me

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.630 
build this the biggest problem for me
was<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:51.329> slambaux<00:00:51.750> transportation<00:00:52.410> is

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
was that the slambaux transportation is

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.790 
was that the slambaux transportation is
not<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:54.059> reliable<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.260> depends<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.770> bit

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
not really reliable so it depends a bit

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.069 
not really reliable so it depends a bit
on<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.100> connection<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.809> will<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
on your connection and you will have to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.990 
on your connection and you will have to
play<00:00:58.379> around<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> delay<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.550> little<00:00:59.879> bit

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
play around with the delay a little bit

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.930 
play around with the delay a little bit
until<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.690> figure<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.500> good<00:01:02.039> good<00:01:02.730> way<00:01:02.910> for

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
until you figure out a good good way for

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.109 
until you figure out a good good way for
your<00:01:03.510> server<00:01:03.750> i<00:01:03.870> also<00:01:04.140> tried<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
your server i also tried this on a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.730 
your server i also tried this on a
single<00:01:06.119> player<00:01:06.299> word<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.869> could<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
single player word and I could do it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.510 
single player word and I could do it
there<00:01:08.100> almost<00:01:08.880> without<00:01:09.030> any<00:01:09.510> delay<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.530> yes

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
there almost without any delay so yes

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.460 
there almost without any delay so yes
you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.299> regular<00:01:12.720> pattern<00:01:13.110> which

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you can see it's a regular pattern which

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.859 
you can see it's a regular pattern which
repeats<00:01:13.950> itself<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.490> always<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
repeats itself it's always one up and

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.010 
repeats itself it's always one up and
one<00:01:15.930> down<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.460> main<00:01:17.729> design<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.780> same

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
one down but the main design is the same

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.370 
one down but the main design is the same
so<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.310> between<00:01:20.509> these<00:01:22.400> yeah<00:01:23.420> designs<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.810> in

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
so in between these yeah designs on in

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.380 
so in between these yeah designs on in
these<00:01:25.580> inventory<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.640> these<00:01:26.790> parts<00:01:27.150> they<00:01:27.270> are

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
these inventory in these parts they are

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.770 
these inventory in these parts they are
here<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:28.380> two<00:01:28.619> three<00:01:28.650> four<00:01:29.430> five<00:01:29.460> six<00:01:30.270> blocks

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
here one two three four five six blocks

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
here one two three four five six blocks
and<00:01:31.909> then<00:01:32.909> between<00:01:33.240> these<00:01:33.689> two<00:01:34.490> if<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.729> count

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and then between these two if we count

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.240 
and then between these two if we count
again<00:01:36.360> from<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.930> glowstone<00:01:37.320> block<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.920> two

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
again from the glowstone block one two

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.170 
again from the glowstone block one two
three<00:01:38.280> four<00:01:38.909> five<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.759> it's<00:01:41.759> always<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.970> little

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
three four five so it's always a little

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.389 
three four five so it's always a little
bit<00:01:42.420> bigger<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.290> gap<00:01:43.470> when<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:43.860> down<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
bit bigger of a gap when you go down and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.490 
bit bigger of a gap when you go down and
the<00:01:44.430> small<00:01:44.729> again<00:01:44.970> when<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.299> go<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.630> again<00:01:45.930> so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the small again when you go up again so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.410 
the small again when you go up again so
right<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.759> count<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.119> six

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
right here we will have to count out six

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.490 
right here we will have to count out six
blocks<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:50.990> then<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.460> place<00:01:53.850> down

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
blocks and then we can just place down

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
blocks and then we can just place down
the<00:01:55.500> next<00:01:55.979> machine<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.299> would<00:01:57.390> have

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the next machine here so we would have

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.209 
the next machine here so we would have
to<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.930> down<00:01:58.350> by<00:01:59.009> one<00:01:59.219> block<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.770> we<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
to go down by one block so we can do it

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.760 
to go down by one block so we can do it
right<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.869> said<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.290> count<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
right here and as I said we count to the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.469 
right here and as I said we count to the
glow<00:02:05.040> sunblock<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.610> maybe<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.880> should<00:02:06.180> place

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
glow sunblock so maybe I should place

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.730 
glow sunblock so maybe I should place
that<00:02:06.869> first<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.500> would<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.390> right<00:02:09.739> here<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
that first it would be right here and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.300 
that first it would be right here and
then<00:02:12.950> we<00:02:13.430> can<00:02:13.640> place<00:02:13.940> down<00:02:14.390> our<00:02:14.920> Pistons<00:02:15.920> maybe

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
then we can place down our Pistons maybe

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.700 
then we can place down our Pistons maybe
first<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:16.970> as<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.240> can<00:02:17.390> see<00:02:17.630> from<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
first so as you can see from the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.500 
first so as you can see from the
glowstone<00:02:19.100> block<00:02:19.310> it's<00:02:19.550> one<00:02:20.060> over<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
glowstone block it's one over to the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.870 
glowstone block it's one over to the
side<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.050> two<00:02:21.590> over<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.370> direction<00:02:22.430> of

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
side and two over in the direction of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.440 
side and two over in the direction of
traveling<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.730> yeah<00:02:25.730> then<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.270> just

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
traveling and yeah then we can just

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.270 
traveling and yeah then we can just
place<00:02:26.750> down<00:02:26.960> our<00:02:27.140> Pistons<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:27.650> one<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:27.980> pushing

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
place down our Pistons so one is pushing

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.440 
place down our Pistons so one is pushing
the<00:02:28.400> player<00:02:28.670> upwards<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:30.010> then<00:02:31.270> one<00:02:32.270> is

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the player upwards and then one is

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.490 
the player upwards and then one is
pushing<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> player<00:02:33.290> over<00:02:33.860> by<00:02:34.280> one<00:02:34.490> block<00:02:35.500> so

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
pushing the player over by one block so

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.100 
pushing the player over by one block so
it<00:02:36.620> should<00:02:36.830> look<00:02:36.980> like<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.750> if<00:02:38.900> both

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
it should look like this so if both

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.110 
it should look like this so if both
piston<00:02:39.590> extends<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.280> slime<00:02:40.520> blocks<00:02:40.760> can't

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
piston extends the slime blocks can't

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.470 
piston extends the slime blocks can't
collide<00:02:41.660> with<00:02:41.990> each<00:02:42.020> other<00:02:42.880> then<00:02:43.880> for<00:02:44.300> the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
collide with each other then for the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.750 
collide with each other then for the
control<00:02:45.260> mechanism<00:02:45.410> we<00:02:45.890> need<00:02:46.130> some<00:02:46.430> blocks

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
control mechanism we need some blocks

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.190 
control mechanism we need some blocks
that<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.090> can't<00:02:47.300> push<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.050> use

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
that you can't push in I like to use

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.280 
that you can't push in I like to use
melons<00:02:48.650> since<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.610> can't<00:02:49.870> click<00:02:50.870> them<00:02:51.050> an

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
melons since you can't click them an

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.060 
melons since you can't click them an
accident<00:02:51.890> like<00:02:52.100> you<00:02:52.880> can<00:02:53.180> do<00:02:53.420> with<00:02:54.070> furnaces

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
accident like you can do with furnaces

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.990 
accident like you can do with furnaces
and<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.490> will<00:02:55.640> just<00:02:55.790> place<00:02:56.210> a<00:02:56.510> melon<00:02:57.050> here<00:02:57.380> and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
and you will just place a melon here and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.150 
and you will just place a melon here and
melon<00:02:59.000> behind<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.690> on<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.410> melon<00:03:00.710> on<00:03:00.800> front

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
melon behind and on the melon on front

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.270 
melon behind and on the melon on front
will<00:03:01.430> place<00:03:01.790> any<00:03:02.150> iron<00:03:02.960> pressure<00:03:03.290> plate<00:03:03.620> since

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
will place any iron pressure plate since

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.710 
will place any iron pressure plate since
this<00:03:04.490> one<00:03:04.700> has<00:03:04.910> almost<00:03:05.360> no<00:03:06.490> delay<00:03:07.490> or<00:03:07.760> no<00:03:08.060> time

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
this one has almost no delay or no time

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.650 
this one has almost no delay or no time
when<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.050> step<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.710> and<00:03:09.830> go<00:03:10.040> off<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.430> will

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
when you step on it and go off it will

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.540 
when you step on it and go off it will
turn<00:03:11.660> off<00:03:11.840> immediately<00:03:12.110> while<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:13.100> stone

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
turn off immediately while a stone

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.590 
turn off immediately while a stone
pressure<00:03:13.790> plate<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.210> wouldn't<00:03:14.450> pressure

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
pressure plate and it wouldn't pressure

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.810 
pressure plate and it wouldn't pressure
plate<00:03:14.900> will<00:03:15.110> stay<00:03:15.460> activated<00:03:16.460> for<00:03:16.490> a<00:03:16.700> little

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
plate will stay activated for a little

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.790 
plate will stay activated for a little
bit<00:03:17.030> then<00:03:17.870> we<00:03:17.990> make<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.200> little<00:03:18.530> bit<00:03:18.590> of<00:03:18.650> a

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
bit then we make a little bit of a

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.130 
bit then we make a little bit of a
container<00:03:19.100> here<00:03:19.400> where<00:03:19.580> we<00:03:19.670> can<00:03:19.700> place<00:03:20.140> water

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
container here where we can place water

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.880 
container here where we can place water
in<00:03:21.470> in<00:03:21.770> just<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.640> moment<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.710> this<00:03:24.710> one

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
in in just a moment and this one

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.380 
in in just a moment and this one
actually<00:03:25.070> needs<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.550> be<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.700> glowstone<00:03:26.180> block

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
actually needs to be a glowstone block

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.690 
actually needs to be a glowstone block
you<00:03:26.810> can<00:03:26.960> use<00:03:27.140> half<00:03:27.380> slab<00:03:27.650> see<00:03:27.800> as<00:03:27.890> well<00:03:28.160> but

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
you can use half slab see as well but

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.670 
you can use half slab see as well but
I'd<00:03:28.880> like<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.240> use<00:03:29.600> closed<00:03:29.960> on<00:03:30.140> since<00:03:30.410> they<00:03:30.620> are

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
I'd like to use closed on since they are

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.260 
I'd like to use closed on since they are
easy<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.070> place<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.640> just<00:03:31.880> need<00:03:32.030> something

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
easy to place you just need something

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.860 
easy to place you just need something
where<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:32.990> can<00:03:33.080> wire<00:03:33.320> upwards<00:03:33.920> through<00:03:34.070> and

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
where you can wire upwards through and

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.810 
where you can wire upwards through and
then<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:36.020> can<00:03:36.290> just<00:03:36.740> make<00:03:37.520> a<00:03:37.550> little

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
then you can just make a little

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.100 
then you can just make a little
staircase<00:03:38.270> with<00:03:38.960> redstone<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:40.450> now<00:03:41.450> for<00:03:41.870> the

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
staircase with redstone and now for the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.170 
staircase with redstone and now for the
delay<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:42.680> told<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.070> about<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.640> is<00:03:44.030> now

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
delay that I told you about that is now

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.710 
delay that I told you about that is now
the<00:03:44.210> part<00:03:44.570> over<00:03:45.320> here<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.850> normally<00:03:47.240> it<00:03:47.690> should

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
the part over here so normally it should

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.260 
the part over here so normally it should
work<00:03:48.140> by<00:03:48.500> placing<00:03:48.830> just<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.400> redstone<00:03:49.700> here<00:03:50.030> and

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
work by placing just a redstone here and

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.260 
work by placing just a redstone here and
here<00:03:50.600> and<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:51.620> repeater<00:03:52.160> on<00:03:52.280> one<00:03:52.550> tick<00:03:52.700> delay<00:03:53.000> so

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
here and a repeater on one tick delay so

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.860 
here and a repeater on one tick delay so
this<00:03:53.540> one<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.840> wanting<00:03:54.200> after<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.740> one<00:03:54.950> but

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
this one is wanting after that one but

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.200 
this one is wanting after that one but
on<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.680> server<00:03:57.950> this<00:03:58.250> won't<00:03:58.490> work<00:03:58.670> so<00:03:59.000> I

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
on the server this won't work so I

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.240 
on the server this won't work so I
figured<00:03:59.870> out<00:03:59.990> that<00:04:00.170> on<00:04:00.350> this<00:04:00.530> server<00:04:00.770> it<00:04:01.010> works

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
figured out that on this server it works

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.430 
figured out that on this server it works
with<00:04:01.520> two<00:04:01.790> tix<00:04:02.090> delay<00:04:02.450> here<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.020> three<00:04:03.230> tix

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
with two tix delay here and three tix

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.260 
with two tix delay here and three tix
here<00:04:03.620> but<00:04:03.800> it's<00:04:03.950> still<00:04:04.250> three<00:04:05.030> takes

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
here but it's still three takes

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.460 
here but it's still three takes
difference<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:07.690> then<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.810> can<00:04:08.959> just<00:04:09.170> place<00:04:09.440> a

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
difference and then you can just place a

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.620 
difference and then you can just place a
block<00:04:09.740> there<00:04:10.070> and<00:04:11.320> redstone<00:04:12.320> over<00:04:12.830> here<00:04:13.070> and

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
block there and redstone over here and

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.510 
block there and redstone over here and
then<00:04:15.220> we<00:04:16.220> can<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:16.430> place<00:04:16.850> in<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.390> water<00:04:17.630> and

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
then we can just place in the water and

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.190 
then we can just place in the water and
now<00:04:19.520> you<00:04:19.580> saw<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.480> there's<00:04:20.900> another

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
now you saw that there's another

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.380 
now you saw that there's another
difference<00:04:21.710> between<00:04:22.550> these<00:04:22.729> two<00:04:22.790> we<00:04:23.240> have

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
difference between these two we have

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.030 
difference between these two we have
cobblestone<00:04:23.900> fence<00:04:24.140> on<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.410> lower<00:04:24.560> ones<00:04:24.830> and

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
cobblestone fence on the lower ones and

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.620 
cobblestone fence on the lower ones and
glass<00:04:25.790> on

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
glass on

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.310 
glass on
upper<00:04:26.960> ones<00:04:27.170> and<00:04:27.410> that's<00:04:27.980> just<00:04:28.340> because<00:04:29.320> the

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
upper ones and that's just because the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.260 
upper ones and that's just because the
hitbox<00:04:30.980> is<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.220> bit<00:04:31.490> different<00:04:31.700> here<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.180> there

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
hitbox is a bit different here and there

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.480 
hitbox is a bit different here and there
was<00:04:32.390> a<00:04:32.420> bit<00:04:32.630> of<00:04:32.660> figuring<00:04:33.560> out<00:04:33.800> what<00:04:34.460> works

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
was a bit of figuring out what works

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.390 
was a bit of figuring out what works
best<00:04:35.060> so<00:04:35.300> you<00:04:35.570> have<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.140> place<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.650> caboose<00:04:37.220> on

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
best so you have to place a caboose on

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.600 
best so you have to place a caboose on
fans<00:04:37.730> here<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.810> on<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.650> other<00:04:39.800> ones<00:04:40.070> just<00:04:40.190> to

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
fans here and on the other ones just to

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.570 
fans here and on the other ones just to
glass<00:04:40.850> so<00:04:41.780> when<00:04:42.170> I<00:04:42.200> step<00:04:42.590> in<00:04:42.800> here<00:04:43.130> hope<00:04:43.370> this

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
glass so when I step in here hope this

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
glass so when I step in here hope this
works<00:04:43.790> now<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.620> will<00:04:45.620> land<00:04:45.800> in<00:04:45.950> there<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:47.330> didn't

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
works now I will land in there it didn't

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.240 
works now I will land in there it didn't
work<00:04:47.750> now<00:04:47.900> because<00:04:48.200> I<00:04:48.230> started<00:04:48.800> from<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.130> one

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
work now because I started from the one

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.480 
work now because I started from the one
wrong<00:04:49.670> place<00:04:49.970> i<00:04:50.180> guess<00:04:50.710> but<00:04:51.710> yeah<00:04:51.860> that's<00:04:52.070> just

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
wrong place i guess but yeah that's just

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.280 
wrong place i guess but yeah that's just
the<00:04:52.760> basic<00:04:53.180> design<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.720> i<00:04:54.080> hope<00:04:54.230> that

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
the basic design and i hope that

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.250 
the basic design and i hope that
somebody<00:04:54.800> can<00:04:55.430> maybe<00:04:56.210> play<00:04:56.570> around<00:04:56.780> with<00:04:57.050> this

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
somebody can maybe play around with this

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.080 
somebody can maybe play around with this
and<00:04:57.500> improve<00:04:58.010> it<00:04:58.160> it's<00:04:58.310> not<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.670> best<00:04:58.760> design

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
and improve it it's not the best design

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.180 
and improve it it's not the best design
since<00:04:59.270> it's<00:04:59.420> not<00:04:59.570> completely<00:04:59.930> reliable<00:05:00.380> but

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
since it's not completely reliable but

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.270 
since it's not completely reliable but
that's<00:05:01.430> due<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.450> slime<00:05:02.750> blocks<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:03.320> i

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
that's due to the slime blocks and i

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.360 
that's due to the slime blocks and i
hope<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.520> mode<00:05:04.970> ring<00:05:05.210> will<00:05:06.200> do<00:05:07.070> something

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
hope that mode ring will do something

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.730 
hope that mode ring will do something
about<00:05:08.060> it<00:05:08.360> in<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:08.660> future<00:05:08.810> that<00:05:09.110> it<00:05:09.230> becomes<00:05:09.650> a

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
about it in the future that it becomes a

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.140 
about it in the future that it becomes a
little<00:05:09.950> bit<00:05:10.040> more<00:05:10.190> reliable<00:05:10.700> what<00:05:10.880> we<00:05:11.030> will

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
little bit more reliable what we will

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.240 
little bit more reliable what we will
see<00:05:11.330> in<00:05:11.480> the<00:05:11.570> future<00:05:11.720> episodes<00:05:12.350> until<00:05:12.590> then

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
see in the future episodes until then

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.030 
see in the future episodes until then
this<00:05:13.760> is<00:05:13.820> a<00:05:13.970> nice<00:05:14.480> contraption<00:05:15.470> if<00:05:15.770> you<00:05:15.860> want

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
this is a nice contraption if you want

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.710 
this is a nice contraption if you want
to<00:05:16.100> play<00:05:16.310> in<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.550> snapshots<00:05:16.970> in<00:05:17.060> Survivor<00:05:17.450> and

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
to play in the snapshots in Survivor and

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.300

want<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:17.990> make<00:05:18.170> a<00:05:18.230> coup<00:05:18.470> sent<00:05:18.680> transportation

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
want to make a coup sent transportation

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.000 
want to make a coup sent transportation
system<00:05:19.670> and<00:05:20.170> yeah<00:05:21.170> I<00:05:21.200> guess<00:05:21.500> that's<00:05:21.740> all<00:05:21.950> for
