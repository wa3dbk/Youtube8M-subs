00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
liked it and when I wore the tops in

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.780 
liked it and when I wore the tops in
video<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:10.769> many<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.099> like<00:00:11.250> where<00:00:11.550> did<00:00:11.700> you

get that where did you get that so I
think<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.980> should<00:00:14.130> start<00:00:14.309> saying<00:00:14.460> one<00:00:14.759> what<00:00:15.000> I'm

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
think I should start saying one what I'm

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.090 
think I should start saying one what I'm
wearing<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.420> videos<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.719> two<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.440> probably

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
wearing in videos and two I'm probably

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.010 
wearing in videos and two I'm probably
just<00:00:17.340> doing<00:00:17.460> more<00:00:17.640> hauls<00:00:17.940> from<00:00:18.390> these

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
just doing more hauls from these

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.029 
just doing more hauls from these
different<00:00:19.320> sites<00:00:19.500> because<00:00:19.830> they<00:00:19.859> don't

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
different sites because they don't

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.519 
different sites because they don't
really<00:00:20.130> have<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:21.060> mean<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> never<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
really have like I mean I never have a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.320 
really have like I mean I never have a
place<00:00:22.680> form<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.400> all<00:00:23.609> haul<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.910> guess<00:00:24.210> it

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
place form that I'm all haul I guess it

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.250 
place form that I'm all haul I guess it
could<00:00:24.420> be<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.539> collective<00:00:24.900> haul<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.050> don't

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
could be a collective haul I don't

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.029 
could be a collective haul I don't
really<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.529> those<00:00:25.650> so

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
really do those so

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.769 
really do those so
so<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.310> actually<00:00:26.490> placed<00:00:26.910> another<00:00:27.090> order<00:00:27.269> for

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
so I actually placed another order for

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.990 
so I actually placed another order for
the<00:00:28.109> change<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.529> seasons<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.279> karma<00:00:29.640> loop<00:00:29.820> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the change of seasons with karma loop I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.820 
the change of seasons with karma loop I
ordered<00:00:30.869> some<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.170> these<00:00:31.230> from<00:00:31.439> karma<00:00:31.710> loop

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
ordered some of these from karma loop

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.319 
ordered some of these from karma loop
and<00:00:31.980> some<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.160> these<00:00:32.219> from<00:00:32.399> miski<00:00:32.669> alamos<00:00:33.059> KL

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and some of these from miski alamos KL

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.760 
and some of these from miski alamos KL
is<00:00:33.480> basically<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.020> same<00:00:34.170> branch<00:00:34.440> they<00:00:34.620> have

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
is basically the same branch they have

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.560 
is basically the same branch they have
on<00:00:34.890> karma<00:00:35.190> loop<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.030> also<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.420> like

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
on karma loop but they also have like

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840 
on karma loop but they also have like
their<00:00:36.750> own<00:00:36.899> brand<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.100> their<00:00:38.280> own<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.790> don't

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
their own brand so their own I don't

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.979 
their own brand so their own I don't
know<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.270> makes<00:00:39.390> sense<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
know if that makes sense you have to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.299 
know if that makes sense you have to
check<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.290> out<00:00:40.379> I'll<00:00:40.559> put<00:00:40.680> both<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> links
