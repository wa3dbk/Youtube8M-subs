00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Host 1: I will give you a question that was actually given in the past Korean Ethics Exam.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.380
[Question] I saw that my friend stole another friend's item and put in in his backpack.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.440
What would be the most ethically right behavior in response to my friend?

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.720
[Answer Choice] 1. Put the stolen item to original place.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.820
2. Talk to homeroom teachers in order to prevent my friend from making more serious mistakes.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.980
3. Call my friend secretly and persuade him to return the stolen item to the original place.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.880
[Both Host 2 &amp; 3] Wow, it's too difficult!

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.940
[sub: Not easy at all.]

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.120
4. Think about why he stole the item.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.240
Please hands up the number you want to choose for answer.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.580
Who will choose number 1: Put the stolen item to original place?___No One

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.800
Who will choose number 2: Tell teachers what I saw in order to prevent my friend from making more serious mistakes?___Tyler from USA

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.520
[sub: Only Tyler chose number 2.]

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.680
How about number 3: Call my friend secretly and persuade him to return__South Korea, Italy, France, Japan, Nepal, Ghana, Russia, Germany, and Canada

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.480
But Zhang Yu'an (Chinese) did not choose any answer choices yet.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.300
Will you choose number 4: At first, think about why my friend might steal an item from another friend's backpack?___China

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.880
[All laugh]

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.420
Err... Why did he steal? Err...

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.220
Err...

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.240
[sub: What's problem? Err..]

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.400
Why did you choose number 4, Zhang Yu'an (Chinese)?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.860
Can you please tell us the reasons that you chose number 4?

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.140
I was surprised by other people's choices. Why did everyone choose answer choice 3?

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.120
[sub: I am very curious] Oh, that's becasue each person from different nation might hold different point of view.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.640
There is a proverb in China: You cannot guarantee that everything you saw through your eyes is true all the time.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.580
[Three show hosts all surprised by  Zhang Yu'an's comment]

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.580
In answer choice number 1,2, and 3, "I" judge the situation based on what "I" saw, and jumped to a conclusion that my friend is a thief.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.900
But that is only "my" understanding of my friend's action through my eyes.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.560
Host 3: So, you mean that the stolen item might be originally my friend's item?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.220
[Sub: "I" should judge the situation carefully]

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.100
Host: Oh, wow! How could you come up with this idea? [Zhang Yu'an: Or maybe there might be another reason]

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.060
Tyler (American): My answer is similar with your one in some ways.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.420
I believe that "I" as a student am not responsible to deal with a problem occurred in a classroom.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.520
[Others: Oh, yeah]

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.320
If "I" tried to order my friend to return the stolen item to the original place by pretending that "I" am a police,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.940
it looks too extreme since "I" do not have rights to command something to my friend.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.900
Instead, this is something that a teacher has to do.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.620
There is another reason. Given that my friend actually "stole" another's item,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.500
my friend must get punishment for his action that violates the school rules and social moral principal.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.520
Robin (French): You're right, but in this situation he is your friend.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.140
Actually the term "friend" does not include such an important values

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.080
[Everyone is surprised.] Oh, really?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.840
A "friend" can be just a person who is taking a same class with me.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.920
Furthermore, just for a reason that he is my classmate, I must not hide his fault.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.780
Julian (Belgian): In Belgium, if you did not defend your friend, people think that you are bad.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.900
It is because of the history of "Resistance."

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.880
[Resistance: any of various secret and clandestine groups that sprang up throughout German-occupied Europe during World War II to oppose Nazi rule]

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.700
So, the Belgium and French think that protecting your friend is the best virtue.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.880
If you told on your friends to the teacher, other friends think that you are very disloyal.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.380
Rather than telling on my friend to the teacher, I think it would be better to ask my friend directly about his action to check what the truth is

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.720
and for next step, you can think about what you should do.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.020
Tyler (American): But, I think we can think in another way here.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.260
If you tried to solve this problem only with your friend without any intervention of an "adult,"

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.420
your action can be interpreted as a tacit agreement that you will not talk about your friend's fault to anyone.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.420
In other words, you eventually participate in an immoral action.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.000
But at least, you can "try" to persuade your friend to regret his immoral behavior

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.540
But if it does not work well, then at that time you can tell your teacher.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.980
If you directly tell on your friend to your teacher, it is quite bad and disloyal to your friend.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.180
Jiyoung (South Korea): Since I am his friend, I might know about his personality or characteristics very well than others

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.880
[Sub: Right, right]

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.860
So, I will try to persuade my friend quickly before others know about my friend's misbehavior

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.620
in order to protect my friend from falling into worse situation (such as being stigmatized as a thief)

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.780
Alberto [Italy]: There is no right answer here

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.860
There is no clearly right answer here, but according to South Korea's ethics teacher,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.400
the correct answer is number 3: Call my friend secretly and persuade him to return the stolen item to original place

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.020
Most of you got correct.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.140
There is a reason that answer choice 3 is correct.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.500
Rather than punishing my friend for a reason that he violates a rule,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.700
it is the most ideal judgement for you to help your friend feel guilty about his misbehavior

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.680
and make morally right decisions next time.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.420
It really looks like a question in Korean ethics exam in the past.
