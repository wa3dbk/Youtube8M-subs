 first season is definitely the bicycle or 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.579
 a bit' 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:23.970
 androni club 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.539
 and because there is just that it is so 'we try to pay attention to a navy follow 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.230
 the same athletic gesture in case you even change lavis photo the malfa mai 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.800
 which could definitely be something that 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.560
 which gives you satisfaction and you do one in an area surely keats vim more 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.780
 suggestive 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.140
 it is then one begins in the gym because in any case it is the gym 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.440
 something important ferrers tone the muscles a little bit 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.650
 you have to go outside the area 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.110
 park 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.980
 Ada to have that preparation that brings you you can give a few hours without 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.460
 to be really really tired 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.040
 rm very free body stretching, which becomes very important 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.270
 because in any case the lengthening of the muscles re becomes the strength of the muscle 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.580
 same and therefore 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 the free body with stretching 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 vip with me some real weight but not everyone can exceed in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 this is because not everyone has the same musculature 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.850
 let's say lalalala 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.050
 always follow one 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.190
 a personal trainer and very well versed in those who are working with 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.480
 weights because otherwise you risk 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.990
 to go to impallarsi and then having to struggle to be able to find that again 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.630
 elasticity that cycling however require 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.219
 a race in the plains even if you do not have a great condition however there is no 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:55.190
 a great 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.190
 work 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.350
 bissoli I have outside the threshold 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.670
 in an uphill race if your condition is a bit precarious 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.850
 you really risk to make the little hearts that you need then 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.409
 definitely that week to be able to recover 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.819
 all the work you've done then 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.099
 It is normal that every effort must be made based on the condition book 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.409
 clear athletics 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:26.059
 if you have an athletic condition bows that can be 60 70 percent not 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.659
