00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.120 
very definitely not here as you're
getting<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.030> bad<00:02:03.180> data<00:02:03.450> glitch<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.469> then<00:02:04.680> you

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
getting the bad data glitch so then you

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.109 
getting the bad data glitch so then you
just<00:02:05.310> want<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.610> right-click<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.390> paste<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
just want to right-click and paste and

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.339 
just want to right-click and paste and
then<00:02:09.119> you'll<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.509> name<00:02:09.780> generation

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
then you'll have a name generation

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.860 
then you'll have a name generation
folder<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.979> now<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.300> worry<00:02:12.480> about<00:02:12.690> stuff

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
folder and now if you worry about stuff

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.790 
folder and now if you worry about stuff
like<00:02:12.930> yeah

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
like yeah

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.090 
like yeah
