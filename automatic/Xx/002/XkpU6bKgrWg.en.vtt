00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
using the b al with a k-12 in any

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.990 
using the b al with a k-12 in any
situation<00:01:28.410> i<00:01:28.590> hope<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.340> they<00:01:29.460> either<00:01:29.610> nerf

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
situation i hope that they either nerf

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
situation i hope that they either nerf
these<00:01:30.270> guns<00:01:30.480> or<00:01:30.690> maybe<00:01:30.840> buff<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.260> other<00:01:31.410> ones

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
these guns or maybe buff the other ones

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.260 
these guns or maybe buff the other ones

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
game is the movement I think that's

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.370 
game is the movement I think that's
going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> add<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> lot<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.960> competitive

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
