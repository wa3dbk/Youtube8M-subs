so<00:00:00.329> the<00:00:00.510> next<00:00:00.719> wall<00:00:01.020> run<00:00:01.230> technique<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.770> want<00:00:01.949> to

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
so the next wall run technique I want to

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.309 
so the next wall run technique I want to
teach<00:00:02.220> you<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:03.030> Tic<00:00:03.629> Tac<00:00:03.870> or<00:00:04.170> the

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
teach you is the Tic Tac or the

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.380 
teach you is the Tic Tac or the
horizontal<00:00:05.040> wall<00:00:05.190> run<00:00:05.400> my<00:00:05.819> last<00:00:06.029> video<00:00:06.330> I

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
horizontal wall run my last video I

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.000 
horizontal wall run my last video I
taught<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:06.750> how<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.870> run<00:00:07.529> up<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.799> wall

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
taught you how to run up the wall

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.299 
taught you how to run up the wall
vertically<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.480> climb<00:00:10.080> up<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.469> pull<00:00:10.650> up<00:00:10.830> and

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
vertically to climb up and pull up and

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.520 
vertically to climb up and pull up and
I'm<00:00:11.370> going<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.639> teach<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.969> how<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.179> use<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> wall

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
I'm going to teach you how to use a wall

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.400 
I'm going to teach you how to use a wall
to<00:00:13.769> clear<00:00:14.130> gaps<00:00:14.639> or<00:00:14.880> distances<00:00:15.420> or<00:00:15.599> leap<00:00:15.900> over

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
to clear gaps or distances or leap over

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.960 
to clear gaps or distances or leap over
something<00:00:16.920> when<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.670> don't<00:00:17.760> necessarily

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
something when you don't necessarily

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.939 
something when you don't necessarily
have<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.480> climb<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.900> actual<00:00:19.199> law<00:00:19.320> itself<00:00:19.680> but

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
have to climb the actual law itself but

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.070 
have to climb the actual law itself but
how<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.490> use<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.029> aid<00:00:21.240> your<00:00:21.510> jump<00:00:21.840> or

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
how you can use it to aid your jump or

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.439 
how you can use it to aid your jump or
leap<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:23.010> any<00:00:23.160> kind<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.609> wall<00:00:24.119> run<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
leap so with any kind of wall run the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.550 
leap so with any kind of wall run the
basic<00:00:24.840> method<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.189> use<00:00:26.519> your<00:00:26.699> momentum<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
basic method is to use your momentum and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.560 
basic method is to use your momentum and
transfer<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> off<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.039> wall<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.390> one

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
transfer it off the wall and in this one

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.060 
transfer it off the wall and in this one
you<00:00:30.660> also<00:00:30.779> use<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> lot<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.380> your<00:00:31.590> leg<00:00:31.769> strength

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
you also use a lot of your leg strength

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.910 
you also use a lot of your leg strength
to<00:00:32.700> jump<00:00:32.940> off<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.390> wall<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.500> how<00:00:34.559> far<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
to jump off the wall to see how far you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.450 
to jump off the wall to see how far you
can<00:00:34.950> get

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
can get

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.910 
can get
you<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.149> either<00:00:36.270> focus<00:00:36.570> your<00:00:36.899> Tic<00:00:37.110> Tac<00:00:37.380> I'm

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
you can either focus your Tic Tac I'm

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280 
you can either focus your Tic Tac I'm
pushing<00:00:38.370> away<00:00:38.460> from<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.000> wall<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.780> pushing

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
pushing away from the wall or pushing

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.049 
pushing away from the wall or pushing
along<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.770> wall<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.550> when<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> first

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
along the wall so when you first

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.799 
along the wall so when you first
approach<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.629> wall<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:43.500> you're<00:00:43.770> doing<00:00:44.100> is

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
approach a wall all you're doing is

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.850 
approach a wall all you're doing is
putting<00:00:45.809> your<00:00:45.989> foot<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> wall<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
putting your foot on the wall and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.450 
putting your foot on the wall and
pushing<00:00:47.610> off<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.360> easy<00:00:52.250> you<00:00:53.250> want<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
pushing off it's that easy you want to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
pushing off it's that easy you want to
make<00:00:53.610> sure<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> feel<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> wall<00:00:54.840> for

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
make sure you get a feel of the wall for

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.010 
make sure you get a feel of the wall for
the<00:00:55.739> grip<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.280> how<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.210> shoe<00:00:57.420> works<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the grip and how your shoe works with it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.889 
the grip and how your shoe works with it
because<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.350> will<00:00:58.590> help<00:00:58.770> aid<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.899> how

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
because that will help aid you in how

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.049 
because that will help aid you in how
you<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> tic<00:01:01.590> tac<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.910> get

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you do the tic tac as you get

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.200 
you do the tic tac as you get
comfortable<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.840> doing<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> Tic<00:01:04.979> Tac<00:01:05.220> from

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
comfortable with doing the Tic Tac from

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.810 
comfortable with doing the Tic Tac from
just<00:01:06.479> blocking<00:01:07.020> up<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.640> pushing<00:01:08.640> off<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
just blocking up to it pushing off the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.480 
just blocking up to it pushing off the
wall<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.290> start<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.860> add<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> little

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
wall you can then start to add a little

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
wall you can then start to add a little
bit<00:01:11.610> more<00:01:11.729> momentum<00:01:12.420> where<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.780> start<00:01:13.049> going

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
bit more momentum where you start going

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.020 
bit more momentum where you start going
into<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> wall<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> little<00:01:13.979> bit<00:01:14.130> faster<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
into the wall a little bit faster a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.390 
into the wall a little bit faster a
little<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.509> faster<00:01:15.659> step<00:01:16.350> by<00:01:16.530> step<00:01:16.830> because

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
little bit faster step by step because

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.910 
little bit faster step by step because
ultimately<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.360> proper<00:01:18.810> technique<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
ultimately with the proper technique the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520 
ultimately with the proper technique the
more<00:01:20.159> momentum<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.900> higher<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
more momentum you have the higher you

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.350 
more momentum you have the higher you
will<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.770> able<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.979> get<00:01:23.220> or<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.430> farther<00:01:23.850> you

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
will be able to get or the farther you

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.630 
will be able to get or the farther you
will<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.600> able<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.250> start<00:01:26.520> getting

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
will be able to get as you start getting

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.999 
will be able to get as you start getting
comfortable<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.659> Tic<00:01:27.900> Tac<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.799> can

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
comfortable with your Tic Tac you can

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.850 
comfortable with your Tic Tac you can
begin<00:01:29.540> implementing<00:01:30.540> objects<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> jump<00:01:31.530> over

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
begin implementing objects to jump over

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.429 
begin implementing objects to jump over
here<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.790> found<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.270> trashcan<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.079> set<00:01:34.320> up

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
here I found this trashcan that I set up

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.920 
here I found this trashcan that I set up
to<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.040> basic<00:01:35.189> tic<00:01:35.579> tac<00:01:35.790> over<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.750> you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
to do just a basic tic tac over if you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.289 
to do just a basic tic tac over if you
can't<00:01:37.140> find<00:01:37.350> any<00:01:37.560> objects<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.640> maybe<00:01:38.850> find<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
can't find any objects then maybe find a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.880 
can't find any objects then maybe find a
broom<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> friend<00:01:40.229> hold<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.710> for

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
broom and have a friend hold it up for

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.230 
broom and have a friend hold it up for
you<00:01:40.979> against<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> wall<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> do

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you against the wall that way if you do
