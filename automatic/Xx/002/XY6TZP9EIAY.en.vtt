00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.310 
sticks or you may not just be placed in
the<00:00:53.460> RAM<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.940> faulty<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.449> broken<00:00:54.930> or

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the RAM because it's faulty or broken or

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.869 
the RAM because it's faulty or broken or
whatever<00:00:55.769> but<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.519> how<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> actually

whatever but this is how to actually
access<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.479> compartment<00:00:58.110> for<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.350> RAM<00:00:58.820> so

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
access the compartment for the RAM so

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.079 
access the compartment for the RAM so
what<00:00:59.939> you<00:01:00.000> want<00:01:00.119> to<00:01:00.180> do<00:01:00.650> is<00:01:01.650> firstly<00:01:02.309> turn<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
what you want to do is firstly turn the

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:15.530 
what you want to do is firstly turn the
unit<00:01:03.449> around<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.290> it's<00:01:07.290> facing<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:08.009> back<00:01:14.540> like

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
unit around so it's facing you back like

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.130 
unit around so it's facing you back like
so<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> side<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.880> each<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so and then on the side of each of the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.690 
so and then on the side of each of the
actual<00:01:19.500> em<00:01:19.880> now<00:01:20.880> you'll<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.479> -<00:01:21.540> um

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
actual em now you'll not see this - um

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.490 
actual em now you'll not see this - um
well<00:01:23.700> -<00:01:24.240> push<00:01:24.509> button<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.869> each<00:01:24.990> side<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.229> use

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
well - push button on each side so use

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.160 
well - push button on each side so use
the<00:01:25.590> first<00:01:25.829> push<00:01:26.100> button<00:01:26.400> right<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:26.579> and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
the first push button right there and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
the first push button right there and
then<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> other<00:01:28.530> side<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
then on the other side there is a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.889 
then on the other side there is a
another<00:01:30.750> one<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.890> over<00:01:32.069> there

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
another one right over there

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.330 
another one right over there
so<00:01:33.899> all<00:01:34.109> God<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.499> is<00:01:34.590> simply<00:01:34.920> flip<00:01:35.159> those

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
so all God do is simply flip those

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.639 
so all God do is simply flip those
buttons<00:01:35.670> over<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.649> it<00:01:37.649> will<00:01:37.829> take<00:01:38.039> to<00:01:38.420> do<00:01:39.420> this

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
buttons over and it will take to do this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:47.629 
buttons over and it will take to do this
and<00:01:40.649> it's<00:01:40.799> got<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> single<00:01:46.249> thing<00:01:47.249> about<00:01:47.369> these

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:47.639 
and it's got a single thing about these

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:50.149 
and it's got a single thing about these
dowels<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.509> using<00:01:49.049> particular<00:01:49.619> access<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
dowels are using particular access to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.620 
dowels are using particular access to
the<00:01:50.310> main<00:01:50.520> body<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.939> computer<00:01:51.479> without

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the main body of the computer without

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.529 
the main body of the computer without
having<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:53.069> school<00:01:53.579> or<00:01:53.819> in<00:01:54.030> rem<00:01:54.179> besides

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
having to on school or in rem besides

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.289 
having to on school or in rem besides
which<00:01:55.139> i<00:01:55.229> think<00:01:55.289> is<00:01:55.499> a<00:01:55.530> very<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:55.889> design<00:01:56.299> it's

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
which i think is a very good design it's

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.910 
which i think is a very good design it's
the<00:01:57.420> very<00:01:57.600> first<00:01:57.780> thing<00:01:58.139> you<00:01:58.289> want<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.499> do<00:01:58.709> is

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the very first thing you want to do is

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.779 
the very first thing you want to do is
ground<00:01:59.280> yourself<00:01:59.490> by<00:01:59.969> touching<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:01.789> exterior

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
ground yourself by touching the exterior

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.099 
ground yourself by touching the exterior
or<00:02:02.939> interior<00:02:03.200> metal<00:02:04.200> casing<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> actual

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
or interior metal casing of the actual

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.820 
or interior metal casing of the actual
PC<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:08.490> once<00:02:08.640> you've<00:02:08.789> done<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.830> you'll

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
PC so once you've done that you'll

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.440 
PC so once you've done that you'll
notice<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.250> there<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.760> access<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.240> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
notice that there is access to the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.740 
notice that there is access to the
actual<00:02:12.690> round<00:02:13.110> here<00:02:13.819> so<00:02:14.819> let's<00:02:15.150> take<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.600> look

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
actual round here so let's take a look

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.300 
actual round here so let's take a look
so<00:02:15.870> here's<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.200> ramp<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.160> base

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
so here's the ramp so this is the base

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.740 
so here's the ramp so this is the base
it<00:02:17.459> would<00:02:17.520> be<00:02:17.640> basically<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.090> motherboard<00:02:18.600> of

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
it would be basically the motherboard of

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.490 
it would be basically the motherboard of
the<00:02:19.160> Dell<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.550> you'll<00:02:21.450> see<00:02:21.660> you'll<00:02:22.170> notice

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
the Dell and you'll see you'll notice

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.720 
the Dell and you'll see you'll notice
that<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> RAM<00:02:22.860> stick<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.310> actually<00:02:23.550> here

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
that the RAM stick so actually here

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.210 
that the RAM stick so actually here
there's<00:02:23.940> two<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.240> them<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:25.140> blew<00:02:25.290> their<00:02:25.440> 256

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
there's two of them and I blew their 256

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.040 
there's two of them and I blew their 256
megabytes<00:02:26.400> each<00:02:26.790> which<00:02:27.690> would<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:27.959> been

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
megabytes each which would have been

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.540 
megabytes each which would have been
shipped<00:02:28.319> stuck<00:02:28.680> with<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.069> actual<00:02:29.310> dark

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
shipped stuck with the actual dark

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.059 
shipped stuck with the actual dark
computer<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:31.050> obviously<00:02:31.560> nothing<00:02:31.800> because

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
computer so obviously nothing because

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.320 
computer so obviously nothing because
lighting<00:02:32.250> gigs<00:02:32.580> or<00:02:32.730> anything<00:02:32.910> because<00:02:33.150> this

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
lighting gigs or anything because this

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.820 
lighting gigs or anything because this
is<00:02:33.450> quite<00:02:33.569> an<00:02:33.720> old<00:02:33.840> computer<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.680> is

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
is quite an old computer so this is

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.590 
is quite an old computer so this is
pretty<00:02:35.370> much<00:02:35.550> kept<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.850> same<00:02:35.970> mmm<00:02:36.300> haven't

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
pretty much kept the same mmm haven't

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.720 
pretty much kept the same mmm haven't
I've<00:02:36.690> never<00:02:36.930> updated<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.620> or<00:02:37.740> removed<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.700> so

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
I've never updated it or removed it so

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.220 
I've never updated it or removed it so
it's<00:02:38.940> pretty<00:02:39.030> much<00:02:39.150> stuck

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
it's pretty much stuck

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.449 
it's pretty much stuck
and<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.620> first<00:02:40.890> thing<00:02:41.040> you'll<00:02:41.159> notice<00:02:41.280> that

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
and the first thing you'll notice that

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.100 
and the first thing you'll notice that
there's<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.790> clips<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.360> see<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.750> add<00:02:42.959> more

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
there's this clips you see can add more

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.570 
there's this clips you see can add more
room<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.470> want<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.920> believe<00:02:44.159> looking<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.459> to

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
room if you want I believe looking up to

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.589 
room if you want I believe looking up to
about<00:02:44.700> four<00:02:45.000> gigs<00:02:45.269> of<00:02:45.420> RAM<00:02:45.920> in<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.040> unit<00:02:47.599> in

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
about four gigs of RAM in this unit in

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.930 
about four gigs of RAM in this unit in
each<00:02:48.769> compartment<00:02:49.769> thereby<00:02:50.280> adding<00:02:50.370> one<00:02:50.700> gig

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
each compartment thereby adding one gig

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.839 
each compartment thereby adding one gig
each<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.900> first<00:02:52.140> thing<00:02:52.260> one<00:02:52.379> do<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.849> pull

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
each so the first thing one do is pull

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.880 
each so the first thing one do is pull
up<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:53.970> clips<00:02:54.330> ESS<00:02:54.750> -<00:02:54.930> clickers<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.409> here<00:02:55.680> and

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
up the clips ESS - clickers one here and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.080 
up the clips ESS - clickers one here and
this<00:02:56.220> one<00:02:56.280> over<00:02:56.760> there

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
this one over there

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.900 
this one over there
so<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.720> want<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.019> do<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.379> simply<00:02:59.129> just<00:02:59.160> pull<00:02:59.879> that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
so I want to do is simply just pull that

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.210 
so I want to do is simply just pull that
down<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:01.160> pull<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.580> other<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.299> down<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
down and pull the other one down and the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.970 
down and pull the other one down and the
RAM<00:03:05.430> just<00:03:05.819> gently<00:03:06.150> be<00:03:06.810> able<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.200> pull<00:03:07.860> that

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
RAM just gently be able to pull that

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.119 
RAM just gently be able to pull that
like<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.659> is<00:03:09.780> pretty<00:03:09.959> much<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.440> ramp

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
like so and that is pretty much the ramp

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.850 
like so and that is pretty much the ramp
there<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:13.049> me<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.319> other<00:03:13.410> one<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.680> just

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
there and to me the other one you just

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.069 
there and to me the other one you just
do<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.069> very<00:03:14.310> much<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.730> very<00:03:14.879> same<00:03:15.150> thing<00:03:15.420> so

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
do the very much the very same thing so

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.009 
do the very much the very same thing so
you<00:03:16.170> pull<00:03:16.379> that<00:03:16.500> down<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:18.209> pull<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
you pull that down and you pull the

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.270 
you pull that down and you pull the
other<00:03:19.079> one<00:03:19.140> down<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.769> should<00:03:19.890> pop<00:03:20.069> out<00:03:20.220> of

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
other one down and it should pop out of

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.580 
other one down and it should pop out of
place<00:03:20.599> so<00:03:21.599> there<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.810> go<00:03:21.930> they<00:03:22.079> are<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.349> two

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
place so there you go they are the two

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.699 
place so there you go they are the two
room<00:03:22.799> sticks<00:03:23.099> right<00:03:23.579> there<00:03:24.379> so<00:03:25.379> this<00:03:25.500> leaves

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
room sticks right there so this leaves

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.069 
room sticks right there so this leaves
the<00:03:26.069> compartment<00:03:26.970> bay<00:03:27.060> open<00:03:27.480> services<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.989> the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
the compartment bay open services in the

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.750 
the compartment bay open services in the
room<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.319> that<00:03:28.440> moment<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.950> basically<00:03:29.579> to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
room in that moment and basically to

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.420 
room in that moment and basically to
insert<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.329> RAM<00:03:30.480> back<00:03:30.780> into<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.140> computer

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
insert the RAM back into the computer

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.470 
insert the RAM back into the computer
you<00:03:32.430> simply<00:03:32.670> just<00:03:34.609> put<00:03:35.609> it<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.000> slot<00:03:36.239> there

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
you simply just put it in the slot there

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.979 
you simply just put it in the slot there
if<00:03:39.480> he<00:03:39.569> decides<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.170> go<00:03:40.319> in<00:03:41.780> tell<00:03:42.780> me<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.900> bit

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
if he decides to go in tell me a bit

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.750 
if he decides to go in tell me a bit
finish<00:03:43.349> to<00:03:43.440> put<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:43.920> on<00:03:44.040> phone<00:03:44.220> do<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.430> with<00:03:44.519> one

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
finish to put in on phone do it with one

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.629 
finish to put in on phone do it with one
hand<00:03:44.790> at<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.209> moment<00:03:46.819> so<00:03:49.250> she'll<00:03:50.250> be<00:03:50.310> back<00:03:50.430> in

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
hand at the moment so she'll be back in

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.099 
hand at the moment so she'll be back in
there<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:51.030> want<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.209> push<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.540> down<00:03:51.870> to

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
there and you want to push it down to

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.379 
there and you want to push it down to
kicks<00:03:52.470> back<00:03:52.650> into<00:03:52.919> place<00:03:53.160> like<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:53.880> and

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
kicks back into place like that and

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.960 
kicks back into place like that and
you'll<00:03:55.290> notice<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.709> both<00:03:56.250> clips<00:03:56.730> once

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
you'll notice that both clips once

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.729 
you'll notice that both clips once
you've<00:03:57.120> pressed<00:03:57.329> it<00:03:57.480> down<00:03:57.510> should<00:03:58.319> come<00:03:58.590> and

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
you've pressed it down should come and

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.129 
you've pressed it down should come and
retract<00:03:59.069> back<00:03:59.220> into<00:03:59.489> place<00:03:59.700> and<00:03:59.959> this<00:04:00.959> will<00:04:01.079> be

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
retract back into place and this will be

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.379 
retract back into place and this will be
the<00:04:01.230> same<00:04:01.410> thing<00:04:01.650> with<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.889> other<00:04:01.980> one<00:04:02.389> same

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
the same thing with the other one same

people try and leave a gap between RAM
if<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:05.579> only<00:04:05.669> put<00:04:05.849> in<00:04:05.970> two<00:04:06.150> steps<00:04:06.329> where<00:04:06.510> I'm

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
if you only put in two steps where I'm

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.379 
if you only put in two steps where I'm
trying<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.870> have<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:06.989> gap<00:04:07.139> between<00:04:07.319> them<00:04:08.239> if<00:04:09.239> you

trying to have a gap between them if you

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.000 
trying to have a gap between them if you
don't<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.810> them<00:04:09.930> too<00:04:10.109> close<00:04:10.349> together<00:04:10.560> so

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
don't have them too close together so
