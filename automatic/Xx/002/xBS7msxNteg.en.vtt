00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
guys it's very very cool the physics are

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.679 
guys it's very very cool the physics are
great<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.250> music<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.730> well<00:00:30.210> actually<00:00:30.420> there's

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
great the music is well actually there's

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.299 
great the music is well actually there's
no<00:00:30.810> music<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.470> sound<00:00:31.769> effects<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.219> either

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
no music the sound effects for either

side<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:33.120> awesome<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:35.070> animation<00:00:35.670> is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
side are awesome and the animation is

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060 
side are awesome and the animation is
very<00:00:36.059> smooth<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.630> believe<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.989> runs<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> 45

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
very smooth I believe it runs at a 45

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.389 
very smooth I believe it runs at a 45
smooth<00:00:39.000> 40<00:00:39.420> frames<00:00:39.600> per<00:00:39.870> second<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.309> you

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
smooth 40 frames per second but if you

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.610 
smooth 40 frames per second but if you
play<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.910> an<00:00:42.030> older<00:00:42.390> iPhone<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:42.930> older

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
play this on an older iPhone or older

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
play this on an older iPhone or older
iPod<00:00:43.980> Touch<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:45.000> frame<00:00:45.270> rate<00:00:45.450> isn't<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.870> good

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
iPod Touch the frame rate isn't as good

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.479 
iPod Touch the frame rate isn't as good
because<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.440> played<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.980> old<00:00:47.129> iPhone

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
because I played it on the old iPhone

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.869 
because I played it on the old iPhone
sometimes<00:00:48.410> but<00:00:49.410> yet<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.219> 3GS<00:00:50.640> it's

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
sometimes but yet this is the 3GS it's

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
sometimes but yet this is the 3GS it's
running<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> here's<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> table<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> play

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
running on and here's the table you play

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.229 
running on and here's the table you play
on<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.160> put<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.489> finger<00:00:53.760> down<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> launch

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
on you put your finger down to launch

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.200 
on you put your finger down to launch
and<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.710> see<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.280> want<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> have

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and as you can see if you want to have

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.639 
and as you can see if you want to have
the<00:00:57.329> left<00:00:57.539> flipper<00:00:57.750> controlled<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.379> just

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the left flipper controlled you just

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.020 
the left flipper controlled you just
type<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> left<00:00:59.100> side<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> screen<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.910> for

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
type the left side of the screen and for

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.049 
type the left side of the screen and for
the<00:01:00.149> right<00:01:00.300> flipper<00:01:00.480> vice<00:01:00.930> versa<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the right flipper vice versa so it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.250 
the right flipper vice versa so it
really<00:01:03.359> can't<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.719> much<00:01:03.780> easier<00:01:03.960> than<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
really can't get much easier than that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.539 
really can't get much easier than that
as<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.350> said<00:01:07.560> before<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> sound<00:01:08.130> effects<00:01:08.430> are

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
as I said before the sound effects are

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.980 
as I said before the sound effects are
awesome<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.270> hear<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> sound

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
awesome if you can hear it the sound

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.399 
awesome if you can hear it the sound
effects<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.920> my<00:01:11.670> opinion<00:01:12.090> sound<00:01:12.600> great<00:01:12.810> of

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
effects in my opinion sound great of

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.600 
effects in my opinion sound great of
course<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.740> wasn't<00:01:13.890> looking<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> screen

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
course I wasn't looking at the screen

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.570 
course I wasn't looking at the screen
then<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.000> lost<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.159> believe<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> have

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
then so I lost and I believe you have

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.030 
then so I lost and I believe you have
four<00:01:17.820> balls<00:01:18.000> per<00:01:18.240> game<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.380> physics<00:01:19.890> are

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
four balls per game the physics are

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.070 
four balls per game the physics are
great<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.460> ball<00:01:20.640> moves<00:01:21.180> very<00:01:21.509> realistically

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
great the ball moves very realistically

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.570 
great the ball moves very realistically
there's<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> train<00:01:22.799> track<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.430> in

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
there's the train track you can go in

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
there's the train track you can go in
for<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> gold<00:01:24.000> mine<00:01:24.240> however<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> gold<00:01:25.380> mine

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
for the gold mine however the gold mine

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
for the gold mine however the gold mine
wasn't<00:01:25.740> unlocked<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> didn't<00:01:26.970> really<00:01:27.150> get<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
wasn't unlocked so I didn't really get a

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
wasn't unlocked so I didn't really get a
multiplier<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.500> I'm<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.770> sucking<00:01:29.220> bad

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
multiplier and I'm really sucking bad

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.749 
multiplier and I'm really sucking bad
right<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:29.810> but<00:01:30.810> um<00:01:30.990> my<00:01:31.740> record<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.220> over<00:01:32.460> three

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
right now but um my record is over three

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
right now but um my record is over three
three<00:01:33.450> million<00:01:33.720> dollars<00:01:34.020> which<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.590> think<00:01:34.799> it's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
three million dollars which I think it's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.710 
three million dollars which I think it's
pretty<00:01:35.100> good<00:01:35.250> well<00:01:36.150> that's<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> first<00:01:36.600> time

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
pretty good well that's the first time

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.230 
pretty good well that's the first time
I've<00:01:36.780> seen<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> go<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.259> past<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.220> bar<00:01:38.490> ball<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
I've seen it go up past the bar ball the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.590 
I've seen it go up past the bar ball the
bar<00:01:39.689> marker<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:41.460> weird

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
bar marker that's weird

you hit the break safe right here enough

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.050 
you hit the break safe right here enough
times<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.500> bank<00:02:04.770> will<00:02:05.040> open<00:02:05.219> right<00:02:05.610> now

there's a white doorway there blocking

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.650 
there's a white doorway there blocking
it<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.729> your<00:02:08.849> vault<00:02:09.000> does<00:02:09.209> go<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.539> there

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
it but if your vault does go in there

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.590

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
and hits all those things multiple times

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.240 
and hits all those things multiple times
you<00:02:11.810> know<00:02:11.930> they<00:02:12.200> don't<00:02:12.320> multiply<00:02:12.620> your<00:02:12.950> score

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250

you know they don't multiply your score
big<00:02:13.700> time<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.450> then<00:02:14.750> after<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.710> multiply

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
big time and then after you multiply

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.920 
big time and then after you multiply
your<00:02:16.700> score<00:02:17.000> if<00:02:17.090> your<00:02:17.150> ball<00:02:17.390> goes<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.810> that

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
your score if your ball goes in that

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.330 
your score if your ball goes in that
hole<00:02:18.170> right<00:02:18.200> there

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
hole right there

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.670 
hole right there
it<00:02:19.640> will<00:02:19.880> multiply<00:02:20.330> like<00:02:20.840> crazy<00:02:20.870> which<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.440> how

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
it will multiply like crazy which is how

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.280 
it will multiply like crazy which is how
you<00:02:21.740> get<00:02:22.040> millions<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.490> dollars<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:23.990> that's<00:02:24.140> a

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
you get millions of dollars so that's a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.750 
you get millions of dollars so that's a
quick<00:02:24.440> note<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.950> if<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:25.160> do<00:02:25.310> get<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.580> gold

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
quick note and if you do get the gold

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
about this game probably a couple weeks

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.810 
about this game probably a couple weeks
ago<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.920> I've<00:03:16.010> been<00:03:16.160> playing<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.490> every<00:03:16.670> day

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
ago and I've been playing it every day

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.590 
ago and I've been playing it every day
well<00:03:17.660> almost<00:03:17.870> every<00:03:18.230> day<00:03:18.350> since<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.510> let<00:03:20.510> me

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
well almost every day since so let me

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.480 
well almost every day since so let me
show<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.900> little<00:03:21.050> bit<00:03:21.350> more<00:03:21.530> gameplay<00:03:22.040> this

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
show you a little bit more gameplay this

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.430 
show you a little bit more gameplay this
is<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.670> pinball<00:03:23.060> game<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.480> well<00:03:23.960> obviously<00:03:24.140> as

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
is a pinball game so well obviously as

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.190 
is a pinball game so well obviously as
you<00:03:24.530> can<00:03:24.650> say<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:26.150> is<00:03:26.330> kind<00:03:26.570> of<00:03:26.660> hard<00:03:26.960> to<00:03:27.020> do<00:03:27.170> a

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
you can say this is kind of hard to do a

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.470 
you can say this is kind of hard to do a
video<00:03:27.440> on<00:03:27.590> because<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.430> can't<00:03:28.820> really<00:03:28.940> script

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
video on because I can't really script

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.290 
video on because I can't really script
anything<00:03:30.610> random<00:03:31.610> things<00:03:31.790> happening<00:03:32.150> cuz

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
anything random things happening cuz

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.660 
anything random things happening cuz
well<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:32.750> pinball<00:03:33.140> but<00:03:33.890> okay<00:03:34.310> good

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
well it is pinball but okay good

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.490 
well it is pinball but okay good
the<00:03:34.910> bank<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.270> open<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:35.810> if<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:36.020> get<00:03:36.080> in<00:03:36.290> there<00:03:36.440> I

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
the bank is open so if I get in there I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.780 
the bank is open so if I get in there I
can<00:03:36.740> show<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:36.980> guys<00:03:37.220> what<00:03:38.060> it's<00:03:38.180> like<00:03:38.330> I<00:03:42.790> don't

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
can show you guys what it's like I don't

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.540 
can show you guys what it's like I don't
I<00:03:43.910> don't<00:03:44.090> make<00:03:44.270> there<00:03:44.630> goes<00:03:44.810> now<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:46.160> course<00:03:46.370> I

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
I don't make there goes now of course I

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.100 
I don't make there goes now of course I
fell<00:03:46.760> out<00:03:46.790> right<00:03:47.000> away<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.480> didn't<00:03:47.900> get<00:03:48.050> the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
fell out right away so I didn't get the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.720 
fell out right away so I didn't get the
multiplier<00:03:48.620> but<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.310> thought<00:03:49.490> would<00:03:49.610> have

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
multiplier but I thought would have

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.250 
multiplier but I thought would have
multiplied<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.270> went<00:03:50.420> in<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.570> hole<00:03:50.840> then<00:03:51.170> it

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
multiplied and went in that hole then it

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.690 
multiplied and went in that hole then it
would<00:03:51.380> have<00:03:51.470> spit<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.770> out<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:52.100> multiplied<00:03:52.520> it

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
would have spit it out and multiplied it

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.370 
would have spit it out and multiplied it
well<00:03:53.330> there<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:53.510> go<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.720> bank<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.050> open<00:03:54.290> again

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
well there you go the bank is open again

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.430 
well there you go the bank is open again
I'm<00:03:54.980> just<00:03:55.130> having<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.400> luck<00:03:55.580> out<00:03:55.760> there<00:03:56.440> and

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
I'm just having a luck out there and

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.320 
I'm just having a luck out there and
believe<00:03:57.560> me<00:03:57.800> when<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:57.950> say<00:03:58.160> this<00:03:58.340> game<00:03:58.580> is<00:03:58.820> OK

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
believe me when I say this game is OK

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.790 
believe me when I say this game is OK
there<00:03:59.510> it<00:03:59.570> goes<00:03:59.720> now

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
there it goes now

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.170 
there it goes now
it's<00:04:01.130> sometimes<00:04:01.490> it<00:04:01.610> stays<00:04:01.790> in<00:04:01.910> there<00:04:02.000> for<00:04:02.030> a

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
it's sometimes it stays in there for a

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.290 
it's sometimes it stays in there for a
while<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.480> just<00:04:02.630> keeps<00:04:02.810> on<00:04:02.900> multiplying<00:04:04.300> and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
while it just keeps on multiplying and

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.220 
while it just keeps on multiplying and
there<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:05.480> get<00:04:05.600> what's<00:04:05.750> going<00:04:05.960> in<00:04:06.020> the<00:04:06.080> hole

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
there you get what's going in the hole

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.310 
there you get what's going in the hole
and<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:07.520> just<00:04:07.670> got<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> bunch<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.150> money<00:04:08.290> now<00:04:09.290> I

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
and I just got a bunch of money now I

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.010 
and I just got a bunch of money now I
just<00:04:09.440> robbed<00:04:09.740> the<00:04:09.830> bank<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.190> said<00:04:10.810> so<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.900> is

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
just robbed the bank it said so it is

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.780 
just robbed the bank it said so it is
very<00:04:12.290> much<00:04:12.650> based<00:04:12.860> on<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.160> Wild<00:04:13.400> West<00:04:13.520> theme

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
very much based on the Wild West theme

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.210 
very much based on the Wild West theme
hence<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.300> name<00:04:14.450> so<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.410> cannot<00:04:15.740> wait<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.040> see

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
hence the name so I cannot wait to see

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.729 
hence the name so I cannot wait to see
the<00:04:16.340> deep<00:04:16.570> blue<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:17.780> believe<00:04:18.320> there's<00:04:18.470> gonna<00:04:18.590> be

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
the deep blue I believe there's gonna be

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.009 
the deep blue I believe there's gonna be
sharks<00:04:19.100> everything

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
sharks everything

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.689 
sharks everything
hence<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.650> name<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.979> deep<00:04:21.160> it's<00:04:21.370> based<00:04:21.579> on

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
hence the name the deep it's based on

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.999 
hence the name the deep it's based on
the<00:04:21.819> water<00:04:22.080> it's<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.169> big<00:04:23.410> multiplier<00:04:23.830> there

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:24.009 
the water it's a big multiplier there

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.309 
the water it's a big multiplier there
and<00:04:24.099> out<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.220> school<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:25.599> only<00:04:25.810> downside<00:04:26.289> to

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:26.319 
and out of school the only downside to

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.300 
and out of school the only downside to
this<00:04:26.530> game<00:04:26.770> is<00:04:27.090> that<00:04:28.440> there's<00:04:29.440> only<00:04:29.650> one<00:04:29.800> table

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
this game is that there's only one table

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.300 
this game is that there's only one table
as<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.849> can<00:04:30.940> probably<00:04:31.060> tell<00:04:31.530> but<00:04:32.530> in<00:04:32.800> my

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
as you can probably tell but in my

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.059 
as you can probably tell but in my
opinion<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:33.849> this<00:04:34.150> table<00:04:34.539> is<00:04:34.860> detailed<00:04:35.860> and

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
opinion this this table is detailed and

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.420 
opinion this this table is detailed and
fun<00:04:36.340> enough<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.729> keep<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.680> entertained<00:04:38.680> is

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
fun enough to keep you entertained is

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.089 
fun enough to keep you entertained is
the<00:04:39.639> word<00:04:39.789> and<00:04:40.110> well<00:04:41.110> guys<00:04:41.289> it's<00:04:41.620> free<00:04:41.860> you

the word and well guys it's free you
can't<00:04:42.400> really<00:04:42.520> argue<00:04:42.580> free<00:04:43.060> so<00:04:43.300> there<00:04:43.419> you<00:04:43.479> go

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
can't really argue free so there you go

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.320

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.809 
and expect many more Typhon app reviews
because<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.750> haven't<00:04:53.139> really<00:04:53.440> done<00:04:53.650> many<00:04:54.520> yet
