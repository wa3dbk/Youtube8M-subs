00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.799
 good evening and welcome to my channel 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.780
 specializing in relaxation in the 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.220
 relaxation at the time smoked a firecracker 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.470
 to make hover 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.440
 watch these videos that often produces 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.390
 same effect and without the harmful side 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.930
 so my main channel is called 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.090
 fish done when I make and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.710
 instructive it's funny because their goal 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.050
 is to awaken the spirit of aligning this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.730
 little spark in your head then 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.530
 that this chain has a purpose 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.239
 totally opposite, ie to appease 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.940
 your mind soothed 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.190
 your mind yes we will immediately be familiar with you 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.360
 it will be more more intimate have had more 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.129
 6 years farting to do this little decor 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.080
 fun ghilas them it would be stupid not to 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.940
 enjoy it and you'll have noticed these 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.830
 two things that are as soon as they are 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.320
 micro 1 and that not for a video 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.010
 classics make it possible to produce a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.080
 binaural sound that is to say a sound that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.850
 will be different for your two ears there 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.070
 you will hear are there you expect a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.690
 other but to fully benefit the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.060
 it's better than putting on a headset 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.500
 during headphones then I am 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.149
 of a very very curious natural young 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.299
 wishing to ask a question to inform 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.520
 all that stuff on the heap of things 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.920
 but another part of me but 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.729
 I noticed over time was 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.259
 quite sensitive to the voices we see to the voices 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.500
 and when I was younger I 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.780
 remember being fascinated by 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.210
 breakdowns the way of a counselor 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.570
 of orientation that was so on 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.340
 the 12 it ran like water but I 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.439
 also remember a 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.030
 near management I had in high school I 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.939
 I started Thursday afternoon she 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.299
 had three hours in a row three 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:53.109
 hours but well because good already his 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.479
 side and deschiens to die and the 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:02:01.149
 well but also there was said 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.829
 know was soporific already after 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.530
 30 minutes to issy beyond the next 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.810
 I was it was completely knocked out I 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.549
 floated in cotton and I had 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.349
 the impression of having been shot at 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.540
 sleeping pills to a good box of 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.019
 sleeping pills so well that the end of three 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.970
 hours 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.370
 I had a fucking red mark there in 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.470
 party is on the cheek by force of 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:27.220
 squeeze like that to prevent my head 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:29.170
 collapses on later on the internet I 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.900
 sometimes fell on videos where the guy 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.030
 or the nana talk and had a voice that 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.610
 little special which was strangely giving 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.680
 the desire to ask and listen as 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.030
 a lullaby will talk about the color code 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.040
 resisters did he told 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.260
 could be boring but then really 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.079
 very boring of which for example the value 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.299
 disturbing resistances home and cg 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.470
 for example, what did I listen to 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.069
 I've had enough of a color code 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.549
 resistance 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.079
 we do not care and yet his voice to be 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.180
 six relaxes 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.889
 it is only much later one day in 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.280
 losing myself on youtube and falling on 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:08.260
 the video of a little brunette who was doing 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.750
 a kind of two hairstyling sessions 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.030
 virtual that I discovered that this 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.919
 was called the smr and that there was a 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.919
 real little community behind 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.049
 harvard to smr meaning autonomous 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.880
 are on it meridian response 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.099
 we can translate for a sensation 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.410
 pleasant often tingling or 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.829
 then some chills at the level of 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.200
 head 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:40.060
 the nape of the skull that has absolutely 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.220
 nothing sexual anything and in response to a 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.419
 simili that is not physical by 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.880
 example when someone comes from 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.079
 whisper in the shadowed ears studies 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.530
 but to shudder like a leaf 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.620
 dead woman 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.060
 well these two there and his mother but what 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.620
 are not necessarily voices that can 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.620
 to be a whole lot of crackling noise 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.579
 so some noises can we make you 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.260
 of the effect of others not at all and no 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.689
 doubt you can find it totally 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.700
 revealing for example mongolo finds 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:13.739
 totally to the swords in the fact of 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.239
 do not hear people sing like that 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.370
 he does not support by cons he loves 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.229
 fall asleep on the sound of rain a 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.039
 video on rain still earthquake and 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.000
 call it here then for the videos 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.610
 yeah that's good it's true 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.550
 when you discover this kind of stuff is 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.590
 can find it weird weird weird 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.030
 a guy or a girl alone 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:44.140
 in front of his camera that tram on 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:45.700
 weird little noises like that it's 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.010
 something of the boards yet 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.370
 over time it was used ended 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.380
 to find that normal and we work and 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.340
 sometimes bonus debates in front of their 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.820
 camera that are talking 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.010
 slowly 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.080
 so we could find that exciting 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.430
 but that's really not the goal at all 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.710
 it's not supposed to be sexual whose claes 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.930
 mayor of ciba you find that sexual or 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.669
 so if that's teksid it's going to be on a 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.469
 site of qe2 wanks a blow can 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.909
 determine if dj ben perso since 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.620
 I discovered the smr I looked at 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.330
 hundreds of videos and I continue to in 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.889
 look at the condition after most 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.600
 videos in the field are in English 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.550
 but hey it's not a problem 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.930
 I understand practically nothing 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.150
 says it does not prevent me from 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.620
 appreciate the most important is if the 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.360
 voice we do not care about language in 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.980
 which he speaks then I listen to 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.930
 often often in the evening before 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.710
 to fall asleep like that it puts me where we are 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.260
 a little bit special but I listen to it 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.180
 also sometimes full day even the 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.530
 morning but it's bullshit it's a 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.510
 bullshit because it also makes me 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.270
 hover and then it makes me want to 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.070
 to sleep a lever podium sometimes I know 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.290
 a little confused but finally good 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.130
 after a long time to think about it 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:57.760
 I decided to do it too 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.710
 own sauce she has good so that's true 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.270
 that I often read from time to time 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.700
 him below and comments but video 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.920
 that despite the fact that it's enough 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.560
 nervous and dynamic that we found you 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.160
 can find my soothing voice and the 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.500
 pleasant 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.270
 or so why not I called this 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.460
 chain the back simply because 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.610
 that the back and my astrological sign 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.620
 I was born in February and then the name 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.150
 back recalls liquid element in 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.370
 which is my main channel 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.770
 that is, fish makes one have 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.110
 finally last members pour to the leap 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.690
 made me pour water it looks 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.030
 pretty cool pretty relaxed as skilled 1 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.800
 here's more there is more nervous I 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.180
 think and then good considering the number of 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.460
 sleeping pills that the French consume 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.400
 every year because of their worries about 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.230
 sleep disorders other insomnia I 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.980
 sincerely think that this kind of video 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:51.370
 could be useful to them and could not 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.500
 to be a good alternative to that so 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.050
 to help you relax right asleep 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.200
 we try at your ease but video or then 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.750
 other smr channels may be who 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.010
 seduced one will become hooked 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.260
 I make you a big kiss on the 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.260
 truffle and I tell you very quickly
