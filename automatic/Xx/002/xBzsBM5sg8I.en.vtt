hey<00:00:11.309> guys<00:00:11.519> it's<00:00:12.030> been<00:00:12.180> a<00:00:12.240> while<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:12.690> I'm<00:00:12.959> back

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
hey guys it's been a while but I'm back

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.039 
hey guys it's been a while but I'm back
with<00:00:13.619> another<00:00:13.650> redstone<00:00:14.250> video<00:00:14.870> from<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
with another redstone video from the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.870 
with another redstone video from the
tile<00:00:16.259> and<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> thumbnail<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:17.009> this<00:00:17.250> video<00:00:17.550> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
tile and the thumbnail of this video you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.720 
tile and the thumbnail of this video you
probably<00:00:18.180> already<00:00:18.689> know<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.189> recreated

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
probably already know but I recreated

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.130 
probably already know but I recreated
air<00:00:21.000> hockey<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.509> my<00:00:21.630> craft

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
air hockey in my craft

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.470 
air hockey in my craft
apart<00:00:22.950> from<00:00:23.039> multiplayer<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.849> also<00:00:24.150> made<00:00:24.449> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
apart from multiplayer I also made a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.630 
apart from multiplayer I also made a
single-player<00:00:24.990> mode<00:00:25.349> in<00:00:26.010> which<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.429> can

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
single-player mode in which you can

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.150 
single-player mode in which you can
control<00:00:26.939> both<00:00:27.210> mallets<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.039> could<00:00:29.039> have

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
control both mallets I could have

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
control both mallets I could have
programmed<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> computer<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.779> have

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
programmed the computer so that you have

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.619 
programmed the computer so that you have
a<00:00:31.019> real<00:00:31.320> opponent<00:00:31.790> but<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.030> laggy<00:00:33.330> enough

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
a real opponent but it is laggy enough

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.329 
a real opponent but it is laggy enough
like<00:00:33.900> this<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.500> don't<00:00:34.620> think<00:00:34.769> that<00:00:35.129> many

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339 
like this and I don't think that many

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.490 
like this and I don't think that many
people<00:00:35.670> will<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.120> play<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.989> game<00:00:37.019> for<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
people will actually play the game for a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.130 
people will actually play the game for a
long<00:00:37.769> time<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.790> start<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.150> game<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.780> simply

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
long time to start the game you simply

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.320 
long time to start the game you simply
have<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.320> press<00:00:40.650> this<00:00:40.830> button<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.400> you<00:00:41.460> will

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
have to press this button and you will

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.079 
have to press this button and you will
be<00:00:42.390> teleported<00:00:42.900> to<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> arrow<00:00:43.620> key<00:00:43.860> table<00:00:44.129> in

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
be teleported to the arrow key table in

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.820 
be teleported to the arrow key table in
order<00:00:45.449> to<00:00:45.600> move<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.900> mallet<00:00:46.199> you<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.650> to

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
order to move the mallet you have to

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.640 
order to move the mallet you have to
look<00:00:47.070> into<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.519> different<00:00:47.850> directions<00:00:48.089> and

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
look into the different directions and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.990 
look into the different directions and
to<00:00:49.650> get<00:00:49.830> the<00:00:49.949> puck<00:00:50.129> moving<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.879> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to get the puck moving you have to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.509 
to get the puck moving you have to
select<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.390> first<00:00:51.600> item<00:00:51.809> slot<00:00:52.229> and<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.309> rest

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
select the first item slot and the rest

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.390 
select the first item slot and the rest
is<00:00:53.729> pretty<00:00:53.760> self-explanatory<00:00:54.540> you<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:56.250> have

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
is pretty self-explanatory you just have

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.250 
is pretty self-explanatory you just have
to<00:00:56.519> try<00:00:56.790> to<00:00:56.850> hit<00:00:57.119> the<00:00:57.299> book<00:00:57.479> with<00:00:57.720> the<00:00:57.839> melet's

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
to try to hit the book with the melet's

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
to try to hit the book with the melet's
and<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:59.100> make<00:00:59.280> goals

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:22.300 

you

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.550 

you

the<00:01:31.070> game<00:01:31.280> itself<00:01:31.610> actually<00:01:32.000> works<00:01:32.720> but<00:01:33.200> due

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
the game itself actually works but due

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.560 
the game itself actually works but due
to<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.710> massive<00:01:33.950> lag<00:01:34.310> sometimes<00:01:34.700> bugs<00:01:35.330> out<00:01:35.540> a

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
to the massive lag sometimes bugs out a

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.590 
to the massive lag sometimes bugs out a
little<00:01:35.870> bit<00:01:36.400> if<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:37.550> are<00:01:37.640> done<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.240> can<00:01:38.270> just

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
little bit if you are done you can just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.810 
little bit if you are done you can just

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
back to the lobby and it's the same

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.090 
back to the lobby and it's the same
thing<00:01:44.180> for<00:01:44.300> multiplayer<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:45.979> to

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
thing for multiplayer you just have to

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
will be able to control one mallet there

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.830 
will be able to control one mallet there
is<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.710> lot<00:01:52.010> of<00:01:52.160> stuff<00:01:52.369> going<00:01:52.729> on<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.240> I'm<00:01:53.630> not

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
is a lot of stuff going on and I'm not

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.450 
is a lot of stuff going on and I'm not
going<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.110> explain<00:01:54.380> everything<00:01:54.619> in<00:01:55.100> detail

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
going to explain everything in detail

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.730 
going to explain everything in detail
but<00:01:55.850> as<00:01:56.090> always<00:01:56.300> I<00:01:56.630> will<00:01:56.690> explain<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.380> basic

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
but as always I will explain the basic

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.710 
but as always I will explain the basic
principles<00:01:58.310> firstly<00:01:59.090> we<00:01:59.330> can<00:01:59.479> actually

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
principles firstly we can actually

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.290 
principles firstly we can actually
pretty<00:02:00.260> much<00:02:00.440> ignore<00:02:00.800> this<00:02:00.979> room<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:02.000> actual

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
pretty much ignore this room the actual

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.120 
pretty much ignore this room the actual
