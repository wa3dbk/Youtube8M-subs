00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
really powerful oh my god and it seems

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.540 
really powerful oh my god and it seems
like<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:24.960> hold<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.380> down<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.740> use<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.070> all

I<00:02:27.780> think<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.620> would<00:02:28.710> be<00:02:28.830> better<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.100> test<00:02:29.430> out

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
I think it would be better to test out

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.370 
I think it would be better to test out
on<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.850> ground<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.570> we're<00:02:30.690> down<00:02:30.780> here<00:02:30.840> oh<00:02:31.110> wow

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.140 
hey bells how you doing over there yeah
it<00:02:40.560> seems<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.130> better<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.640> better<00:02:41.850> to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
it seems like it's better it's better to

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.460 
it seems like it's better it's better to
shoot<00:02:42.330> them<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:42.600> you're<00:02:42.750> on<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.960> same<00:02:43.170> level

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
shoot them if you're on the same level

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.440 
shoot them if you're on the same level
it<00:02:43.590> doesn't<00:02:43.890> seem<00:02:44.040> like<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.640> as<00:02:44.880> easy<00:02:45.030> to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
it doesn't seem like it's as easy to

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.480 
it doesn't seem like it's as easy to
shoot<00:02:45.630> them<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:45.930> you're<00:02:46.080> from<00:02:46.230> up<00:02:46.350> above<00:02:46.500> but

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
shoot them if you're from up above but

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.300 
shoot them if you're from up above but
it's<00:02:47.910> definitely<00:02:48.180> manageable<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.900> imagine<00:02:49.350> but

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
it's definitely manageable I imagine but

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.950 
it's definitely manageable I imagine but
it's<00:02:50.490> yeah<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:50.970> seems<00:02:51.180> more<00:02:51.300> like<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.450> parallel

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
it's yeah it seems more like a parallel

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.260 
it's yeah it seems more like a parallel
to<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.320> ground<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.980> wow<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.430> really<00:02:53.580> cool

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
to the ground so wow that is really cool

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.780 
to the ground so wow that is really cool
let's<00:02:54.570> pop<00:02:54.750> out<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.990> second<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.550> so<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:56.670> is

rapid fire how I believe this works is

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.710 
rapid fire how I believe this works is
you<00:02:58.980> click<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.340> once<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.730> continues<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.540> fire

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
you click it once it continues to fire
