and everybody it's crazy i think i think
the<00:01:44.670> first<00:01:44.850> boon<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.360> had<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> North

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the first boon we had in the North

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.130 
the first boon we had in the North
America<00:01:46.740> was<00:01:47.450> counter-strike<00:01:48.450> several<00:01:48.930> years

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
America was counter-strike several years

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.490 
America was counter-strike several years
ago<00:01:49.290> kind<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.829> was<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> game<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:51.290> every<00:01:52.290> league

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
ago kind of was a game that every league

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.260 
ago kind of was a game that every league
picked<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.979> every<00:01:53.250> tournament<00:01:53.579> had<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.090> had<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
picked up every tournament had you had a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.120 
picked up every tournament had you had a
huge<00:01:54.630> pub<00:01:54.960> scene<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.649> had<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> huge

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
huge pub scene and you had a huge

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.770 
huge pub scene and you had a huge
competitive<00:01:56.640> scene<00:01:56.850> grow<00:01:57.090> out<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.450> right

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
competitive scene grow out of that right

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.929 
competitive scene grow out of that right
I<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:58.530> died<00:01:58.799> away<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.549> now<00:01:59.909> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
I think that's died away and now a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
I think that's died away and now a
counter-strike<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:00.960> example<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.439> kind<00:02:01.619> of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
counter-strike for example your kind of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
counter-strike for example your kind of
left<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> pros<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.670> no<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:02.939> really

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
left with the pros and no one really

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.230 
left with the pros and no one really
plays<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.079> for<00:02:04.200> fun<00:02:04.320> anymore<00:02:04.729> starcraft<00:02:05.729> 2<00:02:05.969> has

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
plays it for fun anymore starcraft 2 has

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.649 
plays it for fun anymore starcraft 2 has
kind<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:06.659> blown

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
kind of blown

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.330 
kind of blown
it<00:02:07.719> back<00:02:07.899> out<00:02:08.110> again<00:02:08.259> for<00:02:08.530> North<00:02:08.709> America<00:02:09.129> but

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
it back out again for North America but

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.290 
it back out again for North America but
times<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.269> hundred<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:12.459> astounding<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:13.090> think

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
times a hundred it's astounding I think

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.900 
times a hundred it's astounding I think
you<00:02:13.390> add<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.010> combination<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.760> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
you add that to the combination of the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.059 
you add that to the combination of the
Justin<00:02:16.299> TVs<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.110> youth<00:02:17.319> streams<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.860> live

Justin TVs the youth streams the live

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.910 
Justin TVs the youth streams the live
streams<00:02:18.489> anybody<00:02:19.420> can<00:02:19.810> grab<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.379> little<00:02:20.769> bit<00:02:20.890> of

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
streams anybody can grab a little bit of

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.369 
streams anybody can grab a little bit of
you<00:02:21.280> know<00:02:21.360> hardware<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> capture<00:02:23.049> card<00:02:23.080> a

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
you know hardware a capture card a

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.259 
you know hardware a capture card a
microphone<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.640> out<00:02:24.760> there<00:02:24.940> with<00:02:24.970> their

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
microphone and get out there with their

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.400 
microphone and get out there with their
game<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:25.870> you're<00:02:25.989> seeing<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.260> lot<00:02:26.379> more

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
game and so you're seeing a lot more

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.770 
game and so you're seeing a lot more
streamers<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:27.220> lot<00:02:27.610> more<00:02:27.730> teams<00:02:28.030> doing<00:02:28.330> content

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
streamers a lot more teams doing content

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.720 
streamers a lot more teams doing content
like<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.650> think<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.190> makes<00:02:30.640> it

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
like that and it I think that makes it

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.400 
like that and it I think that makes it
even<00:02:30.879> more<00:02:31.000> accessible<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.959> casual<00:02:32.379> fan

even more accessible to the casual fan
at<00:02:32.650> home<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.849> I<00:02:33.970> think<00:02:34.000> it's<00:02:34.239> only<00:02:34.420> gonna<00:02:34.510> get

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
at home and I think it's only gonna get

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.410 
at home and I think it's only gonna get
crazier<00:02:35.019> what's<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.040> horizon<00:02:36.760> for<00:02:37.120> Team
