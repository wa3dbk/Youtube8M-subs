00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:03.339
 It has been said that the current situation has been around since the opening 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:09.150
 I'm sorry 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.410
 Run through at high speed of overtime work 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.419
 It was quick to work by this 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.820
 I was scheduled for the fall 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.269
 23500 yen 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.269
 I will carry out this time 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.100
 At the time the motherboard was installed 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.330
 Mr. Maeda 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.810
 State of entrance examination hall and way to play an active part as reporter 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.950
 We have you introduce the highlight of Kawaguchi auto racing ground 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.410
 Arakawa Ward held and sold it once in two years 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 The glory of Jeollanam-do on the 8th 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.340
 so 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.870
 It is one of the attractive points of the Kawaguchi Auto Racing Ground, which is profitable 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.540
 Delicious salmon freshly made 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.480
 Welfare January 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.300
 The sweet sake that is perfect for the current period is being sold 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.790
 Above all there is a menu such as height 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.200
 Please come here 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.350
 Keidanren 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.920
 90% of the seasoned flavors are sold 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.580
 I understand that I was just told that I just won 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.160
 For those who have been well received by the weight of the upper price 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 Main stand 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.620
 Added one point by Nada Takeda's timely strike 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.110
 We understood by tax system revision 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.020
 So what is the reaction of the yen market? 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.500
 Strictly in operation 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.420
 n 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.690
 There are places where signs of improvement began to appear 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.270
 Please think about it There are a lot of crime prevention bikes 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.810
 Which was the case when players were given to each one 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.610
 Here they are ready for the race to replace or maintain parts 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.610
 It's all done by yourself 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.769
 Hello 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.989
 Is it set to 0.7 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.279
 It was somewhat expensive for the third graders on the net 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:21.230
 This is Takeshima's 19 wins and the veteran closed 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.769
 Co-sponsor 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.180
 A place where the Kayaba town sign that saw the competitor close up disappeared 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.059
 And 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.369
 Isn't it a little strange? 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.699
 If the role that played the first seven consecutive wins is pressed down 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:40.580
 Unable to set up a school area in the form of 300 at once for many people 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.589
 It is difficult to do so 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.689
 Auto Race to run to reporters this way 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.760
 Increase contact area with the ground, make it difficult to slip, and make production consignment tires 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.709
 I use it 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.379
 There was one more unusual place 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.469
 That's a dollar 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.589
 It was better to throw it up and put the handle together in a better word 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.589
 Sometimes I can run very easily 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.590
 To beat the opponent in the first half 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.849
 The height of the handle is always installed 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.069
 Moreover, it is not a brake to prevent a rear-end collision 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.289
 Therefore it is driver Tachibana 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:21.859
 Fourth year in this year 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.269
 How I got it to rotate for 7 days 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.259
 Two consecutive nights 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.259
 google blog 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.269
 Power supply 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.769
 So many 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.599
 2226 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.299
 Yes Yes 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.869
 free 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.649
 Oita lost in 0-1 now but about 5 minutes after retiring after 1 minute 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:12.949
 Taikengawa village, a kilometer away 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:14.539
 Not behind
