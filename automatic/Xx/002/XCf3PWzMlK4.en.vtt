onliest 84 dribbling runs card but does

onliest 84 dribbling runs card but does
feel<00:01:47.130> quite<00:01:47.310> better<00:01:47.579> than<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> feels

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
feel quite better than that it feels

about<00:01:48.479> 86<00:01:49.049> 87<00:01:49.500> 88<00:01:50.750> he<00:01:51.750> has<00:01:51.869> very<00:01:52.259> nice<00:01:52.530> strength

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
about 86 87 88 he has very nice strength

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.039 
about 86 87 88 he has very nice strength
as<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.700> saw<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> ingame<00:01:54.450> start<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> think

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
as you saw in the ingame start to think

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.859 
as you saw in the ingame start to think
he<00:01:55.110> had<00:01:55.229> 86<00:01:56.100> strength<00:01:56.729> which<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.689> nice

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
he had 86 strength which is really nice

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.660 
he had 86 strength which is really nice
because<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.320> only<00:01:58.500> 83<00:01:59.009> pace<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.579> know

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
because the only 83 pace and you know

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.010 
because the only 83 pace and you know
when<00:01:59.820> you're<00:01:59.939> running<00:02:00.030> alongside<00:02:00.360> defenders

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
when you're running alongside defenders

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.499 
when you're running alongside defenders
you<00:02:01.170> don't<00:02:01.350> want<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:01.680> weak<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:03.180> that

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
you don't want to be weak so that

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.270 
you don't want to be weak so that
definitely<00:02:03.990> helps<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.649> crew<00:02:04.890> displace<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
definitely helps and crew displace a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.670 
definitely helps and crew displace a
little<00:02:05.579> bit

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
little bit

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.460 
little bit
the<00:02:07.220> next<00:02:07.580> thing<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.119> positioning<00:02:08.930> I<00:02:09.110> had

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
the next thing is is positioning I had

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.560 
the next thing is is positioning I had
noticed<00:02:09.770> his<00:02:10.310> positioning<00:02:10.880> was<00:02:11.000> he<00:02:11.450> was

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
noticed his positioning was he was

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.450 
noticed his positioning was he was
always<00:02:11.780> sent<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.320> being<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.710> the<00:02:12.830> right<00:02:13.010> area

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
always sent to being in the right area

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.190 
always sent to being in the right area
unlike<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> lot<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.390> strikes<00:02:14.660> I've<00:02:14.870> tried<00:02:15.050> this

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
unlike a lot of strikes I've tried this

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.070 
unlike a lot of strikes I've tried this
year<00:02:15.380> you're<00:02:15.950> just<00:02:15.980> always<00:02:16.400> there<00:02:16.960> what<00:02:17.960> was

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
year you're just always there what was

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.440 
year you're just always there what was
that<00:02:18.230> for<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> sweat<00:02:18.800> with<00:02:18.980> barber<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.760> think

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
that for the sweat with barber I think

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.900 
that for the sweat with barber I think
he<00:02:20.510> had<00:02:20.600> 94<00:02:21.170> positioning<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.430> does<00:02:22.670> show

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
he had 94 positioning and that does show

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.030 
he had 94 positioning and that does show
when<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.210> use<00:02:23.450> an<00:02:23.600> ingame<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.800> just<00:02:24.950> see

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.190 
when you use an ingame and I just see
very<00:02:25.220> very<00:02:25.340> nice<00:02:25.880> long<00:02:26.090> stop<00:02:26.360> anyway<00:02:26.750> it's

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
good so many like that the next positive

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.970 
good so many like that the next positive
thing<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.410> he<00:02:30.470> could<00:02:30.650> play

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
cam sent forward or striker eyes and as

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.610 
cam sent forward or striker eyes and as
a<00:02:40.280> striker<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.940> sent<00:02:41.360> forward<00:02:41.600> played<00:02:42.320> about

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
a striker and sent forward played about

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.230 
a striker and sent forward played about
three<00:02:42.980> games<00:02:43.190> we<00:02:43.340> might<00:02:43.520> send<00:02:43.730> forward<00:02:43.970> and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
three games we might send forward and

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.910 
three games we might send forward and
that's<00:02:44.360> hand<00:02:44.750> out<00:02:44.870> striker<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.440> did<00:02:45.620> preferment

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
that's hand out striker I did preferment

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.190 
that's hand out striker I did preferment
striker<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:46.970> felt<00:02:47.210> you<00:02:47.330> could<00:02:47.870> convert

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
striker but I felt you could convert

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.590 
striker but I felt you could convert
into<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> cam<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:49.100> think<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:50.030> would<00:02:50.180> be<00:02:50.300> like

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
into a cam I think that would be like

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.510 
into a cam I think that would be like
really<00:02:51.140> good<00:02:51.350> because<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.740> got<00:02:51.860> nice<00:02:52.130> stats

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
really good because it's got nice stats

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.480 
really good because it's got nice stats
and<00:02:52.910> then<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:54.320> last<00:02:54.800> thing<00:02:55.100> I've<00:02:55.220> already

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
and then the last thing I've already

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.950 
and then the last thing I've already
mentioned<00:02:55.820> is<00:02:55.940> this<00:02:56.060> pace<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.600> know<00:02:56.630> it's<00:02:56.840> not

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
mentioned is this pace you know it's not

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.010 
mentioned is this pace you know it's not
great<00:02:57.230> 83<00:02:57.800> it's<00:02:57.950> decent<00:02:58.430> just<00:02:58.820> not<00:02:58.970> great<00:02:59.270> then

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
great 83 it's decent just not great then

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.950 
great 83 it's decent just not great then
there's<00:03:00.200> negatives

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
there's negatives

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.120 
there's negatives
there's<00:03:02.960> only<00:03:03.050> negatives<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.680> thought<00:03:03.920> was

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
there's only negatives I thought was

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.730 
there's only negatives I thought was
passing<00:03:04.700> only<00:03:05.360> 70<00:03:05.990> passing<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.620> his

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
passing only 70 passing and his

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.620 
passing only 70 passing and his
acceleration<00:03:07.160> wasn't<00:03:08.030> too<00:03:08.150> great<00:03:08.300> you<00:03:08.420> know

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
acceleration wasn't too great you know

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.920 
acceleration wasn't too great you know
he<00:03:08.720> wasn't<00:03:08.900> fast<00:03:09.260> off<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.500> mark<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:11.360> last<00:03:11.570> one

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
he wasn't fast off the mark the last one

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.720 
he wasn't fast off the mark the last one
well<00:03:12.260> it's<00:03:12.410> not<00:03:12.470> really<00:03:12.620> negative<00:03:13.220> it's<00:03:13.520> just

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
well it's not really negative it's just

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.970 
well it's not really negative it's just
you<00:03:14.180> know<00:03:14.270> his<00:03:14.450> price<00:03:14.840> he's<00:03:15.170> about<00:03:15.350> 600<00:03:15.830> play

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
you know his price he's about 600 play

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.910 
you know his price he's about 600 play

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
point five out of ten I thought it was
