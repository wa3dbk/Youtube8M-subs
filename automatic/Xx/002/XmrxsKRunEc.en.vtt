00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
think in the next updates things like

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:15.800 
think in the next updates things like
cars<00:07:11.339> and<00:07:13.520> arc<00:07:14.520> rearrange<00:07:15.120> and<00:07:15.419> stuff<00:07:15.659> like

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
cars and arc rearrange and stuff like

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.850 
cars and arc rearrange and stuff like
that<00:07:15.990> will<00:07:16.229> appear<00:07:17.539> so<00:07:18.539> that<00:07:18.749> it<00:07:18.870> is<00:07:19.080> okay<00:07:19.499> guys

is as I think these first things that
you<00:07:23.249> will<00:07:23.639> see<00:07:23.879> after<00:07:24.300> you<00:07:24.330> update<00:07:24.839> is<00:07:25.319> this
