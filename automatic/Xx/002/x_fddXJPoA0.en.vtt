been researching I already do not eat
meat<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.930> my<00:01:34.170> iron<00:01:34.500> levels<00:01:35.009> are<00:01:35.220> low

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
meat as it is so my iron levels are low

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.760 
meat as it is so my iron levels are low
so<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> take<00:01:36.900> an<00:01:37.049> iron<00:01:37.290> supplement

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
so I do have to take an iron supplement

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
so I do have to take an iron supplement
but<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.060> want<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.299> also<00:01:39.450> let<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.840> got
