00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
upstairs I'm going beneath the bridge to

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.510 
upstairs I'm going beneath the bridge to
avoid<00:06:14.449> the<00:06:14.599> first<00:06:14.870> sub<00:06:15.110> by<00:06:15.319> the<00:06:15.380> enemy<00:06:15.710> rope<00:06:15.889> it

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
avoid the first sub by the enemy rope it

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.909 
avoid the first sub by the enemy rope it
is<00:06:17.150> much<00:06:17.419> less<00:06:17.630> likely<00:06:17.690> for<00:06:18.110> him<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:18.800> be

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
is much less likely for him to be

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.180 
is much less likely for him to be
downstairs<00:06:19.370> so<00:06:20.060> I'd<00:06:20.870> rather<00:06:21.199> take<00:06:21.500> no<00:06:21.740> chances

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
downstairs so I'd rather take no chances
