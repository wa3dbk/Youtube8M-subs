00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.470
 today is the big day of the game and you're 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.300
 stopped 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.390
 you are willing to give everything 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.390
 ah 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.610
 If you want to avoid this you must make a 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.610
 good heating 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.609
 heated with rossi 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.770
 hello friends today I'll show you how 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.390
 do a good warm-up before a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.090
 football match so they do not suffer 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.590
 injuries today is a very cold day now 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.810
 same we will be some two or three 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.980
 degrees so it's very important that 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.980
 be well protected from the cold 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.089
 and follow all these steps to not 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.780
 hurt us so here we go 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.009
 The first rule is the last thing 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.869
 then touch the first thing that there is 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.400
 to do is to heat the body well so 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.400
 now we forget about the ball 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.220
 the first exercise about are in 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.770
 general all the muscles of the body and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.260
 from heart the necessary pulsations 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.790
 so that we do not drown and can 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.020
 get going now so first thing 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.420
 what we are going to do is going to be more or less 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.420
 about 5 minutes running at a trot 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.670
 it is very important to stretch so that later 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.670
 the next day we have no laces 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:56.790
 to all those now that we are already with 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.009
 him and we've already been fine let's do 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.170
 the exercises that is the knees 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:10.090
 above does not happen for us to put like this 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.090
 and the heels back like that 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.849
 in other people 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.849
 Now let's stretch the screws 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.220
 and so a good time and then we will 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.220
 sideways 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.629
 inside and outside it 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.909
 now let's connect the muscles here 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.190
 ok then let's do the knees 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.030
 well for inside 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.030
 with both legs 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.140
 and for outside 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.540
 we have to raise our legs well to 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.540
 note that they are not stretched 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.530
 do not 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.390
 now this exercise is also very 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.909
 important so that we do not injure ourselves 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.110
 when we do a little bit for is where 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:19.560
 I call it the kick it 's like that 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.560
 with both legs 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.650
 ok now let's do for her that 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.269
 We are a little tired, stop 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.400
 warm up all the muscles now let's go 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.400
 to do a side race 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.540
 to heat everything wrong then let's 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:57.209
 make a zig zag 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.209
 which is the same as painting 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.010
 now let's move on to the top train 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.660
 It is also very important so that 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.260
 give us tugs especially with this guy 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.260
 in the back 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.240
 here 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.959
 the grinder with features for 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.959
 ahead 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.570
 Y 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.949
 down 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.129
 these neck exercises now you have to 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.930
 doing it is very slow because they are the 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:45.060
 guarantees so these must be done with 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.060
 a lot of calm aside 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.540
 we make to the right 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.050
 and then to lower up 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.490
 when we go up there 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.229
 we exaggerate because we can do 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.229
 a lot of damage we always stop at the center 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.770
 now let's make a career in 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.389
 progression and then a sprint and already for 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.639
 finish the race in progression 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.440
 we started from very slow 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.889
 very very very progressively up 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.889
 finish 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.020
 and the spirit 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:46.090
 and this has been all friends 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:49.930
 you are not ready to give everything in the 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.300
 soccer field and be the best 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.440
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.440
