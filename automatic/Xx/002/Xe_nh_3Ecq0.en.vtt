the strings that are on the side and she

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.199 
the strings that are on the side and she
actually<00:03:56.239> ran<00:03:56.630> it<00:03:56.840> through<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.140> grommet<00:03:57.470> and

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
way and then she just tied the ends

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.979 
way and then she just tied the ends
together<00:04:07.310> because<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.120> was<00:04:08.239> so<00:04:08.480> full<00:04:08.720> in<00:04:08.870> the

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
together because it was so full in the

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.660 
together because it was so full in the
middle<00:04:09.200> she<00:04:09.380> couldn't<00:04:09.680> get<00:04:09.769> it<00:04:09.920> closed<00:04:10.280> with

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
middle she couldn't get it closed with

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.060 
middle she couldn't get it closed with
snap<00:04:11.150> that<00:04:11.870> she<00:04:12.110> just<00:04:12.320> tied<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.650> ends

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
snap that she just tied the ends

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.290 
snap that she just tied the ends
together<00:04:13.340> like<00:04:13.700> this<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:13.940> I'm

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
together like this and I'm

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.240 
together like this and I'm
do<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.540> on<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.750> other<00:04:14.870> side<00:04:14.990> let's<00:04:15.800> assume<00:04:16.040> we

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
do it on the other side let's assume we

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.500 
do it on the other side let's assume we
can't<00:04:16.489> snap<00:04:16.790> it<00:04:16.970> in<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.090> middle<00:04:17.299> because<00:04:17.420> it's

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
can't snap it in the middle because it's

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
can't snap it in the middle because it's
so<00:04:17.840> heavy<00:04:18.290> and<00:04:18.709> so<00:04:19.489> heavy<00:04:19.730> it's<00:04:20.000> so<00:04:20.239> full<00:04:20.570> it's

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
so heavy and so heavy it's so full it's

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.900 
so heavy and so heavy it's so full it's
actually<00:04:21.620> really<00:04:22.100> not<00:04:22.250> heavy<00:04:22.490> when<00:04:22.760> it's

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
actually really not heavy when it's
