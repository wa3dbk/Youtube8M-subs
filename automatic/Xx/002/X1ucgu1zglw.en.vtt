different pictures and I joined him in
Photoshop<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.530> made<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:41.010> big<00:00:41.280> picture<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
Photoshop and made one big picture and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.369 
Photoshop and made one big picture and
use<00:00:45.500> flash<00:00:46.790> to<00:00:47.790> make<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.180> scan<00:00:48.600> across<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
use flash to make it scan across the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.940 
use flash to make it scan across the
picture<00:00:50.719> now<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:51.989> soon<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.739> done

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
picture now as soon as this is done

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.310 
picture now as soon as this is done
scanning<00:00:53.670> across<00:00:54.390> there<00:00:54.809> will<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:54.930> another

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
scanning across there will be another

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.340 
scanning across there will be another
one<00:00:55.620> that's<00:00:56.340> looking<00:00:56.879> straight<00:00:57.420> across<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
one that's looking straight across the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.060 
one that's looking straight across the
bridge<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.640> I'll<00:01:00.410> discuss<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.649> when<00:01:01.860> I<00:01:01.920> get

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
bridge and I'll discuss that when I get

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.420 
bridge and I'll discuss that when I get
there<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:03.899> can't<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.500> did<00:01:04.829> themes<00:01:05.219> are

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
there but you can't see I did themes are

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
there but you can't see I did themes are
cleaned<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.880> pretty<00:01:06.090> good<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.509> can't<00:01:06.750> see<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
cleaned up pretty good you can't see the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.109 
cleaned up pretty good you can't see the
things<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.009> you're<00:01:08.189> worth<00:01:08.369> been<00:01:08.759> joined

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
things and you're worth been joined

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.929 
things and you're worth been joined
together<00:01:10.159> but<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.189> play<00:01:11.459> with<00:01:11.609> the<00:01:11.729> different

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
together but I play with the different

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.840 
together but I play with the different
programs<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.810> lot<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.979> found<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.520> flash

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
programs a lot and I found as flash

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.599 
programs a lot and I found as flash
works<00:01:15.209> very<00:01:15.600> nice<00:01:15.959> too<00:01:16.459> to<00:01:17.459> do<00:01:17.779> panorama

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
works very nice too to do panorama

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:25.339 
works very nice too to do panorama
pictures<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:24.240> almost<00:01:24.539> looks<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.990> movie

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:25.349 
pictures it almost looks like a movie

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:27.319 
pictures it almost looks like a movie
scan<00:01:25.829> except<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.429> fact<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> water<00:01:27.149> is

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
scan except for the fact the water is

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.199 
scan except for the fact the water is
not<00:01:27.509> moving<00:01:27.569> any<00:01:28.289> my<00:01:29.039> next<00:01:29.399> project<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
not moving any my next project is that

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.149 
not moving any my next project is that
see<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.869> use<00:01:31.049> flash<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.499> make<00:01:31.950> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
see if I can use flash to make that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:43.760 
see if I can use flash to make that
water<00:01:32.749> move

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.660 

now<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.790> looking<00:01:44.970> across<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> bridge

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
now this is looking across the bridge

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.630 
now this is looking across the bridge
this<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.880> Chinatown<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.780> come<00:01:49.290> into<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.070> if

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
this is Chinatown you come into and if

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.149 
this is Chinatown you come into and if
you<00:01:50.820> keep<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.360> you're<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.259> different

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
you keep going you're going to different

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:02.090 
you keep going you're going to different
sort<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.820> Astoria<00:02:00.320> but<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.770> drops

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
sort of Astoria but I think this drops

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.980 
sort of Astoria but I think this drops
directly<00:02:02.430> Myra's<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.270> dropped<00:02:03.570> directly

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
directly Myra's that dropped directly

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.570 
directly Myra's that dropped directly
down<00:02:04.170> into<00:02:04.200> Chinatown<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:07.220> do<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.589 
down into Chinatown the one do you see a
very<00:02:09.000> small<00:02:09.630> domed<00:02:10.200> building<00:02:10.950> off<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
very small domed building off to the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.590 
very small domed building off to the
left<00:02:12.900> side<00:02:15.470> between<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.769> light<00:02:17.100> pole<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.600> and

left side between the light pole and and
and<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.410> real<00:02:19.590> small<00:02:19.980> back<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.670> there<00:02:20.790> and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
and it's real small back up in there and

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.940 
and it's real small back up in there and
I<00:02:20.940> get<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.780> Chinatown

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
I get that it's in Chinatown

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
that's what Myra told me anyway now this

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.449 
that's what Myra told me anyway now this
is<00:02:27.900> zoom<00:02:28.200> was<00:02:28.560> taken<00:02:29.069> with<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:31.610> using<00:02:32.610> flash

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
is zoom was taken with the using flash

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.280 
is zoom was taken with the using flash
it's<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.640> little<00:02:35.850> shaky<00:02:36.209> I'm<00:02:36.600> still<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.230> don't

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
it's a little shaky I'm still I don't

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.380 
it's a little shaky I'm still I don't
know<00:02:37.620> if<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:37.799> something<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.400> I'm<00:02:38.610> doing<00:02:39.000> or

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
know if it's something that I'm doing or

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.750 
know if it's something that I'm doing or
if<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.690> them<00:02:39.980> just<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.160> nature<00:02:41.549> of<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
if it's them just the nature of the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.390 
if it's them just the nature of the
flasher<00:02:42.269> if<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.450> have<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.810> do<00:02:42.989> wait<00:02:43.200> long<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.950> did

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
flasher if I have to do wait long I did

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400 
flasher if I have to do wait long I did
actually<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.910> guess<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.239> did<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> lot<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.780> zoom<00:02:46.200> in

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
actually I guess I did a lot of zoom in

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.860 
actually I guess I did a lot of zoom in
a<00:02:46.500> small<00:02:46.830> amount<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.250> time<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.510> picture

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
a small amount of time so the picture

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.449 
a small amount of time so the picture
has<00:02:49.079> to<00:02:49.350> jump<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.829> little<00:02:50.160> bit<00:02:52.160> but<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.280> does<00:02:53.430> a

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
has to jump a little bit but it does a

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.060 
has to jump a little bit but it does a
pretty<00:02:53.730> good<00:02:53.820> job<00:02:54.030> with<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.750> zoom<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.320> again

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
pretty good job with the zoom and again

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.460 
pretty good job with the zoom and again
I'm<00:02:56.250> using<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.730> little<00:02:56.970> Kodak<00:02:57.329> camera<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
I'm using a little Kodak camera the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.140 
I'm using a little Kodak camera the
little<00:03:00.049> very<00:03:01.049> small<00:03:01.680> lightweight<00:03:01.950> camera<00:03:02.579> all

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
little very small lightweight camera all

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.270 
little very small lightweight camera all
rolled<00:03:03.630> camera<00:03:04.230> I'm<00:03:04.290> using<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.709> do<00:03:04.859> this

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
rolled camera I'm using to do this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.880 
rolled camera I'm using to do this
here's<00:03:05.880> off<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.600> right<00:03:06.810> hand<00:03:07.170> side<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.769> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
here's off on the right hand side of the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.000 
here's off on the right hand side of the
bridge<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.200> same<00:03:10.500> thing<00:03:10.829> it's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
bridge and this is the same thing it's

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.890 
bridge and this is the same thing it's
actually<00:03:11.459> three<00:03:11.820> different<00:03:12.269> pictures<00:03:12.510> were

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
actually three different pictures were

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.270 
actually three different pictures were
taken<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.760> joined<00:03:14.760> together<00:03:14.940> with<00:03:15.260> Photoshop

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
taken and joined together with Photoshop

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.800 
taken and joined together with Photoshop
and<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:18.000> make<00:03:18.180> one<00:03:18.420> big<00:03:18.720> long<00:03:18.989> panorama

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
and to make one big long panorama

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.349 
and to make one big long panorama
picture<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.319> then<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.160> use<00:03:23.430> flash<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:26.359> scan

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
picture and then I use flash to scan

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.770 
picture and then I use flash to scan
that<00:03:27.630> panoramic<00:03:28.410> picture<00:03:28.769> out<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:30.690> it

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
that panoramic picture out and so it

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.349 
that panoramic picture out and so it
actually<00:03:31.139> looked<00:03:31.319> like<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.530> most<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.489> like

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
actually looked like a most like a like

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.379 
actually looked like a most like a like
a<00:03:33.389> video<00:03:33.769> scanning<00:03:34.769> across<00:03:35.160> there<00:03:35.519> but<00:03:36.239> again

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
a video scanning across there but again

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.150 
a video scanning across there but again
like<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:37.049> there's<00:03:37.319> not<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.530> video<00:03:37.769> if<00:03:38.010> you

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
like it there's not a video if you

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.830 
like it there's not a video if you
notice<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.549> water<00:03:38.819> is<00:03:39.030> not<00:03:39.209> moving<00:03:39.269> or

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
notice the water is not moving or

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.740 
notice the water is not moving or
anything

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.180 

I<00:03:46.840> think<00:03:47.590> probably<00:03:47.980> if<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.430> did<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:48.670> higher

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
I think probably if I did a higher

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.420 
I think probably if I did a higher
higher<00:03:52.050> frames<00:03:53.050> per<00:03:53.380> second<00:03:53.890> I<00:03:53.980> may<00:03:54.160> they'll

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
higher frames per second I may they'll

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.310 
higher frames per second I may they'll
get<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:54.850> little<00:03:55.060> bit<00:03:55.270> of<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.540> jump<00:03:55.900> out<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.110> it

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
get that little bit of a jump out of it

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.820 
get that little bit of a jump out of it
but<00:03:56.560> my<00:03:57.220> file<00:03:57.610> size<00:03:58.030> size<00:03:58.450> increases<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.470> lot

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
but my file size size increases a lot

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.990 
but my file size size increases a lot
when<00:04:00.610> I<00:04:00.640> start<00:04:01.120> doing<00:04:01.390> that<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:03.000> considering

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
when I start doing that and considering

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.970 
when I start doing that and considering
my<00:04:04.030> internet<00:04:04.630> here<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.870> want<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.260> do<00:04:05.380> anything<00:04:05.680> I

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
my internet here I want to do anything I

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.030 
my internet here I want to do anything I
can<00:04:06.040> do<00:04:06.720> Laure<00:04:07.720> file<00:04:08.170> sizes

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
can do Laure file sizes

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.510 
can do Laure file sizes
but<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.400> kind<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:09.970> like<00:04:10.209> this<00:04:10.450> effect<00:04:11.080> of

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
but I kind of like this effect of

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.190 
but I kind of like this effect of
scanning<00:04:12.520> across<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.390> might<00:04:13.600> even<00:04:13.720> try<00:04:14.050> this

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
scanning across I might even try this

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.670 
scanning across I might even try this
down<00:04:14.590> through<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.160> neighborhood<00:04:15.790> and

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
down through the neighborhood and

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.520 
down through the neighborhood and
different<00:04:17.680> areas<00:04:18.040> around<00:04:18.190> here<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.880> show<00:04:19.090> them

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
different areas around here to show them

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.560 
different areas around here to show them
so<00:04:20.530> what<00:04:20.769> I'm<00:04:20.919> actually<00:04:21.220> looking<00:04:21.609> at<00:04:22.030> it's

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
so what I'm actually looking at it's

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.210 
so what I'm actually looking at it's
something<00:04:22.870> about<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.140> still<00:04:23.530> picture<00:04:23.800> that

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
something about a still picture that

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.190 
something about a still picture that
that<00:04:24.460> lacks<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.510> little<00:04:25.660> bit<00:04:25.960> when<00:04:26.110> you're

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
that lacks a little bit when you're

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.320 
that lacks a little bit when you're
moving<00:04:26.710> across<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.130> scene<00:04:27.640> that's<00:04:27.910> kind<00:04:28.210> of

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
moving across the scene that's kind of

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.270 
moving across the scene that's kind of
neat<00:04:28.630> because<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:29.050> again<00:04:29.320> get<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.070> real

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
neat because you again get the real

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.780 
neat because you again get the real
effect<00:04:30.700> of<00:04:30.850> what<00:04:31.000> it<00:04:31.090> looks<00:04:31.300> like<00:04:32.610> but<00:04:33.610> this<00:04:33.730> is

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
effect of what it looks like but this is

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.300 
effect of what it looks like but this is
right<00:04:34.150> by<00:04:34.330> immigration<00:04:35.140> you'll<00:04:35.650> have<00:04:35.890> to<00:04:36.100> wait

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
right by immigration you'll have to wait

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.460 
right by immigration you'll have to wait
at<00:04:36.490> immigration<00:04:37.180> for<00:04:37.390> papers<00:04:37.780> any<00:04:37.960> words<00:04:38.260> it

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
at immigration for papers any words it

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.200 
at immigration for papers any words it
wouldn't<00:04:38.770> be<00:04:38.919> bad<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.280> walk<00:04:39.490> up<00:04:39.700> here<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:39.940> take

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
wouldn't be bad to walk up here and take

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.020 
wouldn't be bad to walk up here and take
a<00:04:40.240> little<00:04:40.480> peek<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:41.080> know<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:42.870> nice<00:04:43.870> view
