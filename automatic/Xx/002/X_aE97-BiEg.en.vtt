00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
video as well you can see right on the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.380 
video as well you can see right on the
unit<00:00:52.679> itself<00:00:52.769> I've<00:00:53.159> got<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.909> trackpad

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
unit itself I've got the the trackpad

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.849 
unit itself I've got the the trackpad
here<00:00:54.629> obviously<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.079> hook<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.350> an<00:00:55.440> external

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
here obviously I can hook up an external

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.709 
here obviously I can hook up an external
mouse<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.670> there's<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.269> looks<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
mouse and then there's what looks like a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.559 
mouse and then there's what looks like a
huge<00:00:58.379> mouse<00:00:58.859> trackpad<00:00:59.309> well<00:00:59.819> an<00:01:00.030> actual<00:01:00.359> fact

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
huge mouse trackpad well an actual fact

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.829 
huge mouse trackpad well an actual fact
this<00:01:00.749> is<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.069> Wacom<00:01:02.069> tablet<00:01:02.670> wacom<00:01:03.179> tablets<00:01:03.719> are

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
this is a Wacom tablet wacom tablets are

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.329 
this is a Wacom tablet wacom tablets are
used<00:01:03.989> by<00:01:04.170> graphics<00:01:04.589> professionals<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
used by graphics professionals to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.120 
used by graphics professionals to
actually<00:01:05.790> draw<00:01:06.210> or<00:01:06.570> edit<00:01:06.930> photo<00:01:07.409> images<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
actually draw or edit photo images and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.740 
actually draw or edit photo images and
like<00:01:08.640> i<00:01:08.759> said<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.030> thing's<00:01:09.240> built<00:01:09.509> right

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
like i said this thing's built right

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.569 
like i said this thing's built right
onto<00:01:10.079> the<00:01:10.170> unit<00:01:10.380> there's<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.430> much

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
onto the unit there's that that much

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.969 
onto the unit there's that that much
space<00:01:11.909> inside<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.380> powerhouse<00:01:13.799> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
space inside this it's a powerhouse you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.840 
space inside this it's a powerhouse you
can<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> number<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.579> different

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
can get a number of different

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090 
can get a number of different
configurations<00:01:15.570> things<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.469> dual-core

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
configurations things like a dual-core

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.760 
configurations things like a dual-core
processor<00:01:17.729> even<00:01:18.180> quad-core<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.320> got<00:01:19.500> two

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
processor even quad-core it's got two

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.499 
processor even quad-core it's got two
hard<00:01:20.159> drive<00:01:20.369> bays<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.850> well<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.479> can

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
hard drive bays as well so you can

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.910 
hard drive bays as well so you can
actually<00:01:21.869> set<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.289> with<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> raid

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
actually set this up with a raid

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.639 
actually set this up with a raid
configuration<00:01:23.700> raise<00:01:24.090> 0<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.689> raid<00:01:25.079> 1<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
configuration raise 0 and raid 1 and

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.410 
configuration raise 0 and raid 1 and
essentially<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.399> that<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.119> something

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
essentially what that is is something

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.459 
essentially what that is is something
that<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.600> find<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.960> high-end<00:01:28.289> desktop

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
that you find in high-end desktop

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.319 
that you find in high-end desktop
workstations<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.700> allows<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> have

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
workstations it allows you to have

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.420 
workstations it allows you to have
redundant<00:01:30.780> backup<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.950> data<00:01:32.189> so

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
redundant backup of your your data so

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.709 
redundant backup of your your data so
that<00:01:32.460> you're<00:01:32.729> always<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> go<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.659> you

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
that you're always on the go and you

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.510 
that you're always on the go and you
don't<00:01:33.899> have<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> worry<00:01:34.320> about<00:01:34.439> any<00:01:35.009> failure

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
don't have to worry about any failure

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580 
don't have to worry about any failure
what<00:01:36.000> makes<00:01:36.149> this<00:01:36.270> thing<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.539> little<00:01:37.229> unique

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
what makes this thing a little unique

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.859 
what makes this thing a little unique
though<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.039> not<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> size<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.479> what<00:01:39.719> else

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
though is not just a size but what else

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
though is not just a size but what else
it<00:01:40.049> packs<00:01:40.289> in<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.549> side<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:41.939> can

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it packs in it on the side here I can

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.690 
it packs in it on the side here I can
push<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.719> and<00:01:43.469> check<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:44.039> this<00:01:44.520> is

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
push this in and check this out this is

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.270 
push this in and check this out this is
a<00:01:44.729> full<00:01:45.090> 10<00:01:45.630> inch<00:01:45.810> screen<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.439> pops<00:01:46.469> out<00:01:46.859> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
a full 10 inch screen that pops out the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.910 
a full 10 inch screen that pops out the
side<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.969> actual<00:01:48.299> laptop<00:01:48.570> screen<00:01:49.200> you're

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
side of the actual laptop screen you're

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.340 
side of the actual laptop screen you're
probably<00:01:50.130> asking<00:01:50.340> why<00:01:51.299> why<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.810> i<00:01:52.020> need<00:01:52.079> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
probably asking why why do i need this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.649
