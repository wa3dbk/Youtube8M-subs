00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.740
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.140
 this is part 2 of my knowledge specials 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.270
 and today there are four different ones 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.310
 hairstyles that can wear on the wiesn 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.290
 if you want and want to know 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.910
 For example, one thing was done right 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.770
 by the way this is also the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.440
 the easiest thing is just the video 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 and yes, if you have my first division 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 did not see the link to you 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.140
 again in the infobox I film today 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.430
 times out for a change I think so 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.870
 actually quite the last 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.580
 enjoy sunbeams 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.800
 See you next time a lot 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.750
 fun in the video let him but one 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:08.220
 thumbs up , you liked it 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:09.840
 and yes we start with the first 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.610
 hairstyle which at the same time also the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.580
 the simplest is all you have for it 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.340
 need is such a flower wreath you 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.570
 just on your head are the and 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.680
 then you take if you so one you 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.050
 have small side vertex like me 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.240
 Turn around a few times and pinch it 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.979
 in the back of the elastic band of the flower wreath 1 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.119
 and that was all if you were 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.280
 you want your hair now 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.569
 I tease tablets or curls 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.759
 of course I left it now 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.710
 the second hairstyle is almost the same 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.840
 just how much to number one and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 Although you just take all yours 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.160
 hair as far as possible and you 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.330
 through a relatively deep 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.270
 page crest 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.970
 then you take your part through yours 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.840
 hair in three parts and escapes 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.840
 just as usual 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.710
 Did you do that? 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:15.540
 end just with a hang to the end 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.390
 you still pull a strand of your pony 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.340
 Out of the head and you can 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.020
 either with a curling iron again 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.090
 make it easy or just leave it 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.890
 so fixed and is a meeting with 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.800
 bring out that is already hairstyle 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.900
 number two you probably noticed 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.600
 then I'll show you how to do it 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.590
 such flowers limit super investors 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.630
 can integrate with 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.220
 and now number 2 can flow 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.080
 just come back with a flower wreath 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.540
 a little more and then 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.830
 you just turn back for that 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.600
 pulled out of the pony and pinched 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.030
 It's back in the gum of the flower wreath 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.930
 is so easy and second hairstyle could 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.930
 pump again 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.070
 why number three is such a kind of trend 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.500
 but only speaks in pony this time 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.450
 all you have to do is 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.080
 again a relatively deep 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:18.180
 side vertex relatively deep and braids 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.830
 Just follow it as usual 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.430
 after you take a strand then 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.650
 from below and we are weaving 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.070
 see also can just one with 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.290
 So it's normal to braid like a spray 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.500
 you would just do that until then 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.340
 finish until a braided strand 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.340
 originated 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.200
 then you just take a whole 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.430
 thin little hair tie I know 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.340
 does not recognize, I do not like the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:59.860
 those are from me solo bender and 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.270
 just turns a knot around than 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.630
 Lastly, take another bobby 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.670
 pins and pin expensive strand of hair easy 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.850
 Back at the back and that's it 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.850
 already everything 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.510
 we come to the hairstyle number four and 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.859
 that is such a side braided that 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.380
 is also the hardest at the same time 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.530
 hairstyle in quotes you have yes 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.090
 already a strand on the front head 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.729
 braided that stays as it were 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.680
 basis and then simply planarize you 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.590
 again a side braid as well 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.270
 inflation number two even then 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.699
 Just fix it all again 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.610
 with a normal hair ties and then 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.699
 So you just turn the pigtail 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.169
 just such a small side bush 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.000
 can see videos 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:51.509
 through a second hair tie and 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.220
 that attaches to your head is that 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.320
 we just take it all done 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.419
 Many bobby pins and turn ours 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.940
 front strand still in the butt with 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.570
 and just stick it to ours 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.570
 occiput 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.620
 if you want you can also here 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.720
 Give your home hairstyle again and 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.050
 finished is a super pretty meadows 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.050
 crisis
