00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.700 
is how it is with the light as you can
see<00:01:47.509> I'm<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.020> only<00:01:49.170> thing<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.470> bothers<00:01:49.710> me

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
see I'm the only thing that bothers me

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.050 
see I'm the only thing that bothers me
is<00:01:49.920> they're<00:01:50.100> not<00:01:50.220> quite<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.549> comfortable<00:01:50.729> as

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
is they're not quite as comfortable as

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.870 
is they're not quite as comfortable as
my<00:01:51.180> other<00:01:51.270> contacts<00:01:51.810> are<00:01:52.049> um<00:01:52.579> but<00:01:53.579> I'm<00:01:53.700> pretty

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
my other contacts are um but I'm pretty

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.609 
my other contacts are um but I'm pretty
sure<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.299> because<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.630> my<00:01:54.780> own<00:01:54.930> my<00:01:55.470> eyes

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
sure that's because of my own my eyes

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.289 
sure that's because of my own my eyes
because<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.100> my<00:01:56.189> base<00:01:56.369> curve<00:01:56.670> because<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.180> have

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
because of my base curve because I have

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.149 
because of my base curve because I have
some<00:01:57.450> friends<00:01:57.630> who<00:01:57.840> own<00:01:57.869> them<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.890> they

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
some friends who own them and there they

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.649 
some friends who own them and there they
say<00:01:59.670> they're<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.000> comfortable<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.570> i'm

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
say they're really comfortable so i'm

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.730 
say they're really comfortable so i'm
pretty<00:02:00.840> sure<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.229> an<00:02:01.320> individual

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
pretty sure it's just an individual

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.069 
pretty sure it's just an individual
thing<00:02:02.149> they<00:02:03.149> also<00:02:03.270> don't<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.600> quite<00:02:03.840> as<00:02:03.930> much

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
thing they also don't have quite as much

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.870 
thing they also don't have quite as much
water<00:02:04.259> content<00:02:04.829> as<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.159> other<00:02:05.280> context<00:02:05.759> i

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
water content as the other context i

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.249 
water content as the other context i
were<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.180> that's<00:02:06.299> probably<00:02:06.479> also<00:02:06.689> part<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.110> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
were so that's probably also part of it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.830 
were so that's probably also part of it
but<00:02:07.619> as<00:02:07.740> long<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.069> keep<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.399> eyes<00:02:08.840> moist

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
but as long as you keep your eyes moist

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.370 
but as long as you keep your eyes moist
