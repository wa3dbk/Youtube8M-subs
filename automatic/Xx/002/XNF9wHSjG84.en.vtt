00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
min had the problem glitch where if you

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.900 
min had the problem glitch where if you
shot<00:03:58.350> him<00:03:58.560> right<00:03:58.620> at<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.100> top<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.310> his<00:03:59.489> bald

head<00:04:00.060> he<00:04:00.720> wouldn't<00:04:01.019> dive<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.650> now<00:04:01.739> that's

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
head he wouldn't dive and now that's

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.370 
head he wouldn't dive and now that's
hopefully<00:04:02.370> been<00:04:02.549> fixed<00:04:03.030> more's<00:04:03.810> back<00:04:04.140> on

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
hopefully been fixed more's back on

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.740 
hopefully been fixed more's back on

server<00:04:06.989> replication<00:04:07.620> issues<00:04:07.799> fixed<00:04:08.280> which

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
server replication issues fixed which

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.460 
server replication issues fixed which
means<00:04:09.090> sometimes<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.989> will<00:04:10.049> be<00:04:10.140> taught<00:04:10.350> both

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
means sometimes it will be taught both

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.259 
means sometimes it will be taught both
sometimes<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.070> would<00:04:11.130> be<00:04:11.220> more<00:04:11.459> so<00:04:11.640> now<00:04:12.030> it

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
sometimes it would be more so now it

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.880 
sometimes it would be more so now it
should<00:04:12.480> definitely<00:04:12.870> be<00:04:12.989> more<00:04:13.200> because<00:04:13.859> I

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
should definitely be more because I

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.620 
should definitely be more because I
think<00:04:14.100> they've<00:04:14.340> upped<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:15.030> damage<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.600> the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
think they've upped the damage of the

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.599 
think they've upped the damage of the
more<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.049> hopefully<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.709> works<00:04:16.919> now<00:04:17.250> even

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
more and hopefully it works now even

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.310 
more and hopefully it works now even
though<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:18.030> will<00:04:18.329> miss<00:04:18.539> using<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.989> tour<00:04:19.200> boat

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
though I will miss using the tour boat

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.599 
though I will miss using the tour boat
on<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.620> map<00:04:19.769> because<00:04:19.979> i<00:04:20.100> think<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.400> tour

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
on that map because i think the tour

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.790 
on that map because i think the tour
boat<00:04:20.760> did<00:04:20.970> fit<00:04:21.209> very<00:04:21.450> well<00:04:21.510> but<00:04:22.500> it's<00:04:22.680> up<00:04:22.770> to

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
boat did fit very well but it's up to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.230 
boat did fit very well but it's up to
epic<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.750> also<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.080> last<00:04:25.289> update<00:04:26.280> list

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
epic and also the last update list

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.969 
epic and also the last update list
from<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.539> list<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:27.870> mauler<00:04:28.199> no<00:04:28.500> longer<00:04:28.830> able

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
to hit things through walls so it's just

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.520
