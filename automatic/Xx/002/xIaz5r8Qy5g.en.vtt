well<00:00:35.610> yeah<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.880> could<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.390> could

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
well yeah we could see this could

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.170 
well yeah we could see this could
produce<00:00:36.899> again<00:00:37.410> along<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> coast<00:00:38.700> certainly

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
produce again along the coast certainly

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.790 
produce again along the coast certainly
some<00:00:39.360> major<00:00:39.540> coastal<00:00:39.840> flooding<00:00:40.230> some<00:00:40.559> spots

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
some major coastal flooding some spots

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.670 
some major coastal flooding some spots
could<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.190> record<00:00:41.579> coastal<00:00:41.969> flooding<00:00:42.680> inland

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
could see record coastal flooding inland

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.260 
could see record coastal flooding inland
this<00:00:43.890> has<00:00:44.070> potential<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.550> produce<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.969> lot<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
this has potential to produce a lot of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.900 
this has potential to produce a lot of
heavy<00:00:45.390> rain<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.219> we<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:47.430> certainly<00:00:47.610> see

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
heavy rain and we could certainly see

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
heavy rain and we could certainly see
some<00:00:47.940> major<00:00:48.300> river<00:00:48.629> flooding<00:00:49.110> too<00:00:49.320> soon<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
some major river flooding too soon to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
some major river flooding too soon to
say<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:50.070> river<00:00:50.640> basins<00:00:51.059> might<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.390> hardest

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
say which river basins might be hardest

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
say which river basins might be hardest
hit<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.379> again<00:00:52.890> some<00:00:53.100> places<00:00:53.280> could<00:00:53.520> see

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
hit but again some places could see

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.939 
hit but again some places could see
record<00:00:54.030> flooding<00:00:54.300> inland<00:00:54.719> along<00:00:55.140> our<00:00:55.590> rivers

linger<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.979> more<00:01:53.130> likely<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.490> move

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
linger this is more likely to move

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.520 
linger this is more likely to move
slower<00:01:53.970> than<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.299> average<00:01:54.659> hurricane<00:01:55.200> or

tropical system coming up here a lot of
times<00:01:59.130> when<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> advantages<00:01:59.909> here<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.180> is

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
times when the advantages here is is

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.880 
times when the advantages here is is
they're<00:02:00.450> accelerating<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.350> come<00:02:01.560> by<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
they're accelerating as they come by and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.190 
they're accelerating as they come by and
so<00:02:02.040> they<00:02:02.219> typically<00:02:02.579> maybe<00:02:02.850> only<00:02:03.030> hit<00:02:03.270> one<00:02:03.960> or

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
so they typically maybe only hit one or

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080 
so they typically maybe only hit one or
maybe<00:02:04.320> two<00:02:04.469> high<00:02:05.009> tide<00:02:05.310> cycles<00:02:05.759> along<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
impacts from this storm on Sunday so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350 
impacts from this storm on Sunday so
both<00:02:10.770> hi<00:02:10.950> Ty<00:02:10.979> along<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> coast<00:02:11.790> high<00:02:11.910> tides<00:02:12.180> on

both hi Ty along the coast high tides on
Sunday<00:02:12.780> two<00:02:12.840> more

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
Sunday two more

Sunday two more
on<00:02:13.480> Monday<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:13.989> at<00:02:14.410> least<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.680> one<00:02:14.860> on

on Monday and at least the one on
Tuesday<00:02:15.520> morning<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.360> we<00:02:16.450> could<00:02:16.599> be<00:02:16.629> looking

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
Tuesday morning so we could be looking

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.320 
Tuesday morning so we could be looking
at<00:02:17.020> up<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.200> five<00:02:17.440> high<00:02:17.709> tide<00:02:17.950> cycles<00:02:18.489> possibly

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
at up to five high tide cycles possibly

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.280 
at up to five high tide cycles possibly
each<00:02:19.390> one<00:02:19.540> getting<00:02:19.840> higher<00:02:19.989> than<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
each one getting higher than the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.650 
each one getting higher than the
previous<00:02:20.680> one<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.220> that's<00:02:22.000> all<00:02:22.269> that's<00:02:22.510> a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
previous one so that's all that's a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.180 
previous one so that's all that's a
slumber<00:02:22.690> storm<00:02:23.440> that's<00:02:23.620> why<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.769> impact<00:02:24.129> from

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
slumber storm that's why the impact from

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.580 
slumber storm that's why the impact from
a<00:02:24.310> slow-moving<00:02:24.610> storm<00:02:25.000> inland<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.959> get<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> lot

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
a slow-moving storm inland you get a lot

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.259 
a slow-moving storm inland you get a lot
more<00:02:26.620> rainfall<00:02:27.040> if<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.489> storms<00:02:27.790> moving<00:02:28.060> slow

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
more rainfall if the storms moving slow

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.820 
more rainfall if the storms moving slow
too<00:02:28.330> because<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.780> has<00:02:28.900> time<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.230> add<00:02:29.379> up<00:02:29.410> the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
too because it has time to add up the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.740 
too because it has time to add up the
