only<00:03:37.660> used<00:03:37.959> water<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.790> that's<00:03:40.390> probably

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
only used water and so that's probably

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.070 
only used water and so that's probably
why<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.170> gel<00:03:41.650> didn't<00:03:41.950> come<00:03:42.130> out<00:03:42.600> if<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.870> gel

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
why the gel didn't come out if the gel

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.520 
why the gel didn't come out if the gel
is<00:03:44.110> really<00:03:44.560> thick<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.959> they're<00:03:46.959> really<00:03:47.170> good
