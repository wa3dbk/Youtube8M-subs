 The eyes of the triangle gusset are now one by one 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:51.120
 The in 30 women of Haganekiba It was back and forth knitting, which has been now one last installment is not this rest is up to now

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.880
 In this case 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.100
 Because it is a second eye rubber knitting, I think as it is and look at the surface 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:48.080
 I will weave 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.080
