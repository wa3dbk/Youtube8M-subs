open up and your other foot to pull up
for<00:01:22.560> what<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.890> call<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.640> swing<00:01:23.940> step

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.570 

the<00:01:31.720> swing<00:01:32.020> step<00:01:32.410> simply<00:01:32.710> requires<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.550> to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
the swing step simply requires you to

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.730 
the swing step simply requires you to
swing<00:01:33.940> your<00:01:34.090> foot<00:01:34.300> across<00:01:34.660> your<00:01:34.900> body<00:01:35.050> while

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
swing your foot across your body while

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.650

pulling<00:01:36.070> your<00:01:36.340> knee<00:01:36.520> up<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:37.000> generate<00:01:37.420> some

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
pulling your knee up to generate some

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.230 
pulling your knee up to generate some
upward<00:01:37.840> momentum<00:01:38.140> this<00:01:39.130> is<00:01:39.340> very<00:01:39.580> similar<00:01:40.060> to

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
upward momentum this is very similar to

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.430 
upward momentum this is very similar to
the<00:01:40.330> mechanics<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.080> layup

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
the mechanics of a layup

the mechanics of a layup
because<00:01:41.920> you're<00:01:42.130> shooting<00:01:42.310> side<00:01:42.760> leg<00:01:43.030> drives

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
because you're shooting side leg drives

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.900 
because you're shooting side leg drives
upward<00:01:44.050> as<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.740> extend<00:01:45.100> your<00:01:45.280> arm<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.670> shoot

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
upward as you extend your arm to shoot

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.810 
upward as you extend your arm to shoot
as<00:01:46.750> you're<00:01:47.020> completing<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.680> swing<00:01:47.950> step<00:01:48.220> your

as you're completing the swing step your

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.490 
as you're completing the swing step your

body should be opened up facing the

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.830 
body should be opened up facing the

and over the shooting side shoulder so

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.850

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
full length of your arm what you don't

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.350 
full length of your arm what you don't
want<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.890> loop<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.340> ball<00:02:38.520> out<00:02:38.730> away

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
want to do is loop the ball out away

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.420 
want to do is loop the ball out away
from<00:02:39.570> your<00:02:39.720> body<00:02:39.900> because<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.950> will<00:02:41.220> take

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
from your body because this will take

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.150 
from your body because this will take
too<00:02:41.700> much<00:02:41.880> time<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.990> exposes<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.650> ball<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
too much time and it exposes the ball to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.040 
too much time and it exposes the ball to
other<00:02:44.340> defenders<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.330> keep<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.750> close

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.350 

at<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.860> point<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.640> should<00:02:53.670> release<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
at this point you should release the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.510 
at this point you should release the
ball<00:02:54.540> with<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> soft<00:02:55.200> flop<00:02:55.620> finish<00:02:56.100> at<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.490> top

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
ball with a soft flop finish at the top

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.210

of your arm the follow-through needs to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.670 
of your arm the follow-through needs to
go<00:02:59.340> directly<00:02:59.910> toward<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.330> basket<00:03:00.600> using<00:03:01.560> the

go directly toward the basket using the
same<00:03:01.920> basic<00:03:02.250> mechanics<00:03:03.030> as<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.210> regular<00:03:03.780> shot

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
same basic mechanics as a regular shot

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.500 
same basic mechanics as a regular shot
the<00:03:04.890> ball<00:03:05.130> should<00:03:05.370> come<00:03:05.580> off<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.000> middle<00:03:06.300> and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
the ball should come off the middle and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.200 
the ball should come off the middle and
index<00:03:06.870> fingers<00:03:07.350> last<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.760> ball<00:03:08.970> should

index fingers last and the ball should

have a gentle high arc remember to not

have a gentle high arc remember to not
fade<00:03:12.750> away<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.410> shot<00:03:13.710> if<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.400> defender

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
fade away on this shot if the defender

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.970 
fade away on this shot if the defender
