00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.100
 Hi, I've been looking for information 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.009
 internet how to perform the hack to 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.079
 the great tourism 6 in ps3 the truth is 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.759
 I did not find any in Spanish that 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.589
 convince me or explain it 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.630
 correctly that's why I decided to 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.689
 do it myself to see if I can help and 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.369
 You can do it in your house 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.289
 for this we are only going to need 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.910
 a single program 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.519
 which is the control with sun is all in 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.040
 a rare file I leave the link below 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.260
 in the video description this 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.870
 it only contains this folder that 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.840
 contains two folders are one for ps3 and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.780
 the other one for pc the one that puts in ps3 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.370
 contains a toll worth so 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.450
 we have to install the package this 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.590
 our ps3 so it should be with a 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.080
 custom firmware is valid and the other one is the 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.700
 good pc is an installer for 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.010
 install the program in our 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.280
 our team like all of you 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.170
 you know the ps3 you have to copy in the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.770
 root of a usb file 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.369
 pkg connect this usb to the console and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.290
 from there perform the installation of 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.860
 program when I have installed it 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.590
 he executes jce a little window will come out 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.409
 that you have to say to everything that yes 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.869
 ok then the machine will restart 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.299
 when it restarts you will see that up 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.909
 On the right you have a window that 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.210
 informs you that control with sun up 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.640
 and it's already running so 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.979
 then it was good that you go in the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.929
 shopping console configuration to 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.450
 system tools information 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.729
 system and there you copy the ip address 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.020
 which has at that time the console is worth 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.259
 because that's important for later 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.229
 Now what we will do is enter the great 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.420
 6 tourism will excuse me and I do not have a 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.440
 video capturer copied it with the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.660
 mobile so you can see it is worth 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.790
 shabby but what there is 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.310
 we are in the console as you can see 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.739
 here is already active the control with sun 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.750
 we go to the multi man that you have 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:19.090
 and we load the game 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.090
 there they put me in the reflection 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.800
 and good control with sun we have 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.580
 installed from here from eastern 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.580
 package files 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.860
 in addition to the game 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.230
 is 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.050
 if you look up right now I have 27 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.959
 million and peak is what we are going to 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.940
 to do is to take a career in which the 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.470
 that it is I am going to choose the mass more 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.070
 simple the first and there 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.070
 Amen 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.230
 and what we have to do is as soon as 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.940
 let's start the game to use it 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.569
 at the same time what you do can 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.590
 run a bit and for the later there is 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.590
 that you have to pass it 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.260
 and when we pause then we 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.590
 we will go to the computer to do the second 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.590
 part 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.200
 of that is starting 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.430
 yes, the game is a bit slow for 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.430
 load the races 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.060
 we're 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.530
 pause now 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.500
 once we have the program installed 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.470
 what we will do is execute it 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.410
 we will go to file add a new console 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.480
 we will give you a name and the ip address 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.830
 that we have taken previously for that 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.040
 it is important because if not we are not 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.680
 we can connect, it's okay, I got it done 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.930
 and it will give you what we'll do with 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.840
 right button connect the console me 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.699
 says that you have already connected 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.030
 and that's when we'll have to do the 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:23.900
 modifications are valid in the same file 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.120
 I attached a word that is worth this 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.320
 here where he puts the things we have 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.260
 what to modify 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:37.200
 we will go to memory 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:40.890
 here here you select retracts list 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.620
 We will select and below it 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.930
 the one that says it's on the hard drive the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.300
 game is high 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.620
 with this now we will do the 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.620
 modifications that tells us here 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:01.539
 ok we 'll take this let's copy 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.770
 we go here we hit it on 6 also 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.500
 says you have to change it, you have to 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:12.380
 put a 32-bit word value 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:15.820
 and the input is also copied 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.300
 and we will stick it here 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.610
 we click on epoc se la suda no decir 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.160
 nothing is normal now we will do the same 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.360
 changing the values ​​again this here 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.360
 we copy it 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.189
 we paste it here 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.620
 the 6 is the same are word values of 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.620
 32 bits 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.550
 and we paste it, we give it to little and neither 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.500
 He says nothing but we have already done it 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.280
 ok now we will have to go back 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.710
 to the console and finish the race when 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.210
 let's finish it and we'll get one 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.500
 little window that will tell us that we can not 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.720
 have more than 50 million credits and 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.710
 we will finish it's worth now I'm going to 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.610
 finish it finish the game 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.190
 and it's worth 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.350
 we have finished the race 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.490
 this is level provides I'm holding the 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.770
 mobile and command at the same time 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.960
 you will see what I said about the 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.110
 window of the 50 million credits 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.210
 and all this you will see that there are cuts in the 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.770
 video the cuts are not to be 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.259
 putting all the things because no 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:34.400
 would fit and if it would not be a very long video 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:37.280
 ok but it's not all right it's not a 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.470
 so neither one of these rare at dinner 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.330
 perfectly and you can check it is 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.729
 this what we can not have more than 50 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.210
 million if you have set before me 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:51.229
 there were 27 97 million and you see it 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.960
 in the top right and now 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.969
 you will see how I have 50 again 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.159
 millions 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:00.889
 well this has been all the guys I hope 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:04.959
 that has served you and that you can do 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.959
 the hack without any problems until then
