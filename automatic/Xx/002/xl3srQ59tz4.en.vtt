00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.100
 hello your teacher asshole talks to you and this time we will download nothing 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.589
 we will buy some potatoes as in the last video 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.740
 this video will deal with the most common causes why the 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.900
 computer 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.119
 from now on I say that is informed is original because I took it from the page 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.739
 of the description 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.470
 good girls, let's start 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.360
 if it has ever happened to you that your computer suddenly shuts down and 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.960
 frequently and you do not know what to do surely you will be very frustrated by 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.949
 This situation is so uncomfortable that it occurs with so much everydayness 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.240
 calm that all that will change right now 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.870
 Let's analyze the most common causes why a computer shuts down 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.300
 what causes this 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.430
 usually cpu processor overheating problems this 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.950
 causes the automatic processor preventive mechanism to turn off the 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.300
 computer 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.030
 however let's look at the five most common causes we know today 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.210
 overheating of some physical component the processors have 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.590
 automated mechanisms that always check the temperature of them 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.890
 when it has reheated automatically it would shut down the computer 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.570
 to prevent further damage 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.040
 Now, going deeper into this issue, which causes the overheating of 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.370
 the processors 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.950
 terrible ventilation of course 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.890
 maybe the fan and beloved dissipater of an gÃ¼ler is not 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.270
 working properly and there is no cooling 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.040
 could be because of the dust that is clogging the functioning of the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.960
 fan 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.390
 The most efficient solution is to have physical maintenance done 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.119
 cleaning them with a vacuum cleaner brushes and leaving them as if they were 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.050
 new 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.250
 by the way clarify that not only is the processor fan also 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.480
 could be the motherboard that is overheating a lot 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.840
 conflicts with some new or damaged jabour I ask you my friend has 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.470
 installed some new physical component 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.599
 accelerator graphics card 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.549
 television capture 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.399
 there may be compatibility conflicts 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:18.299
 test removing these new components to see is solved 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.370
 and of course it's not always because of new jaguar issues it could also be 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.629
 because a component that was already on your computer presents problems 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.989
 what could be done is to verify that a component is damaged by testing it 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:31.699
 in other 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:36.389
 if you have two RAM memory modules try removing 1 and using the pc with the 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.419
 another and so on 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.759
 the idea is to discard what causes the problem 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.989
 remember that the physical components are very delicate 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.719
 be very careful 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.119
 3 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:51.119
 the operating system is infected by a virus 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.419
 I checked it with a computer that was brought to me a few days ago 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:59.129
 the system was turned off only after a mysteriously spent time 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:04.769
 provides everything until I tried with other physical components the problem would be 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.889
 what was causing this then 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.819
 well it is possible that a virus has infected your system that has been 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.469
 developed with the aim of shutting down or restarting the computer so 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.499
 automatic 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.479
 and it may be executed when you start a program or an activity 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.869
 specific 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:25.109
 what you can do then is to exhaustively clean your system of any 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.419
 virus that is present in the same 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.379
 I will shortly bring a manual on how to effectively remove viruses or 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.569
 Trojan in a system without failure in the attempt 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.879
 I hope this article helps you a lot 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.280
 if any one knows other causes why a computer goes off suddenly 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:46.290
 and it would often be good to please share it with everyone leaving 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.799
 a comment 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.979
 going back to his teacher asshole I had or rather I have a laptop the 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:57.799
 which was overheated and turned off I used it like for 15 or 20 minutes and rates 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.400
 it went off it overheated machin 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.010
 for stupid reasons I broke the xd screen but next month 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.120
 will be repaired from the heating and with another screen 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.059
 Goodbye little girls until next time
