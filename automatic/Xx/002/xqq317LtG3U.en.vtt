our<00:00:18.449> director<00:00:18.960> I'm<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.170> designer<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.580> just

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
our director I'm a designer and I just

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.050 
our director I'm a designer and I just
loved<00:00:21.180> out<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:22.080> Q<00:00:22.350> looks<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.250> mean<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:23.939> just

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
loved out the Q looks I mean it's just

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.939 
loved out the Q looks I mean it's just
the<00:00:24.480> coolest-looking<00:00:25.019> computer<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the coolest-looking computer on the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.179 
the coolest-looking computer on the
planet

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.830 

the<00:00:31.189> first<00:00:31.400> reaction<00:00:31.789> I<00:00:31.849> had<00:00:32.059> to<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.329> size<00:00:32.540> of

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
the first reaction I had to the size of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.840 
the first reaction I had to the size of
the<00:00:32.960> g4<00:00:33.350> cube<00:00:33.380> was<00:00:33.890> really<00:00:34.340> one<00:00:34.489> of<00:00:34.520> amazement

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
the g4 cube was really one of amazement

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.979 
the g4 cube was really one of amazement
because<00:00:35.270> if<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:35.480> had<00:00:35.570> asked<00:00:35.690> me<00:00:35.809> in<00:00:35.930> advance

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
because if you had asked me in advance

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.689 
because if you had asked me in advance
how<00:00:36.470> small<00:00:36.970> and<00:00:37.970> a<00:00:38.150> supercomputer<00:00:38.989> be<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:39.699> never

how small and a supercomputer be I never
