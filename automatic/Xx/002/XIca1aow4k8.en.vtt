hey<00:00:19.430> guys<00:00:19.640> black<00:00:20.090> Scout<00:00:20.390> survival<00:00:20.900> and<00:00:21.050> today

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
hey guys black Scout survival and today

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:22.749 
hey guys black Scout survival and today
we're<00:00:21.740> going<00:00:21.830> to<00:00:21.920> talk<00:00:22.039> about<00:00:22.160> a<00:00:22.279> primitive

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
we're going to talk about a primitive

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.519 
we're going to talk about a primitive
fire-making<00:00:23.000> technique<00:00:23.750> known<00:00:23.930> as<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.289> fire

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
fire-making technique known as the fire

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.909 
fire-making technique known as the fire
piston<00:00:25.099> and<00:00:26.029> actually<00:00:26.570> got<00:00:26.720> this<00:00:26.900> fire<00:00:27.410> piston

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
piston and actually got this fire piston

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.870 
piston and actually got this fire piston
here<00:00:28.279> from<00:00:28.910> Ben's<00:00:29.360> backwoods<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.789> it's<00:00:31.789> a

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
here from Ben's backwoods and it's a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.479 
here from Ben's backwoods and it's a
very<00:00:32.119> nice<00:00:32.390> one<00:00:32.689> and<00:00:32.930> it's<00:00:33.739> made<00:00:33.980> of<00:00:34.129> cocobolo

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
very nice one and it's made of cocobolo

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.759 
very nice one and it's made of cocobolo
and<00:00:35.290> it<00:00:36.290> has<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.470> release<00:00:37.309> valve<00:00:37.580> here<00:00:38.710> so<00:00:39.710> you

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
and it has a release valve here so you

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.810 
and it has a release valve here so you
can<00:00:39.980> push<00:00:40.220> it<00:00:40.370> in<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:40.760> seal<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:41.720> up<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.080> your

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
can push it in and seal it up so your

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.119 
can push it in and seal it up so your
plug<00:00:43.820> doesn't<00:00:44.120> drop<00:00:44.269> out<00:00:44.769> it<00:00:45.769> also<00:00:45.920> has<00:00:46.100> a

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
plug doesn't drop out it also has a

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.660 
plug doesn't drop out it also has a
brass<00:00:46.430> tip<00:00:46.640> with<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.000> o-ring<00:00:47.120> gasket<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:48.670> has

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
brass tip with the o-ring gasket and has

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.950 
brass tip with the o-ring gasket and has
a<00:00:49.700> little<00:00:50.000> place<00:00:50.360> where<00:00:50.480> you<00:00:50.600> put<00:00:50.660> your

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
a little place where you put your

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.850 
a little place where you put your
charred<00:00:51.770> material<00:00:52.399> out<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.870> just<00:00:54.739> a<00:00:54.800> little

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
charred material out and just a little

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.380 
charred material out and just a little
bit<00:00:55.070> of<00:00:55.129> history<00:00:55.399> about<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.610> fire<00:00:55.850> piston<00:00:56.329> the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
bit of history about the fire piston the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.389 
bit of history about the fire piston the
fire<00:00:56.600> piston<00:00:57.140> has<00:00:57.649> been<00:00:57.829> used<00:00:58.010> for<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.219> long

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
fire piston has been used for a long

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.029 
fire piston has been used for a long
times<00:00:58.730> in<00:00:59.000> long<00:00:59.480> time<00:00:59.750> in<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.020> jungles<00:01:00.500> of<00:01:00.739> the

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
times in long time in the jungles of the

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.610 
times in long time in the jungles of the
Pacific<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:01.940> islands<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.020> stuff<00:01:03.109> like<00:01:03.350> that

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
Pacific and islands and stuff like that

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.540 
Pacific and islands and stuff like that
and<00:01:04.399> I<00:01:05.149> think<00:01:05.899> in<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.320> 70s<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:07.190> was<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:08.410> Navy

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
and I think in the 70s it was a Navy

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.310 
and I think in the 70s it was a Navy
survival<00:01:10.550> instructor<00:01:10.850> went<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.420> study<00:01:11.750> with

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
survival instructor went to study with

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.190 
survival instructor went to study with
some<00:01:12.350> natives<00:01:12.920> on<00:01:13.399> some<00:01:13.700> survival<00:01:14.479> on<00:01:14.570> islands

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
some natives on some survival on islands

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.740 
some natives on some survival on islands
over<00:01:15.410> there<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.880> he's<00:01:16.880> seen<00:01:17.179> a<00:01:17.420> when<00:01:17.720> he

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
over there and he's seen a when he

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.590 
over there and he's seen a when he
walked<00:01:18.020> up<00:01:18.289> he's<00:01:18.470> seen<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.710> native<00:01:19.460> strike<00:01:20.360> one

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
walked up he's seen a native strike one

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.570 
walked up he's seen a native strike one
of<00:01:20.689> these<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.200> light<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.619> cigarette<00:01:22.009> with<00:01:22.400> it

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
of these and light a cigarette with it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.490 
of these and light a cigarette with it
and<00:01:22.759> he<00:01:23.150> had<00:01:23.270> never<00:01:23.390> seen<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:23.869> before<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.170> he

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
and he had never seen it before so he

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.190 
and he had never seen it before so he
asked<00:01:24.890> if<00:01:24.950> he<00:01:25.040> could<00:01:25.220> do<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.340> trade<00:01:25.759> for<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.600> Zippo

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
asked if he could do a trade for a Zippo

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.499 
asked if he could do a trade for a Zippo
lighter<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.770> in<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.549> native<00:01:29.000> gave<00:01:29.180> him<00:01:29.299> this

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
lighter and in the native gave him this

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.390 
lighter and in the native gave him this
for<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.780> Zippo<00:01:30.049> lighter<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.500> he<00:01:31.070> brought<00:01:31.250> it

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
for the Zippo lighter and he brought it

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.399 
for the Zippo lighter and he brought it
back<00:01:31.579> here<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.060> they<00:01:32.150> researched<00:01:32.659> it<00:01:32.930> but

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
back here and they researched it but

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.600 
back here and they researched it but
basically<00:01:34.210> how<00:01:35.210> this<00:01:35.479> thing<00:01:35.750> works<00:01:36.049> is<00:01:36.380> that

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
basically how this thing works is that

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.060 
basically how this thing works is that
whenever<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:38.000> still<00:01:38.750> seal<00:01:39.229> up<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.530> valve

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
whenever you still seal up the valve

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.819 
whenever you still seal up the valve
here<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:41.570> put<00:01:41.780> this<00:01:41.900> in<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.170> when<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:42.350> strike

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
here you put this in and when you strike

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.789 
here you put this in and when you strike
it<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:43.310> compresses<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.509> air<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:45.170> fast<00:01:45.530> and

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
it it compresses the air so fast and

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.249 
it it compresses the air so fast and
efficiently<00:01:46.369> that<00:01:46.970> it<00:01:47.180> heats<00:01:47.450> up<00:01:47.750> anywhere

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
efficiently that it heats up anywhere

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.280 
efficiently that it heats up anywhere
between<00:01:48.439> 500<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.340> 800<00:01:49.579> degrees<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:51.079> pull

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
between 500 to 800 degrees and you pull

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.569 
between 500 to 800 degrees and you pull
it<00:01:51.320> out<00:01:51.530> real<00:01:51.740> quick<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.220> you'll<00:01:52.369> have<00:01:52.549> a

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
it out real quick and you'll have a

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.789 
it out real quick and you'll have a
burning<00:01:53.149> ember<00:01:53.299> on<00:01:53.540> your<00:01:53.720> chart<00:01:53.990> material<00:01:54.590> and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
burning ember on your chart material and

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.090 
burning ember on your chart material and

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
you guys may think well a fire piston

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.170 
you guys may think well a fire piston
you<00:02:11.750> know<00:02:11.870> it's<00:02:12.019> kind<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.320> old<00:02:12.500> school<00:02:12.829> and<00:02:13.180> and

you know it's kind of old school and and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.370 
you know it's kind of old school and and
why<00:02:14.329> would<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.540> need<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.870> when<00:02:14.959> I<00:02:14.989> can<00:02:15.170> carry

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
why would I need it when I can carry

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.240 
why would I need it when I can carry
bits<00:02:15.650> or<00:02:15.890> whatnot

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
bits or whatnot

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.220 
bits or whatnot
but<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.000> thing<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.299> it's<00:02:17.480> probably<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.079> good

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
but the thing is it's probably a good

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.250 
but the thing is it's probably a good
thing<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.470> have<00:02:18.709> because<00:02:18.950> with<00:02:19.880> this<00:02:20.269> you<00:02:21.049> need

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
thing to have because with this you need

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.099 
thing to have because with this you need
no<00:02:21.530> resources<00:02:22.190> truly<00:02:22.880> other<00:02:23.120> than<00:02:23.419> every<00:02:23.930> time

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:24.109 
no resources truly other than every time

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.509 
no resources truly other than every time
you<00:02:24.260> start<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.560> fire<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:24.949> make<00:02:25.100> more<00:02:25.250> char

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
you start a fire to make more char

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.699 
you start a fire to make more char
material<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.329> it's<00:02:26.510> pretty<00:02:26.810> much<00:02:27.049> unless<00:02:27.530> you

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
material so it's pretty much unless you

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.110 
material so it's pretty much unless you
break

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
break

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.949 
break
get<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:28.510> will<00:02:29.379> be<00:02:29.409> useful<00:02:30.099> for<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:31.390> long<00:02:31.629> as<00:02:31.690> it

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
get it will be useful for as long as it

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.830 
get it will be useful for as long as it
lasts<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.470> know<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:33.299> let's<00:02:34.299> go<00:02:34.510> ahead<00:02:34.720> and
