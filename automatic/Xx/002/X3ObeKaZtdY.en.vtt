back<00:01:44.710> I<00:01:44.979> had<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> decent<00:01:45.820> start<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:47.710> really

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
back I had a decent start and was really

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.039 
back I had a decent start and was really
excited<00:01:48.100> about<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:48.789> and<00:01:48.939> then<00:01:49.149> I<00:01:49.479> had<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.780> rough
