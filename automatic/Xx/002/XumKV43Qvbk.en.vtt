00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.490
 django new beagle channel flashes 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.370
 I'm rod and I'll be here with you and 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.139
 bringing tips news news at last 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.269
 anything interesting about the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.039
 universe of the game and you too can 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.930
 contribute by giving suggestions of subjects 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.740
 that you would like to hear here in the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.970
 Channel closed the presentations today I'm going 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.039
 talk quickly about the update 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.510
 visual of sommer city that is 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.070
 appearing in the video 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.280
 most likely you should already have 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.809
 previous view the right sky and if you have 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.460
 I'll leave a link for you guys 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.910
 see in the video description why 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.710
 for people who are interested in something else 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 you already have against the ps can 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.140
 simply enter and test the new map 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.210
 that he is very nice but for whom 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.149
 No account yet has only normal account 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.710
 even the staff created a modest map 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.079
 new so you can play it 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.489
 get off the official servers 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.500
 so basically this one needs to do the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.660
 download mod that leave the link here 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.010
 in the video description and install on 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.840
 same square 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.689
 now one thing that is interesting to do 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.330
 a copy of your folder canceled because 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.790
 because despite the update trying to 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.259
 conflict with a game itself, it can 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.740
 conflict with any 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.409
 how to replay and there you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.150
 in this cup you can simply 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.439
 make the modification or just play 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.049
 Any time you want 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.270
 anyway you have a greater control of this 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.920
 update 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.619
 anyway the update is totally safe you 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.850
 not only against the banned because I 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.490
 I have no desire in 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.560
 gameplay or else you have the map 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.909
 You're not in front of your opponents. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.460
 in no way 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.890
 It should also be remembered that we are still 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.840
 is working on the map or what 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.329
 you will download it will just be the preview of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.189
 pib milk some animations not yet 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.229
 disclosed some issues have 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.360
 complex or if it 's just for you to know 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.100
 even though the work is already done 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.770
 well in advance you can have a good 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.540
 notion of how it will stay at the launch and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.799
 only drawback is that you need 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.500
 install it whenever you have a 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.330
 update and some programs 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.890
 they just stopped working or not 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.350
 works right 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.840
 after 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.230
 update as face replay 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.180
 just give one bike every 23 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.920
 minutes when you were trying to replay 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.920
 so did not recommend it to him 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.570
 playing on the map you realize that the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.000
 graphics give a smoothed and monsters 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.660
 now seem to be part of the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.580
 map 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.370
 that added the work of hill or jack 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.290
 is doing in several 'champions' ends 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.420
 making the game a homogeneous thing 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.110
 you do not feel for example the contrast 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.000
 between monsters and quinton sounds and this is 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.100
 good to have the clarity of the game 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.930
 and speaking in clarity the monsters now 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.090
 has indicators and hp 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.490
 and you know exactly how much due 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.290
 they have simple to stay clicking mon 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.040
 tribe the status bar to appear one 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.600
 corner of the screen 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.010
 This is important for when you are 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.350
 present trying to conquer some 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.210
 goal as a dragon ball or 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.280
 simply trying to give a character of 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.130
 angle guys to know exactly the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.720
 disney is offline 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.190
 ends up making things easier 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.850
 again does not put you at an advantage 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.320
 because the other player who is not 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.480
 this update it simply can 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.780
 click on the monstra and the same information 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.930
 will be available for it 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.130
 The interesting thing about this work is that you 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.510
 can see that anger has been working 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.540
 It's been a long time. 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.510
 You can take the video from the penultimate one. 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.250
 cinematics the one that you check 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.660
 that the monster that appears at the end of 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.330
 clip is nothing more than the update 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.330
 of the noise that appears on this new map 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.700
 Good guys, you only need this short tournament. 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.680
 with the PS to display the same channel 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.690
 I hope you enjoyed it if you liked it. 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.920
 sign up for a jewelry that helps 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.660
 enough 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.420
 soon I would like it too and videos 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.430

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.930
