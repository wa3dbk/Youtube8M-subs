00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.359
 nutrition sugar and cell sugar is one 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.370
 collective name for an entire group 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.960
 compounds and the mixtures a somewhat 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 sweeter than the other 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.269
 one of those forms of glucose is indispensable 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.300
 for our body muscles cannot 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.699
 function without glucose and ours 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.260
 brains eat our muscles bluntly 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.450
 there is a lack of glucose in the blood 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.600
 arises 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.000
 you eat an average of 44 kilos of sugar per year 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.370
 via soda candy cake bread fruit 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.700
 but also soups and sauces and meat 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.530
 about 40% of that is fructose 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.530
 a very cheap variant to produce 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.390
 of glucose fructose you enter 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.790
 unlike glucose 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.630
 no sense of satiety you can do it 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.750
 keep eating 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.150
 good news for the manufacturer only one 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.360
 excess of fructose is a hefty one 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.840
 tax on your liver this body sets 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.560
 fructose into glycerol or fat and stores 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.720
 it up in fat cells in your abdominal wall 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.790
 this belly fat is associated 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.190
 with an increased risk of heart disease 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.600
 vascular disease and high blood pressure and high 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.310
 cholesterol levels 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.649
 diabetes and even cancer 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.820
 ordinary granulated sugar exists for the 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.820
 half from fructose 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.910
 an excess of glucose in your blood 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.090
 is normally prevented by the hormone 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.240
 insulin it converts your body to glucose 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.460
 store in muscle and fat cells 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.000
 in addition to glucose, insulin also beats 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.250
 magnesium in the cells 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.680
 who uses too much sugar for a long time 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.120
 runs the risk of becoming insensitive to 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.250
 insulin 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.470
 your body then beats the excess glucose 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.880
 but also not the magnesium in the blood 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.979
 well up 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.780
 Magnesium then leaves your body through one 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.060
 visit the toilet 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.650
 that's a shame because magnesium is too 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.659
 necessary for the production of 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.140
 insulin 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.740
 a magnesium deficiency can therefore be up to 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.020
 insulin resistance 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.480
 and a lower insulin excretion of 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.270
 the bank respond 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.890
 chromium picolinate can dampen this process 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.510
 by that it is the action of insulin 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.280
 strengthens 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.380
 less insulin is then needed 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.450
 store sugar from the blood too 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.090
 magnesium gets better through your body 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.610
 saved and retained 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.310
 but sugar still has an effect in you 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.680
 body an excess of glucose and with 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.379
 particularly fructose winds easily 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.750
 receptors or proteins in the cell wall of 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.550
 blood vessels and thus affects it 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.600
 functioning thereof 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.670
 that is called glycolysis ring 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.160
 an important process that is so disrupted 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.960
 touches is the transport and recording of 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.880
 cholesterol and other ldl fats 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.800
 cholesterol is the main component 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.510
 from the isolation to your neurons 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.540
 it is a protective factor in your 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.770
 cell wall against overly reactive substances 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.740
 the neurotransmitter glutamate 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.780
 For example, cholesterol also provides 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.450
 the uptake and storage of glutamate 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.910
 what is separated by the synapse 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.400
 If these functions are disrupted then go 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.330
 neurons leak electrolytes and less 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.860
 function well 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.450
 also the cell wall that the brain of the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.660
 blood circulation is said to be 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.230
 touched by this oxidative stress leak 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.090
 normal 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.540
 impermeable layer then 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.290
 pathogenic bacteria 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.810
 Alzheimer's patients have these 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.970
 You will find symptoms in these people 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.480
 relatively more often bacteria from the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.000
 intestine 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.319
 in the blood and brains back and 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.969
 don't belong there 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.590
 the sensitivity to developing 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.230
 insulin resistance 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.930
 differs per person 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.099
 about 40 to 60 percent of people 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.000
 with depression 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.000
 his diabet
