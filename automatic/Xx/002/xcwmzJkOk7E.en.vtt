00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
doing over the last few months now a lot

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.350 
doing over the last few months now a lot
of<00:00:29.930> people<00:00:30.110> have<00:00:30.560> wondered<00:00:30.800> how<00:00:31.340> resistance<00:00:32.059> 2

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
of people have wondered how resistance 2

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.170 
of people have wondered how resistance 2
is<00:00:32.629> going<00:00:32.870> to<00:00:32.960> start<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:33.739> we<00:00:34.579> spent<00:00:34.850> a<00:00:34.969> lot<00:00:35.149> of

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
is going to start and we spent a lot of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.049 
is going to start and we spent a lot of
time<00:00:35.420> discussing<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:36.469> best<00:00:36.739> way<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:37.059> really

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
time discussing the best way to really

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.790 
time discussing the best way to really
tie<00:00:38.390> resistance<00:00:38.930> 1<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:39.260> resistance<00:00:39.680> 2

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
tie resistance 1 and resistance 2

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.120 
tie resistance 1 and resistance 2
together<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.370> what<00:00:40.640> we<00:00:40.670> hit<00:00:40.940> on<00:00:41.120> was

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
together and what we hit on was

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.979 
together and what we hit on was
beginning<00:00:43.130> with<00:00:43.310> the<00:00:43.460> last<00:00:43.780> movie<00:00:44.780> in

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
beginning with the last movie in

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.350 
beginning with the last movie in
resistance<00:00:45.739> 1<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:46.280> having<00:00:46.670> it<00:00:46.760> transition

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
resistance 1 and having it transition

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.479 
resistance 1 and having it transition
seamlessly<00:00:47.870> into<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.739> first<00:00:48.980> movie<00:00:49.340> of

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
seamlessly into the first movie of

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.729 
seamlessly into the first movie of
resistance<00:00:49.910> -<00:00:50.150> this<00:00:50.899> means<00:00:51.110> that<00:00:51.260> there<00:00:51.470> is<00:00:51.500> no

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
resistance - this means that there is no

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.150 
resistance - this means that there is no
time<00:00:52.040> elapsed<00:00:52.579> between<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.120> two<00:00:54.020> games<00:00:54.200> so

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
time elapsed between the two games so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.040 
time elapsed between the two games so
what<00:00:55.310> you're<00:00:55.430> seeing<00:00:55.579> here<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.750> first

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
what you're seeing here is the first

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.830 
what you're seeing here is the first
cinematic<00:00:57.500> in<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.399> game<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:58.910> you<00:00:59.690> can

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
cinematic in the game and you can

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.130 
cinematic in the game and you can
actually<00:01:00.020> see<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:01.790> difference<00:01:02.239> between<00:01:02.480> our

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
actually see the difference between our

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.229 
actually see the difference between our
movie<00:01:03.590> making<00:01:03.920> techniques<00:01:04.309> in<00:01:04.489> resistance<00:01:05.030> 1

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
movie making techniques in resistance 1

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.030 
movie making techniques in resistance 1
and<00:01:05.540> now<00:01:05.659> what<00:01:05.840> we're<00:01:05.990> doing<00:01:06.229> in<00:01:06.350> resistance<00:01:06.829> 2

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
and now what we're doing in resistance 2

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.950 
and now what we're doing in resistance 2
there<00:01:08.000> are<00:01:08.030> several<00:01:08.270> things<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.540> we've<00:01:08.719> done

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
there are several things that we've done

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.950 
there are several things that we've done
in<00:01:09.229> resistance<00:01:09.799> 2<00:01:10.009> that<00:01:10.250> have<00:01:10.400> made<00:01:10.580> it<00:01:10.960> much

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
in resistance 2 that have made it much

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.840 
in resistance 2 that have made it much
easier<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:12.409> us<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.770> create<00:01:13.130> movies<00:01:13.460> at<00:01:13.640> higher

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
easier for us to create movies at higher

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.460 
easier for us to create movies at higher
fidelity<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:16.070> number<00:01:16.370> one<00:01:16.960> change<00:01:17.960> has<00:01:18.290> been

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
fidelity the number one change has been

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.469 
fidelity the number one change has been
the<00:01:18.530> use<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.920> motion<00:01:19.100> capture<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.000> resistance

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
the use of motion capture and resistance

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.570 
the use of motion capture and resistance
1<00:01:20.659> we<00:01:20.840> hand<00:01:21.080> animated<00:01:21.530> everything<00:01:21.920> but<00:01:22.460> with

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
1 we hand animated everything but with

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.780 
1 we hand animated everything but with
resistance<00:01:23.180> 2<00:01:23.450> we've<00:01:24.080> been<00:01:24.380> using<00:01:25.190> afterwards

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
resistance 2 we've been using afterwards

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.180 
resistance 2 we've been using afterwards
in<00:01:25.970> mocap<00:01:26.450> volumes<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.619> create<00:01:27.950> much<00:01:28.159> more

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
in mocap volumes to create much more

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.090 
in mocap volumes to create much more
lifelike<00:01:28.729> motions<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:30.409> really<00:01:30.619> convey

lifelike motions and to really convey
the<00:01:31.280> story<00:01:31.549> a<00:01:31.610> lot<00:01:31.880> more<00:01:32.060> convincingly<00:01:32.600> than

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
the story a lot more convincingly than

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.670 
the story a lot more convincingly than
we<00:01:33.470> have<00:01:33.650> before<00:01:34.210> another<00:01:35.210> really<00:01:35.689> cool<00:01:36.049> piece

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
we have before another really cool piece

we have before another really cool piece
of<00:01:36.710> technology<00:01:36.860> we've<00:01:37.460> been<00:01:37.610> using<00:01:37.880> is<00:01:38.240> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
of technology we've been using is the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.690 
of technology we've been using is the

inner sense camera the inner sense
camera<00:01:41.090> allows<00:01:41.570> us<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:42.850> create<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.090> scene

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
camera allows us to create the scene

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.859 
camera allows us to create the scene
first<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:44.960> then<00:01:45.220> we<00:01:46.220> film<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.790> with<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.600> camera

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
first and then we film it with a camera

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.899 
first and then we film it with a camera
who's<00:01:48.200> loose<00:01:48.619> motions<00:01:49.159> are<00:01:49.310> actually<00:01:49.729> motion

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
who's loose motions are actually motion

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.149 
who's loose motions are actually motion
captured<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:50.780> what<00:01:51.110> this<00:01:51.229> does<00:01:51.470> for<00:01:51.500> us<00:01:51.920> is

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
captured and what this does for us is

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.640 
captured and what this does for us is
create<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.670> much<00:01:52.880> more<00:01:52.909> filmic<00:01:53.570> feel<00:01:53.869> for<00:01:54.500> all

the game have had a major overhaul in

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
terms of the technology underlying them

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.559 
terms of the technology underlying them
first<00:02:07.790> of<00:02:07.909> all<00:02:08.000> we've<00:02:08.989> got<00:02:09.229> much<00:02:09.920> higher<00:02:10.189> res

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
first of all we've got much higher res

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.300 
first of all we've got much higher res
textures<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.870> normal<00:02:12.170> maps<00:02:12.409> and<00:02:12.799> better

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
textures and normal maps and better

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.920 
textures and normal maps and better
specularity<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.180> character<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:14.599> they<00:02:14.720> pop

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
specularity on the character so they pop

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.830 
specularity on the character so they pop
out<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.290> environment

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
out of the environment

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.720 
out of the environment
we've<00:02:16.200> completely<00:02:16.650> revamped<00:02:17.069> our<00:02:17.340> lighting

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
we've completely revamped our lighting

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.270 
we've completely revamped our lighting
system<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.599> now<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:19.080> much<00:02:19.650> better<00:02:19.830> support

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
system we now have much better support

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.729 
system we now have much better support

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
for our den dynamic lights we have self

shadowing<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.340> characters<00:02:23.849> what<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.510> does

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
shadowing on characters what this does

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.990 
shadowing on characters what this does
is<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.410> brings<00:02:25.620> out<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.069> normal<00:02:26.340> maps<00:02:26.700> and

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
is it brings out the normal maps and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.330 
is it brings out the normal maps and
detail<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:27.989> both<00:02:28.260> our<00:02:28.440> characters<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.130> our

detail in both our characters and our

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.120 
detail in both our characters and our
environment<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.060> think<00:02:30.330> Chicago<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.470> great

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
environment I think Chicago is a great

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.479 
environment I think Chicago is a great
example<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:33.200> how<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.800> detail<00:02:35.220> is

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
example of how all of this detail is

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.080 
example of how all of this detail is
making<00:02:36.120> resistance<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.760> much<00:02:38.760> more

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
making resistance to a much more

making resistance to a much more
visually<00:02:39.840> vibrant<00:02:40.319> game<00:02:40.910> secondly<00:02:41.910> they're

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
visually vibrant game secondly they're

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.240 
visually vibrant game secondly they're
all<00:02:42.209> using<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.660> motion<00:02:42.840> capture<00:02:43.250> techniques

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
all using the motion capture techniques

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.710 
all using the motion capture techniques
that<00:02:44.400> we're<00:02:44.550> using<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:44.940> our<00:02:45.000> cinematics<00:02:45.540> so

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
that we're using in our cinematics so

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.900 
that we're using in our cinematics so
characters<00:02:46.290> movement<00:02:46.739> believably<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.550> with
