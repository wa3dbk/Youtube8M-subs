00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:21.439
 April 1 looks vaccine 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.590
 a bush stamp made to headquarters in the fall 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.410
 a reference you see on the left above 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:34.370
 for filming I took 5 liter 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 I take the egg-cap here showing all caresses 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.780
 alive 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.360
 swelled we will wait further 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:50.120
 blooming now take off this piece and 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.120
 again I will wear a 5 liter eggplate 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.320
 department again 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:03.600
 5-liter bottle of egg-box 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:10.409
 and spunbond wrapped so that the night is not so 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.700
 cooled the air and the ground inside and because 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.159
 what is polyethylene 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.740
 well as from which the egg is made not 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.860
 keeps warm air at night he 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.509
 cools inside 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:33.180
 therefore spunbond wrapped the eggplant all 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.110
 more often the graft cuttings are, as it were, in 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.110
 mini hothouses 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.049

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.680
 shoots of growth of sprouts and splicing 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.680
