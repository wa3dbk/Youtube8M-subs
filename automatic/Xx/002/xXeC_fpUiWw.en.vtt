00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
okay the first thing I do is I look at

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.490 
okay the first thing I do is I look at
the<00:00:24.269> mini-map<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.840> course<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.109> like<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.350> see

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the mini-map of course I like to see

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.480 
the mini-map of course I like to see
where<00:00:25.619> they're<00:00:25.710> spawning<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.160> know<00:00:26.250> they're

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
where they're spawning I know they're

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
where they're spawning I know they're
diagonally<00:00:27.090> across<00:00:27.210> from<00:00:27.480> us<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.140> so

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
diagonally across from us and so

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.349 
diagonally across from us and so
generally<00:00:29.189> when<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.400> first<00:00:29.699> started<00:00:29.939> map<00:00:30.119> I

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
generally when I first started map I

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.209 
generally when I first started map I
brush<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.900> don't<00:00:30.990> camp<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.470> map<00:00:31.650> from<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> get-go

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
brush I don't camp a map from the get-go

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.560 
brush I don't camp a map from the get-go
because<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.430> got<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> learn<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> map<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.510> I'm

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
because you got to learn the map so I'm

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.540 
because you got to learn the map so I'm
using<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.899> river<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> gun<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.860> new<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.280> me<00:00:35.460> I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
point in the game so a lot of times it's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
point in the game so a lot of times it's
a<00:00:47.760> easy<00:00:47.910> kill<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.239> me<00:00:48.480> I'll<00:00:48.570> drop<00:00:48.719> ie<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.230> there

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
them up now what I do is I tend to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.680 
them up now what I do is I tend to
approach<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.550> caution<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.059> don't<00:00:54.390> know<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
approach with caution I don't know the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.330 
approach with caution I don't know the
routes<00:00:54.870> people<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.379> running<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.190> not

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
routes people are running so I'm not

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
routes people are running so I'm not
sure<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.579> people<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> come<00:00:57.239> this

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
sure if people are going to come this

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
sure if people are going to come this
way<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.170> prepared<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.039> tend<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
way so I'm prepared for it so I tend to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.610 
way so I'm prepared for it so I tend to
take<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> corners<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.329> try<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> stay<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
take the corners I try to stay out the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.170 
take the corners I try to stay out the
line<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.160> sights<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.670> try<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.879> hit<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
line of sights and I try to hit the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.640 
line of sights and I try to hit the
angles<00:01:03.480> look<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.719> see<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.140> behind<00:01:04.260> stuff

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
angles look to see I get behind stuff

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960 
angles look to see I get behind stuff
I'm<00:01:04.799> kind<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> glitch<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.580> now<00:01:05.670> I'm<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
I'm kind of a glitch and now I'm in the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060 
I'm kind of a glitch and now I'm in the
second<00:01:06.330> spot<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.049> dropping<00:01:07.229> ie<00:01:07.560> d<00:01:07.770> cuz<00:01:07.979> I

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
second spot so I'm dropping ie d cuz I

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.500 
second spot so I'm dropping ie d cuz I
got<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> feeling<00:01:08.640> people<00:01:08.790> may<00:01:09.030> run<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.420> way

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
got a feeling people may run that way

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.820 
got a feeling people may run that way
I'm<00:01:09.720> not<00:01:09.869> sure<00:01:09.990> if<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.140> learn<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.439> way<00:01:10.590> or

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
I'm not sure if they learn that way or

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.359 
I'm not sure if they learn that way or
this<00:01:11.100> way

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
this way

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.219

and learning the maps if additional drop
now<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.490> looks<00:02:07.700> like<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.880> camping<00:02:08.360> spot<00:02:08.479> but

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.029 
now this looks like a camping spot but
it<00:02:08.989> looks<00:02:09.140> like<00:02:09.259> what<00:02:09.410> I<00:02:09.470> call<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.709> heavy

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
it looks like what I call a heavy

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.830 
it looks like what I call a heavy
traffic<00:02:10.340> camping<00:02:10.820> spot<00:02:11.090> that's<00:02:11.570> not<00:02:11.720> what<00:02:11.810> I

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
traffic camping spot that's not what I

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
look for when I play a map actually the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.660 
look for when I play a map actually the
the<00:02:14.360> heavier<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.840> traffic<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:16.280> worse<00:02:16.459> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
the heavier the traffic the worse the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.370 
the heavier the traffic the worse the
captain<00:02:17.000> spot<00:02:17.209> tends<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.570> be<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:17.870> many<00:02:18.050> people

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
captain spot tends to be so many people

to be hard to get it so I'm actually
looking<00:02:21.500> for<00:02:21.860> spots<00:02:22.100> where<00:02:22.430> it's<00:02:22.640> not

looking for spots where it's not

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.670 
looking for spots where it's not
necessarily<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.600> most<00:02:23.750> traffic<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.440> can

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
necessarily the most traffic but I can

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.560 
necessarily the most traffic but I can
coerce<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.070> traffic<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.610> me<00:02:25.670> when<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.269> can't

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
coerce the traffic to me when I can't
