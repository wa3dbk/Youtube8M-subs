00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.650 
on your eyes and I thought I would get
some<00:00:43.230> use<00:00:43.410> out<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.800> color<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.640> um<00:00:44.940> yeah<00:00:45.629> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
some use out of that color so um yeah I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.840 
some use out of that color so um yeah I
think<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.649> simple<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
think this is really simple just a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
think this is really simple just a
neutral<00:00:48.270> eye<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> pop<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> color<00:00:49.410> that's

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
neutral eye with a pop of color that's
