00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.039 

the<00:03:34.680> most<00:03:34.920> important<00:03:35.489> reduction<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
the most important reduction is in the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.399 
the most important reduction is in the
portal<00:03:37.470> axle<00:03:38.060> very<00:03:39.060> important<00:03:39.659> to<00:03:39.900> reduce<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
portal axle very important to reduce the

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.530 
portal axle very important to reduce the
stress<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.040> weak<00:03:41.310> parts<00:03:41.790> just<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.209> drone

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
stress in the weak parts just the drone

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.170

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
only the front wheels are here because

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.140 
only the front wheels are here because

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.569 

let's<00:04:16.320> know<00:04:16.650> explain<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.549> most<00:04:17.820> dirty

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.090 
particular position which a small device
I'm<00:04:34.890> going<00:04:34.920> to<00:04:35.190> explain<00:04:35.720> sooner<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:37.100> the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
I'm going to explain sooner and the

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.180 
I'm going to explain sooner and the
directional<00:04:38.760> rotation<00:04:38.970> of<00:04:39.660> one<00:04:40.050> another<00:04:40.560> is

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
directional rotation of one another is

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.090 
directional rotation of one another is
change<00:04:41.700> via<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.480> mechanism<00:04:42.600> based<00:04:43.470> on<00:04:43.770> soil

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
change via a mechanism based on soil

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.000 
change via a mechanism based on soil
auto<00:04:44.490> valve

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
auto valve

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.100 
auto valve
so<00:04:47.010> first<00:04:47.460> let's<00:04:48.000> explain<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:49.440> device<00:04:49.770> used

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
so first let's explain the device used

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.680 
so first let's explain the device used
to<00:04:52.110> change<00:04:52.919> phenomena<00:04:53.550> desert<00:04:53.910> animal<00:04:54.390> Iseman

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
to change phenomena desert animal Iseman

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.950 
to change phenomena desert animal Iseman
so<00:04:54.870> here<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:57.590> there<00:04:58.590> are<00:04:58.770> three<00:04:59.250> works<00:04:59.550> 1<00:05:00.360> 2

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
so here it is there are three works 1 2

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.260 
so here it is there are three works 1 2
&amp;<00:05:01.260> 3<00:05:02.210> in<00:05:03.210> normal<00:05:03.660> mode<00:05:03.840> only<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:05.160> rock<00:05:05.760> moves

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
&amp; 3 in normal mode only this rock moves

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.500 
&amp; 3 in normal mode only this rock moves
now<00:05:06.750> in<00:05:06.960> fact<00:05:07.200> all<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.620> three<00:05:07.860> rocks<00:05:08.160> move<00:05:08.510> you

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
now in fact all the three rocks move you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.510 
now in fact all the three rocks move you
need<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.810> imagine<00:05:10.020> that<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.800> output<00:05:11.280> of<00:05:11.310> the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
need to imagine that the output of the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.300 
need to imagine that the output of the
servo<00:05:11.730> motor<00:05:11.850> is<00:05:12.300> connected<00:05:12.540> there<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.470> when

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
servo motor is connected there so when

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.690 
servo motor is connected there so when
the<00:05:14.610> seminar<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.240> terms<00:05:15.600> this<00:05:16.470> rock<00:05:16.800> moves<00:05:17.340> and

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
the seminar of terms this rock moves and

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:24.310 
the seminar of terms this rock moves and
with<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:19.050> stirrups<00:05:19.530> move<00:05:20.010> also<00:05:20.400> tied<00:05:21.000> up

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.840 

I'm<00:05:25.320> changing<00:05:25.800> from<00:05:26.040> normal<00:05:26.430> mode<00:05:26.610> to

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
I'm changing from normal mode to

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.100 
I'm changing from normal mode to
determine<00:05:27.479> reduce<00:05:28.940> this<00:05:29.940> rock<00:05:30.240> doesn't<00:05:30.810> move

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
determine reduce this rock doesn't move

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.870 
determine reduce this rock doesn't move
anymore<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:32.510> this<00:05:33.510> time<00:05:33.780> it's<00:05:34.140> this<00:05:34.470> action

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
anymore and this time it's this action

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.560 
anymore and this time it's this action
which<00:05:35.880> is<00:05:36.419> right<00:05:37.520> so<00:05:38.520> when<00:05:39.450> this<00:05:39.690> action<00:05:40.050> turn

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
which is right so when this action turn

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.960 
which is right so when this action turn
the<00:05:42.570> two<00:05:42.780> rock<00:05:43.020> move<00:05:43.919> in<00:05:44.280> opposite<00:05:44.700> direction

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
the two rock move in opposite direction

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.080 
the two rock move in opposite direction
and<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:46.290> leads<00:05:46.530> which<00:05:46.979> are<00:05:47.010> connected<00:05:47.820> to

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
and the leads which are connected to

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.200 
and the leads which are connected to
take<00:05:48.780> rock<00:05:49.080> come<00:05:49.500> closer

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
take rock come closer

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.150 
take rock come closer
so<00:05:51.210> there's<00:05:51.570> one<00:05:51.960> name<00:05:52.229> which<00:05:52.620> is<00:05:52.740> connected

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
so there's one name which is connected

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.860 
so there's one name which is connected
there<00:05:53.370> and<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:53.790> buzzer<00:05:54.000> which<00:05:54.330> is<00:05:54.450> connected

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
there and the buzzer which is connected

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.500 
there and the buzzer which is connected
there<00:05:55.080> so<00:05:55.950> our<00:05:57.110> issue<00:05:58.110> when<00:05:59.010> I<00:05:59.370> turn<00:05:59.729> the

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
there so our issue when I turn the

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.320 
there so our issue when I turn the
action<00:06:01.190> the<00:06:02.190> two<00:06:02.370> rocks<00:06:02.610> move<00:06:02.880> in<00:06:03.090> opposite

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
action the two rocks move in opposite

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.710 
action the two rocks move in opposite
direction<00:06:03.479> again<00:06:04.110> and<00:06:04.140> time<00:06:04.790> and<00:06:05.790> they<00:06:06.540> will

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
direction again and time and they will

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.100 
direction again and time and they will
take<00:06:07.140> their<00:06:07.620> particular<00:06:08.280> position<00:06:09.030> so<00:06:09.780> it's<00:06:10.020> a

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
take their particular position so it's a

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.140 
take their particular position so it's a
quite<00:06:10.290> simple<00:06:10.560> device<00:06:11.100> but<00:06:11.130> it<00:06:11.520> works<00:06:11.880> pretty

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
quite simple device but it works pretty

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.290 
quite simple device but it works pretty
well<00:06:13.729> and<00:06:15.110> more<00:06:16.110> clever<00:06:16.440> solution

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
well and more clever solution

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.110 
well and more clever solution
that<00:06:17.479> my<00:06:17.599> previous<00:06:17.870> question<00:06:18.530> where<00:06:18.770> I<00:06:19.129> used<00:06:19.610> a

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
that my previous question where I used a

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.999 
that my previous question where I used a
lot<00:06:20.599> of<00:06:20.720> pneumatic<00:06:21.229> system<00:06:21.620> to<00:06:21.919> do<00:06:22.669> this<00:06:24.009> so

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
lot of pneumatic system to do this so

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.820 
lot of pneumatic system to do this so
during<00:06:25.879> this<00:06:26.060> change<00:06:26.479> happened<00:06:27.050> directional

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
during this change happened directional

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.360 
during this change happened directional
rotation<00:06:28.009> of<00:06:28.639> one<00:06:29.259> accelerator<00:06:30.259> is<00:06:30.949> change

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
rotation of one accelerator is change

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.879 
rotation of one accelerator is change
via<00:06:32.090> a<00:06:32.590> device<00:06:33.590> based<00:06:34.490> on<00:06:34.699> silent<00:06:35.599> Ottawa<00:06:36.020> but

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
via a device based on silent Ottawa but

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.040 
via a device based on silent Ottawa but
rather<00:06:37.129> than<00:06:37.430> animatics<00:06:37.970> which<00:06:38.150> is<00:06:38.509> an

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
rather than animatics which is an

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.559 
rather than animatics which is an
electrical<00:06:39.590> switch<00:06:39.740> which<00:06:40.069> is<00:06:40.099> used<00:06:40.430> so<00:06:41.210> I

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:41.569 
electrical switch which is used so I

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.290 
electrical switch which is used so I
think<00:06:41.960> doesn't<00:06:42.289> need<00:06:42.590> more<00:06:43.520> information

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
think doesn't need more information

00:06:44.300 --> 00:07:00.260 
think doesn't need more information
about<00:06:44.690> how<00:06:45.110> it<00:06:45.289> works<00:06:45.590> so<00:06:46.400> in<00:06:46.669> action

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.249 

and<00:07:00.710> now<00:07:01.710> the<00:07:01.770> wheels<00:07:02.449> turn<00:07:03.449> in<00:07:03.840> the<00:07:03.960> opposite

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 
and now the wheels turn in the opposite

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:14.480 
and now the wheels turn in the opposite
direction<00:07:06.770> is<00:07:08.060> visible<00:07:12.590> so<00:07:13.590> I<00:07:13.620> think<00:07:13.800> I've

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
direction is visible so I think I've

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.339 
direction is visible so I think I've
explained<00:07:15.000> everything<00:07:15.419> important<00:07:16.110> about

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:16.349 
explained everything important about

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:20.450 
explained everything important about
this<00:07:17.099> model<00:07:17.310> I<00:07:17.669> will<00:07:18.150> open<00:07:18.479> 20<00:07:19.110> command<00:07:19.470> I<00:07:19.740> hope

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
this model I will open 20 command I hope

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.379 
this model I will open 20 command I hope
you<00:07:20.669> have<00:07:20.849> enjoyed<00:07:21.599> listening<00:07:21.780> to<00:07:22.139> me<00:07:23.240> have<00:07:24.240> a

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:24.389 
you have enjoyed listening to me have a

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.620 
you have enjoyed listening to me have a
