00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.840
 bardi league you speak your czech are 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.490
 here today to bring you open streets of 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.689
 a futile and I'm talking about 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.579
 marcolino royce 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.489
 start immediately tell guys that this 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.470
 player I expected more and sent 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.140
 not even then understood immediately that there are 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.780
 some flops so maybe I'll go too 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.180
 against current in this video however is 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.429
 a subjective subjective playready 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.910
 me there are some features that 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:48.460
 I do not go here, I am looking for years 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.079
 we are the paper from 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.109
 general characteristics the beloved of 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.199
 speed makes 9 dribbling 90 shooting 35 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:59.320
 of defense 88 the passage and 68 of physical 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.690
 then speed 93 and split 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.129
 acceleration notes 91 and 94 of 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.930
 speed snap the speed is 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.390
 absolutely a mouse of this value 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.530
 yes there is an einstein it takes to understand it 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.450
 which anyway very very fast succeeds 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.730
 let's say panic through the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.840
 its speed here I will dwell more than 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.640
 so much about this value 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.310
 let's connect let's say dreaming 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.100
 through the agility which is 92 a 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.570
 great value here the queen understood right away 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.730
 that this player also having the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.860
 four-star skill and everything is usual 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.270
 speech that I do a bit in a bit 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.360
 all players who have four 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.320
 skill stars is good speed 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.020
 practically having these 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.560
 features make this player 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.720
 a bit more effective a point from the point of 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.220
 dribble view because he can shout or 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.900
 through the four-star skill 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.910
 through speed through 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.350
 excellent ball control of 86 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.480
 or through agility and precisely 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.060
 however these values echo those of the 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.510
 dream is absolutely a top where i 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.210
 guys that are already here you understand no already the 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.340
 my tone of voice here is the shot 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.789
 the trio of this player I immediately say 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.680
 that from the nif version pulls me around 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.730
 he always made 50 goals 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.709
 this pressure may have been 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.260
 unlucky me and all no oh well let's leave 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.870
 however, we can see that the long shot 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.519
 it's all it's values ​​are 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.380
 absolutely its values ​​also from the way 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.440
 where you pull where 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.360
 in which he will say maybe languages pulls in which one 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.810
 coordinates everything guys you see immediately 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.300
 which is a value that is part is part 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.490
 marcolino royce is the only one 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.280
 color that made me really sorry there 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.110
 I say it made me sick of shooting 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.270
 been at the finalization you can 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.190
 see also below in the physical clips 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.130
 the worst goal he did anyway 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.350
 excellent average realization here I hold 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.350
 however to specify it five games 6 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.970
 however, you could see that alone goal 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.070
 in front of the door he had to arrive 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.810
 minimum 15 goals because he made too many eva 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.030
 too many opportunities we say that when 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.260
 recessive a player practically not 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.040
 I'm interested I can result also 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.910
 lose 50 but I have to found the game 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.340
 on that on that player who 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.980
 I review just if I see this 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.620
 player during the game is only him 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.050
 10 shots and on these ten apples 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.870
 throw in a fish that 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.490
 finalization is no good no then me 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.020
 then where I throw it there in my opinion is from 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.550
 this view is not very good 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.860
 player and only tried the photon or 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.810
 just to know through a commentary 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.870
 here also analyze the remaining part 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.340
 of the shooting we find 94 of shooting a 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.960
 around, however, we see that the shot turns 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.600
 something that is part of marconi la 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.910
 royce certain headlights I spoke read that 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.980
 are really beautiful even just 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.320
 to see and after that we also find 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.690
 91 of punishment precision I am 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.240
 maybe happen one or two maybe anyway 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.150
 I don't remember making them here 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.550
 so anyway a good value can be seen 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.950
 the boys find another one among those long 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.810
 short sea shot from distance 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.760
 the thing they do best perhaps have 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.470
 made 12 long shots I don't remember well 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.590
 however we see that in any case a value that 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.830
 it's more than good I can't say anything else 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.940
 here after that we also find 89 boys 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.860
 weakened euro 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.019
 91 to volley in this case 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.610
 I didn't try after seeing the shot e 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.280
 let us dwell on the passage which 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.840
 great of this player because 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.270
 however, I haven't been to much 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.430
 selfish not to use it ie not has 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.740
 used only the dribbling shot and 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.920
 speed but I also passed enough 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.840
 with him because he was very very curious 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.780
 from this value of 88 facts has me 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.430
 amazed I do not say remarkably though yes 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.170
 you see, however, that he is very, very skilled 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.670
 in passing into private life l 1 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.830
 triangle is something that comes out very well 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.370
 palizzi also understands the division 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.230
 also from the 89 of short passages and from 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.880
 81 of passages from a kg to the point of 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.400
 view of the cross very well 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.250
 marcolino royce to 86 of cross therefore not 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.020
 you can ask for more from a wing here or 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.050
 let's talk about the physical 68 which is a flop 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.790
 that I say already because in any case of 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.860
 these values ​​above all what i have 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.240
 he surprised the balance of boys 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.830
 I can assure you that you had a thiago 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.050
 silva or a david ruiz against 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.600
 he almost always went ashore 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.350
 here is what we will try quite amazed 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.350
 in negative, unfortunately, because of but 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.150
 in the only value that the only flop 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.490
 in the end it was the physical and the 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.020
 finalization of this player 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.020
 physical however we are going to tell her 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.240
 ie features 85 of balance yes 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.720
 suitable 3d in elevation also sounded 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.190
 anyway we leave it alone 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.650
 I would stop dead on my head 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.370
 because he also got me wrong 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.560
 easy goals on the head but ok, oh well 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:54.760
 and after that the boys find many 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.250
 direction 81 of stamina in 69 of power 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.160
 which is related to aggression renders 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.280
 this short color make this 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.370
 very poor combination in the sense that 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.110
 aggression only 46 so you understand that 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.380
 aggression and strength is not really 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.260
 the favorable point for not repeating 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.900
 precisely the strength of marco meno 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.169
 royce rubrics to 91 of positions yes 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.219
 he was always positioned 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.979
 a player from this point of view 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.389
 I can't say anything to the boys what to say 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.490
 I liked this player 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:28.090
 quite 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.590
 yes I feel quite alone that 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.289
 let's say I was expecting the first mandate of 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.479
 less so here's recap smoothly 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:38.749
 just this top speed player 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.029
 dribbling shots and passes and physical flop 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:43.069
 finalization vote I do not feel to give 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.300
 more than 9 is therefore not known 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:47.270
 question in the comments if you agree 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.909
 with me I point if you liked this 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.939
 video vito precisely to pass of relative 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:57.249
 link in description and kids from yours
