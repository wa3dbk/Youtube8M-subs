00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
Roundup Ready those are the best because

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.080 
Roundup Ready those are the best because
you've<00:04:13.650> got<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.829> seed<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.430> only<00:04:14.519> works<00:04:14.970> for

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
one cycle of planning then you got to go

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.380 
one cycle of planning then you got to go
back<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.190> buy<00:04:17.430> more<00:04:17.459> seed<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.940> can't<00:04:18.120> get<00:04:18.299> the
