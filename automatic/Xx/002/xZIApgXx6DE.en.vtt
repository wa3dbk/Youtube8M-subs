00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 well all guys 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.970
 but 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.509
 Doppler ultrasound method 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 vessels of the neck and brain allows 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.599
 to reveal 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.739
 the speed of blood flow through this vessel 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.980
 we identify such changes as contraction 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.980
 vessels 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.640
 atherosclerotic changes in the vessels 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:46.260
 can reveal 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:50.430
 pathological vessel crimp 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:55.489
 education method is very informative 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.489
 when treating a patient in our clinic 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.200
 because knowing the changes in the vessels we 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.309
 we can already correctly build a treatment 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.309
 our patients 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.450
 So 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.350
 in this case, we see and expressed 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.580
 vascular spasms and so you know or 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:02:01.400
 she informative most often this 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:04.160
 consequence take vascular dystonia already 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.750
 when we carry out the same treatment 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.270
 therapeutic measures will be sent a 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.440
 something to relieve spasm of blood vessels in the head 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.280
 leading you to improve condition 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.280
 patient health
