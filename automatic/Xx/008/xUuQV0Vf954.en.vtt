00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
take a little bit more work since he's

Battlefield 4 it's kind of like the tell
a<00:00:59.460> little<00:00:59.730> bit<00:00:59.850> where<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.239> point<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.480> lasers

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
a little bit where you point the lasers

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.750 
a little bit where you point the lasers
where<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> missiles<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.489> best<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
where the missiles go so it's best to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.920 
where the missiles go so it's best to
kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> aim<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> top<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
