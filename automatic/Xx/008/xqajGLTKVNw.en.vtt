hey<00:00:08.210> you<00:00:08.269> guys<00:00:08.480> and<00:00:08.809> welcome<00:00:08.960> this<00:00:09.350> video's<00:00:09.710> on

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
hey you guys and welcome this video's on

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.830 
hey you guys and welcome this video's on
the<00:00:09.920> plug-in<00:00:10.280> set<00:00:10.610> block<00:00:10.910> fix<00:00:11.240> and<00:00:11.570> this<00:00:11.719> is

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
the plug-in set block fix and this is

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.230 
the plug-in set block fix and this is
basically<00:00:12.049> a<00:00:12.320> fix<00:00:12.650> for<00:00:12.860> bucket<00:00:13.250> currently<00:00:14.120> it

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
basically a fix for bucket currently it

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.849 
basically a fix for bucket currently it
doesn't<00:00:14.510> have<00:00:14.629> the<00:00:14.750> set<00:00:14.959> block<00:00:15.199> command<00:00:15.559> but

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
doesn't have the set block command but

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.500 
doesn't have the set block command but
this<00:00:15.949> will<00:00:16.100> add<00:00:16.250> it<00:00:16.279> and<00:00:16.940> basically<00:00:17.180> this

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
this will add it and basically this

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.510 
this will add it and basically this
works<00:00:17.779> inside<00:00:18.199> command<00:00:18.590> blocks<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.250> you<00:00:19.310> place

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
works inside command blocks so you place

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.390 
works inside command blocks so you place
a<00:00:19.550> command<00:00:20.029> BBQ<00:00:20.480> set<00:00:20.900> block<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:21.560> then

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
a command BBQ set block and then

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.489 
a command BBQ set block and then
whatever<00:00:22.820> coordinates<00:00:23.539> you<00:00:23.689> want<00:00:23.869> or<00:00:24.050> you<00:00:24.470> can

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:24.499 
whatever coordinates you want or you can

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.200 
whatever coordinates you want or you can
use<00:00:24.650> relativity<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.759> actual<00:00:25.880> block

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
use relativity to the actual block

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.140 
use relativity to the actual block
itself<00:00:26.570> by<00:00:26.839> using<00:00:27.019> this<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:27.759> then<00:00:28.759> what<00:00:28.999> if<00:00:29.089> a

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
itself by using this and then what if a

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.120 
itself by using this and then what if a
block<00:00:29.359> type<00:00:29.599> you<00:00:29.810> want<00:00:29.929> a<00:00:30.019> place<00:00:30.259> so<00:00:30.619> dirt<00:00:30.919> I

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
block type you want a place so dirt I

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.160 
block type you want a place so dirt I
know<00:00:31.519> the<00:00:31.759> middle<00:00:32.029> one<00:00:32.150> is<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:32.419> height<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.110> if

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
know the middle one is the height so if

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.280 
know the middle one is the height so if
I<00:00:33.260> do<00:00:33.320> one<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:34.820> should<00:00:35.120> place<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.690> one<00:00:36.050> above

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
I do one it should place it one above

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.069 
I do one it should place it one above
this<00:00:36.560> so<00:00:37.400> for<00:00:37.700> instance<00:00:37.790> place<00:00:38.270> that<00:00:38.539> and<00:00:38.989> as

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
this so for instance place that and as

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.990 
this so for instance place that and as
you<00:00:39.230> can<00:00:39.320> see<00:00:39.350> it's<00:00:39.590> created<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.160> then<00:00:40.879> you

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
you can see it's created it then you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.520 
you can see it's created it then you
need<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:41.239> figure<00:00:41.390> out<00:00:41.600> which<00:00:41.750> direction<00:00:41.989> both

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
need to figure out which direction both

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.189 
need to figure out which direction both
of<00:00:42.739> these<00:00:42.859> guys<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:43.520> you<00:00:43.609> put<00:00:43.820> one<00:00:44.109> and<00:00:45.109> then

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
of these guys so you put one and then

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.080 
of these guys so you put one and then
you<00:00:45.289> can<00:00:45.410> see<00:00:45.559> it<00:00:45.649> spawned<00:00:45.949> it<00:00:46.129> towards<00:00:46.519> me<00:00:46.699> so

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
you can see it spawned it towards me so

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.830 
you can see it spawned it towards me so
far<00:00:47.359> the<00:00:47.449> minus<00:00:47.899> one<00:00:49.329> it<00:00:50.329> will<00:00:50.449> spawn<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:50.780> the

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
far the minus one it will spawn in the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.330 
far the minus one it will spawn in the
opposite<00:00:51.260> way<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:51.829> as<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:51.980> can<00:00:52.100> see<00:00:52.190> it's

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
opposite way so as you can see it's

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.459 
opposite way so as you can see it's
placed<00:00:52.550> it<00:00:52.730> there<00:00:52.989> then<00:00:53.989> you<00:00:54.079> need<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.320> figure

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
placed it there then you need to figure

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.799 
placed it there then you need to figure
out<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.679> other<00:00:54.920> direction<00:00:55.129> oh<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:59.420> that's

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
out the other direction oh and that's

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.349 
out the other direction oh and that's
porn<00:01:00.199> that<00:01:00.410> way<00:01:00.699> so<00:01:01.699> now<00:01:01.820> you<00:01:01.879> can<00:01:02.120> place

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
porn that way so now you can place

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.900 
porn that way so now you can place
blocks<00:01:02.690> wherever<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:03.230> want<00:01:03.469> so<00:01:04.430> if<00:01:04.489> i<00:01:04.640> set

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
blocks wherever you want so if i set

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.200 
blocks wherever you want so if i set
this<00:01:05.120> to<00:01:05.330> 0<00:01:06.100> this<00:01:07.100> is<00:01:07.340> 0<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.870> this<00:01:09.020> one<00:01:09.290> 2-5<00:01:10.210> it

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
this to 0 this is 0 and this one 2-5 it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.710 
this to 0 this is 0 and this one 2-5 it
will<00:01:11.329> place<00:01:11.509> a<00:01:11.540> block<00:01:11.840> five<00:01:12.200> blocks<00:01:12.500> forward

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
will place a block five blocks forward

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.630 
will place a block five blocks forward
then<00:01:14.720> what<00:01:15.049> you<00:01:15.140> could<00:01:15.290> do<00:01:15.470> is<00:01:15.829> change<00:01:16.460> it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
then what you could do is change it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.469 
then what you could do is change it
again<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.329> change<00:01:17.689> this<00:01:17.869> one<00:01:18.049> to<00:01:18.110> one<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:19.479> then

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
again so change this one to one and then

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.929 
again so change this one to one and then
it<00:01:20.540> will<00:01:20.630> place<00:01:20.810> one<00:01:20.840> on<00:01:21.049> top<00:01:21.350> of<00:01:21.470> it<00:01:21.729> so<00:01:22.729> then

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
it will place one on top of it so then

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.389 
it will place one on top of it so then
what<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:23.659> do<00:01:23.930> is<00:01:23.960> you<00:01:24.229> create<00:01:24.619> multiple

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
what you do is you create multiple

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.359 
what you do is you create multiple
command<00:01:25.909> blocks<00:01:26.180> running<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.689> same<00:01:26.899> command

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
command blocks running the same command

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.190 
command blocks running the same command
but<00:01:28.369> slightly<00:01:28.850> different<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:29.780> just<00:01:30.020> change

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
but slightly different so just change

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.840 
but slightly different so just change
the<00:01:30.439> height<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.890> that<00:01:37.070> will<00:01:37.219> create<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.549> tower

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
the height and that will create a tower

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.219 
the height and that will create a tower
or<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:40.610> step<00:01:41.149> so<00:01:41.540> as<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.719> can<00:01:41.780> see<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:41.990> be

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
or a step so as you can see that be

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.069 
or a step so as you can see that be
great<00:01:42.380> for<00:01:42.590> parkour<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:43.360> this<00:01:44.360> one<00:01:44.600> here<00:01:44.930> is

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
great for parkour and this one here is

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.929 
great for parkour and this one here is
actually<00:01:45.560> using<00:01:45.740> coordinates<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:46.700> as<00:01:46.759> you<00:01:46.880> can

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
actually using coordinates so as you can

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.649 
actually using coordinates so as you can
see<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.240> coordinates<00:01:47.780> 25<00:01:48.290> 5<00:01:48.590> 63<00:01:49.280> 5<00:01:49.310> 80<00:01:49.850> and

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
see the coordinates 25 5 63 5 80 and

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.200 
see the coordinates 25 5 63 5 80 and
it's<00:01:50.780> going<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:50.960> place<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.170> gold<00:01:51.500> block<00:01:51.770> and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
it's going to place a gold block and

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.880 
it's going to place a gold block and
then<00:01:53.210> this<00:01:53.390> one's<00:01:53.630> exactly<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.289> same<00:01:54.500> but<00:01:54.770> it

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
then this one's exactly the same but it

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.580 
then this one's exactly the same but it
changes<00:01:55.250> it<00:01:55.399> to<00:01:55.430> dirt<00:01:56.020> so<00:01:57.020> it's<00:01:57.140> just<00:01:57.259> using

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
changes it to dirt so it's just using

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.340 
changes it to dirt so it's just using
the<00:01:57.680> coordinates<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:59.570> I've<00:01:59.659> created<00:01:59.810> a<00:02:00.049> few

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
the coordinates so I've created a few

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.620 
the coordinates so I've created a few
things<00:02:00.560> using<00:02:00.920> this<00:02:01.210> basically<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:02.390> one

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
things using this basically this one

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.319 
things using this basically this one
places<00:02:03.289> a<00:02:03.500> block<00:02:04.219> of<00:02:04.399> 0<00:02:04.700> which<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.060> obviously

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
places a block of 0 which is obviously

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.420 
places a block of 0 which is obviously
air<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.289> this<00:02:06.439> one<00:02:06.619> place<00:02:06.859> is<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:07.100> block<00:02:07.280> of

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
air and this one place is a block of

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.490 
air and this one place is a block of
glass<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.539> that<00:02:08.570> will<00:02:08.810> just<00:02:08.960> fill<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:09.410> gap

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
glass so that will just fill in this gap

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.340 
glass so that will just fill in this gap
basically<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.180> can<00:02:11.360> see<00:02:11.510> when<00:02:11.660> I<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:12.050> start

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
basically so you can see when I to start

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.890 
basically so you can see when I to start
it<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.740> water<00:02:12.920> starts<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.370> run<00:02:13.670> waits<00:02:14.629> for<00:02:14.750> the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
it the water starts to run waits for the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.479 
it the water starts to run waits for the
signal<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.319> get<00:02:15.500> around<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:16.069> they<00:02:16.160> will<00:02:16.280> block

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
signal to get around and they will block

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.059 
signal to get around and they will block
it<00:02:16.519> back<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:16.940> again

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
it back up again

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.440 
it back up again
then<00:02:19.069> this<00:02:19.280> one<00:02:19.489> obviously<00:02:19.730> quite<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.239> few

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
then this one obviously quite a few

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.089 
then this one obviously quite a few
command<00:02:20.720> blocks<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.739> just<00:02:21.980> creates

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
command blocks it and this just creates

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.860 
command blocks it and this just creates
the<00:02:22.459> letter<00:02:22.610> V<00:02:22.700> on<00:02:23.030> here<00:02:23.329> and<00:02:23.510> then<00:02:23.599> it<00:02:23.780> will

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
the letter V on here and then it will

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.130 
the letter V on here and then it will
disappear<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:28.180> that's<00:02:29.180> done<00:02:29.450> by<00:02:29.629> setting<00:02:30.019> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
disappear and that's done by setting the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.780 
disappear and that's done by setting the
blocks<00:02:30.379> so<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.769> can<00:02:30.950> see<00:02:31.069> that's<00:02:31.310> setting<00:02:31.640> to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
blocks so you can see that's setting to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.710 
blocks so you can see that's setting to
color<00:02:32.000> one<00:02:32.299> color<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:33.349> color<00:02:34.250> 3<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.970> then<00:02:35.480> air

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
color one color to color 3 and then air

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.979 
color one color to color 3 and then air
in<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.170> last<00:02:36.349> ones<00:02:37.269> so<00:02:38.269> that<00:02:38.299> creates<00:02:38.810> this

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
in the last ones so that creates this

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.899 
in the last ones so that creates this
obviously<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.739> could<00:02:39.920> actually<00:02:40.220> have<00:02:40.760> this

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
obviously you could actually have this

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.699 
obviously you could actually have this
running<00:02:41.299> all<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.510> time<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.109> just<00:02:42.349> keep<00:02:42.590> the

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
running all the time and just keep the

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.839 
running all the time and just keep the
circuit<00:02:43.129> going<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.609> it<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:43.879> keep<00:02:44.030> flashing

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
circuit going and it just keep flashing

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.250 
circuit going and it just keep flashing
so<00:02:46.849> there's<00:02:47.180> definitely<00:02:47.510> tons<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:47.989> tons<00:02:48.079> of

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
so there's definitely tons and tons of

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.839 
so there's definitely tons and tons of
potential<00:02:48.590> for<00:02:48.799> use<00:02:49.189> in<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.400> set<00:02:49.609> block

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
potential for use in the set block

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.089 
potential for use in the set block
commanding<00:02:50.329> command<00:02:50.659> blocks<00:02:50.950> hopefully<00:02:51.950> you

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
commanding command blocks hopefully you

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.740 
commanding command blocks hopefully you
we<00:02:52.250> have<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.489> use<00:02:52.639> this<00:02:52.879> I<00:02:53.090> mean<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:53.480> great

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
we have to use this I mean it's great

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.599 
we have to use this I mean it's great
for<00:02:53.900> map<00:02:54.079> makers<00:02:54.500> but<00:02:54.709> I've<00:02:54.829> also<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.220> enjoyed

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
for map makers but I've also you enjoyed

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.009 
for map makers but I've also you enjoyed
just<00:02:55.849> messing<00:02:56.150> about<00:02:56.329> with<00:02:56.389> it<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.720> definitely

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
just messing about with it I definitely

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.680 
just messing about with it I definitely
use<00:02:57.349> it<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.769> create<00:02:58.010> things<00:02:58.450> cool<00:02:59.450> thing

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
use it just to create things cool thing

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.449 
use it just to create things cool thing
about<00:02:59.780> this<00:03:00.019> is<00:03:00.079> you<00:03:00.260> can<00:03:00.440> create<00:03:00.889> things<00:03:01.129> that

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
about this is you can create things that

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.300 
about this is you can create things that
do<00:03:02.060> change<00:03:02.420> color<00:03:02.689> so<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.019> mean<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.889> create<00:03:04.280> a

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
do change color so I mean you create a

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.890 
do change color so I mean you create a
police<00:03:04.549> car<00:03:04.819> with<00:03:04.939> flashing<00:03:05.090> light<00:03:05.540> source

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
police car with flashing light source

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.750 
police car with flashing light source
all<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.170> on<00:03:06.290> someone<00:03:06.500> server<00:03:06.889> but<00:03:07.609> we

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
all that on someone server but we

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.890 
all that on someone server but we
