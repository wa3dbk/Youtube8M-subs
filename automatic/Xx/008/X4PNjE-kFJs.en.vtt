under airplane now airplay is different

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.750 
under airplane now airplay is different
than<00:00:14.299> standard<00:00:15.470> Bluetooth<00:00:16.470> airplay<00:00:17.460> actually

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
than standard Bluetooth airplay actually

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.939 
than standard Bluetooth airplay actually
works<00:00:17.940> over<00:00:18.210> your<00:00:18.330> router<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.410> any<00:00:19.619> place<00:00:19.920> that

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
works over your router so any place that

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.200 
works over your router so any place that
you<00:00:20.250> have<00:00:20.490> your<00:00:20.670> router<00:00:20.880> connected<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:22.289> your

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
you have your router connected to your

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.000 
you have your router connected to your
iPhone<00:00:24.210> or<00:00:24.420> iPad<00:00:24.840> or<00:00:25.109> actually<00:00:25.619> even<00:00:25.830> other

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
iPhone or iPad or actually even other

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.250 
iPhone or iPad or actually even other
devices<00:00:26.580> there's<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> special<00:00:27.750> application

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
devices there's a special application

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.650 
devices there's a special application
for<00:00:28.500> Android<00:00:28.890> devices<00:00:29.130> as<00:00:29.460> well<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.480> play

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
for Android devices as well you can play

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.049 
for Android devices as well you can play
your<00:00:30.960> speaker<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:32.309> any<00:00:32.460> music<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:32.969> on

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
your speaker with any music that's on

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.400 
your speaker with any music that's on
there<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.690> pretty<00:00:33.809> interesting<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
there so it's pretty interesting and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.660 
there so it's pretty interesting and
again<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.710> better<00:00:34.860> range<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> Bluetooth

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
again it's better range of the Bluetooth

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.280 
again it's better range of the Bluetooth
speaker<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> works<00:00:36.899> wherever<00:00:37.110> your

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
speaker because it works wherever your

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.069 
speaker because it works wherever your
router<00:00:37.559> works<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.370> necessarily<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
router works and not necessarily just a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.840 
router works and not necessarily just a
within<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.649> range<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> Bluetooth<00:00:41.340> so

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
within the range of the Bluetooth so

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
within the range of the Bluetooth so
let's<00:00:41.969> look<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.510> thing<00:00:42.660> sets<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
let's look at how this thing sets up and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.360 
let's look at how this thing sets up and
how<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.309> sounds<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.969> Steve<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.079> me<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
how it sounds and Steve this is me a

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.040 
how it sounds and Steve this is me a
small<00:00:47.370> speaker<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:48.149> would<00:00:48.239> interest<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.389 

okay<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.410> might<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.860> little<00:00:53.219> difficult

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
okay so this might be a little difficult

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.860 
okay so this might be a little difficult
to<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> things<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.629> really

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
well so we'll show you how that works

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.670 
well so we'll show you how that works
next<00:02:30.840> okay<00:02:31.840> now<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.140> we<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.380> speaker

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
next okay now that we have the speaker

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.800 
next okay now that we have the speaker
set<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.010> we're<00:02:33.160> going<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.570> show<00:02:34.570> how<00:02:34.690> it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
set up we're going to show how it

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.430 
set up we're going to show how it
actually<00:02:34.960> works

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
actually works

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.110 
actually works
and<00:02:35.620> again<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.160> setup<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.490> very<00:02:36.520> simple<00:02:36.970> so

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
and again the setup is very simple so

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.480 
and again the setup is very simple so
I'll<00:02:37.720> play<00:02:37.900> some<00:02:38.080> nice<00:02:38.200> non<00:02:38.920> copy<00:02:39.280> written

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490

I'll play some nice non copy written
music<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.150> Yankee<00:02:40.390> Doodle<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:41.980> my<00:02:42.130> iPad

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
music and Yankee Doodle this is my iPad

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.790 
music and Yankee Doodle this is my iPad
that<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.730> hear<00:02:42.910> now<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:44.350> probably<00:02:44.680> familiar

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
that you hear now you probably familiar

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:55.830 
that you hear now you probably familiar
with<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.190> little<00:02:45.490> icon<00:02:45.910> there<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:55.150> see<00:02:55.360> airplay

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
with a little icon there you see airplay

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.860 
with a little icon there you see airplay
and<00:02:56.440> then<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.459> switch<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.850> over<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:58.690> takes

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
and then you switch it over and it takes

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:22.410 
and then you switch it over and it takes
it<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.080> few<00:02:59.560> seconds<00:02:59.890> actually<00:03:00.750> connects<00:03:21.420> and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
it a few seconds actually connects and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.539 
it a few seconds actually connects and
the<00:03:22.900> South<00:03:23.110> formance<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.650> pretty<00:03:23.860> good<00:03:24.100> now

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
the South formance is pretty good now

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.160 
the South formance is pretty good now
one<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.880> nice<00:03:25.000> things<00:03:25.030> about<00:03:25.269> this<00:03:25.540> too<00:03:25.750> is

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
one of the nice things about this too is

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.770 
one of the nice things about this too is
you're<00:03:26.410> now<00:03:27.120> only<00:03:28.120> restricted<00:03:28.959> by<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:30.780> range

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
you're now only restricted by the range

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.720 
you're now only restricted by the range
of<00:03:31.930> your<00:03:32.019> router<00:03:32.290> in<00:03:32.739> your<00:03:32.890> device<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.519> not

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
of your router in your device and not

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.050 
of your router in your device and not
limited<00:03:34.600> by<00:03:34.660> bluetooth<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.730> pretty<00:03:36.940> nice

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
limited by bluetooth so it's pretty nice

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
limited by bluetooth so it's pretty nice
and<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.330> actually<00:03:37.600> probably<00:03:37.780> get<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:37.989> little

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
and you actually probably get a little

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.080 
and you actually probably get a little
bit<00:03:38.290> better<00:03:38.410> at<00:03:38.560> musical<00:03:38.890> performers<00:03:39.280> using

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
bit better at musical performers using

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.460 
bit better at musical performers using
airplay<00:03:40.390> than<00:03:40.570> what<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.810> would<00:03:40.930> get<00:03:41.080> using

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
airplay than what you would get using

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.289 
airplay than what you would get using
standard<00:03:42.010> Bluetooth<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:42.850> kind<00:03:43.030> of<00:03:43.060> keep<00:03:43.180> that

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
standard Bluetooth so kind of keep that

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.530 
standard Bluetooth so kind of keep that
in<00:03:43.360> my<00:03:43.600> -<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:45.280> very<00:03:45.459> easy<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:46.060> set<00:03:46.239> up<00:03:46.269> both

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
in my - it's very easy to set up both

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.229 
in my - it's very easy to set up both
for<00:03:46.720> an<00:03:46.810> Android<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.320> for<00:03:47.610> my<00:03:48.610> device<00:03:48.970> whether

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
it's an iPad or iPhone and it works for

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.190 
it's an iPad or iPhone and it works for
other<00:03:51.910> things<00:03:52.000> other<00:03:52.299> than<00:03:52.450> music<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.019> if<00:03:53.110> you

of playback using airplay for battery

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.750 
of playback using airplay for battery
life<00:04:13.690> which<00:04:14.049> is<00:04:14.170> pretty<00:04:14.350> good<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:15.280> has<00:04:15.489> up<00:04:15.670> to

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
you're using full 24 watts and also it

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.670 
you're using full 24 watts and also it
doesn't<00:04:25.120> really<00:04:25.330> sound<00:04:25.660> like<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:26.020> has<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.200> full

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
24 watts per speaker it seems a little

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.340 
24 watts per speaker it seems a little
less<00:04:28.660> than<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.900> but<00:04:29.770> that<00:04:29.800> just<00:04:30.100> may<00:04:30.280> be<00:04:30.340> me

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
less than that but that just may be me

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.499 
less than that but that just may be me
it<00:04:32.350> sets<00:04:32.590> up<00:04:32.740> really<00:04:32.770> quick<00:04:33.190> under<00:04:33.910> 30<00:04:34.120> seconds

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
in terms of disadvantages the sound does

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.330 
in terms of disadvantages the sound does
like<00:05:22.599> bass<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:23.500> does<00:05:23.620> have<00:05:23.830> some<00:05:23.860> lack<00:05:24.160> of

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
like bass so it does have some lack of

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.400 
like bass so it does have some lack of
depths<00:05:24.699> to<00:05:24.910> it<00:05:25.060> which<00:05:25.960> is<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.110> little<00:05:26.289> bit

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
depths to it which is a little bit

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.409 
depths to it which is a little bit
surprising<00:05:26.740> at<00:05:27.009> this<00:05:27.160> price<00:05:27.370> range<00:05:27.610> and<00:05:28.150> also

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
surprising at this price range and also

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.430 
surprising at this price range and also
if<00:05:28.479> you're<00:05:28.570> going<00:05:28.690> to<00:05:28.750> add<00:05:28.810> two<00:05:29.080> speakers

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
if you're going to add two speakers

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.960 
if you're going to add two speakers
you're<00:05:29.889> starting<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.430> get<00:05:30.520> into<00:05:30.789> some<00:05:30.940> pretty

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
you're starting to get into some pretty

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.219 
you're starting to get into some pretty
significant<00:05:31.800> cash<00:05:32.800> outflow<00:05:33.370> so<00:05:34.120> compared<00:05:35.020> to

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
significant cash outflow so compared to

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.830 
significant cash outflow so compared to
standard<00:05:35.849> dual<00:05:36.849> speakers<00:05:37.419> that<00:05:37.659> you<00:05:37.690> would

get for your pewter it might be a little
bit<00:05:40.060> more<00:05:40.240> expensive<00:05:40.510> than<00:05:40.870> some<00:05:41.199> of<00:05:41.320> the

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
bit more expensive than some of the

bit more expensive than some of the
other<00:05:41.530> options<00:05:41.710> out<00:05:42.039> there<00:05:42.340> but<00:05:42.820> that<00:05:42.849> that's

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
other options out there but that that's

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.460 
other options out there but that that's
kind<00:05:43.389> of<00:05:43.419> a<00:05:43.510> nice<00:05:43.630> way<00:05:43.810> to<00:05:43.840> think<00:05:44.110> of<00:05:44.229> it<00:05:44.320> as<00:05:44.440> a
