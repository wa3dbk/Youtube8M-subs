go to the speed paint videos now this is

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.599 
go to the speed paint videos now this is
from<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> pico<00:01:01.020> de<00:01:01.199> speed<00:01:01.530> paint<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
from the pico de speed paint and what it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.670 
from the pico de speed paint and what it
is<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.090> only<00:01:03.300> difference<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.260> see

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
is the only difference that you can see

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160 
is the only difference that you can see
left<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.189> right<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.700> took<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.659> image<00:01:06.840> from

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
left and right I took this image from

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.700 
left and right I took this image from
the<00:01:07.380> video<00:01:07.590> itself<00:01:08.090> in<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.630> moment<00:01:10.020> before<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the video itself in a moment before and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.700 
the video itself in a moment before and
after<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.330> implemented<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.600> trick<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> it's

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
after I implemented this trick and it's

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370 
after I implemented this trick and it's
simply<00:01:14.189> adding<00:01:14.700> backlighting<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.259> can

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
simply adding backlighting so you can

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.070 
simply adding backlighting so you can
see<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> very<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.220> Left<00:01:17.520> image<00:01:17.820> I

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
see on the very on the Left image I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.149 
see on the very on the Left image I
added<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> shading<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.770> where<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> base

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
added the shading so where the base

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.789 
added the shading so where the base
color<00:01:20.490> which<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:20.970> pinkish<00:01:21.330> purple<00:01:21.799> then

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
color which is this pinkish purple then

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.770 
color which is this pinkish purple then
I'll<00:01:22.920> add<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.130> darker<00:01:23.850> deep<00:01:24.150> shade<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.540> purple

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
I'll add the darker deep shade of purple

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.950 
I'll add the darker deep shade of purple
and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.710> my<00:01:25.920> next<00:01:26.310> step<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> erase<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and then my next step was to erase the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380 
and then my next step was to erase the
edges<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.650> shading<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.180> does

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
edges of that shading and what that does

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.480 
edges of that shading and what that does
is<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.960> photos<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.829> professional

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
is in photos that professional

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.819 
is in photos that professional
photographers<00:01:33.030> make<00:01:33.299> or<00:01:33.540> or

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
photographers make or or

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.560 
photographers make or or
cinematographers<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.549> know<00:01:35.670> when<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.299> set

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
cinematographers you know when they set

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.219 
cinematographers you know when they set
up<00:01:36.659> their<00:01:36.810> shot

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
up their shot

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.830 
up their shot
they<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.829> several<00:01:38.549> lights<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.270> fill<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> scene

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
they have several lights to fill a scene

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.760 
they have several lights to fill a scene
and<00:01:40.490> often<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.729> always<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> light

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and often if not always there is a light

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.240 
and often if not always there is a light
very<00:01:44.579> immediately<00:01:45.299> behind<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.960> subject<00:01:46.250> in

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
very immediately behind the subject in

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.580 
very immediately behind the subject in
which<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.820> shot<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.210> taken<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
which the shot is taken and that's to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.730 
which the shot is taken and that's to
make<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.549> figure<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.750> pop<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.439> in

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
make that figure really just pop out in

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.760 
make that figure really just pop out in
front<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.729> background<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.770> really

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
front of the background in and really

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.139 
front of the background in and really
make<00:01:55.920> things<00:01:56.070> look<00:01:56.280> cinematic<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.000> can

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
make things look cinematic and you can

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.730 
make things look cinematic and you can
see<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.899> instant<00:01:58.380> before<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
see just in this instant before and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.580 
see just in this instant before and
after<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.189> the<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.719> amount<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.079> time<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> took

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
after now the the amount of time it took

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.120 
after now the the amount of time it took
to<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:02.100> from<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.030> very<00:02:04.130> monument

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
to go from this to that is very monument

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.980 
to go from this to that is very monument
of<00:02:05.250> time<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> difference<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.420> phenomenal

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
of time but the difference is phenomenal

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.740 
of time but the difference is phenomenal
now<00:02:07.110> next<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.000> early<00:02:09.300> stages<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
now next this is in the early stages of

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.170 
now next this is in the early stages of
this<00:02:09.989> beast<00:02:10.440> painting<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.670> again<00:02:11.910> click<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
this beast painting so again click the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.870 
this beast painting so again click the
annotation<00:02:12.690> or<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.810> link

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
annotation or the link

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.880 
annotation or the link
and<00:02:14.090> on<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.750> left<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.560> is<00:02:15.710> is

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
and on the left this is this is is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.170 
and on the left this is this is is
interesting<00:02:16.280> because<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.790> whole<00:02:16.970> thing

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
interesting because the whole thing

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.820 
interesting because the whole thing
started<00:02:17.480> off<00:02:17.600> as<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.900> single<00:02:18.230> shade<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.590> gray

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
started off as the single shade of gray

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.820 
started off as the single shade of gray
and<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.670> started<00:02:20.060> off<00:02:20.150> with<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.650> shadows<00:02:21.650> and

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
and I started off with the shadows and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.990 
and I started off with the shadows and
then<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:21.980> had<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.250> highlight<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:22.670> it's<00:02:22.940> a

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
then I had the highlight so it's a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.070 
then I had the highlight so it's a
little<00:02:23.180> bit<00:02:23.300> different<00:02:23.600> on<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.810> didn't

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
little bit different on it didn't

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.370 
little bit different on it didn't
necessarily<00:02:24.170> erase<00:02:24.980> shadow<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:26.540> get<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:27.260> know

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
necessarily erase shadow to get you know

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.260 
necessarily erase shadow to get you know
the<00:02:27.650> highlights<00:02:28.070> or<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.310> edging<00:02:28.670> but<00:02:28.910> getting

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
the highlights or the edging but getting

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.940 
the highlights or the edging but getting
on<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.690> very<00:02:29.930> edge<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.380> make<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.530> look<00:02:30.650> like<00:02:30.920> a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
on the very edge to make it look like a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.040 
on the very edge to make it look like a
light<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.340> immediately<00:02:31.760> behind<00:02:31.970> will<00:02:32.720> really

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
light is immediately behind will really

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.100 
light is immediately behind will really
make<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.230> pop<00:02:33.560> now<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.670> chain<00:02:35.000> here<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.080> a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
make it pop now the chain here is a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.070 
make it pop now the chain here is a
really<00:02:36.770> good<00:02:36.980> example<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.720> there<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.900> no

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
really good example of that there is no

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.660 
really good example of that there is no
difference<00:02:39.320> between<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:40.010> chains<00:02:40.310> on<00:02:40.580> the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
difference between the chains on the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.070 
difference between the chains on the
left<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.120> chains<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.540> right<00:02:41.690> aside

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
left and the chains on the right aside

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.840 
left and the chains on the right aside
from<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.380> fact<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.710> every<00:02:43.070> chain<00:02:43.400> link<00:02:43.670> on

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
from the fact that every chain link on

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.820 
from the fact that every chain link on
the<00:02:43.970> right<00:02:44.210> has<00:02:45.020> that<00:02:45.770> shadow<00:02:46.160> erased<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.830> has

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
the right has that shadow erased and has

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.500 
the right has that shadow erased and has
the<00:02:49.010> highlight<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.670> edge<00:02:49.820> added<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.390> you

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
the highlight on the edge added and you

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.100 
the highlight on the edge added and you
can<00:02:50.690> see<00:02:50.960> that<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:52.040> amount<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.750> this<00:02:53.750> chain

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
can see that the amount that this chain

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.010 
can see that the amount that this chain
stands<00:02:54.530> out<00:02:54.740> as<00:02:54.890> opposed<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.460> chain<00:02:55.790> is

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
stands out as opposed to this chain is

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.750 
stands out as opposed to this chain is
huge<00:02:57.020> they<00:02:57.260> just<00:02:57.500> sit<00:02:57.800> in<00:02:57.980> front<00:02:58.400> they<00:02:58.520> just

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
huge they just sit in front they just

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.660 
huge they just sit in front they just
pop<00:02:59.450> out<00:02:59.600> they're<00:02:59.810> really<00:03:00.050> loud<00:03:00.290> next<00:03:01.280> we<00:03:01.550> have

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
pop out they're really loud next we have

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.000 
pop out they're really loud next we have
my<00:03:01.880> Slenderman<00:03:02.450> painting<00:03:02.870> now<00:03:03.740> this<00:03:03.890> is

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
my Slenderman painting now this is

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.710 
my Slenderman painting now this is
really<00:03:04.280> subtle<00:03:04.490> there<00:03:04.820> isn't<00:03:05.090> heaps<00:03:05.360> on<00:03:05.570> this

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
really subtle there isn't heaps on this

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.810 
really subtle there isn't heaps on this
guy<00:03:05.870> but<00:03:06.650> as<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:07.100> can<00:03:07.250> see<00:03:07.430> on<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.640> left

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
guy but as you can see on the left

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.580 
guy but as you can see on the left
especially<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.440> image

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
especially and this is in this image

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.200 
especially and this is in this image
it's<00:03:09.800> quite<00:03:10.070> dark<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.870> his<00:03:11.870> skin<00:03:12.380> his<00:03:12.560> ugh<00:03:12.860> I

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
it's quite dark and his skin his ugh I

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.060 
it's quite dark and his skin his ugh I
wouldn't<00:03:14.210> call<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.510> skin<00:03:15.020> but<00:03:15.320> he's<00:03:15.590> facing<00:03:16.010> a

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
wouldn't call it skin but he's facing a

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.000 
wouldn't call it skin but he's facing a
hand<00:03:16.400> he<00:03:17.000> doesn't<00:03:17.210> even<00:03:17.270> have<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.540> face<00:03:17.690> are

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
hand he doesn't even have a face are

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.800 
hand he doesn't even have a face are
kind<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.760> shading<00:03:20.120> meld<00:03:20.390> into<00:03:20.630> the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
kind of the shading meld into the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.380 
kind of the shading meld into the
background<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:22.160> without<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:23.060> little

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
background and so without this little

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.640 
background and so without this little
trick<00:03:23.570> implemented<00:03:24.170> he<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:24.890> kind<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.520> a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
trick implemented he just kind of is a

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.130 
trick implemented he just kind of is a
bit<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.770> a<00:03:27.920> mesh<00:03:28.520> of<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:29.120> background<00:03:29.600> where<00:03:30.050> as

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
bit of a mesh of the background where as

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.920 
bit of a mesh of the background where as
you<00:03:30.200> get<00:03:30.350> on<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.560> right<00:03:30.709> here<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.190> just

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
you get on the right here and it just

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.800 
you get on the right here and it just
really<00:03:32.930> not<00:03:33.200> much<00:03:33.410> work<00:03:33.800> but<00:03:34.459> huge<00:03:35.180> amount<00:03:35.690> of

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
really not much work but huge amount of

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.610 
really not much work but huge amount of
difference<00:03:37.630> then<00:03:38.630> we<00:03:38.870> have<00:03:39.080> here<00:03:39.350> must<00:03:39.530> be

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
difference then we have here must be

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.840 
difference then we have here must be
painting<00:03:40.040> of<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.760> hellbenders<00:03:41.300> and<00:03:41.800> again

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
painting of the hellbenders and again

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.070 
painting of the hellbenders and again
not<00:03:43.850> much<00:03:44.000> difference<00:03:44.480> again<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:44.840> is<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
not much difference again this is the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.750 
not much difference again this is the
early<00:03:45.380> stage<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.739> image<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.550> later

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
early stage of image so the later

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.790 
early stage of image so the later
shading<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.630> all<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.780> other<00:03:47.959> parts<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.590> image

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
shading and all the other parts of image

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.920 
shading and all the other parts of image
are<00:03:48.950> here<00:03:49.310> in<00:03:49.400> these<00:03:49.550> examples<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.510> click<00:03:50.750> the

thing if you want to go to the thing but

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.990 
thing if you want to go to the thing but
a<00:03:53.540> few<00:03:54.500> seconds<00:03:54.860> apart<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.580> see<00:03:55.820> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
a few seconds apart you can see the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.120 
a few seconds apart you can see the
amount<00:03:56.270> that<00:03:56.390> this<00:03:56.780> face<00:03:57.380> or<00:03:57.650> at<00:03:57.800> least<00:03:58.010> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
amount that this face or at least the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.479 
amount that this face or at least the
edging<00:03:58.489> around<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.480> neck<00:03:59.959> and<00:03:59.989> ears<00:04:00.500> stand

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
edging around the neck and ears stand

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.550 
edging around the neck and ears stand
out<00:04:01.700> on<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.270> right<00:04:02.450> as<00:04:02.720> opposed<00:04:03.080> to<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.290> left

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
out on the right as opposed to the left

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.250 
out on the right as opposed to the left
and<00:04:04.300> finally<00:04:05.300> I<00:04:05.450> couldn't<00:04:05.840> get<00:04:06.020> a<00:04:06.050> decent

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
and finally I couldn't get a decent

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.160 
and finally I couldn't get a decent
before<00:04:06.890> because<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.489> in<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.239> painting<00:04:08.630> of<00:04:08.870> this

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
before because I in the painting of this

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.720 
before because I in the painting of this
V<00:04:10.040> mask<00:04:10.640> I<00:04:10.970> implemented<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:13.220> edging<00:04:13.610> or

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
V mask I implemented the the edging or

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.509 
V mask I implemented the the edging or
the<00:04:13.850> backlighting<00:04:14.330> as<00:04:14.660> I<00:04:15.560> painted<00:04:16.130> from<00:04:16.370> the

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
the backlighting as I painted from the

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.520 
the backlighting as I painted from the
beginning<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:17.120> there<00:04:17.269> wasn't<00:04:17.450> really<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.870> good

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
beginning so there wasn't really a good

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.310 
beginning so there wasn't really a good
before<00:04:19.160> example<00:04:19.820> but<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.630> can<00:04:20.780> at<00:04:20.900> least<00:04:20.930> see

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
before example but you can at least see

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.550 
before example but you can at least see
how<00:04:21.710> very<00:04:21.979> instantly<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:23.570> this<00:04:23.810> mask<00:04:24.229> just

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
how very instantly that this mask just

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.650 
how very instantly that this mask just
really<00:04:25.220> snaps<00:04:25.520> out<00:04:25.700> especially<00:04:25.880> on<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.300> dark

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
really snaps out especially on a dark

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.310 
really snaps out especially on a dark
background

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
background

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.080 
background
so<00:04:27.710> what<00:04:27.890> I'm<00:04:27.980> going<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.160> do<00:04:28.340> before<00:04:28.760> right<00:04:29.000> in

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
so what I'm going to do before right in

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.190 
so what I'm going to do before right in
this<00:04:29.150> video<00:04:29.300> I'm<00:04:29.540> like<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.780> said<00:04:29.960> it's<00:04:30.050> going<00:04:30.140> to

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
this video I'm like I said it's going to

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.350 
this video I'm like I said it's going to
be<00:04:30.320> a<00:04:30.350> really<00:04:30.680> short<00:04:30.710> video<00:04:31.160> I'm<00:04:32.030> just<00:04:32.120> going

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
be a really short video I'm just going

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.690 
be a really short video I'm just going
to<00:04:32.390> show<00:04:32.600> you<00:04:32.630> in<00:04:32.840> context<00:04:33.410> how<00:04:33.830> this<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.460> done

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
to show you in context how this is done

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.060 
to show you in context how this is done
so<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:35.270> have<00:04:35.420> an<00:04:35.540> example<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:36.140> a<00:04:36.230> before<00:04:36.590> here<00:04:36.920> I

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
so I have an example of a before here I

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.280 
so I have an example of a before here I
have<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.580> just<00:04:38.060> a<00:04:38.180> black<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:38.420> white<00:04:38.690> sphere<00:04:39.140> on

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
the left and a green sphere on the right

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.070

get<00:05:22.430> my<00:05:22.580> eraser<00:05:23.860> and<00:05:24.860> I'm<00:05:25.850> just<00:05:26.030> going<00:05:26.210> to<00:05:26.270> go

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
get my eraser and I'm just going to go

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.920 
get my eraser and I'm just going to go
along<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:27.170> edge<00:05:27.290> here<00:05:28.000> all<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.660> way<00:05:29.780> around

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
along the edge here all the way around

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.200 
along the edge here all the way around
and<00:05:30.740> I'm<00:05:30.860> going<00:05:30.950> to<00:05:31.040> have<00:05:31.160> it<00:05:31.280> fade<00:05:31.610> out<00:05:31.790> as<00:05:31.970> it

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
and I'm going to have it fade out as it

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.850 
and I'm going to have it fade out as it
gets<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.600> bottom<00:05:32.750> because<00:05:33.380> I<00:05:33.440> don't<00:05:33.650> want

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
gets to the bottom because I don't want

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.950 
gets to the bottom because I don't want
it<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.460> edging<00:05:34.820> -<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.360> don't<00:05:35.750> want<00:05:35.900> the

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
it the edging - I don't want the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.390 
it the edging - I don't want the
backlighting<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:36.590> appear<00:05:36.890> underneath

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
backlighting to appear underneath

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.010 
backlighting to appear underneath
because<00:05:37.670> that's<00:05:37.970> where<00:05:38.180> there<00:05:38.690> is<00:05:38.870> no

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
because that's where there is no

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.470 
because that's where there is no
lighting<00:05:39.410> coming<00:05:39.620> through<00:05:39.920> and<00:05:40.150> I<00:05:41.150> don't<00:05:41.390> know

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
lighting coming through and I don't know

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.760 
lighting coming through and I don't know
if<00:05:41.570> I'll<00:05:41.660> have<00:05:41.810> it<00:05:41.900> all<00:05:42.140> the<00:05:42.320> way<00:05:42.470> around

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
if I'll have it all the way around

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.260 
if I'll have it all the way around
because<00:05:43.040> again<00:05:43.400> you<00:05:43.520> don't<00:05:43.550> want<00:05:43.730> to<00:05:43.850> over<00:05:44.120> use

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
because again you don't want to over use

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.980 
because again you don't want to over use
this<00:05:44.510> you<00:05:45.140> use<00:05:45.320> it<00:05:45.500> in<00:05:45.650> mild<00:05:46.370> amounts<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.330> it's

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
this you use it in mild amounts and it's

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.590 
this you use it in mild amounts and it's
very<00:05:48.500> effective<00:05:48.880> and<00:05:49.880> then<00:05:50.000> coming<00:05:50.300> over<00:05:50.360> here

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
very effective and then coming over here

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.900 
very effective and then coming over here
on<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.780> left<00:05:51.400> same<00:05:52.400> thing

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
on the left same thing

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.780 
on the left same thing
I'll<00:05:53.240> select<00:05:53.570> my<00:05:53.720> shadow<00:05:54.140> get<00:05:55.130> my<00:05:55.250> eraser<00:05:55.880> and

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
I'll select my shadow get my eraser and

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.990 
I'll select my shadow get my eraser and
simply<00:05:58.790> remove<00:06:01.570> some<00:06:02.570> of<00:06:02.600> the<00:06:02.780> edging<00:06:03.200> shadow

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
simply remove some of the edging shadow

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.370 
simply remove some of the edging shadow
and<00:06:05.000> another<00:06:05.360> cool<00:06:05.630> thing<00:06:05.690> that<00:06:05.930> you<00:06:06.050> can<00:06:06.140> do

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
and another cool thing that you can do

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.530 
and another cool thing that you can do
with<00:06:06.560> a<00:06:06.590> color<00:06:06.980> image<00:06:07.190> it<00:06:08.590> is<00:06:10.150> you<00:06:11.150> just<00:06:11.360> add

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
with a color image it is you just add

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.380 
with a color image it is you just add
another<00:06:11.570> layer<00:06:11.990> is<00:06:12.490> add<00:06:13.490> another<00:06:13.790> color<00:06:14.120> as

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
another layer is add another color as

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.690 
another layer is add another color as
part<00:06:14.960> of<00:06:15.020> the<00:06:15.110> backlight<00:06:15.500> so<00:06:16.010> for<00:06:16.280> example

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
part of the backlight so for example

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.920 
part of the backlight so for example
with<00:06:16.790> this<00:06:16.910> screen<00:06:17.210> I<00:06:17.240> might<00:06:17.570> want<00:06:17.810> the

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
with this screen I might want the

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.320 
with this screen I might want the
backlight<00:06:18.320> to<00:06:18.470> be<00:06:18.590> a<00:06:18.620> yellow<00:06:19.160> and<00:06:19.460> I<00:06:19.970> know<00:06:20.030> that

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
backlight to be a yellow and I know that

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.930 
backlight to be a yellow and I know that
using<00:06:21.230> different<00:06:21.710> colors<00:06:22.160> like<00:06:22.190> this<00:06:22.670> can

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
using different colors like this can

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.670 
using different colors like this can
really<00:06:23.510> make<00:06:23.690> it<00:06:23.720> pop<00:06:24.050> so<00:06:24.260> I'm<00:06:24.350> just<00:06:24.470> going<00:06:24.620> to

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
really make it pop so I'm just going to

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.030 
really make it pop so I'm just going to
grab<00:06:24.770> this<00:06:24.920> yellow<00:06:25.390> make<00:06:26.390> it<00:06:26.540> nice<00:06:26.720> and<00:06:27.040> faint

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
grab this yellow make it nice and faint

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.590 
grab this yellow make it nice and faint
and<00:06:28.340> just<00:06:28.850> kind<00:06:29.060> of<00:06:29.150> add<00:06:29.330> a<00:06:31.150> really<00:06:32.150> light

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.740 

accentuation<00:06:35.600> to<00:06:36.169> that<00:06:36.380> backlight<00:06:36.860> and<00:06:37.750> all

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
accentuation to that backlight and all

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.430 
accentuation to that backlight and all
of<00:06:38.960> a<00:06:39.050> sudden<00:06:40.000> BAM<00:06:41.000> so<00:06:41.960> the<00:06:42.080> difference

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
of a sudden BAM so the difference

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.620 
of a sudden BAM so the difference
between<00:06:42.650> the<00:06:43.580> top<00:06:43.789> and<00:06:43.940> the<00:06:44.000> bottom<00:06:44.090> images

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
between the top and the bottom images

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.200 
between the top and the bottom images
are<00:06:44.870> pretty<00:06:45.500> darn<00:06:45.889> drastic<00:06:46.490> now<00:06:46.880> this<00:06:47.090> is

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
are pretty darn drastic now this is

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.409 
are pretty darn drastic now this is
quite<00:06:47.449> an<00:06:47.660> extreme<00:06:48.080> example<00:06:48.259> it<00:06:49.069> does<00:06:49.400> kind<00:06:50.330> of

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
quite an extreme example it does kind of

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.749 
quite an extreme example it does kind of
it's<00:06:50.900> fairly<00:06:51.740> loud<00:06:51.979> so<00:06:52.310> I<00:06:52.340> wouldn't

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
it's fairly loud so I wouldn't

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.700 
it's fairly loud so I wouldn't
necessarily<00:06:52.849> go<00:06:53.449> that<00:06:53.660> extreme<00:06:54.110> but<00:06:54.319> you<00:06:54.470> can

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
necessarily go that extreme but you can

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.980 
necessarily go that extreme but you can
see<00:06:55.039> the<00:06:55.520> difference<00:06:55.910> that<00:06:56.090> it<00:06:56.180> makes<00:06:56.360> I<00:06:56.660> hope

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
see the difference that it makes I hope

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.659 
see the difference that it makes I hope
