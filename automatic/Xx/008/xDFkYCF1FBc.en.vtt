heard a lot of good things about College
of<00:01:02.040> DuPage<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.700> I<00:01:02.730> figured<00:01:03.240> I<00:01:03.360> try<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.700> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
of DuPage so I figured I try it and and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.149 
of DuPage so I figured I try it and and
they<00:01:06.390> had<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> paralegal<00:01:07.200> program<00:01:07.530> an

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
they had a paralegal program an

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.859 
they had a paralegal program an
undergraduate<00:01:08.670> program<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.350> basically

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
undergraduate program and I basically

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.569 
undergraduate program and I basically
went<00:01:12.869> into<00:01:13.619> college<00:01:14.840> expecting<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:17.399> the

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
went into college expecting to get the

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.480 
went into college expecting to get the
least<00:01:17.909> amount<00:01:18.179> of<00:01:18.450> school<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.469> get<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
least amount of school in to get just to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.270 
least amount of school in to get just to
get<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> basically<00:01:22.740> went<00:01:23.130> in

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
get out of it and so I basically went in

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.130 
get out of it and so I basically went in
for<00:01:23.429> an<00:01:23.520> undergraduate<00:01:23.939> degree<00:01:24.179> but<00:01:24.719> I<00:01:24.780> ended

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
for an undergraduate degree but I ended

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.959 
for an undergraduate degree but I ended
up<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.469> liking<00:01:25.740> school<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.520> sticking

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
up really liking school and sticking

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:28.849 
up really liking school and sticking
with<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.600> guess<00:01:28.079> it<00:01:28.289> was<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.649> of<00:01:28.679> a

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
with it I guess it was more of a

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.190 
with it I guess it was more of a
critical<00:01:29.280> thinking<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.390> pushed<00:01:30.810> into

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
critical thinking I was in pushed into

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.859 
critical thinking I was in pushed into
taking<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.100> bunch<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.490> tests<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.539> felt

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
taking a bunch of tests that I felt

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.080 
taking a bunch of tests that I felt
terrible<00:01:34.380> about<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.579> feel<00:01:35.789> immense

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
terrible about and in feel immense

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.830 
terrible about and in feel immense

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I wouldn't say dumber but just not as

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.169 
I wouldn't say dumber but just not as
