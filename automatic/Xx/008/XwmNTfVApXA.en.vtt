with the tines to help turn the what
you're<00:00:19.470> making<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:22.369> let's<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.550> get<00:00:23.640> started

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
you're making and let's just get started

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.439 
you're making and let's just get started
I<00:00:24.500> have<00:00:25.500> I'm<00:00:25.980> not<00:00:26.160> sure<00:00:26.279> how<00:00:26.460> many<00:00:26.519> cups<00:00:27.269> this

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
I have I'm not sure how many cups this

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.320 
I have I'm not sure how many cups this
is<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.990> pick<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.260> up<00:00:28.439> set<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:29.029> at<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.119> bulk

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
is I just pick this up set be at a bulk

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.880 
is I just pick this up set be at a bulk
store<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.349> I'm<00:00:31.710> gonna<00:00:31.830> put<00:00:32.399> some<00:00:32.640> into<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:34.160> jar

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
store so I'm gonna put some into the jar

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.200 
store so I'm gonna put some into the jar
they<00:00:37.890> advise<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.550> they<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.760> two<00:00:39.000> cup

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
they advise like they have two cup

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.389 
they advise like they have two cup
measurements<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.050> guess<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:40.890> easier

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
measurements I guess it's just easier

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.280 
measurements I guess it's just easier
that<00:00:41.460> way<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> overfill<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:42.870> I've
