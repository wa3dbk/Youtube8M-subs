the<00:00:11.219> moon<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.639> Libra<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.269> usually<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> time<00:00:13.469> of

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the moon in Libra is usually a time of

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.550 
the moon in Libra is usually a time of
moderation<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:15.179> think<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.809> may<00:00:16.049> be<00:00:16.080> day

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
moderation but I think this may be day

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.540 
moderation but I think this may be day

29th<00:00:23.430> I'm<00:00:24.060> Rick<00:00:24.420> Lavigne<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.470> am<00:00:25.619> just

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.609 
29th I'm Rick Lavigne and I am just
noting<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:27.119> are<00:00:27.300> coming<00:00:27.689> off<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.900> quite<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
noting that we are coming off of quite a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.049 
noting that we are coming off of quite a
series<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.570> Jupiter<00:00:30.570> Ian<00:00:30.929> expansive

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
series of Jupiter Ian expansive

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.090 
series of Jupiter Ian expansive
overindulgent<00:00:33.200> astrological<00:00:34.200> aspects<00:00:35.010> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
overindulgent astrological aspects that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.580 
overindulgent astrological aspects that
correspondent<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.390> calendar<00:00:37.170> date<00:00:37.380> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
correspondent with the calendar date of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
correspondent with the calendar date of
Thanksgiving<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.760> country<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.629> so

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
Thanksgiving here in this country and so

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.000 
Thanksgiving here in this country and so
I<00:00:39.899> think<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.469> part<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
I think this is part of the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.819 
I think this is part of the
overindulgence<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.809> stuff<00:00:43.440> today

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
overindulgence but there is stuff today

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.350 
overindulgence but there is stuff today
even<00:00:44.550> though<00:00:44.910> we're<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.539> quite<00:00:46.140> as

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
even though we're not quite as

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.940 
even though we're not quite as
unconsciously<00:00:48.360> expansive<00:00:49.260> as<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.770> were

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
unconsciously expansive as we were

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.430 
unconsciously expansive as we were
yesterday<00:00:50.239> there's<00:00:51.239> stuff<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.539> continues

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
yesterday there's stuff that continues

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.380 
yesterday there's stuff that continues
the<00:00:52.469> theme<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.309> yet<00:00:53.430> maybe<00:00:53.640> we're<00:00:53.879> feeling<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the theme and yet maybe we're feeling a

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.709

little<00:00:54.600> pain<00:00:54.870> well<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.739> moon<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.760> Libra<00:00:57.300> today

expansive Jupiter and with pleasure
seeking<00:01:03.780> Venus<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.379> that's<00:01:04.530> sort<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
seeking Venus and that's sort of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
yesterday and while we discussed it then

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.190 
yesterday and while we discussed it then
and<00:01:11.070> mention<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.939> again<00:01:12.060> today<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> kind<00:01:13.080> of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
and mention it again today as a kind of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.050 
and mention it again today as a kind of
overindulgence<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.790> also

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
overindulgence what it can also

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.789 
overindulgence what it can also
represent<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:16.350> feeling<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.040> we're<00:01:17.310> far<00:01:18.000> from

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
represent is feeling like we're far from

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.770 
represent is feeling like we're far from
satisfaction<00:01:19.799> far<00:01:20.549> from<00:01:21.030> having<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> money

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
satisfaction far from having the money

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.990 
satisfaction far from having the money
the<00:01:22.110> pleasure<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.830> love<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.820> in

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the pleasure the love that we want in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.960 
the pleasure the love that we want in
life<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:25.170> may<00:01:25.409> stuff<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
life so we just may stuff more in to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.850 
life so we just may stuff more in to
bring<00:01:27.119> ourselves<00:01:27.299> or<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> attempt<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.680> bring

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
bring ourselves or to attempt to bring

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.859 
bring ourselves or to attempt to bring
ourselves<00:01:28.979> closer<00:01:29.549> yeah<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> think<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:30.630> one

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
ourselves closer yeah I think that's one

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.929 
ourselves closer yeah I think that's one
way<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> effort<00:01:31.799> playing<00:01:32.070> out<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.490> yet<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> also

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
way of effort playing out and yet I also

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.149 
way of effort playing out and yet I also
think<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.810> Jupiter<00:01:34.409> Venus<00:01:34.590> being

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
think that with the Jupiter Venus being

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.460 
think that with the Jupiter Venus being
so<00:01:35.460> strong<00:01:35.850> with<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.329> moon<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.840> there's

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so strong with the moon that there's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.609 
so strong with the moon that there's
also<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.979> sense<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.640> even<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.840> feel<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.140> way

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
also a sense of even if we feel that way

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.679 
also a sense of even if we feel that way
and<00:01:40.950> maybe<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.970> partly<00:01:42.329> what<00:01:42.540> you're

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
and maybe this is partly what you're

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.840 
and maybe this is partly what you're
saying<00:01:42.990> even<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:43.799> feel<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.220> way<00:01:44.369> there's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
saying even if we feel that way there's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.370 
saying even if we feel that way there's
a<00:01:44.939> sense<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:47.240> overcoming<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.600> feeling

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
a sense of of of overcoming that feeling

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.010 
a sense of of of overcoming that feeling
of<00:01:49.500> something<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.159> don't<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:51.020> bye-bye

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
of something that we don't have bye-bye

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.580 
of something that we don't have bye-bye
over<00:01:52.320> compensating<00:01:52.950> by<00:01:53.490> by<00:01:54.210> by<00:01:54.659> faking<00:01:55.290> it

over compensating by by by faking it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.830 
over compensating by by by faking it
until<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:55.950> make<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.640> gonna<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.329> gonna<00:01:57.570> be

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.840 
until we make it I'm gonna I'm gonna be
happy<00:01:58.200> I'm<00:01:58.380> gonna<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.770> more<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.369> party

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
happy I'm gonna have more the party

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.289 
happy I'm gonna have more the party
aspects<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.810> indulgence<00:02:01.229> becomes<00:02:02.100> more<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
aspects the indulgence becomes more of a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.810 
aspects the indulgence becomes more of a
shallow<00:02:03.960> cover<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.009> feel<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.579> I'm

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
shallow cover of what I feel like I'm

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.210 
shallow cover of what I feel like I'm
missing<00:02:06.060> rather<00:02:06.930> than<00:02:07.229> what<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.770> have

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
missing rather than what it is I have

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.279 
missing rather than what it is I have
and<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.910> think<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.420> we're<00:02:09.629> brave<00:02:09.929> enough

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and I think that if we're brave enough

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.290 
and I think that if we're brave enough
to<00:02:10.500> really<00:02:10.649> look<00:02:11.039> at<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.400> issues<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.120> real

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
to really look at the issues for real

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.309
