00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.600
 are you into computer hardware or 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.609
 want to find the best vidyuhi under 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.740
 your config then you direct path to 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.020
 channel you big electronics will be you 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.290
 wait for the review to be brand and many more 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.290
 Total 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.320
 You know, I always tried to stay in 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.869
 side of the fanboys then by a certain 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.869
 kristoff and even when calmly treated 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.210
 to such people about Lesch and now I 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.820
 I had nothing against and do not have but 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.480
 This post introduced me on the wall cognitive 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.520
 dissonance 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.989
 I remind you that I am for objectivity in for 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.480
 people who are broadcasting about the game 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.850
 industry unfortunately alexey mass 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.440
 would never shine though did 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.660
 pretty water comparison of two consoles 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.960
 xbox one and playstation 4 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.630
 Well, but to the post, he wrote quote 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.720
 constantly hear what track lair 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.730
 what forza is an incredible blah blah blah no 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.960
 all listed drive club is better 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 auto graphics 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.870
 physics atmosphere controllability tuning 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.119
 nature the weather and created a poll which 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.220
 naturally his fans clicked on drive 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.860
 club because they are sure that I am now 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.990
 a staunch playstation as well as 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.080
 many consider me an admirer of x-box 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080
 one 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.020
 however I will not give you anything today 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.840
 prove and just walk on his 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:28.060
 points and show you the whole truth about these 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.790
 racing games alexey is right about something 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.159
 about graphics to forza motorsport 5 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.690
 plastic cars however almost the same 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.659
 even forza horizon 2 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.570
 but in the drive club oh my god if this is de 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.850
 plastic what is it all the same 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.460
 plastic cars with only more 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.259
 thick plastic casing in general 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.420
 grafon drive club is better 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.539
 there's nothing you can say but thanks 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.640
 why is it better if you compare drive club 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.250
 and forza motorsport 5 here without 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.080
 compromises and wins but if 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.729
 compare forza horizon 2 in which 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.159
 huge open world with its 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.289
 beautiful places to add new 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.420
 map and in all locations goes 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.030
 people and drive other cars here 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.370
 it becomes clear that their shroud resources are not 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.890
 would draw in such an open world 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.810
 graphics like drive club nothing 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.640
 will pull at the moment the graphics as 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.370
 drive club 100 tenge in nature 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.590
 I think you understand the pattern no 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.540
 freedom of movement and a huge map 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.850
 less cost and resources for their 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.230
 drawing means you can screw 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.230
 grafonchik a car 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.250
 did not understand at all what kind of physics in question 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.420
 at first thought about handling but she 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.069
 mentioned later 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.519
 so take courage 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.310
 suggest that auto damage physics 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:51.340
 here and so gives the contribution it simply is not 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.080
 cars do not fight at all by the way lyoshka 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.030
 his last video mentioned that 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.930
 cars in drive club fight better than 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.830
 forda haha ​​what in horizon 2 what in 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.650
 motorsport 5 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.829
 will get pretty good anyway 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.810
 crushed to the box in general, not as 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.799
 flatout or beam ng drive 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.780
 but pretty detailed in many ways reluctantly well 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.750
 at least not so skillfully and sadly 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.000
 drive club although I would say that in both 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.280
 games they fight sucks 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.560
 and here is what is in favor of motorsport 5 what is 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.079
 drive collapse atmosphere is not very all 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.480
 so good to give the club try to create 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.060
 around you pseudo community with friends 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.660
 riders in fact you just pass 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.290
 race forza 5 is not at all on the plot because 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.120
 Unlike deka it has in Lavra 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.889
 autosimulator but half haters this 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.280
 series don't even know where are 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:50.680
 helpers settings but the second zone 2 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.230
 the best atmosphere at once 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.000
 dips into the thick of the festival events which 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.069
 passes scenic spots 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.290
 allows you to perform a variety of racing 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.989
 tasks for example overtake the train 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.819
 retro curry and stuff like that for every 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.010
 level you are awarded bonuses 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.380
 and also every 10th level they give a bracelet 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.019
 new color which is very simple 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.690
 immediately determine how many played enough in the lobby 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.790
 player drive club also has levels 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.849
 awards but they are made not so joyfully 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.650
 kapha risen showing itself as self 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.650
 a true gameplay element 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.860
 got to my favorite items 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.720
 for some reason everyone is far from racing people 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.690
 consider that drive club is the crown 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.030
 machine handling in games is a pity that 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.250
 few understand back and unfortunately 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.170
 drive club arcade in which just is 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.020
 faster cars that are harder 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.120
 manage than others before the physicist 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.520
 The behavior of the car in the deco is different and even 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.860
 requires some skill but it is not 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.530
 simulator and certainly not the best 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.810
 management though what is there to talk about 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.230
 forza motorsport 5 and driveability 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.900
 club 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.330
 The first is a simulator in which you are given 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.880
 chance to somehow overtake rivals on 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.590
 gamepad including all assistants a drive 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.500
 club is an incomprehensible mess 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.190
 undecided that but arcades and besim 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.500
 you will say why this is not a simulator but 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.870
 there is no machine settings scrupulous 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.270
 which have, for example, that forza 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.190
 motorsport 5 what's in horizon 2 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.440
 thanks to which you can make 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.780
 drift monster can make 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.780
 ideal car for ring races 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.160
 Alexey wrote that tuning the drive club 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.590
 have honestly not noticed where he is here 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.590
 Is that the coloring of the car this 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.710
 the final element of tuning but it is extremely 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.700
 bullshit in the tuning element ford again 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.770
 in both series 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.960
 I remind you that in horizon more 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.630
 arcade gives you the opportunity to change 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.300
 car both externally and completely inside 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.430
 not to mention fine tuning 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.830
 the car i'm sure our friend 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.830
 Lesha and now I never even went 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.510
 yes there is something to think about 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.600
 Again, compared with forza 5 against 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.030
 drive club 1 loses little interesting 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.610
 species but it is in favor of the fact that the slopes 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.760
 real drive club real only cities 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.340
 unrealistic tracks can they be present 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.440
 in the corners of the earth but the racing championship and 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.510
 there definitely does not pass which means 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.200
 developers because could draw that 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.970
 without thinking much about 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.740
 onticheskie trails in the whole drive club and 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.380
 nature is beautiful well, but rainy weather 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.220
 just amazing unfortunately for 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.770
 wallpaper with 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.930
 but in carazin 2 in particular in addition 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.520
 assault Island there are beautiful 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.510
 fascinating landscapes amazing 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:48.430
 rain but still me even nature itself 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.430
 drive club like the weather more 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.970
 in the end, I think that with some 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.550
 Alexey points hit the point with 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.590
 I completely missed the other well 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.420
 tried to make this video as much as possible 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.120
 informative and renounced 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.480
 my own opinion the more I played enough 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.700
 lots of hours in both games for grievances 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.070
 as always there are comments will be glad 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.030
 read thanks to our today's 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.730
 to a friend 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:23.120
 Alexey now I'm for throwing 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.560
 thought for a long and thoughtful video with 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.660
 you were Dima Vankoin 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.660
 and good luck on virtual roads
