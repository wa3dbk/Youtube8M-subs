conference and I recommend going I'm
going<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.220> actually<00:02:31.400> add<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.880> trailer<00:02:32.510> for

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
going to actually add the trailer for

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.140 
going to actually add the trailer for
the<00:02:33.650> conference<00:02:34.099> at<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.400> end<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:34.880> video

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
the conference at the end of this video

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.600 
the conference at the end of this video
all<00:02:35.660> right<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.670> yeah<00:02:37.670> me<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:39.190> zero<00:02:40.190> fossil

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
all right so yeah me and zero fossil

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.970 
all right so yeah me and zero fossil
fuel<00:02:40.819> are<00:02:41.060> going<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.510> have<00:02:41.690> both<00:02:42.050> next<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.920> each

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
fuel are going to have both next to each

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.400 
fuel are going to have both next to each
other<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.819> we<00:02:43.940> can<00:02:43.970> all<00:02:44.269> kind<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.810> be<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.350> a

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
other so we can all kind of be in a

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.920 
other so we can all kind of be in a
group<00:02:45.590> we're<00:02:46.549> pretty<00:02:46.850> much<00:02:47.000> similar<00:02:47.299> thinking

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
group we're pretty much similar thinking

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.320 
group we're pretty much similar thinking
same<00:02:48.560> minded<00:02:49.010> people<00:02:49.370> doing<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.910> similar

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
same minded people doing the similar

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.789 
same minded people doing the similar
sort<00:02:50.600> of<00:02:50.690> research<00:02:51.019> so<00:02:51.350> I<00:02:51.380> think<00:02:51.590> it'd<00:02:51.680> be<00:02:51.709> good

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
sort of research so I think it'd be good

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.920 
sort of research so I think it'd be good
to<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.160> able<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.459> be<00:02:52.730> in<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:52.940> same<00:02:53.120> location<00:02:53.750> I

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
to be able to be in the same location I

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.460 
to be able to be in the same location I
will<00:02:54.530> be<00:02:54.650> there<00:02:54.799> all<00:02:55.069> three<00:02:55.430> days<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:57.140> the

than<00:05:18.190> now<00:05:18.370> a<00:05:19.680> question<00:05:20.680> is<00:05:21.100> can<00:05:21.340> we<00:05:21.670> hold<00:05:22.090> in

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
than now a question is can we hold in

the technology that comes out of that
investigation<00:06:27.810> this<00:06:28.810> is<00:06:29.020> coming<00:06:29.440> whether<00:06:30.220> you

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
investigation this is coming whether you

want it or not it's not about win lose
it's<00:06:33.880> not<00:06:34.030> about<00:06:34.210> competition<00:06:34.480> it<00:06:34.990> is<00:06:35.200> win-win

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
it's not about competition it is win-win

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.250 
it's not about competition it is win-win
for<00:06:36.100> every<00:06:36.730> single<00:06:37.240> individual<00:06:37.960> on<00:06:38.110> the

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
for every single individual on the

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:57.189 
for every single individual on the
planet

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.719 

isn't<00:06:58.199> it<00:06:58.289> wonderful<00:06:58.470> to<00:06:58.800> come<00:06:59.099> to<00:06:59.250> conference

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
isn't it wonderful to come to conference

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.460 
isn't it wonderful to come to conference
like<00:06:59.940> this<00:06:59.970> if<00:07:00.419> I<00:07:00.509> hang<00:07:00.720> out<00:07:00.870> with<00:07:00.930> people<00:07:01.199> to

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
like this if I hang out with people to

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.860 
like this if I hang out with people to
know<00:07:01.680> that<00:07:01.710> you're<00:07:01.979> not<00:07:02.009> alone<00:07:02.389> I'm<00:07:03.389> happy<00:07:03.750> to

like<00:07:05.280> to<00:07:05.460> a<00:07:08.840> vision<00:07:09.840> is<00:07:10.680> more<00:07:11.039> powerful<00:07:11.280> than

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 
like to a vision is more powerful than

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.120 
like to a vision is more powerful than
around
