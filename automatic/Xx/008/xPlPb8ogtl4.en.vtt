that further treatment is required if on

they<00:01:58.950> would<00:01:59.100> receive<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> letter<00:01:59.759> from<00:01:59.909> our

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
they would receive a letter from our

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910 
they would receive a letter from our
office<00:02:00.600> within<00:02:00.810> two<00:02:01.110> weeks<00:02:01.290> telling<00:02:01.619> them

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
office within two weeks telling them

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920 
office within two weeks telling them
that<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.159> was<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> cancer<00:02:02.820> most<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that it was not a cancer most of the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.840 
that it was not a cancer most of the
time<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.470> something<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> skin

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
time if something is going to be a skin

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.310 
time if something is going to be a skin
cancer<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.270> will<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.630> already<00:02:06.930> warned<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
cancer I will have already warned the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.600 
cancer I will have already warned the
patient<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.799> think<00:02:07.830> that<00:02:08.130> there's<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> high

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
patient I think that there's a high

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.240 
patient I think that there's a high
degree<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.090> suspicion<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.530> skin

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
degree of suspicion that this is a skin

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.370 
degree of suspicion that this is a skin
cancer<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.819> there's<00:02:12.000> some<00:02:12.180> forewarning<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
cancer so there's some forewarning the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.710 
cancer so there's some forewarning the
treatment<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.860> skin<00:02:14.099> cancer<00:02:14.520> involves<00:02:15.090> three

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
treatment of skin cancer involves three

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.990 
treatment of skin cancer involves three
stages<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.470> first<00:02:16.500> stage<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.220> biopsy<00:02:17.550> so

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
stages the first stage is the biopsy so

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.190 
stages the first stage is the biopsy so
that's<00:02:18.180> already<00:02:18.390> been<00:02:18.660> done<00:02:18.900> at<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.140> point

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
that's already been done at that point

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.130 
that's already been done at that point
the<00:02:20.069> second<00:02:20.430> stage<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.849> complete<00:02:21.360> removal<00:02:21.930> of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
the second stage is complete removal of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.559 
the second stage is complete removal of
the<00:02:22.470> skin<00:02:22.709> cancer<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:23.940> you'll<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.180> sent

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
the skin cancer and then you'll be sent

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.150 
the skin cancer and then you'll be sent
to<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:24.900> me<00:02:25.050> at<00:02:25.200> an<00:02:25.319> operating<00:02:25.769> room<00:02:26.010> the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
to see me at an operating room the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.040 
to see me at an operating room the
following<00:02:26.580> day<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.180> will<00:02:27.450> repair<00:02:27.870> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
following day and I will repair the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.190 
following day and I will repair the
defect<00:02:28.230> or<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.709> hole<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.160> was<00:02:29.310> created<00:02:29.910> by

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
defect or the hole that was created by

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.370 
defect or the hole that was created by
removing<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.769> lesion<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.840> best

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
removing the lesion this is the the best

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.559 
removing the lesion this is the the best
method<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:34.980> patients<00:02:35.640> because<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.180> has<00:02:36.330> an

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
method for patients because it has an

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.580 
method for patients because it has an
extremely<00:02:37.080> high<00:02:37.260> cure<00:02:37.560> rate<00:02:37.790> around<00:02:38.790> 98%<00:02:39.590> in

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
extremely high cure rate around 98% in

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.120 
extremely high cure rate around 98% in
addition<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:42.180> allows<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:43.130> skin

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
addition to that it allows the skin

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.070 
addition to that it allows the skin
cancer<00:02:44.310> specialist<00:02:44.970> remove<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.630> minimal

amount of normal tissue creating the
