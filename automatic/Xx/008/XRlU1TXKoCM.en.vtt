00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 to iron a shirt maybe it's the most 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.929
 complicated that's why our expert from 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.150
 beatriz home is going to make us this 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.040
 easier task where we 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.929
 you recommend starting the first thing you should 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.539
 to do is to look at the base of the plate 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.220
 clean the water tank full and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.380
 observe the fabric to be ironed in this 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.869
 case is cotton shirts so 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.849
 I would accept a fairly high temperature 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.590
 we will also use a table of 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.630
 ironing we will place it the highest 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.969
 possible to avoid damaging the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.610
 back to take our garment and 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.690
 we started ironing the flaps here 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.780
 we can use enough steam 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.780
 [Music] 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.929
 then the fists 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.929
 [Music] 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.970
 and finally the neck never 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.970
 we will fold the iron we will do so 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.970
 stretched 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.989
 to avoid wrinkles that is now we put 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.000
 the right shirt and we will pose the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.729
 shoulders we will always use the form of 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.090
 the iron in our favor and hands 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.729
 to stretch and clean 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.859
 and the most complicated moment arrives 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.719
 good sleeves is not that complicated if 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:21.270
 we have a little space 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:25.650
 we must avoid the unsightly streak by 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.070
 that we will place the sleeve in this way 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.640
 and ironing we have everything but the part 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.310
 higher 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.010
 [Music] 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.160
 now the tour will do and we repeat 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.880
 the same operation 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.250
 [Music] 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.049
 we already have several ironed parts we 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.729
 would be the area of ​​the chest and back 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.939
 we take advantage of the form of the 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:53.659
 table and we put our shirt this 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.369
 shape and iron smoothly 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.469
 be careful in the lapels where 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.899
 find the buttons because you can 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.090
 burn very easily as the 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.479
 we can protect then vadhir you can 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.859
 use a thimble or a spoon now 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.899
 comes to the simplest part of a 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:12.400
 shirt that is the part of the back 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.110
 we put it 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.400
 stretch and clean 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.110
 [Music] 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.819
 and if as in this case we are 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.510
 tweezers we also come back to help from 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.450
 hands 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.020
 to leave it perfect 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.180
