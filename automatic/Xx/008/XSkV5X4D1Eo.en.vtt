00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.120 
sixteenth them or a double now basically
this<00:00:53.600> is<00:00:53.660> sometimes<00:00:54.230> referred<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:54.710> as<00:00:54.950> a

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
this is sometimes referred to as a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.389 
this is sometimes referred to as a
diddle<00:00:55.850> on<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.840> marching<00:00:57.320> band<00:00:57.500> terms<00:00:57.890> or<00:00:58.130> drum

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
what I'm doing is I'm alternate sticking

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.750 
what I'm doing is I'm alternate sticking
the<00:01:09.470> double<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.070> I'm<00:01:10.250> going<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:12.650> doing<00:01:13.370> right

the double so I'm going and doing right

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.310 
the double so I'm going and doing right
left<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.330> again<00:01:14.570> on<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.810> end<00:01:14.960> you'll<00:01:15.110> see

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
left and again on the end you'll see

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.560 
left and again on the end you'll see
this<00:01:15.470> all<00:01:15.680> written<00:01:15.950> on<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.190> board<00:01:16.570> basically

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
this all written on the board basically

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.930 
this all written on the board basically
using<00:01:17.960> this<00:01:18.049> in<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:18.560> funk<00:01:18.920> balance<00:01:19.490> type<00:01:19.729> of

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
using this in a funk balance type of

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:29.390 
using this in a funk balance type of
fill<00:01:20.330> with<00:01:20.900> a<00:01:20.930> groove

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.370 

now<00:01:30.400> you<00:01:30.460> can<00:01:30.700> also<00:01:30.940> displace<00:01:31.720> that<00:01:32.050> on<00:01:32.230> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
now you can also displace that on the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.740 
now you can also displace that on the
bass<00:01:32.620> drum<00:01:32.920> instead<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.520> hands<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.180> go

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
bass drum instead of the hands and go

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:45.120 
bass drum instead of the hands and go
one<00:01:35.350> trip<00:01:36.070> lip<00:01:42.300> or<00:01:43.300> you<00:01:44.020> can<00:01:44.200> combine<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.920> two

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
one trip lip or you can combine the two

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:54.210 
one trip lip or you can combine the two
and<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.570> can<00:01:52.810> be<00:01:52.900> applied<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.500> any<00:01:53.710> part<00:01:54.160> of

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
and this can be applied to any part of

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.940 
and this can be applied to any part of
the<00:01:54.310> triplet<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.090> one<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.870> trip<00:01:56.290> in<00:01:56.530> this

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
the triplet the one the trip in this

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.820 
the triplet the one the trip in this
case<00:01:57.220> we're<00:01:57.520> doing<00:01:57.760> it<00:01:57.850> on<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.150> leg<00:01:58.620> so<00:01:59.620> let's

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
case we're doing it on the leg so let's

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.560 
case we're doing it on the leg so let's
check<00:02:00.070> it<00:02:00.190> out<00:02:00.310> again<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.670> little<00:02:00.880> bit<00:02:01.000> faster

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
check it out again a little bit faster

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.110 
check it out again a little bit faster
and<00:02:01.660> practical<00:02:02.200> performance<00:02:02.350> form<00:02:03.070> here<00:02:04.030> it

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
and practical performance form here it

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:37.590 
and practical performance form here it
comes<00:02:34.890> alright<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.100> there<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.459> go<00:02:36.489> a<00:02:36.910> basic

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
comes alright so there you go a basic

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.509 
comes alright so there you go a basic
kind<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.900> idea<00:02:38.260> with<00:02:38.470> eighth<00:02:38.709> note<00:02:38.980> triplets

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
kind of idea with eighth note triplets

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.960 
kind of idea with eighth note triplets
in<00:02:39.640> four-four<00:02:40.239> time<00:02:40.560> doubling<00:02:41.560> on<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.430> let<00:02:42.760> of

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
in four-four time doubling on the let of

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.240 
in four-four time doubling on the let of
an<00:02:43.180> eighth<00:02:43.390> note<00:02:43.420> triplet<00:02:44.140> again<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:45.220> can

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
an eighth note triplet again you can

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.640 
an eighth note triplet again you can
make<00:02:45.790> numerous<00:02:46.090> variations<00:02:46.630> up<00:02:47.140> between<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
make numerous variations up between the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.880 
make numerous variations up between the
hands<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.310> feet<00:02:48.970> with<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.600> idea<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.290> put

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
hands and feet with this idea and put

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.259 
hands and feet with this idea and put
them<00:02:51.040> on<00:02:51.130> different<00:02:51.430> parts<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.060> eighth

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
them on different parts of the eighth

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.150 
them on different parts of the eighth
note<00:02:52.480> triplet<00:02:52.959> I'm<00:02:53.200> going<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.680> write<00:02:53.830> out<00:02:53.860> on

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
note triplet I'm going to write out on

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.800 
note triplet I'm going to write out on
the<00:02:54.310> board<00:02:54.580> what<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.820> played<00:02:55.209> right<00:02:55.450> here<00:02:55.480> but

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
the board what I played right here but

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.360 
the board what I played right here but
again<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.170> whole<00:02:56.350> idea<00:02:56.800> is<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:57.070> come<00:02:57.250> up<00:02:57.340> with

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
again the whole idea is to come up with

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.520 
again the whole idea is to come up with
your<00:02:57.580> own<00:02:57.640> ideas<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.360> really<00:02:58.450> improvise<00:02:58.870> I'm

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
your own ideas and really improvise I'm

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.259 
your own ideas and really improvise I'm
