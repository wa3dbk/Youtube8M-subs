gee<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:05.560> next<00:00:05.890> question<00:00:06.010> from<00:00:06.340> the<00:00:06.490> form<00:00:06.760> is

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
gee the next question from the form is

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.660 
gee the next question from the form is
from<00:00:07.090> rich<00:00:07.390> be<00:00:07.870> too<00:00:08.380> what<00:00:09.070> is<00:00:09.250> a<00:00:09.280> tritone

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
from rich be too what is a tritone

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.150 
from rich be too what is a tritone
substitution<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:11.080> when<00:00:11.830> does<00:00:12.070> one<00:00:12.250> use<00:00:12.549> it

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
substitution and when does one use it

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.800 
substitution and when does one use it
okay<00:00:15.750> well<00:00:17.820> textbook<00:00:18.930> answer<00:00:19.930> is<00:00:20.340> tritone

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
okay well textbook answer is tritone

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.350 
okay well textbook answer is tritone
let's<00:00:22.810> take<00:00:23.020> a<00:00:23.830> tone<00:00:24.460> away<00:00:24.670> for<00:00:24.880> a<00:00:24.910> second<00:00:25.210> tri

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
let's take a tone away for a second tri

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.350 
let's take a tone away for a second tri
means<00:00:25.570> three<00:00:25.950> tone<00:00:26.950> is<00:00:27.190> referring<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:27.850> a<00:00:28.120> whole

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
means three tone is referring to a whole

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.830 
means three tone is referring to a whole
step<00:00:28.600> so<00:00:28.930> three<00:00:29.530> whole<00:00:29.800> steps<00:00:30.070> so<00:00:30.850> the<00:00:31.060> tritone

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
step so three whole steps so the tritone

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.660 
step so three whole steps so the tritone
is<00:00:32.020> an<00:00:32.169> interval<00:00:32.529> of<00:00:32.559> three<00:00:33.250> whole<00:00:33.399> steps

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
is an interval of three whole steps

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.260 
is an interval of three whole steps
which<00:00:34.000> is<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:35.610> perfect<00:00:36.610> I'm<00:00:36.910> sorry<00:00:37.120> an

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
which is a perfect I'm sorry an

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.500 
which is a perfect I'm sorry an
Augmented<00:00:37.780> fourth<00:00:38.050> or<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:39.450> diminished<00:00:40.450> fifth

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
Augmented fourth or a diminished fifth

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.840 
Augmented fourth or a diminished fifth
send<00:00:41.050> harmonically<00:00:41.560> the<00:00:41.740> same<00:00:41.950> thing<00:00:42.190> so<00:00:42.760> if

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
send harmonically the same thing so if

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.060 
send harmonically the same thing so if
we're<00:00:43.030> here<00:00:43.360> at<00:00:44.130> see<00:00:45.130> here<00:00:45.340> on<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:47.070> fifth

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
we're here at see here on the fifth

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.460 
we're here at see here on the fifth
string<00:00:48.160> third<00:00:48.550> fret<00:00:48.790> here's<00:00:49.180> a<00:00:49.360> c3<00:00:50.320> whole

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
string third fret here's a c3 whole

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.160 
string third fret here's a c3 whole
steps<00:00:50.770> away<00:00:50.950> so<00:00:51.640> you<00:00:51.730> have<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.910> D<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.540> lab

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
steps away so you have the D the lab

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.800 
steps away so you have the D the lab
sharp<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:53.829> here's<00:00:54.040> your<00:00:54.220> here's<00:00:55.090> your<00:00:55.210> linear

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
sharp so here's your here's your linear

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.590 
sharp so here's your here's your linear
or<00:00:56.079> horizontal<00:00:56.620> tritone<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.360> could<00:00:58.480> be<00:00:58.510> a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
or horizontal tritone so that could be a

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.889 
or horizontal tritone so that could be a
Augmented<00:00:59.350> fourth<00:00:59.500> or<00:00:59.739> a<00:00:59.800> flat<00:01:00.280> five<00:01:00.550> I

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
Augmented fourth or a flat five I

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.120 
Augmented fourth or a flat five I
remember<00:01:01.899> dead<00:01:02.079> harmonic<00:01:02.530> is<00:01:02.649> a<00:01:02.680> note<00:01:02.980> that

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
remember dead harmonic is a note that

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.979 
remember dead harmonic is a note that
has<00:01:03.220> two<00:01:03.370> different<00:01:03.520> names<00:01:03.820> same<00:01:04.540> pitch<00:01:04.750> two

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
has two different names same pitch two

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.289 
has two different names same pitch two
different<00:01:05.290> names<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.670> by<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:06.969> way<00:01:07.090> the

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
different names and by the way the

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.149 
different names and by the way the
tritone<00:01:07.689> is<00:01:07.929> the<00:01:08.049> exact<00:01:08.380> middle<00:01:08.649> point<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.069> an

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
tritone is the exact middle point of an

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.090 
tritone is the exact middle point of an
octave<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:09.880> here's<00:01:10.060> an<00:01:10.149> octave<00:01:10.920> there's<00:01:11.920> the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
octave so here's an octave there's the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.950 
octave so here's an octave there's the
tritone<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:13.479> i'm<00:01:13.569> not<00:01:13.659> talking<00:01:13.719> about

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
tritone and i'm not talking about

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.389 
tritone and i'm not talking about
physically<00:01:14.499> on<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.710> guitar<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.100> looks<00:01:15.280> like

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
physically on the guitar that looks like

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.739 
physically on the guitar that looks like
the<00:01:15.520> middle<00:01:15.729> point<00:01:15.880> between<00:01:15.969> this<00:01:16.299> diagonal

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:16.749 
the middle point between this diagonal

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:19.260 
the middle point between this diagonal
line<00:01:16.899> i'm<00:01:17.109> talking<00:01:17.409> you<00:01:18.399> know<00:01:18.429> in<00:01:18.759> music<00:01:19.179> in

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
line i'm talking you know in music in

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.059 
line i'm talking you know in music in
general<00:01:19.450> this<00:01:20.139> is<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.289> exact<00:01:20.590> middle<00:01:20.799> point

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
general this is the exact middle point

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.620 
general this is the exact middle point
of<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.219> twelve<00:01:21.459> half<00:01:21.670> steps<00:01:21.969> this<00:01:22.209> is<00:01:22.359> number

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
of the twelve half steps this is number

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.160 
of the twelve half steps this is number
six<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:24.329> this<00:01:25.329> is<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.569> only<00:01:25.689> interval<00:01:26.139> that

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
six so this is the only interval that

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.800 
six so this is the only interval that
when<00:01:26.409> you<00:01:26.499> flip<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.799> so<00:01:27.369> here's<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:27.639> c2<00:01:28.389> its

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
when you flip it so here's a c2 its

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.989 
when you flip it so here's a c2 its
tritone<00:01:29.229> if<00:01:29.469> you<00:01:29.590> go<00:01:29.709> to<00:01:29.889> its<00:01:30.249> tritone<00:01:30.639> to<00:01:30.789> see

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
tritone if you go to its tritone to see

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.300 
tritone if you go to its tritone to see
same<00:01:31.689> exact<00:01:32.020> interval<00:01:32.409> it's<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.679> only<00:01:32.740> one

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
same exact interval it's the only one

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.940 
same exact interval it's the only one
that<00:01:33.490> does<00:01:33.609> that<00:01:34.469> there's<00:01:35.469> all<00:01:35.560> kinds<00:01:35.799> of<00:01:35.829> cool

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
that does that there's all kinds of cool

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.249 
that does that there's all kinds of cool
little<00:01:36.130> things<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.369> tritone<00:01:36.609> does<00:01:37.109> let's<00:01:38.109> get

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
little things a tritone does let's get

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.559 
little things a tritone does let's get
to<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.439> substitution<00:01:39.100> part<00:01:39.340> okay<00:01:40.119> so<00:01:40.179> when<00:01:40.479> it

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
to the substitution part okay so when it

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.529 
to the substitution part okay so when it
comes<00:01:40.719> to<00:01:40.869> tritone<00:01:41.259> substitution<00:01:42.420> let's<00:01:43.420> take

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
comes to tritone substitution let's take

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.300 
comes to tritone substitution let's take
a<00:01:43.600> seventh<00:01:43.990> chord<00:01:44.049> this<00:01:44.499> is<00:01:44.679> most<00:01:44.829> commonly

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
a seventh chord this is most commonly

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.709 
a seventh chord this is most commonly
where<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.579> happened<00:01:45.880> though<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.209> doesn't<00:01:46.359> have

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
where it happened though it doesn't have

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.019 
where it happened though it doesn't have
to<00:01:46.959> happen<00:01:46.990> here<00:01:47.529> please<00:01:48.490> remember<00:01:48.759> I<00:01:48.909> said

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:49.029 
to happen here please remember I said

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:51.239 
to happen here please remember I said
that<00:01:49.270> tritone<00:01:50.170> substitutions<00:01:50.920> are<00:01:51.069> not

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
that tritone substitutions are not

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:54.059 
that tritone substitutions are not
regulated<00:01:51.609> just<00:01:52.179> to<00:01:52.479> seventh<00:01:53.170> chords<00:01:53.529> they're

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
regulated just to seventh chords they're

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.359 
regulated just to seventh chords they're
most<00:01:54.310> commonly<00:01:54.670> uses<00:01:55.359> way<00:01:55.539> referred<00:01:56.049> to<00:01:56.369> in

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
most commonly uses way referred to in

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.980 
most commonly uses way referred to in
conjunction<00:01:58.149> with<00:01:58.240> seventh<00:01:58.539> chords<00:01:58.779> but<00:01:58.869> it

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
conjunction with seventh chords but it

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.699 
conjunction with seventh chords but it
can<00:01:59.109> be<00:01:59.200> anything<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:02.049> might<00:02:02.200> be<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.349> bit

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
can be anything so that might be a bit

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.289 
can be anything so that might be a bit
of<00:02:02.799> a<00:02:02.859> controversial<00:02:03.340> statement<00:02:03.939> but<00:02:04.029> it's<00:02:04.209> a

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
of a controversial statement but it's a

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
is also a sharp force that as you try to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.360 
is also a sharp force that as you try to
the<00:02:35.820> tritone<00:02:36.240> substitution<00:02:36.500> comes<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.740> where

the tritone substitution comes in where
you<00:02:38.520> take<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.880> root<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.630> c7<00:02:40.290> and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
you take the root of this c7 and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.230 
you take the root of this c7 and
substitute<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.120> root<00:02:42.360> with<00:02:42.930> its<00:02:43.290> tritone

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
substitute the root with its tritone

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.690 
substitute the root with its tritone
which<00:02:45.240> remember<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.810> shape<00:02:45.990> looks<00:02:46.020> like<00:02:46.380> this

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
whatever it is I'm doing here so I can

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.870 
whatever it is I'm doing here so I can
play<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:17.049> treat<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.170> now<00:04:18.320> as<00:04:18.530> f<00:04:18.739> sharp<00:04:18.950> 7<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:19.610> over

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
play a treat it now as f sharp 7 so over

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.340 
play a treat it now as f sharp 7 so over
this<00:04:24.580> play<00:04:25.580> F<00:04:25.730> sharp<00:04:25.900> seven<00:04:26.900> lines<00:04:27.080> which

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
this play F sharp seven lines which

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.790 
this play F sharp seven lines which
would<00:04:27.500> tell<00:04:27.680> like<00:04:27.770> this<00:04:32.650> notice<00:04:33.650> how<00:04:33.770> i

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
would tell like this notice how i

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.840 
would tell like this notice how i
resolved<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.400> at<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.700> end<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:35.030> played<00:04:36.550> sharp<00:04:37.550> 7

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
resolved it at the end I played sharp 7

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.640 
resolved it at the end I played sharp 7
fragment<00:04:38.240> over<00:04:38.420> here<00:04:38.630> in<00:04:38.720> this<00:04:38.840> little<00:04:39.260> one

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
fragment over here in this little one

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.640 
fragment over here in this little one
octave<00:04:39.950> arpeggio<00:04:41.050> improvise<00:04:42.050> with<00:04:42.230> that<00:04:42.410> and

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
octave arpeggio improvise with that and

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.620 
octave arpeggio improvise with that and
then<00:04:42.800> handed<00:04:43.280> on<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.550> o.c<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:44.390> i<00:04:44.420> have<00:04:44.540> this

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
then handed on the o.c so i have this

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.000 
then handed on the o.c so i have this
outside<00:04:45.050> sound<00:04:45.380> that's<00:04:45.680> not<00:04:45.800> really<00:04:45.980> that

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
outside sound that's not really that

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.500 
outside sound that's not really that
outside<00:04:46.490> because<00:04:46.670> as<00:04:46.880> two<00:04:47.060> tones<00:04:47.300> that<00:04:47.420> are

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
outside because as two tones that are

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.890 
outside because as two tones that are
coming<00:04:51.280> then<00:04:52.280> resolve<00:04:52.640> it<00:04:52.760> that<00:04:53.240> is<00:04:53.480> tritone

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
coming then resolve it that is tritone

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.010 
coming then resolve it that is tritone
substitution<00:04:54.010> you<00:04:55.010> can<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:56.180> can<00:04:56.330> do<00:04:56.840> what<00:04:56.960> I

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
substitution you can you can do what I

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.270 
substitution you can you can do what I
just<00:04:57.050> did<00:04:57.320> or<00:04:57.530> you<00:04:57.620> can<00:04:57.710> combine<00:04:57.830> them<00:04:58.130> both

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
just did or you can combine them both

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:07.799 
just did or you can combine them both
where<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.700> go<00:04:58.820> I<00:05:02.200> played<00:05:03.200> a<00:05:03.230> little<00:05:03.350> bit<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:03.620> c7

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:07.809 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.839 

and<00:05:08.809> then<00:05:08.899> played<00:05:09.109> more<00:05:09.559> inside<00:05:10.099> of<00:05:10.249> F<00:05:10.369> sharp<00:05:10.519> 7

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
and then played more inside of F sharp 7

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.299 
and then played more inside of F sharp 7
and<00:05:11.449> ended<00:05:11.719> on<00:05:11.809> that<00:05:11.869> see<00:05:12.229> something<00:05:13.219> that

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:13.309 
and ended on that see something that

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.639 
and ended on that see something that
results<00:05:13.779> so<00:05:14.779> there<00:05:14.899> you<00:05:14.989> have<00:05:15.019> it<00:05:15.139> as<00:05:15.379> you<00:05:15.499> try

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:15.649 
results so there you have it as you try

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.679 
results so there you have it as you try
its<00:05:15.769> own<00:05:15.859> substitution<00:05:16.519> I<00:05:16.699> remember<00:05:17.539> what<00:05:17.629> I

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:17.689 
its own substitution I remember what I

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.329 
its own substitution I remember what I
said<00:05:17.719> you<00:05:18.319> could<00:05:18.439> do<00:05:18.559> this<00:05:18.589> with<00:05:18.829> anything<00:05:19.129> i

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:19.339 
said you could do this with anything i

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.789 
said you could do this with anything i
could<00:05:20.059> try<00:05:20.269> its<00:05:20.419> own<00:05:20.479> substitute<00:05:21.019> c7<00:05:21.589> with

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:21.799 
could try its own substitute c7 with

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:23.259 
could try its own substitute c7 with
something<00:05:22.159> built<00:05:22.399> off<00:05:22.579> of<00:05:22.609> F<00:05:22.849> sharp<00:05:23.029> it

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:23.269 
something built off of F sharp it

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:24.759 
something built off of F sharp it
doesn't<00:05:23.539> have<00:05:23.689> to<00:05:23.869> be<00:05:23.899> in<00:05:24.079> a<00:05:24.109> seventh<00:05:24.439> chord<00:05:24.499> it

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:24.769 
doesn't have to be in a seventh chord it

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:26.649 
doesn't have to be in a seventh chord it
can<00:05:24.859> be<00:05:24.949> F<00:05:25.069> sharp<00:05:25.219> major<00:05:25.429> 7<00:05:25.579> it<00:05:26.299> could<00:05:26.479> be<00:05:26.539> F

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
can be F sharp major 7 it could be F

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.589 
can be F sharp major 7 it could be F
sharp<00:05:26.779> minor<00:05:26.899> 7<00:05:27.549> i've<00:05:28.549> worked<00:05:29.089> with<00:05:29.239> lots<00:05:29.479> of

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
sharp minor 7 i've worked with lots of

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:30.849 
sharp minor 7 i've worked with lots of
composers<00:05:30.019> that<00:05:30.109> take<00:05:30.259> advantage<00:05:30.379> of<00:05:30.739> this

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:30.859 
composers that take advantage of this

00:05:30.859 --> 00:05:32.469 
composers that take advantage of this
and<00:05:31.039> I've<00:05:31.129> seen<00:05:31.339> lots<00:05:31.399> of<00:05:31.699> improvisers<00:05:32.149> do

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
and I've seen lots of improvisers do

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.379 
and I've seen lots of improvisers do
this<00:05:32.659> and<00:05:33.349> you<00:05:34.309> can<00:05:34.339> go<00:05:34.579> no<00:05:34.789> further<00:05:34.819> than<00:05:35.149> Joe

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
this and you can go no further than Joe

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.299 
this and you can go no further than Joe
Pass<00:05:35.599> they<00:05:35.959> did<00:05:36.169> it<00:05:36.259> all<00:05:36.469> the<00:05:36.499> time<00:05:36.709> when<00:05:37.099> he

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:37.309 
Pass they did it all the time when he

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:39.999 
Pass they did it all the time when he
was<00:05:37.399> very<00:05:37.489> harmonizing<00:05:38.089> tunes<00:05:38.359> so<00:05:39.009> the

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
was very harmonizing tunes so the

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.959 
was very harmonizing tunes so the
concept<00:05:40.369> is<00:05:40.610> broader<00:05:41.239> than<00:05:41.329> just<00:05:41.479> sevens
