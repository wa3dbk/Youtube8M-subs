00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
harnesses so the LLC the search dog

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.509 
harnesses so the LLC the search dog
harness<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.289> recall<00:00:28.619> harness<00:00:29.039> are<00:00:29.220> all

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
harness and the recall harness are all

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.310 
harness and the recall harness are all
ones<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.119> harness<00:00:30.480> works<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.259> as

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
ones that this harness works with and as

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.869 
ones that this harness works with and as
you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> from<00:00:32.339> the<00:00:32.430> bottom<00:00:32.610> up

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
you can see this is from the bottom up

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.180 
you can see this is from the bottom up
it's<00:00:33.089> about<00:00:33.210> 3<00:00:33.629> inches<00:00:33.930> deep<00:00:34.170> at<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.710> deepest

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
it's about 3 inches deep at the deepest

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's about 3 inches deep at the deepest
point<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> its<00:00:35.940> shape<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.449> teardrop<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
point and its shape is a teardrop so the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.439 
point and its shape is a teardrop so the
load<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.580> works<00:00:38.820> its<00:00:39.030> way<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
load actually works its way to the

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.240 
load actually works its way to the
bottoms<00:00:39.780> because<00:00:40.019> we<00:00:40.140> want<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> keep<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.739> load

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
bottoms because we want to keep the load

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.740 
bottoms because we want to keep the load
to<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.519> as<00:00:41.850> far<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.089> the<00:00:42.269> bottom<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:42.629> we

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
to the as far to the bottom as we

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.780 
to the as far to the bottom as we
possibly<00:00:43.230> can<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:43.980> three<00:00:44.670> inches

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
possibly can and that's three inches

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.729 
possibly can and that's three inches
deep<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.050> seven<00:00:46.469> inches

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
deep as you can see and seven inches

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.369 
deep as you can see and seven inches
tall<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.699> tapers<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.449> the<00:00:48.570> bottom<00:00:48.930> zipper

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
tall now it tapers to the bottom zipper

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.650 
tall now it tapers to the bottom zipper
to<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.559> bottom<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.610> does<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.090> us<00:00:51.210> it

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to the bottom what that does for us it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.049 
to the bottom what that does for us it
allows<00:00:51.690> better<00:00:52.530> range<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.920> motion<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.940> can

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
allows better range of motion so we can

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.790 
allows better range of motion so we can
get<00:00:54.149> more<00:00:54.300> stuff<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.410> heavy<00:00:55.559> stuff

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
get more stuff in it and the heavy stuff

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.709 
get more stuff in it and the heavy stuff
kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.129> sips<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.609> bottom<00:00:56.940> which<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.600> can

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
kind of sips to the bottom which we can

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.389 
kind of sips to the bottom which we can
keep<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> load<00:00:58.199> balanced<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.739> lot<00:00:58.920> better<00:00:59.160> that

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
keep the load balanced a lot better that

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.580 
keep the load balanced a lot better that
way<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.019> comes<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
way so you can see here it comes on and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.680 
way so you can see here it comes on and
off<00:01:01.649> pretty<00:01:01.920> easy<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.670> unclip<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.180> fast<00:01:03.420> X

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
off pretty easy you unclip a fast X

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.960 
off pretty easy you unclip a fast X

body<00:01:46.410> is<00:01:46.619> especially<00:01:47.130> if<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.280> kind<00:01:47.489> of<00:01:47.550> have

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
body is especially if you kind of have

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
body is especially if you kind of have
big<00:01:48.000> hot<00:01:48.239> dogs<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.289> little<00:01:49.440> clumsy

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
big hot dogs that are a little clumsy

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.620 
big hot dogs that are a little clumsy
the<00:01:50.369> more<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:50.849> become<00:01:51.149> aware<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.420> their

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the more that they become aware of their

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.510 
the more that they become aware of their
body<00:01:51.750> past<00:01:52.170> their<00:01:52.440> front<00:01:52.679> legs<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.369> more

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
body past their front legs the more

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
body past their front legs the more
agile<00:01:53.849> they<00:01:53.940> become<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.479> easier<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:54.959> are<00:01:55.319> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
agile they become the easier they are to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.020 
agile they become the easier they are to
deal<00:01:55.709> with<00:01:55.890> especially<00:01:56.160> in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.580> house<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
deal with especially in the house and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.889 
deal with especially in the house and
things<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.629> that

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
things like that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.150 
things like that
getting<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.319> and<00:01:58.410> out<00:01:58.440> of<00:01:58.590> cars<00:01:58.830> they<00:01:59.009> don't

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
getting in and out of cars they don't

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.740 
getting in and out of cars they don't
bump<00:01:59.459> into<00:01:59.729> things<00:01:59.910> near<00:02:00.209> as<00:02:00.300> much<00:02:00.539> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
bump into things near as much and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.540 
bump into things near as much and
they're<00:02:00.840> not<00:02:00.959> as<00:02:01.110> apt<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:01.649> tear<00:02:01.890> themselves<00:02:02.129> up

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
they're not as apt to tear themselves up

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.309 
they're not as apt to tear themselves up
so<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.149> better<00:02:03.330> body<00:02:03.599> awareness<00:02:03.840> they<00:02:04.140> have

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
so the better body awareness they have

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.380 
so the better body awareness they have
the<00:02:04.739> better<00:02:04.890> off<00:02:05.129> we<00:02:05.369> are<00:02:05.399> they<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.030> we're

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the better off we are they know we're

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.330 
the better off we are they know we're
more<00:02:06.629> than<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.020> their<00:02:07.140> front<00:02:07.410> legs<00:02:07.590> are<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
more than just their front legs are the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.199 
more than just their front legs are the
