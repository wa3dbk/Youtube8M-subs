00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
color it in so it's super quick and easy

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.800 
color it in so it's super quick and easy
and<00:01:06.470> with<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.950> Prima<00:01:08.400> style<00:01:08.670> flowers<00:01:09.150> or<00:01:09.420> like

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and with the Prima style flowers or like

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.360 
and with the Prima style flowers or like
paper<00:01:10.110> flowers<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.540> use

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
paper flowers I really like to use

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
paper flowers I really like to use
copics<00:01:14.370> for<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.910> because<00:01:15.060> they're

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
copics for it because they're

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.800 
copics for it because they're
alcohol-based<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.260> dries<00:01:16.560> quickly

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
alcohol-based so it dries quickly

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.840 
alcohol-based so it dries quickly
because<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.960> you're<00:01:19.080> familiar<00:01:19.230> with<00:01:19.850> these

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
because if you're familiar with these

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.260 
because if you're familiar with these
types<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.390> flowers<00:01:21.570> they're<00:01:22.140> usually<00:01:23.270> they've

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
types of flowers they're usually they've

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.000 
types of flowers they're usually they've
got<00:01:24.480> like<00:01:24.660> designs<00:01:25.230> or<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.740> know<00:01:25.830> they've

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
got like designs or you know they've

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.990 
got like designs or you know they've
been<00:01:26.040> pressed<00:01:26.430> into<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.000> certain<00:01:27.480> shape<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.000> by

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
been pressed into a certain shape and by

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.490 
been pressed into a certain shape and by
using<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.360> Copic<00:01:30.660> marker<00:01:30.960> because<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.320> dries

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
using a Copic marker because it dries

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.530 
using a Copic marker because it dries
quickly<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.040> doesn't<00:01:32.490> distort<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> shape<00:01:33.240> at

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
quickly it doesn't distort the shape at

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.770 
quickly it doesn't distort the shape at
all<00:01:34.100> because<00:01:35.100> I've<00:01:35.310> tinted<00:01:35.730> flowers<00:01:36.150> way<00:01:36.540> back

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
all because I've tinted flowers way back

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.630 
all because I've tinted flowers way back
before<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.200> had<00:01:37.440> Kovac<00:01:37.830> markers<00:01:38.160> i<00:01:38.340> would<00:01:38.490> use

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
before I had Kovac markers i would use

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.400 
before I had Kovac markers i would use
like<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> die<00:01:39.030> based<00:01:39.300> marker<00:01:39.690> or<00:01:39.960> everybody<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
like a die based marker or everybody you

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.700 
like a die based marker or everybody you
been<00:01:40.590> use<00:01:40.980> em<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:42.120> a<00:01:42.150> reinker<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.960> try<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
been use em like a reinker and try and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.140 
been use em like a reinker and try and
tint<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.100> flowers<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.520> color<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.760> wanted

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
tint the flowers the color I wanted

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.710 
tint the flowers the color I wanted
which<00:01:45.900> for<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> most<00:01:46.350> part<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.740> works<00:01:47.010> however

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
which for the most part it works however

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.570 
which for the most part it works however
when<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.170> flowers<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:50.010> exposed<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.400> too<00:01:50.550> much

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
when the flowers are exposed to too much

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.000 
when the flowers are exposed to too much
moisture<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.600> flatten<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.140> because

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
moisture they just flatten out because

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.660 
moisture they just flatten out because
the<00:01:53.130> paper<00:01:53.310> absorbs<00:01:53.610> all<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.270> water<00:01:55.490> so<00:01:56.490> that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the paper absorbs all the water so that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.810 
the paper absorbs all the water so that
is<00:01:56.880> why<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> prefer<00:01:57.540> using<00:01:58.490> kopecks<00:01:59.490> also

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
is why I prefer using kopecks also

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.460 
is why I prefer using kopecks also
because<00:02:00.120> they<00:02:00.300> dry<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.900> I<00:02:01.020> said<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.260> jar

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
because they dry like I said the jar

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.990 
because they dry like I said the jar
really<00:02:01.560> quickly<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.190> can<00:02:02.370> quickly<00:02:02.670> tint

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
really quickly so you can quickly tint

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.260 
really quickly so you can quickly tint
it<00:02:03.150> it's<00:02:03.390> dry<00:02:04.260> within<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:05.250> few<00:02:05.580> seconds<00:02:05.970> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
it it's dry within a few seconds and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.009 
it it's dry within a few seconds and
it's<00:02:07.140> good<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.470> go<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.569> that's<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.899> have

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
it's good to go so that's all you have

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.839 
it's good to go so that's all you have
to<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:10.800> say<00:02:11.039> it's<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> same<00:02:11.579> thing

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
to do and then say it's the same thing

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.660 
to do and then say it's the same thing
with<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.019> a<00:02:13.049> fabric<00:02:13.499> for<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.249> by<00:02:14.489> um

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
with this is a fabric for this is by um

same<00:02:16.990> idea<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:19.360> have<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.630> use<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.810> little<00:02:20.050> bit

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
same idea you have to use a little bit

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.820 
same idea you have to use a little bit
more<00:02:20.260> pressure<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:22.210> coat<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:24.160> fabric<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.830> let

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
more pressure to coat the fabric and let

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.140 
more pressure to coat the fabric and let
these<00:02:27.040> ones<00:02:27.340> just<00:02:27.580> because<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.060> way

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
these ones just because of the way

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.060 
these ones just because of the way
they're<00:02:28.420> shaped<00:02:28.810> their<00:02:29.110> kind<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.350> funny<00:02:29.560> but<00:02:29.860> I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
they're shaped their kind of funny but I

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.480 
they're shaped their kind of funny but I
just<00:02:31.320> use<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.350> bit<00:02:32.560> more<00:02:32.680> pressure<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.280> press

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
just use a bit more pressure and press

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.260 
just use a bit more pressure and press
down<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:34.000> make<00:02:34.150> sure<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:35.770> everything<00:02:36.270> gets

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
down to make sure that everything gets

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.110 
down to make sure that everything gets
absorbed<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.280> that's<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.640> is<00:02:39.820> where<00:02:39.970> it's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
absorbed and that's this is where it's

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.290 
absorbed and that's this is where it's
really<00:02:40.210> good<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.570> use<00:02:40.930> either<00:02:41.580> scrap<00:02:42.580> paper<00:02:42.880> or

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
really good to use either scrap paper or

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.880 
really good to use either scrap paper or
a<00:02:43.330> protective<00:02:43.900> surface<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.440> some<00:02:44.620> sort

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
a protective surface of some sort

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.080 
a protective surface of some sort
because<00:02:45.040> you're<00:02:45.340> going<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.640> get<00:02:45.850> ink<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:48.090> more

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
because you're going to get ink on more

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.120 
because you're going to get ink on more

you<00:03:04.420> can<00:03:04.540> use<00:03:04.690> alcohol<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.170> kind<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.590> like

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
you can use alcohol to kind of like

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.300 
you can use alcohol to kind of like
rubbing<00:03:06.580> alcohol<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:07.000> remove<00:03:08.700> most<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:11.310> and

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
rubbing alcohol to remove most of it and

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.949 
rubbing alcohol to remove most of it and
yeah<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:13.270> you<00:03:13.360> just<00:03:14.760> keep<00:03:15.760> dabbing<00:03:16.060> at<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.600> to

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
yeah so you just keep dabbing at it to

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.270 
yeah so you just keep dabbing at it to
completely<00:03:17.800> color<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.690> also<00:03:20.280> another

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
completely color it and also another

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.520 
completely color it and also another
good<00:03:21.610> reason<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.060> use<00:03:22.180> just<00:03:22.510> white<00:03:22.720> flowers<00:03:23.230> is

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
good reason to use just white flowers is

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.650 
good reason to use just white flowers is
you'll<00:03:24.220> get<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> true<00:03:26.040> color<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.430> guess<00:03:28.150> like<00:03:28.450> if

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
you'll get a true color I guess like if

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.509 
you'll get a true color I guess like if
you<00:03:28.900> want<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.140> specific<00:03:29.410> like<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:29.920> kopeck<00:03:30.310> color

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
you want a specific like a kopeck color

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.940 
you want a specific like a kopeck color
use<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.360> white<00:03:31.630> flower<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.110> will<00:03:32.230> get<00:03:32.380> that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
use a white flower you will get that

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.729 
use a white flower you will get that
exact<00:03:33.310> color<00:03:33.660> using<00:03:34.660> one<00:03:34.959> that's<00:03:35.200> tinted<00:03:35.590> this

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
exact color using one that's tinted this

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.949 
exact color using one that's tinted this
one's<00:03:35.920> pretty<00:03:36.100> close<00:03:36.400> but<00:03:36.640> using<00:03:37.030> flowers

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
one's pretty close but using flowers

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.009 
one's pretty close but using flowers
that<00:03:38.080> are<00:03:38.200> already<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.650> certain<00:03:39.040> color<00:03:40.019> the

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
that are already a certain color the

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.630 
that are already a certain color the
shade<00:03:41.320> might<00:03:41.620> not<00:03:41.799> be<00:03:41.950> exactly<00:03:42.070> what<00:03:42.610> you

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
shade might not be exactly what you

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.330 
shade might not be exactly what you
wanted<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.330> just<00:03:43.540> keep<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.720> in<00:03:43.900> mind<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:45.190> can

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
wanted so just keep that in mind you can

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.690 
wanted so just keep that in mind you can
also<00:03:45.459> do<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.730> with<00:03:45.880> ribbon<00:03:46.299> I<00:03:46.959> rarely<00:03:47.860> color

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
also do that with ribbon I rarely color

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.130 
also do that with ribbon I rarely color
my<00:03:48.910> room<00:03:49.090> with<00:03:49.239> copics<00:03:49.570> that's<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.870> lot<00:03:50.110> of

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
my room with copics that's a lot of

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.190 
my room with copics that's a lot of
coloring<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.850> a<00:03:51.970> lot<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.269> ink<00:03:52.480> being<00:03:52.750> used<00:03:52.989> up

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
coloring and a lot of ink being used up

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.620 
coloring and a lot of ink being used up
so<00:03:53.410> I<00:03:53.620> don't<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.430> usually<00:03:54.880> will<00:03:55.030> try<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.360> find<00:03:55.540> a

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
so I don't I usually will try and find a

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.970 
so I don't I usually will try and find a
different<00:03:55.780> type<00:03:56.019> of<00:03:56.049> Reuben<00:03:56.350> if<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.530> can't<00:03:56.769> find

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
different type of Reuben if I can't find

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.560 
different type of Reuben if I can't find
the<00:03:57.070> right<00:03:57.160> color<00:03:57.400> or<00:03:57.670> else<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:58.000> just<00:03:58.060> won't<00:03:58.390> use

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
the right color or else I just won't use

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.660 
the right color or else I just won't use
ribbon<00:03:58.900> rather<00:03:59.620> than<00:03:59.830> color<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.220> because<00:04:00.489> for

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
ribbon rather than color it because for

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.800 
ribbon rather than color it because for
a<00:04:00.700> full<00:04:00.880> card<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.269> amount<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.480> ribbing<00:04:01.720> you

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
a full card the amount of ribbing you

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.140 
a full card the amount of ribbing you
need<00:04:01.989> and<00:04:02.230> then<00:04:02.380> to<00:04:02.530> color<00:04:02.799> it<00:04:03.070> you're<00:04:03.820> using

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
need and then to color it you're using

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.020 
need and then to color it you're using
up<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.600> lot<00:04:04.630> of<00:04:05.230> ink<00:04:05.380> so<00:04:05.620> but<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:06.549> can<00:04:06.790> do<00:04:07.000> it

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
up a lot of ink so but you can do it

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.470 
up a lot of ink so but you can do it
keep<00:04:07.750> in<00:04:07.900> mind<00:04:07.930> though<00:04:08.290> with<00:04:09.220> ribbon<00:04:09.640> because

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
keep in mind though with ribbon because

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.670 
keep in mind though with ribbon because
of<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.780> way<00:04:10.900> it's<00:04:11.049> weaved<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.620> can<00:04:13.170> bleed<00:04:14.170> or

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
of the way it's weaved it can bleed or

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.330 
of the way it's weaved it can bleed or
smear<00:04:16.290> it<00:04:17.290> just<00:04:17.680> depends<00:04:18.010> on<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.160> type<00:04:18.310> of

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
smear it just depends on the type of

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.830 
smear it just depends on the type of
ribbon<00:04:18.760> but<00:04:19.630> one<00:04:19.989> like<00:04:20.169> this<00:04:20.350> this<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:21.840> just

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
ribbon but one like this this is a just

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.779 
ribbon but one like this this is a just
a<00:04:22.930> white<00:04:23.169> satin<00:04:23.650> ribbon<00:04:23.919> you<00:04:24.160> can<00:04:24.220> actually<00:04:24.460> do

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
a white satin ribbon you can actually do

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.850 
a white satin ribbon you can actually do
rather<00:04:25.630> than<00:04:25.750> color<00:04:26.050> in<00:04:26.229> all<00:04:26.349> the<00:04:26.500> ribbon<00:04:26.740> you

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
rather than color in all the ribbon you

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.180 
rather than color in all the ribbon you
could<00:04:27.010> do<00:04:27.130> like<00:04:27.310> stripes<00:04:27.789> like<00:04:28.120> this

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
could do like stripes like this

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.330 
could do like stripes like this
just<00:04:31.190> color<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.610> edges<00:04:32.830> however<00:04:33.830> like<00:04:34.069> i<00:04:34.160> said

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
just color the edges however like i said

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.730 
just color the edges however like i said
and<00:04:34.460> i<00:04:34.550> can<00:04:34.699> already<00:04:34.819> see<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.300> it's<00:04:35.870> starting

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
and i can already see it it's starting

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.070 
and i can already see it it's starting
to<00:04:37.090> bleed<00:04:38.090> i<00:04:38.360> don't<00:04:38.509> know<00:04:38.599> if<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.750> can<00:04:38.870> tell<00:04:39.020> on

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
to bleed i don't know if you can tell on

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.629 
to bleed i don't know if you can tell on
camera<00:04:39.319> but<00:04:39.560> it's<00:04:39.710> starting<00:04:40.039> to<00:04:40.160> bleed<00:04:40.400> down

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
camera but it's starting to bleed down

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.999 
camera but it's starting to bleed down
so<00:04:41.479> right<00:04:41.630> there<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:41.990> just<00:04:42.169> that<00:04:42.500> bothers<00:04:42.860> me

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
so right there that just that bothers me

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.409 
so right there that just that bothers me
i<00:04:43.039> would<00:04:43.250> want<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.520> use<00:04:43.610> this<00:04:43.729> on<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:43.910> project

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
i would want to use this on a project

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.450 
i would want to use this on a project
plus<00:04:45.199> the<00:04:45.380> other<00:04:45.470> side<00:04:45.710> isn't<00:04:45.889> as<00:04:46.069> good<00:04:46.220> so

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
plus the other side isn't as good so

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.740 
plus the other side isn't as good so
when<00:04:46.610> you<00:04:46.699> want<00:04:46.849> to<00:04:46.940> go<00:04:47.030> in<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:47.270> fill<00:04:47.509> in<00:04:47.630> the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
when you want to go in and fill in the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.170 
when you want to go in and fill in the
other<00:04:47.870> side<00:04:48.110> it's<00:04:48.319> just<00:04:48.470> going<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.650> bleed<00:04:48.830> more

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
other side it's just going to bleed more

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.059 
other side it's just going to bleed more
so<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.240> would<00:04:50.569> want<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.810> color<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.199> like<00:04:51.860> all

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069 
so you would want to color in like all

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.260 
so you would want to color in like all
the<00:04:52.220> ribbon<00:04:52.660> but<00:04:53.660> with<00:04:54.050> ribbon<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:55.520> does<00:04:55.940> it

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
the ribbon but with ribbon it does it

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.909 
the ribbon but with ribbon it does it
takes<00:04:56.569> a<00:04:56.930> lot<00:04:57.590> more<00:04:57.620> effort<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:59.840> get<00:05:00.259> all<00:05:00.710> the

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
takes a lot more effort to get all the

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.310 
takes a lot more effort to get all the
color<00:05:01.130> on<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:02.720> can<00:05:02.840> also<00:05:02.960> make<00:05:03.199> the

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
color on that it can also make the

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.740 
color on that it can also make the
ribbon<00:05:03.560> stiffer<00:05:04.550> once<00:05:04.789> it's<00:05:04.970> absorbed<00:05:05.570> all

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
ribbon stiffer once it's absorbed all

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.610 
ribbon stiffer once it's absorbed all
the<00:05:05.780> ink<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:07.030> honestly<00:05:08.030> i'm<00:05:08.479> not<00:05:08.539> a<00:05:09.380> big<00:05:09.590> fan

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
the ink and honestly i'm not a big fan

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.260 
the ink and honestly i'm not a big fan
of<00:05:09.830> it<00:05:10.039> but<00:05:10.400> i<00:05:10.430> suppose<00:05:10.639> if<00:05:10.849> you<00:05:10.910> had<00:05:10.940> a<00:05:11.030> little

of it but i suppose if you had a little

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.450 
of it but i suppose if you had a little
project<00:05:11.900> you<00:05:12.199> wanted<00:05:12.470> you<00:05:12.620> needed<00:05:12.979> a<00:05:13.039> specific
