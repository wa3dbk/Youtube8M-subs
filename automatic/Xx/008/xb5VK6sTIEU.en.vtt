00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello friends how are you I hope you are very 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.730
 well this is a super special brownie 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.899
 with a secret ingredient that I'm going to 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.899
 say in the middle of the video 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
 but 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.600
 The first thing we are going to do is melt 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.579
 the chocolate sparks with the 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.199
 butter in the microwave for 30 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.160
 seconds this step can also 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.160
 make a bain marie 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.740
 now let's beat the eggs and the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.310
 sugar until you bleach and get that 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.310
 double the volume 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.040
 now we add chocolate 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.460
 melted with the butter and we return 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.460
 to beat 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.790
 now we are going to sift the flour the cocoa 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.790
 and the baking powder 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.539
 ah 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.610
 and now the mysterious ingredient 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.320
 it's just beetroot even if I do not 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.420
 I think what he says was to listen to 2 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.580
 beets peel and puree 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.590
 then squeeze it very well with a 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.720
 strainer to remove all the water and the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.730
 we integrate chocolate the brownie is not going 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.650
 to be flavored with beet is what 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.830
 what he's going to do is enhance the taste of 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.830
 chocolate 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.690
 We emptied the mixture into a mold of 23 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.640
 centimeters and we take the oven for 25 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.640
 200 degrees Celsius 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.430
 do the test to d'hebron and with the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.990
 beet they give to their friends and their 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.030
 family and do not tell them what it is that 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.240
 they have assure you that neither account are going 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.240
 to give 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.740
