00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.389
 Hi, honey! 

00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.951
 Girls step into puberty, chest development is the only way 

00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:07.299
 Some things you might want to know 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:15.814
 Today, we discuss how we face development and tell parents to buy a bust. 

00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:19.198
 The girl’s development period is too early for the boy 

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:24.040
 About 9 to 14 years old, when you step into puberty 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.408
 What will happen? 

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:30.457
 The hormone we secrete in our body, the chest begins to develop 

00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:39.354
 And the breast tissue will become particularly sensitive, and it will cause discomfort or pain if it is slightly stimulated and collided. 

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:45.701
 If a student collides with his elbow, it will not hurt! 

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:55.667
 What can I do? You can choose to buy a girl's underwear, which is a half-cut type. 

00:00:55.667 --> 00:01:00.941
 Like sports underwear, but it’s different 

00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:08.897
 Wear girls underwear for support and protection 

00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:12.873
 However, its protection is not high, and it can cause pain if there is a collision. 

00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:19.949
 Second, how do you tell your parents that you need to buy a bust? 

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:21.651
 I suggest you tell mom 

00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:26.644
 Because she knows better, and we won’t 

00:01:26.644 --> 00:01:29.692
 A long time ago, I told my mother directly. 

00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:35.250
 "I am developing, it is better to buy girl underwear." 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.396
 Of course, everyone can be indirect, if you dare not speak. 

00:01:40.408 --> 00:01:44.632
 Indirect... just... 

00:01:44.632 --> 00:01:51.199
 Mom, my friend has girl underwear, do I need it? 

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:53.780
 I seem to be developing too. 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.229
 Mom, my chest seems a bit strange, why is it painful? 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.547
 I hope she will understand (laugh) 

00:02:04.547 --> 00:02:13.067
 If you have a better way, please leave a message to me, I believe you will have a better way 

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:16.376
 Similarly, you can also take a look at the message and learn about other methods. 

00:02:16.376 --> 00:02:18.358
 Also, bust 

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:21.945
 With development, the chest will (hopefully) become more and more full. 

00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:30.037
 I am no longer satisfied with girl underwear, but need a bust with a steel ring 

00:02:30.037 --> 00:02:35.530
 Those chests have a measure, that is, A, B, C, D... 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.640
 But what is the number in front of the letter? What is it? 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.285
 Suppose you are 70B 

00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:52.926
 70cm is the chest circumference, B is the chest circumference minus the chest circumference 

00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:59.840
 The remainder is representative of different Cups 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.581
 Each Cup is increased by 2.5cm 

00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:12.104
 32C? What is 32? 

00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:15.831
 70C=32C 

00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:19.534
 It’s just the difference of the unit 

00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:24.542
 I suggest that you use the tape measure to be more accurate. 

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:28.278
 And when measuring, don’t want a bigger bust, but special 

00:03:28.278 --> 00:03:30.934
 (Inhale...) Come on! 

00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:36.469
 No! Because you can't maintain this situation all day long. 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.422
 So measure when breathing calmly 

00:03:39.422 --> 00:03:44.821
 Girls have a good and bad stage when they step into puberty 

00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:49.517
 I hope this little share can help 

00:03:49.517 --> 00:03:53.783
 If you have any questions, please let me know in the message. 

00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:57.352
 Or have any mistakes, please advise 

00:03:57.352 --> 00:04:00.013
 I hope you can give me a Like, bye!
