00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.359
 a team that decided to beat 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.949
 Bordeaux who returned equal 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.449

 followed and finally ryan has just flattened 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.649

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.070
 pressure in this encounter to the image 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.260
 of this hanging has shifted chalmers 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.749
 players that we find in this 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.790
 mold in this the balloon carried organized 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:06.890
 by the Bordeaux people everyone will go 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.570
 on the ground arm extended again from 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.490
 referee advantage in course so for the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.140
 bordelais an advantage that will play 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.130
 maybe he alone to ennahdha this 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.420
 little kick over for 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.299
 surprise the Bayonne defense 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.070
 but Marvin O'Connor sweat saves her 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.890
 team we come back to this penalty 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.060
 successful by federico sanchez holder 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.680
 today the place of lopez 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.840
 he equalizes so for this team 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.520
 Bordeaux a lot of fighting it was said 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.140
 but little game at the beginning of the match 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.729
 may be because of the wind support 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.380
 a lot of mistakes also here mark 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.030
 chisholm and destabilize in the air 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.649
 the arbitrator intervenes immediately and 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.980
 sanction the second Bordeaux 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.360
 adam jaulhac 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.360
 you think of this gentleman 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.560
 reduced to fourteen and despite a 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.850
 new penalty bayonne bordeaux 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.470
 is far from sinking 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.000
 heini adams here escapes into the closed 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.560
 he is stopped a few centimeters from 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.640
 the line was boula which was well followed 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.210
 seize this balloon and seems to flatten 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.090
 behind the line he managed to score 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.530
 this test is there or not and it's 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.570
 all that is the question that the referees 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.330
 sir minery will ask his referee 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.790
 video 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.920
 and in slow motion and well we'll see that your 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.990
 balls flattened perfectly this test 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.430
 this test can be validated it is the 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.690
 first of the meeting and allows 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.320
 this Bordeaux team to take 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.240
 the advantage 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.220
 federico sanchez is getting ready to 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.320
 try the transformation but the wind 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.240
 who blew here drops the ball 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.650
 repeatedly the scorer then 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.720
 ask for help from his coach 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.180
 assistant ludovic loustau who did 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.620
 absolutely not allowed to touch the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.880
 balloon it's the rule he can not 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.620
 touch the ball and so the 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.630
 transformation is obviously canceled 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.090
 two points stupidly left en route 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.220
 while he benjamin boyer managed a 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.930
 last penalty before half time a 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.730
 third penalty passed by the opener 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.130
 Bayonne bayonne who takes the advantage 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.570
 9 to 8 at the break and that seems to 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.070
 new healthy in the image of 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.020
 christophe deylaud who was operated on 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.970
 recently a broken hip 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.709
 christophe deylaud disgruntled 40o years 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.780
 locker room and well sanchez adds 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.670
 three points on this drop the team of 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.670
 burgundy then leads 11 to 9 may bordeaux 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.020
 as often and too often penalized 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.970
 succession of faults in front of the line 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.470
 in-goal and yellow card addressed to 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.330
 pillars head of a decline again 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.590
 this Bordeaux team will have to play 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.660
 at 14 against 15 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.100
 benjamin boyer takes advantage of this box 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.380
 yellow he will even benefit from another to 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.269
 mistakes to register six more points 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.010
 in favor of this Bayonne writing which 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.410
 then leads from game 15 to 11 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.120
 a mini-break of water will use the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.400
 bayonnais to finally start 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.780
