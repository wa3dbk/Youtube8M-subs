00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello guys I hope you are very 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.580
 well today's video is missing voted 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.830
 for you and they asked me please 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.410
 make a video of what it means with the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.360
 boy that you like looks at you a lot but 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.710
 when you see it, whether it's cement 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.310
 and it was not good for you, no option and it has 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.240
 smiled then if you are 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.880
 intrigued by that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.980
 here are all I think about this 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 video ok the first thing I think is that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 Well, it has happened to me many times 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.250
 that the guys look good and then 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.320
 you see them and then you do this and then the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.390
 guy is like he did not give you then 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.280
 I have had several situations 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.899
 first time obviously obviously if 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.579
 he likes you because nothing chavos 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.860
 you will be seeing nothing else because 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.590
 yes especially men a woman is 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.289
 a little more critical and things for the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.090
 style but but men are more 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.379
 as the point then I the truth 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.730
 I feel that if the boy keeps you 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.320
 watching a lot is because I really 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.809
 you like 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.180
 but there are two small circumstances that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.579
 I at least I in my experience when 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.770
 cancel with guys and things if I happened 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.210
 the first is that the boy likes it 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.559
 it is but it is very shy and does not love you 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.190
 talk then what I give you 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.190
 I would recommend 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.140
 and it's the same I made a little more open 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.270
 like 7 and you also like the boy 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.460
 then you can continue to say hello 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.230
 hello or you start to greet him little by little 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.090
 you saw that he saw you smile at him is the 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.040
 president of the ebb and you know the volley 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.320
 cs5 in the biggest e intel and I did alone and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.360
 little by little they begin to talk that is 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.700
 The truth is that it is very easy to break the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.550
 ice once you already put on like that 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.140
 it's like you take away that barrier no longer 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.120
 you say you know that flat if I want that 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.100
 this guy look at me look at me more I started 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.390
 talk with him just the same as 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.190
 you need to be given as a 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.630
 nudge to help you get through 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.500
 realize that you feel the same 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.540
 way that the second reason or the second 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.010
 motive that happened to me every time 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.080
 I was listening 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.080
 he told me nothing or something like that is because the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.080
 person is already had a girlfriend then what 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.390
 what happens is what you like to see but 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.700
 at the same time he has another relationship 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.140
 with another person and he really speaks 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.450
 good for him because he means that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.490
 never never deceive the couple with the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.080
 that is but it is bad for you because 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.750
 you already have another person in you too 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.510
 like then is 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.840
 the two reasons why I think 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.690
 that maybe this guy has not spoken to you 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.250
 It is still because he is very shy or because 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.900
 He has another relationship but he likes to see you 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.870
 and you are very pretty 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.180
 in their eyes then that's are the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.459
 only two opinions or what to me 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.440
 happened when I went out with a person was 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.480
 that this person already had something or that 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.030
 you are just very shy then I 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.700
 I think that here, the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.610
 go talk to this person because he does not 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.290
 There's nothing wrong with approaching a boy 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.270
 especially if you think there is also 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.190
 feel the same for you and in second 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.989
 good place well if you have a government 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.180
 you also come out of doubts do not want 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.730
 you have a girlfriend or both 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.250
 I hope you girls help a lot this 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.410
 video is a very short video I think that 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.900
 it is a very small subject but if 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.820
 you have more questions doubts or if 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.560
