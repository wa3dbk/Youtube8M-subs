00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.060
 Then walk from now on map no 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.800
 We introduce life 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.490
 Here is ratified Lorensoration 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.649
 It is a flat polygon model 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.780
 For data of eco there 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.980
 jay-z mashed and processed data into it 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.589
 It is important to transfer using the features of 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:19.970
 I would like to come here 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.970
 You can receive specification by US file name 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.800

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800
 Suppress the living in the upper back 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.720
 This data is 1.3 million polygons 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.080
 Taipei data has been read 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 I look in the rice 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.920
 Sixty-nine 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.339
 It is very array data when you select and try to approach 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.330
 I understand that 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
 By the way move it to the side 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.780
 The data was eco 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.720
 further 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.740
 Status I would like to see if there is also coastal capture 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.730
 From within 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.700
 Display information on stretching 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.540
 Then you can see that there is a circle-limited 1.33 million polygons 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.040
 It is a city of objects at home 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 I will return to the state of the evolta 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.890
 Now select the Lorenzo data and start with January property 7 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.210
 Run the walk map 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.010
 At first 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.430

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.430
 High resolution funeral pick 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.270
 It was a result 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.390
 In addition, which map to generate 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.360
 To some extent before the flat-stated maria had been swayed ambientcclusion 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.310
 Choose something like 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.410

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.570
 At the Eco Altima Upper 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.159
 I set up a bigeye and a camera, and I'm doing calculation prototyping from it. 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.880
 It is difficult to understand the camera position at that time. 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.500
 not to mention 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.020
 This time with this version of 3 city 2 towns click on os

 Against this 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:30.569
 In these file formats and is delayed 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.679
 Go further to the 16 bit of donation-floatingpoint got 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:36.230
 US openxri 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.739
 File format 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.689
 Furthermore mentalimages are various files such as before arrest 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.469
 Supports format 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.519
 If you finish setting here, you can click on other expeditions 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.519
 To do 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.569
 Background settlement is over 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.949
 Well then 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.949
 Choose TV for Voice 3 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.919
 High resolution 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.680
 Because it is not necessary now 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.239
 I will keep this secret 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.239
 Then, it is such a display now 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.389
 Choose to create a preview here 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.210
 The same route is selected 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.210
 Hayden is looking at fishing open 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.590
 Currently Nikkei Display visits Japan 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.419
 In short, diamond has been killed by accident 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.159
 Therefore, directx and hardware 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.859
 Switch to Ecuador atx 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.859
 I will carry out a television strategy 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.519
 But I switched to the old horse that was already popular 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.179
 Realtime magazine radar density is created automatically 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.759
 This is true 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.159
 Inherit ambient 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.639
 It is a US de 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.499
 further 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.619
 Leave 0 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.619
 It will be a node that is the real-time nature that did the enemy 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:10.119
 It is part of eco-head 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.299
 There is no connection with the performance dance 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.499
 I would like to go Septeni 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.169
 Adjust the US tangent 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.169
 With the promotion section tel that lives here 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.189
 It will be possible to make adjustments with Patasen 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:39.590
 Do not go by eighty-two 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.020
 You can see that it was real-time or created
