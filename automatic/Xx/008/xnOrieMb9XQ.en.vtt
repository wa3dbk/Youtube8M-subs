00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.420 

an<00:00:13.360> exercise<00:00:14.140> we<00:00:14.350> can<00:00:14.530> take<00:00:14.710> advantage<00:00:15.280> of

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
an exercise we can take advantage of

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.730 
an exercise we can take advantage of
presets<00:00:16.090> in<00:00:16.390> order<00:00:16.869> to<00:00:16.990> save<00:00:17.290> certain

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
presets in order to save certain

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.609 
presets in order to save certain
properties<00:00:18.520> in<00:00:18.790> our<00:00:19.060> property<00:00:19.540> pages<00:00:19.780> so<00:00:20.500> we

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
properties in our property pages so we

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.620 
properties in our property pages so we
can<00:00:20.740> recycle<00:00:21.070> and<00:00:21.430> reuse<00:00:21.610> them<00:00:22.000> over<00:00:22.450> and<00:00:22.570> over

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
can recycle and reuse them over and over

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.780 
can recycle and reuse them over and over
again<00:00:22.810> without<00:00:23.619> having<00:00:23.890> to<00:00:24.040> set<00:00:24.250> them<00:00:24.460> up<00:00:24.550> from

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
again without having to set them up from

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.910 
again without having to set them up from
scratch<00:00:25.060> this<00:00:25.810> can<00:00:26.050> save<00:00:26.230> us<00:00:26.410> time<00:00:26.680> in<00:00:26.860> the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
scratch this can save us time in the

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.230 
scratch this can save us time in the
long<00:00:27.130> run<00:00:27.369> when<00:00:27.550> working<00:00:27.790> in<00:00:28.060> certain

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
long run when working in certain

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.870 
long run when working in certain
projects<00:00:28.869> in<00:00:28.960> exercise<00:00:29.470> so<00:00:30.430> let<00:00:30.610> me<00:00:30.669> show<00:00:30.790> you

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
projects in exercise so let me show you

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.540 
projects in exercise so let me show you
how<00:00:30.970> to<00:00:31.000> take<00:00:31.240> advantage<00:00:31.689> of<00:00:31.779> that<00:00:31.840> feature<00:00:32.110> of

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
how to take advantage of that feature of

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.640 
how to take advantage of that feature of
softimage<00:00:33.550> xsi<00:00:34.110> let's<00:00:35.110> go<00:00:35.260> up<00:00:35.350> here<00:00:35.560> to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
softimage xsi let's go up here to

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.400 
softimage xsi let's go up here to
primitive<00:00:35.950> in<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.610> modeling<00:00:37.000> menu<00:00:37.390> set<00:00:37.660> go<00:00:37.870> to

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
primitive in the modeling menu set go to

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.620 
primitive in the modeling menu set go to
polygon<00:00:38.739> mesh<00:00:39.250> and<00:00:39.760> we'll<00:00:39.970> create<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.300> simple

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
polygon mesh and we'll create a simple

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.350 
polygon mesh and we'll create a simple
sphere<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.610> here's<00:00:42.820> our<00:00:42.940> simple<00:00:43.120> little

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
sphere so here's our simple little

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.810 
sphere so here's our simple little
sphere<00:00:43.720> with<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.020> default<00:00:44.680> grey<00:00:45.039> fog<00:00:45.399> shader

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
sphere with the default grey fog shader

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.029 
sphere with the default grey fog shader
let's<00:00:46.539> apply<00:00:46.840> material<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.500> this<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.739> change

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
let's apply material to this to change

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.410 
let's apply material to this to change
it<00:00:48.190> up<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.399> bit<00:00:49.019> let's<00:00:50.019> go<00:00:50.109> to<00:00:50.170> material<00:00:51.420> click

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
it up a bit let's go to material click

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.560 
it up a bit let's go to material click
on<00:00:52.600> Phong<00:00:52.929> this<00:00:53.920> applies<00:00:54.340> a<00:00:54.370> new<00:00:54.670> fog<00:00:54.940> material

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
on Phong this applies a new fog material

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.290 
on Phong this applies a new fog material
on<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:56.199> sphere<00:00:56.500> we<00:00:56.620> created<00:00:57.129> let's<00:00:58.000> change

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
on the sphere we created let's change

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.619 
on the sphere we created let's change
the<00:00:58.480> color<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.019> sort<00:01:02.410> of<00:01:02.589> purple<00:01:03.629> maybe

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
the color to a sort of purple maybe

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.930 
the color to a sort of purple maybe
change<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.080> specular<00:01:05.620> just<00:01:06.550> picking<00:01:06.850> a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
change the specular just picking a

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.100 
change the specular just picking a
random<00:01:07.090> color<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:08.970> okay<00:01:09.970> so<00:01:10.690> there's<00:01:11.020> our

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
random color here okay so there's our

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.370 
random color here okay so there's our
purple<00:01:11.980> material<00:01:12.400> here<00:01:12.520> for<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.850> grape<00:01:13.380> well

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
purple material here for a grape well

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.680 
purple material here for a grape well
let's<00:01:14.950> go<00:01:15.130> up<00:01:15.190> here<00:01:15.370> to<00:01:15.520> this<00:01:15.610> folder<00:01:16.060> icon<00:01:16.480> and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
let's go up here to this folder icon and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.140 
let's go up here to this folder icon and
if<00:01:17.620> you<00:01:17.650> left<00:01:17.950> click<00:01:18.190> left<00:01:18.760> mouse<00:01:18.910> button

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
if you left click left mouse button

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.350 
if you left click left mouse button
click<00:01:19.810> on<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.590> get<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.800> submenu<00:01:21.550> and<00:01:21.670> you

click on it you get a submenu and you
have<00:01:22.510> two<00:01:22.690> options<00:01:23.200> we<00:01:23.350> can<00:01:23.500> load<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.740> preset

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
have two options we can load a preset

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.030 
have two options we can load a preset
which<00:01:24.880> we<00:01:25.150> don't<00:01:25.300> have<00:01:25.450> or<00:01:26.110> we<00:01:26.620> can<00:01:26.770> save<00:01:27.010> a

material and click on OK now let's close

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.810 
material and click on OK now let's close
that<00:02:01.390> property<00:02:02.170> page<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:02.740> with<00:02:03.220> this<00:02:03.400> Fears

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
that property page and with this Fears

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.780 
that property page and with this Fears
still<00:02:04.210> selected<00:02:04.810> let's<00:02:05.620> go<00:02:05.830> back<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.250> material

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
still selected let's go back to material

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.900 
still selected let's go back to material
and<00:02:06.940> apply<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.750> new<00:02:07.780> Phong<00:02:08.349> material<00:02:08.910> that's

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
and apply a new Phong material that's

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.670 
and apply a new Phong material that's
going<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.209> create<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.599> new<00:02:10.840> default<00:02:11.319> Phong

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
going to create a new default Phong

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.160 
going to create a new default Phong
which<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.700> be<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.910> simple<00:02:13.239> bland<00:02:13.690> gray

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
which is going to be a simple bland gray
