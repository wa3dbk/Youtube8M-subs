painters<00:00:43.620> tape<00:00:43.770> would<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> ideal<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.760> to

painters tape would be the ideal one to
use<00:00:46.160> place<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> tape<00:00:47.460> where<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> want<00:00:47.940> the

use place the tape where you want the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.959 
use place the tape where you want the
lines<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.219> then<00:00:50.219> make<00:00:50.460> sure<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
lines to be and then make sure that you

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.700 
lines to be and then make sure that you
burnish<00:00:51.300> or<00:00:51.449> smooth<00:00:51.719> down<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> edges<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
tape using your finger or nail so it's

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.959 
tape using your finger or nail so it's
flat<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.320> flush<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> surface<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.910> is

flat and flush with the surface this is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.760 
flat and flush with the surface this is
important<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.750> none<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.410> paint

using again a flat ended brush right
into<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.790> tape<00:01:06.000> line<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.500> way<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.240> gesso

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
into the tape line so that way the gesso

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420 
into the tape line so that way the gesso
might<00:01:10.080> seep<00:01:10.470> through<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.830> tape<00:01:11.159> if

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
might seep through the tape if

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.280 
might seep through the tape if
anything's<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> seep<00:01:12.600> through<00:01:12.630> you're

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
anything's going to seep through you're

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.560 
anything's going to seep through you're
going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> want<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> gesso<00:01:14.580> instead

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
going to want it to be the gesso instead

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.179 
going to want it to be the gesso instead
of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> paint<00:01:16.020> you're<00:01:16.140> using<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.979> much

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
of the paint you're using it's much

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.530 
of the paint you're using it's much
better<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.909> seep<00:01:18.270> through<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
better to have this seep through the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.450 
better to have this seep through the
tape<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> way<00:01:19.650> there'll<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.920> no<00:01:20.159> room<00:01:20.430> for

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460

tape so that way there'll be no room for
the<00:01:20.909> new<00:01:21.060> color<00:01:21.299> you'll<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.630> adding<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.110> seep

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the new color you'll be adding to seep

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.190 
the new color you'll be adding to seep
through<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.220> bleed<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> line<00:01:23.990> once<00:01:24.990> your

should<00:03:18.990> dry<00:03:19.170> clear<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:20.340> if<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:20.670> does<00:03:20.820> bleed

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060

get to apply a new color paint here you
going<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.100> want<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.340> make<00:03:35.490> sure<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.970> you've

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
going to want to make sure that you've

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.510 
going to want to make sure that you've
considered<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.870> page<00:03:37.080> opacity<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:38.010> this

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
considered the page opacity in this

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.700 
considered the page opacity in this
example<00:03:38.850> I'm<00:03:39.120> using<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.480> blue<00:03:39.750> paint<00:03:39.990> on<00:03:40.320> top<00:03:40.560> of

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
example I'm using a blue paint on top of

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.950 
example I'm using a blue paint on top of
the<00:03:40.830> red<00:03:41.010> opposed<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.180> use<00:03:42.300> yellow<00:03:42.510> instead

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
the red opposed to use yellow instead

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.410 
the red opposed to use yellow instead
the<00:03:43.560> red<00:03:43.770> triangle<00:03:44.730> would<00:03:44.880> show<00:03:45.060> up<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.300> lot

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
the red triangle would show up a lot

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.140 
the red triangle would show up a lot
easier<00:03:45.810> but<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.770> blues<00:03:47.010> darker<00:03:47.460> is<00:03:47.670> able<00:03:48.030> to

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
easier but the blues darker is able to

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.840 
easier but the blues darker is able to
cover<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:49.080> lighter<00:03:49.440> color<00:03:49.770> looks<00:03:50.400> like<00:03:50.490> our

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
cover the lighter color looks like our

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.720 
cover the lighter color looks like our
images<00:03:51.600> turned<00:03:51.840> out<00:03:52.020> great<00:03:52.220> it's<00:03:53.220> important

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
images turned out great it's important

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.310 
images turned out great it's important
to<00:03:53.790> remember<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.540> hard<00:03:54.780> edge<00:03:54.900> matching

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
to remember the hard edge matching

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.050 
to remember the hard edge matching
requires<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.890> spend<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.190> lot<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.400> time<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.910> it

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
requires you spend a lot of time on it

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.180 
requires you spend a lot of time on it
so<00:03:57.510> make<00:03:57.690> sure<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.320> don't<00:03:58.500> rush<00:03:58.710> enter

patiently work
it's<00:04:01.390> also<00:04:01.600> important<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:02.410> take<00:04:02.590> the

it's also important that you take the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.680 
it's also important that you take the

protective coat such as the gesso in the
clear<00:04:04.870> medium<00:04:05.260> seriously<00:04:05.860> it's<00:04:06.580> a<00:04:06.700> lot<00:04:06.850> easier

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
clear medium seriously it's a lot easier

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.850 
clear medium seriously it's a lot easier
to<00:04:07.390> do<00:04:07.510> this<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.930> first<00:04:07.960> time<00:04:08.410> then<00:04:08.710> to<00:04:08.800> have
