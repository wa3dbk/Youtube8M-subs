00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
of a lot of choice with this figure I

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.720 
of a lot of choice with this figure I
guess<00:02:58.860> you're<00:02:59.070> supposed<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> have<00:02:59.550> these

I kind of like having them down they
give<00:03:03.690> them<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> more<00:03:04.110> filled<00:03:04.500> out<00:03:04.650> look<00:03:04.890> kind<00:03:05.820> of

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
give them a more filled out look kind of

a<00:03:05.970> Martian<00:03:06.210> like<00:03:06.840> shoulder<00:03:07.230> pad<00:03:07.470> type<00:03:07.710> of<00:03:07.890> look

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
a Martian like shoulder pad type of look

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.070 
a Martian like shoulder pad type of look
I<00:03:08.250> like<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.760> lot<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.630> terms<00:03:09.870> of

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
I like that a lot in terms of

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.590 
I like that a lot in terms of
articulation<00:03:10.950> we<00:03:11.340> have<00:03:11.610> like<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.240> said<00:03:12.420> the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
articulation we have like I said the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.380 
articulation we have like I said the
shoulder<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.860> cockpit<00:03:14.460> Park<00:03:14.910> moves<00:03:15.090> up<00:03:15.240> and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
shoulder the cockpit Park moves up and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.940 
shoulder the cockpit Park moves up and
down<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.930> children<00:03:16.260> moves<00:03:16.410> within<00:03:16.620> that

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
down and the children moves within that

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.199 
down and the children moves within that
it<00:03:17.820> does<00:03:18.030> rotate<00:03:18.300> there<00:03:19.520> he's<00:03:20.520> got<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> swivel

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
it does rotate there he's got a swivel

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.620 
it does rotate there he's got a swivel
their<00:03:21.450> elbow<00:03:22.260> joint<00:03:22.620> as<00:03:22.860> normal<00:03:23.820> that's<00:03:24.390> about

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
their elbow joint as normal that's about

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.840 
their elbow joint as normal that's about
it<00:03:24.690> his<00:03:25.110> hands<00:03:25.440> move<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.770> little<00:03:25.920> bit<00:03:26.070> but

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
it his hands move a little bit but

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.300 
it his hands move a little bit but
that's<00:03:27.000> mostly<00:03:27.270> for<00:03:28.190> transformation<00:03:29.190> you're

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
that's mostly for transformation you're

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.380 
that's mostly for transformation you're
probably<00:03:29.459> not<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.850> use<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.180> whole

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
probably not going to use that a whole

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.380 
probably not going to use that a whole
lot<00:03:30.570> no<00:03:31.260> wrist<00:03:31.560> rotation<00:03:31.770> but<00:03:32.520> that's<00:03:32.820> okay<00:03:33.120> if

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
lot no wrist rotation but that's okay if

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.750 
lot no wrist rotation but that's okay if
you<00:03:33.540> want<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.959> bring<00:03:34.590> his<00:03:34.770> arm<00:03:34.950> forward<00:03:35.490> and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
you want to bring his arm forward and

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.810 
you want to bring his arm forward and
rotate<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.450> like<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.930> at<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.830> bicep<00:03:38.310> really

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
rotate it like that at the bicep really

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.740 
rotate it like that at the bicep really
not<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.000> problem<00:03:40.130> head<00:03:41.130> rotates<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:42.000> looks<00:03:42.600> up

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
not a problem head rotates and looks up

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.360 
not a problem head rotates and looks up
and<00:03:42.900> down<00:03:43.110> just<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.530> little<00:03:43.709> bit<00:03:43.830> he<00:03:44.130> doesn't

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
and down just a little bit he doesn't

transformation you can't bend them up at

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.220 
transformation you can't bend them up at
all<00:04:29.120> he'll<00:04:30.120> moves<00:04:30.389> a<00:04:30.480> little<00:04:30.630> bit<00:04:30.870> but<00:04:31.110> it

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
all he'll moves a little bit but it

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.840 
all he'll moves a little bit but it
doesn't<00:04:31.500> really<00:04:31.620> help<00:04:31.980> so<00:04:32.280> there's<00:04:32.669> not<00:04:32.790> a

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
doesn't really help so there's not a

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.000 
doesn't really help so there's not a
whole<00:04:33.030> lot<00:04:33.090> of<00:04:33.210> foot<00:04:33.449> articulation<00:04:34.139> one<00:04:34.800> thing

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
whole lot of foot articulation one thing

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.170 
whole lot of foot articulation one thing
you'll<00:04:35.130> have<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.340> watch<00:04:35.460> out<00:04:35.669> for<00:04:35.699> these

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
you'll have to watch out for these

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.240 
you'll have to watch out for these
pieces<00:04:36.510> right<00:04:36.810> here<00:04:36.870> they<00:04:37.530> pop<00:04:37.800> back<00:04:37.830> in

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
pieces right here they pop back in

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.050 
pieces right here they pop back in
you're<00:04:38.400> supposed<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.669> leave<00:04:38.790> them<00:04:38.940> out<00:04:39.030> for

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
you're supposed to leave them out for

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.000 
you're supposed to leave them out for
robot<00:04:39.540> mode<00:04:39.750> but<00:04:40.020> they<00:04:40.440> popped<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.830> real

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
robot mode but they popped in real

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.400 
robot mode but they popped in real
easily<00:04:41.190> well<00:04:41.669> you<00:04:41.760> can<00:04:41.910> do<00:04:42.060> though<00:04:42.270> not<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.199> big

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
easily well you can do though not a big

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.790 
easily well you can do though not a big
deal<00:04:43.650> just<00:04:44.190> push<00:04:44.400> back<00:04:44.669> forward<00:04:45.350> they<00:04:46.350> do<00:04:46.530> snap

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
deal just push back forward they do snap

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.140 
deal just push back forward they do snap
in<00:04:47.010> place<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:47.520> you're<00:04:47.669> not<00:04:47.760> just<00:04:47.820> going<00:04:48.060> to

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
in place so you're not just going to

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.689 
in place so you're not just going to
bump<00:04:48.360> them<00:04:48.510> probably<00:04:48.930> but<00:04:49.290> if<00:04:49.530> you're<00:04:50.460> posing

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
bump them probably but if you're posing

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.310 
bump them probably but if you're posing
them<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.000> lot<00:04:51.210> you'll<00:04:51.389> probably<00:04:51.570> end<00:04:51.900> up<00:04:52.020> having

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
them a lot you'll probably end up having

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
them a lot you'll probably end up having
to<00:04:52.380> pull<00:04:52.530> him<00:04:52.620> back<00:04:52.770> out<00:04:52.919> a<00:04:52.979> few<00:04:53.220> different

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
to pull him back out a few different

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
to pull him back out a few different
times<00:04:54.560> there<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:55.680> go<00:04:55.860> he<00:04:56.729> really<00:04:56.940> doesn't

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
times there you go he really doesn't

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.879 
times there you go he really doesn't
have<00:04:57.389> a<00:04:57.510> backpack<00:04:57.810> just<00:04:58.229> these<00:04:58.410> two<00:04:58.620> thin
