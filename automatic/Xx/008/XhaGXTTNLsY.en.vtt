it difficult for it to collect itself in
the<00:00:31.900> jump<00:00:32.199> and<00:00:32.470> in<00:00:32.860> its<00:00:33.010> canter<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:34.000> that's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
the jump and in its canter and that's

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.380 
the jump and in its canter and that's
what<00:00:34.809> we<00:00:34.960> want<00:00:35.170> to<00:00:35.260> show<00:00:35.559> in<00:00:35.739> this<00:00:35.949> exercise

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.410 
what we want to show in this exercise
how<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.449> train<00:00:37.960> it's<00:00:38.199> over<00:00:38.620> line<00:00:38.800> as<00:00:39.129> in<00:00:39.760> how<00:00:40.269> it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
how to train it's over line as in how it

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.869 
how to train it's over line as in how it
sticks<00:00:40.750> out<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.170> head<00:00:41.379> and<00:00:41.620> uses<00:00:42.430> its<00:00:42.610> back

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
sticks out the head and uses its back

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.970 
sticks out the head and uses its back
get<00:00:43.600> it<00:00:43.720> to<00:00:43.839> bring<00:00:44.050> up<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.350> back<00:00:44.559> in<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.829> air

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
get it to bring up the back in the air

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.760 
get it to bring up the back in the air
and<00:00:45.280> in<00:00:45.610> that<00:00:45.790> way<00:00:46.030> also<00:00:46.390> collect<00:00:47.110> itself<00:00:47.530> and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
and in that way also collect itself and

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.670 
and in that way also collect itself and
get<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.399> better<00:00:48.730> take<00:00:49.059> off<00:00:49.239> Camilla<00:00:50.170> will<00:00:50.469> now

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
get a better take off Camilla will now

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.430 
get a better take off Camilla will now
ride<00:00:51.010> in<00:00:51.250> in<00:00:51.820> canter<00:00:52.449> and<00:00:52.629> we<00:00:52.989> can<00:00:53.140> see<00:00:53.410> that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
ride in in canter and we can see that

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.709 
ride in in canter and we can see that
the<00:00:53.710> horse<00:00:53.980> slowly<00:00:54.399> increases<00:00:55.090> its<00:00:55.239> canter

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719

towards<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.559> obstacle<00:00:56.770> as<00:00:57.730> it's<00:00:58.000> difficult

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
towards the obstacle as it's difficult

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.110 
towards the obstacle as it's difficult
for<00:00:58.690> it<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:58.930> collect<00:00:59.230> itself<00:00:59.739> we<00:01:00.489> can<00:01:00.640> see<00:01:00.699> how

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
for it to collect itself we can see how

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.959 
for it to collect itself we can see how
it<00:01:01.269> jumps<00:01:01.629> using<00:01:02.350> its<00:01:02.500> body<00:01:02.739> and<00:01:03.010> handles<00:01:03.820> the

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
it jumps using its body and handles the

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.469 
it jumps using its body and handles the
line<00:01:04.180> well<00:01:04.509> land<00:01:05.350> in<00:01:05.590> canter<00:01:06.220> left<00:01:06.640> lead<00:01:06.940> after

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
line well land in canter left lead after

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.410 
line well land in canter left lead after
which<00:01:07.899> it<00:01:08.110> crosses<00:01:08.350> over<00:01:08.649> to<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.039> right<00:01:09.420> what

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
which it crosses over to the right what

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.419 
which it crosses over to the right what
can<00:01:10.720> be<00:01:10.899> a<00:01:10.929> bit<00:01:11.170> dangerous<00:01:11.410> for<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:11.950> rider<00:01:12.160> in

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
can be a bit dangerous for the rider in

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.210 
can be a bit dangerous for the rider in
this<00:01:12.580> line<00:01:12.880> is<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.810> rider<00:01:14.080> easily<00:01:14.830> ends

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
this line is that the rider easily ends

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.969 
this line is that the rider easily ends
up<00:01:15.340> out<00:01:15.550> towards<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.390> ears<00:01:16.660> as<00:01:17.050> we<00:01:17.410> see<00:01:17.679> here

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
up out towards the ears as we see here

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.760

pulls up the heels and stands too far

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.040 
pulls up the heels and stands too far
ahead<00:01:20.920> that<00:01:21.759> will<00:01:22.090> put<00:01:22.300> strain<00:01:22.660> on<00:01:22.690> the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
ahead that will put strain on the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.290 
ahead that will put strain on the
horse's<00:01:23.500> upper<00:01:23.920> body<00:01:24.160> which<00:01:24.759> will<00:01:24.940> make<00:01:25.149> it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
horse's upper body which will make it

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.240 
horse's upper body which will make it
more<00:01:25.599> difficult<00:01:25.810> for<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.530> jump<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.069> line

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
more difficult for it to jump the line

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.660 
more difficult for it to jump the line
we<00:01:28.240> can<00:01:28.390> also<00:01:28.569> see<00:01:29.050> that<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.500> rider<00:01:29.740> is<00:01:30.130> up<00:01:30.340> on

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
we can also see that the rider is up on

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.260 
we can also see that the rider is up on
the<00:01:30.849> toes<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.890> important<00:01:33.550> that<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:34.000> rider

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
the toes it's important that the rider

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.749 
the toes it's important that the rider
has<00:01:34.720> his<00:01:34.899> point<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.349> balance<00:01:35.619> straight<00:01:36.340> above

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
has his point of balance straight above

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.479 
has his point of balance straight above
the<00:01:36.940> horse<00:01:37.179> that<00:01:38.110> his<00:01:38.289> behind<00:01:38.709> is<00:01:38.979> free<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.369> the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:39.489 
the horse that his behind is free of the

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:42.029 
the horse that his behind is free of the
saddle<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.030> presses<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.140> heels<00:01:41.410> down<00:01:41.679> well

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
saddle and presses the heels down well

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.120 
saddle and presses the heels down well
when<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.149> rider<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.660> sitting<00:01:43.959> correctly<00:01:44.229> will

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
when the rider is sitting correctly will

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.790 
when the rider is sitting correctly will
see<00:01:45.429> that<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.700> horse<00:01:45.970> can<00:01:46.450> jump<00:01:46.780> more<00:01:47.259> easily

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
see that the horse can jump more easily

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.550 
see that the horse can jump more easily
and<00:01:47.979> freely<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.849> front<00:01:49.119> and<00:01:49.390> jump<00:01:50.140> upwards

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
and freely in the front and jump upwards

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.300 
and freely in the front and jump upwards
like<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.929> as<00:01:52.929> it's<00:01:53.259> only<00:01:53.470> four<00:01:53.830> years<00:01:53.979> old

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
like that as it's only four years old

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.430 
like that as it's only four years old
and<00:01:54.610> even<00:01:55.420> though<00:01:55.599> we're<00:01:55.780> at<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.989> end<00:01:56.140> of<00:01:56.319> the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
and even though we're at the end of the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.130 
and even though we're at the end of the
year<00:01:56.709> now<00:01:56.920> we<00:01:57.700> don't<00:01:57.970> let<00:01:58.149> these<00:01:58.300> horses<00:01:58.810> jump

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
year now we don't let these horses jump

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.619 
year now we don't let these horses jump
a<00:01:59.259> lot<00:01:59.410> we<00:02:00.310> try<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.640> strengthen<00:02:01.060> them<00:02:01.450> as

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:01.629 
a lot we try to strengthen them as

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:05.369 
a lot we try to strengthen them as
you'll<00:02:02.410> also<00:02:02.619> see<00:02:03.009> here<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:04.270> horse<00:02:04.539> has<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.110> bit

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:05.379 
you'll also see here the horse has a bit

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:07.440 
you'll also see here the horse has a bit
of<00:02:05.410> a<00:02:05.619> long<00:02:05.860> jump<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.459> stretches<00:02:07.300> its

of a long jump and stretches its

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.499 
of a long jump and stretches its
forelegs<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:08.200> bit<00:02:08.530> ahead<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.399> has<00:02:09.940> problems

to land if it lands in Cantor right lead
it<00:02:32.830> can<00:02:33.100> do<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> flying<00:02:33.670> change<00:02:34.060> over<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.720> pole

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
it can do a flying change over the pole

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.760

trying hard to correct its mistake again

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.640 
trying hard to correct its mistake again
it's<00:02:48.490> because<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.150> horse<00:02:49.390> jumps<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.960> bit<00:02:50.230> too

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.450 
far now it lands in canter right lead
and<00:02:55.750> we'll<00:02:56.230> want<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.830> do<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.190> flying
