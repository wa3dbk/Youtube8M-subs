00:00:01.486 --> 00:00:06.486
The new release of the label printing software 
 TFORMer Designer offers built-in serial number support.

00:00:07.802 --> 00:00:10.602
This video introduces this convenient feature in just a few minutes.

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:18.743
Start TFORMer Designer and create a new label.

00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:31.992
For printing on laser or inkjet printers confirm the first 
 two pages of the upcoming wizard with Next.

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.909
Browse the list of available label templates or enter the label number directly.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.400
You can also create your own label layout with 
 this button, but I'll use this predefined template.

00:00:56.332 --> 00:01:00.332
TFORMer Designer displays a sample label with the suitable settings.

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:09.005
In order to create a simple barcode label with a a serial 
 number, first I reduce the size of the sample text element.

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:14.925
Then I insert a new barcode into the label layout. 

00:01:17.137 --> 00:01:19.137
The barcode data wizard opens.

00:01:19.898 --> 00:01:23.498
Enter static barcode data here or insert a datafield.

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:28.375
To print serial numbers I create a new datafield.

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:36.469
Enter the required start value, let's say 1000.

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.650
I'll use the default increment which is 1.

00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:48.820
To ensure continuous numbering - even between TFORMer Designer 
 sessions - I check Store value after printing.

00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:55.930
Each label should be printed with a new serial number, 
 so I select Label in the Update section.

00:01:57.354 --> 00:01:59.750
Confirm all dialogs with OK.

00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:08.230
TFORMer Designer updates the barcode with the name of the serial field.

00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:13.230
The serial number datafield is now assigned to the barcode element.

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:16.150
Activate the Preview tab.

00:02:18.344 --> 00:02:21.340
TFORMer Designer prints ten labels by default.

00:02:28.793 --> 00:02:34.690
To print more labels add more records in the data 
 tab or just increase the number of copies.

00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:45.780
In this example you receive 49 pages as output.

00:02:46.487 --> 00:02:49.490
The barcodes are numbered consecutively.

00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:53.480
You are now ready to print the labels.

00:02:55.125 --> 00:03:01.120
I hope this video was helpful and I encourage you to 
 check out TFORMer Designer for yourself. Thanks for watching!
