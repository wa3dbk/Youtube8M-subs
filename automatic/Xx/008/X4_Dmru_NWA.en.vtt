00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.460 
it gets a little better like mid use
like<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:29.970> too<00:01:30.210> fresh<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.810> beginning<00:01:30.930> but

this<00:02:45.799> moving<00:02:46.310> brush<00:02:46.549> just<00:02:46.790> kind<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:47.030> freaks<00:02:47.330> me

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
this moving brush just kind of freaks me

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.850 
this moving brush just kind of freaks me
out<00:02:47.569> when<00:02:47.690> I'm<00:02:47.900> using<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.410> because<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:48.739> just

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
out when I'm using it because it's just

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.220 
out when I'm using it because it's just
it<00:02:49.850> doesn't<00:02:50.030> use<00:02:50.269> I<00:02:50.510> mean<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.840> doesn't<00:02:51.110> been

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
it doesn't use I mean it doesn't been

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.539 
it doesn't use I mean it doesn't been
that<00:02:51.380> much<00:02:51.500> whenever<00:02:51.709> you're<00:02:51.980> using<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.489> but

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
that much whenever you're using it but

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.470 
that much whenever you're using it but
it's<00:02:52.700> just<00:02:52.910> weird<00:02:53.049> but<00:02:54.049> um<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:55.239> guess<00:02:56.239> it's<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
it's just weird but um I guess it's the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.809 
it's just weird but um I guess it's the
okay<00:02:56.840> product<00:02:57.260> it's<00:02:57.860> not<00:02:58.069> what<00:02:58.250> they<00:02:58.400> make<00:02:58.670> it

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
okay product it's not what they make it

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.490 
okay product it's not what they make it
out<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.150> be<00:02:59.769> I<00:03:00.769> don't<00:03:01.099> even<00:03:01.220> know<00:03:01.430> what<00:03:01.580> manga

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
out to be I don't even know what manga

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.870 
out to be I don't even know what manga
means<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.950> guess<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.400> should<00:03:04.549> have<00:03:04.640> looked<00:03:04.790> that

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
means I guess I should have looked that

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.490 
means I guess I should have looked that
up<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.120> says<00:03:05.269> manga<00:03:05.630> effect<00:03:06.790> maximized<00:03:07.790> and

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
up it says manga effect maximized and

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.820 
up it says manga effect maximized and
maximizes<00:03:09.760> 360<00:03:10.760> flexor<00:03:11.569> brush<00:03:11.870> oversized

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
maximizes 360 flexor brush oversized

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.580 
maximizes 360 flexor brush oversized
volume<00:03:13.519> yeah<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.450> don't<00:03:14.750> feel<00:03:14.930> like<00:03:15.079> it<00:03:15.320> gives

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
volume yeah I don't feel like it gives

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.699 
volume yeah I don't feel like it gives
me<00:03:15.859> oversized<00:03:16.459> volume<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.260> tried<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.380> on<00:03:18.500> its

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
me oversized volume I tried it on its

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.229 
me oversized volume I tried it on its
well<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.190> first<00:03:19.400> time<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.579> tried<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.030> tried

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
well the first time I tried it I tried

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.910 
well the first time I tried it I tried
it<00:03:20.359> over<00:03:20.570> top<00:03:20.720> of<00:03:20.780> my<00:03:20.989> L'Oreal<00:03:21.290> voluminous<00:03:21.470> but

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
it over top of my L'Oreal voluminous but

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.819 
it over top of my L'Oreal voluminous but
this<00:03:22.040> time<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.250> tried<00:03:22.579> it<00:03:22.609> alone<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:24.500> had<00:03:24.709> to

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
this time I tried it alone and I had to

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.220 
this time I tried it alone and I had to
end<00:03:24.859> up<00:03:25.100> using<00:03:25.370> my<00:03:25.670> L'Oreal<00:03:26.000> voluminous<00:03:26.230> maybe

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
end up using my L'Oreal voluminous maybe

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.990 
end up using my L'Oreal voluminous maybe
it's<00:03:27.440> too<00:03:27.650> fresh<00:03:27.920> right<00:03:28.160> now<00:03:28.310> maybe<00:03:28.549> it'll<00:03:28.819> get

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
it's too fresh right now maybe it'll get

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.479 
it's too fresh right now maybe it'll get
better<00:03:29.180> after<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:30.170> use<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.590> few<00:03:30.620> times<00:03:30.769> I'm

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
better after I use it a few times I'm

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.569 
better after I use it a few times I'm
not<00:03:31.760> sure<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.030> guess<00:03:32.390> we'll<00:03:32.780> find<00:03:33.049> out<00:03:33.459> maybe<00:03:34.459> I

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
not sure I guess we'll find out maybe I

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:35.890 
not sure I guess we'll find out maybe I
should<00:03:34.819> have<00:03:34.910> waited<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.299> record<00:03:35.630> this<00:03:35.720> video

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
should have waited to record this video

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.509 
should have waited to record this video
when<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.230> found<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.620> out<00:03:36.680> but<00:03:37.660> overall<00:03:38.660> I

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
when I found that out but overall I

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.470 
when I found that out but overall I
don't<00:03:40.519> dig<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:41.000> 360<00:03:41.720> blocks<00:03:42.139> or<00:03:42.380> brush<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:43.639> did

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
don't dig the 360 blocks or brush I did

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.420 
don't dig the 360 blocks or brush I did
like<00:03:44.660> using<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.350> my<00:03:45.470> bottom<00:03:45.650> lashes<00:03:46.010> though

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
like using it on my bottom lashes though

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.610 
like using it on my bottom lashes though
but<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.269> this<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.660> supposed<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.930> be<00:03:47.989> clump<00:03:48.350> free

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
but so this is supposed to be clump free

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.030 
but so this is supposed to be clump free
flake<00:03:49.040> free<00:03:49.310> smudge<00:03:49.609> free<00:03:50.440> yada<00:03:51.440> yada<00:03:51.739> yada
