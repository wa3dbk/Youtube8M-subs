00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
be perfectly honest I think that the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
consoles have a big part of why is

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.060

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
that I know Travis right as the it was

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.020 
that I know Travis right as the it was
so<00:01:15.560> stylistic<00:01:16.340> I<00:01:16.460> thought<00:01:16.700> was<00:01:16.820> like<00:01:16.909> trying

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030

to<00:01:17.149> be<00:01:17.240> realistic

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580
