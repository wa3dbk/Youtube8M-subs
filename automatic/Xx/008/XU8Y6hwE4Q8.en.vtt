00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.680
 complicated I'm going to his little button that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.230

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.189
 on the wrench with multiple pressures 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 you make three small dots 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.460
 there is a space point 2.3.1 space 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.130
 star that gives you that after you put 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.539

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.500
 connections after you are going to put 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.520
 reconnect so here it connects so 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.690

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.289
 alone on the console look good on 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 could observe that I am alone 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.930
 for the time being 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.100
