00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.910
 we have this conversation 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.500
 not the first time what day is today 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.280
 rows of recruits 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.739
 farther 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.850
 the invasion boil over and everyone you 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.150
 send there die we lost everything 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.150

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.070
 find me when you wake up 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.470

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.650
 with me 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.040

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.120
 need your help but what exactly 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.400

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.060
 train you 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.690
 no matter what I do, everything depends on you 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.299
 why it is so important what will happen to me 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.470
 I'm not a soldier 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.470
 Of course you are not a weapon
