been working on this lately and I

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.140 
been working on this lately and I
haven't<00:00:11.219> been<00:00:11.309> doing<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.550> for<00:00:11.670> too<00:00:11.759> long<00:00:11.940> but

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
haven't been doing it for too long but

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.810 
haven't been doing it for too long but
I'm<00:00:12.240> almost<00:00:12.450> done<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.429> first<00:00:14.549> thing<00:00:14.670> you

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
I'm almost done so the first thing you

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.189 
I'm almost done so the first thing you
want<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.000> do<00:00:15.089> before<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:15.900> anything<00:00:16.080> else

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
want to do before you do anything else

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.450 
want to do before you do anything else
to<00:00:16.350> try<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.560> get<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.800> shot<00:00:17.010> challenge<00:00:17.250> is

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
to try to get that shot challenge is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.640 
to try to get that shot challenge is
done<00:00:17.640> as<00:00:17.820> soon<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.090> possible<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.720> find<00:00:19.560> that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
done as soon as possible I find that

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.340 
done as soon as possible I find that
this<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.580> most<00:00:20.699> useful<00:00:21.000> for<00:00:21.779> example<00:00:22.199> if

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
this is the most useful for example if

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.870 
this is the most useful for example if
we<00:00:22.619> go<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> my<00:00:23.189> assault<00:00:23.460> rifles<00:00:23.789> here<00:00:25.880> it's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
we go to my assault rifles here it's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.240 
we go to my assault rifles here it's
oval<00:00:27.210> whoops<00:00:27.349> you'll<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
oval whoops you'll see that I have the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.950 
oval whoops you'll see that I have the
headshot<00:00:29.519> challenges<00:00:29.910> done<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
headshot challenges done for this the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.709 
headshot challenges done for this the
rest<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.170> them<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> got<00:00:31.439> gold<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.570> got<00:00:33.570> all

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
rest of them I got gold but I got all

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.030 
rest of them I got gold but I got all
the<00:00:33.809> headshot<00:00:34.079> challenges<00:00:34.440> done<00:00:34.590> first<00:00:34.860> I

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the headshot challenges done first I

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.010 
the headshot challenges done first I
think<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.309> better<00:00:35.460> example<00:00:35.610> would<00:00:35.940> be<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> LMGs

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
think a better example would be the LMGs

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
think a better example would be the LMGs
so<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.070> shows<00:00:38.219> someone<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> lsat

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
so it shows someone like the lsat

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420 
so it shows someone like the lsat
headshot<00:00:39.840> challenges<00:00:40.200> are<00:00:40.320> done<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.739> chose

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
headshot challenges are done I chose

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.190 
headshot challenges are done I chose
something<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> qbb<00:00:42.390> edge<00:00:43.020> at

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
something like the qbb edge at

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
something like the qbb edge at
challenges<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.680> done<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.120> really

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
challenges have done so it's really

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.779 
challenges have done so it's really
important<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.309> get<00:00:47.309> those<00:00:47.460> out<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> way

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
important to get those out of the way

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.920 
important to get those out of the way
first<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> second<00:00:48.750> half<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
first because then the second half you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350 
first because then the second half you
can<00:00:49.200> kind<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.440> work<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.860> playing<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.030> more

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
can kind of work on playing on a more

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
can kind of work on playing on a more
normal<00:00:51.629> type<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.649> opposed<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.039> for

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
normal type as opposed to going for

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.100 
normal type as opposed to going for
headshots<00:00:53.750> but<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:54.840> you're<00:00:54.930> having<00:00:55.050> trouble

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
headshots but if you're having trouble

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.770 
headshots but if you're having trouble
getting<00:00:55.350> headshots<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:56.070> recommend<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.090> reflex

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
getting headshots I recommend a reflex

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.479 
getting headshots I recommend a reflex
sight<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.500> accurate<00:00:58.649> obviously

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
sight to be more accurate obviously

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.180 
sight to be more accurate obviously
aiming<00:00:59.699> towards<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> head<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.980> if<00:01:01.980> you're

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
aiming towards the head and if you're

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.399 
aiming towards the head and if you're
using<00:01:02.309> an<00:01:02.520> assault<00:01:03.120> rifle<00:01:03.149> that's<00:01:03.960> automatic

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
using an assault rifle that's automatic

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.770 
using an assault rifle that's automatic
or<00:01:04.530> an<00:01:04.799> SMG<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.850> maybe<00:01:06.090> use<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> laser<00:01:06.479> sight

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
or an SMG then maybe use a laser sight

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.120 
or an SMG then maybe use a laser sight
try<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> hit<00:01:07.260> fire<00:01:07.439> towards<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> head<00:01:07.950> if

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
try to hit fire towards the head if

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.960 
try to hit fire towards the head if
you're<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> somewhat<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.080> close-range<00:01:10.080> area

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
you're in somewhat of a close-range area

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.160 
you're in somewhat of a close-range area
so<00:01:11.970> that's<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.479> say<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.990> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so that's all I can say about that it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.420 
so that's all I can say about that it
takes<00:01:13.320> some<00:01:13.500> time<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.950> once<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.280> those

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
takes some time but once you get those

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.859 
takes some time but once you get those
done<00:01:14.610> second<00:01:15.060> half<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> challenges<00:01:15.720> are<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
done second half the challenges are a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.109 
done second half the challenges are a
lot<00:01:15.990> easier<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> SMR<00:01:17.549> i<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
lot easier so the SMR i have here is a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
lot easier so the SMR i have here is a
pretty<00:01:18.270> good<00:01:18.479> example<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:19.320> classes<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.860> i

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
pretty good example of classes that i

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
pretty good example of classes that i
set<00:01:20.189> up<00:01:20.280> i<00:01:20.400> set<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.670> three<00:01:21.030> classes<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.720> this

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
set up i set up three classes for this

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.080 
set up i set up three classes for this
thing<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.619> first<00:01:22.830> one<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.189> no<00:01:23.520> attachments

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
thing the first one is no attachments

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.870 
thing the first one is no attachments
and<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.290> more<00:01:25.560> perks<00:01:25.830> i<00:01:26.040> make<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.610> really

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and as for more perks i make it really

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.120 
and as for more perks i make it really
aggressive<00:01:27.330> lightweight<00:01:28.009> toughness<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
aggressive lightweight toughness and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.850 
aggressive lightweight toughness and
scavenger<00:01:30.020> hardline<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.140> well<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.560> it's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
scavenger hardline as well and it's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.800 
scavenger hardline as well and it's
dexterity<00:01:32.729> interesting<00:01:33.060> conditioning<00:01:33.450> very

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
dexterity interesting conditioning very

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.140 
dexterity interesting conditioning very
aggressive<00:01:34.259> I'm<00:01:35.159> very<00:01:35.220> fast<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.880> move<00:01:36.060> around

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
aggressive I'm very fast I move around
the<00:01:36.299> map<00:01:36.360> get<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:36.990> kills<00:01:37.259> scavenger

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the map get a lot of kills scavenger

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.649 
the map get a lot of kills scavenger
keeps<00:01:38.430> me<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.180> keep<00:01:39.299> using<00:01:39.450> this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
keeps me going so I can keep using this

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.960 
keeps me going so I can keep using this
gun<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.140> hardline<00:01:41.130> helps<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.670> my<00:01:41.759> score

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
gun and hardline helps with my score

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.910 
gun and hardline helps with my score
streaks<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:42.479> are<00:01:42.600> pretty<00:01:42.750> important<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
streaks which are pretty important the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
score streak set up you want to use is a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
score streak set up you want to use is a
very<00:01:46.470> great<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.280> oriented<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.899> were<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
very great are oriented one if I were to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.389 
very great are oriented one if I were to
set<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.350> something<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.740> little<00:01:49.829> bit<00:01:50.009> different

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
set up something a little bit different

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.399 
set up something a little bit different
you<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.790> let's<00:01:50.909> say<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.689> my<00:01:51.960> traditional

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
you know let's say like my traditional

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.770 
you know let's say like my traditional
setup<00:01:52.820> my<00:01:53.820> score<00:01:54.149> streaks<00:01:54.390> will<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> lot<00:01:54.750> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
setup my score streaks will get a lot of

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.480 
setup my score streaks will get a lot of
the<00:01:54.930> kills<00:01:55.170> instead<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.770> my<00:01:55.860> weapon<00:01:56.219> which

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the kills instead of my weapon which

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.219 
the kills instead of my weapon which
will<00:01:56.670> prolong<00:01:57.060> how<00:01:57.540> long<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.020> use<00:01:58.110> his

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
will prolong how long I have to use his

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.139 
will prolong how long I have to use his
weapon<00:01:58.380> for<00:01:58.770> that's<00:01:59.460> not<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.880> want<00:02:00.000> to

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
weapon for that's not what you want to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
weapon for that's not what you want to
do<00:02:00.270> instead<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.170> set<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.469> something<00:02:02.219> like

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
do instead you set up something like

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.370 
do instead you set up something like
this<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:03.149> way<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.540> constantly<00:02:04.140> see

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
this that way I can constantly see

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.810 
this that way I can constantly see
people<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> radar<00:02:04.950> or<00:02:05.310> stay<00:02:05.549> off<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
people on the radar or stay off the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.490 
people on the radar or stay off the
radar<00:02:06.000> which<00:02:06.450> ultimately<00:02:06.630> still<00:02:07.140> helps<00:02:07.350> me

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
radar which ultimately still helps me

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.190 
radar which ultimately still helps me
and<00:02:08.209> will<00:02:09.209> allow<00:02:09.300> me<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.690> get<00:02:09.780> more<00:02:09.899> kills<00:02:10.080> on

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
and will allow me to get more kills on

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
and will allow me to get more kills on
my<00:02:10.289> gun<00:02:10.500> speeding<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.160> process

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
my gun speeding up the process

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.570 
my gun speeding up the process
so<00:02:13.020> two<00:02:13.530> more<00:02:13.710> classes<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.190> set<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.430> with<00:02:14.520> the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
so two more classes I set up with the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.850 
so two more classes I set up with the
SMR<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.510> first<00:02:15.750> one<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.470> no<00:02:16.590> perks

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
SMR the first one is the no perks

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.960 
SMR the first one is the no perks
because<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.370> won't<00:02:17.520> work<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.790> both

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
because you won't work on both

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.630 
because you won't work on both
challenges<00:02:18.420> at<00:02:18.540> same<00:02:18.720> time<00:02:19.310> but<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.430> want<00:02:20.610> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
challenges at same time but you want to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640 
challenges at same time but you want to
prioritize<00:02:21.150> one<00:02:21.780> gun<00:02:21.960> at<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.140> time<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.500> you'll

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
prioritize one gun at a time so you'll

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.380 
prioritize one gun at a time so you'll
see<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.010> have<00:02:23.520> three<00:02:23.700> classes<00:02:23.850> with<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.210> S

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
see I have three classes with the S

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.760 
see I have three classes with the S
somewhere<00:02:24.660> that's<00:02:24.870> my<00:02:24.990> assault<00:02:25.260> rifle<00:02:25.590> and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
somewhere that's my assault rifle and

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.850 
somewhere that's my assault rifle and
working<00:02:26.070> on<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.660> one<00:02:27.840> I'm<00:02:28.080> very<00:02:28.350> close

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
working on so in this one I'm very close

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.430 
working on so in this one I'm very close
quarters<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.490> reflex<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.720> select<00:02:31.050> fire<00:02:31.230> in

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
quarters the reflex the select fire in

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.350 
quarters the reflex the select fire in
the<00:02:31.530> laser<00:02:31.680> sight<00:02:31.950> allows<00:02:32.520> me<00:02:32.700> play<00:02:32.910> pretty

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the laser sight allows me play pretty

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.450 
the laser sight allows me play pretty
close<00:02:33.630> quarters<00:02:34.020> areas<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.830> we're<00:02:34.980> semi-auto

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
close quarters areas so we're semi-auto

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.550 
close quarters areas so we're semi-auto
SMR<00:02:36.030> action<00:02:36.600> wouldn't<00:02:36.840> really<00:02:36.930> work<00:02:37.170> out<00:02:37.320> like

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
SMR action wouldn't really work out like

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.500 
SMR action wouldn't really work out like
a<00:02:37.590> place<00:02:37.830> like<00:02:37.950> hijacked<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:39.090> weapon<00:02:39.480> will

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
a place like hijacked this weapon will

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.110 
a place like hijacked this weapon will
do<00:02:39.870> me<00:02:40.020> better<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.650> try<00:02:41.460> not<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.640> use<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.820> real

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
do me better I try not to use a real

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.730 
do me better I try not to use a real
secondary<00:02:42.690> like<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.900> pistol<00:02:43.230> because<00:02:43.320> if<00:02:43.620> i

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
secondary like a pistol because if i

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.350 
secondary like a pistol because if i
switch<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.400> get<00:02:44.490> kills<00:02:44.700> with<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:44.940> i'm

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
switch to that and get kills with it i'm

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.330 
switch to that and get kills with it i'm
taking<00:02:45.630> away<00:02:45.960> from<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.260> gun<00:02:46.410> same<00:02:47.160> thing<00:02:47.280> with

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
taking away from the gun same thing with

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.820 
taking away from the gun same thing with
lethal<00:02:47.670> kill<00:02:47.820> streaks<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:49.020> i<00:02:49.140> want<00:02:49.350> there's

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
lethal kill streaks so if i want there's

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
lethal kill streaks so if i want there's
really<00:02:49.890> nothing<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.520> if<00:02:50.730> you're

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
really nothing you can do if you're

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.370 
really nothing you can do if you're
going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> use<00:02:51.150> them<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:51.870> i<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.200> nothing

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
going to use them but i have nothing

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.930 
going to use them but i have nothing
else<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.770> really<00:02:52.920> put<00:02:53.130> on<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.340> class<00:02:53.610> since<00:02:53.850> i

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
else to really put on this class since i

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.230 
else to really put on this class since i
can't<00:02:54.120> use<00:02:54.210> perks<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> mean<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.650> could<00:02:55.830> just

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
can't use perks so I mean I could just

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.610 
can't use perks so I mean I could just
get<00:02:57.240> rid<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.780> maybe<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.050> use<00:02:58.170> like<00:02:58.320> more

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
get rid of it and maybe to use like more

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.250 
get rid of it and maybe to use like more
tactical<00:02:59.130> grenades<00:02:59.220> but<00:02:59.700> oh<00:02:59.910> well<00:03:00.540> plus<00:03:01.140> if

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
tactical grenades but oh well plus if

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.990 
tactical grenades but oh well plus if
using<00:03:01.530> launchers<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.100> can<00:03:02.220> kind<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.730> get<00:03:02.880> them

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
using launchers you can kind of get them

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.390 
using launchers you can kind of get them
gold<00:03:03.240> on<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.600> way<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:03.990> as<00:03:04.200> well<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:05.310> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
gold on the way of this as well so the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.850 
gold on the way of this as well so the
next<00:03:05.580> class<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.200> same<00:03:07.200> thing<00:03:07.440> except

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
next class is same thing except

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.020 
next class is same thing except

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
challenges done I put a real secondary

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.350 
challenges done I put a real secondary
on<00:03:37.770> here<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.100> call<00:03:38.280> them<00:03:38.400> real<00:03:38.580> secondaries<00:03:39.150> but

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
on here I call them real secondaries but

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.330 
on here I call them real secondaries but
a<00:03:39.510> legitimate<00:03:40.170> like<00:03:40.410> killing<00:03:40.830> secondary

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
a legitimate like killing secondary

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.590 
a legitimate like killing secondary
because<00:03:41.940> there<00:03:42.060> was<00:03:42.150> really<00:03:42.270> nothing<00:03:42.420> else

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
because there was really nothing else

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.810 
because there was really nothing else
could<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.140> fill<00:03:43.320> up<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.500> ten<00:03:43.680> points<00:03:44.130> but

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
could do to fill up the ten points but

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.910 
could do to fill up the ten points but
uh<00:03:44.900> again<00:03:45.900> try<00:03:46.200> not<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.380> use<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.620> too<00:03:46.739> often

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
uh again try not to use it too often

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.560 
uh again try not to use it too often
because<00:03:47.130> then<00:03:47.370> he'll<00:03:47.940> end<00:03:48.120> up<00:03:48.150> having<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
because then he'll end up having the

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.180 
because then he'll end up having the
users<00:03:49.020> come<00:03:49.170> longer<00:03:49.440> than<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.650> want<00:03:49.680> or<00:03:50.070> any

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
users come longer than you want or any

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.580 
users come longer than you want or any
gun<00:03:50.370> for<00:03:50.550> that<00:03:50.640> matter<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.380> do<00:03:52.500> recommend

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
gun for that matter so I do recommend

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.110 
gun for that matter so I do recommend
sending<00:03:53.070> three<00:03:53.430> classes<00:03:53.790> if<00:03:53.910> you're<00:03:54.030> going

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
sending three classes if you're going

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.400 
sending three classes if you're going
for<00:03:54.270> something<00:03:54.420> like<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.810> if<00:03:55.110> you're<00:03:55.380> going

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
for something like that if you're going

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.910 
for something like that if you're going
for<00:03:55.800> an<00:03:56.070> SMG<00:03:56.459> type<00:03:56.970> thing<00:03:57.440> again<00:03:58.440> set<00:03:58.739> up<00:03:58.830> a

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
for an SMG type thing again set up a

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.699 
for an SMG type thing again set up a
very<00:03:59.100> aggressive<00:03:59.459> class<00:04:00.170> scavenger<00:04:01.170> lets<00:04:01.650> you

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
very aggressive class scavenger lets you

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.220 
very aggressive class scavenger lets you
use<00:04:01.830> your<00:04:01.950> gun<00:04:02.130> constantly<00:04:02.870> ghost<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:04.050> good

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
use your gun constantly ghost is good

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.600 
use your gun constantly ghost is good
for<00:04:04.380> kind<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:04.590> flanking<00:04:04.950> around<00:04:05.190> staying<00:04:05.550> off

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
for kind of flanking around staying off

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.150 
for kind of flanking around staying off
the<00:04:05.640> radar<00:04:05.850> getting<00:04:06.420> kills<00:04:06.950> smgs<00:04:07.950> or<00:04:08.040> close

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
the radar getting kills smgs or close

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.650 
the radar getting kills smgs or close
quarters<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.760> obviously<00:04:08.910> want<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.390> stay

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
quarters so you obviously want to stay

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.000 
quarters so you obviously want to stay
off<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.900> radar<00:04:10.050> so<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:10.410> can<00:04:10.530> get<00:04:10.620> close<00:04:10.830> to

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
off the radar so you can get close to

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.860 
off the radar so you can get close to
them<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.700> again<00:04:11.940> parks<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.480> really<00:04:12.660> speed

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
them and again parks to really speed

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.229 
them and again parks to really speed
that<00:04:13.019> that<00:04:13.380> process<00:04:13.590> up<00:04:13.980> but<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.519> already<00:04:14.970> kind

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
that that process up but I already kind

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.539 
that that process up but I already kind
of<00:04:15.269> finish<00:04:15.480> these<00:04:15.630> off<00:04:17.180> if<00:04:18.180> we<00:04:18.419> were<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.660> go<00:04:18.780> for

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
of finish these off if we were to go for

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.159 
of finish these off if we were to go for
shotguns<00:04:20.549> pretty<00:04:20.970> much<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.150> same<00:04:21.299> thing<00:04:21.570> same

challenge<00:04:26.430> is<00:04:26.520> done<00:04:26.699> obviously<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.539> case

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:27.719 
challenge is done obviously the case

challenge is done obviously the case
tree<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.469> r870<00:04:29.090> very<00:04:30.090> easy<00:04:30.270> s12<00:04:30.990> m1216<00:04:31.710> I

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
tree in the r870 very easy s12 m1216 I

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
tree in the r870 very easy s12 m1216 I
would<00:04:32.490> say<00:04:32.699> go<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.060> hardcore<00:04:34.460> as<00:04:35.460> for<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.699> LMGs

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
would say go to hardcore as for the LMGs

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.920 
would say go to hardcore as for the LMGs
pretty<00:04:37.229> tough<00:04:37.729> I<00:04:38.729> mean<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.629> headshot

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
pretty tough I mean the headshot

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.059 
pretty tough I mean the headshot
challenge<00:04:40.229> is<00:04:40.319> a<00:04:40.349> little<00:04:40.590> bit<00:04:40.680> easier<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.949> get

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
challenge is a little bit easier to get

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.490 
challenge is a little bit easier to get
because<00:04:41.219> they're<00:04:41.370> more<00:04:41.610> consistent<00:04:42.150> gun<00:04:42.500> but

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
because they're more consistent gun but

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.709 
because they're more consistent gun but
I<00:04:43.770> say<00:04:44.580> speed<00:04:44.939> them<00:04:45.030> up<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.180> bit<00:04:45.270> i'll<00:04:45.509> show<00:04:45.659> you

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
I say speed them up a bit i'll show you

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.770 
I say speed them up a bit i'll show you
my<00:04:45.930> MK<00:04:46.379> 48<00:04:46.830> class<00:04:47.099> I<00:04:47.430> put<00:04:48.150> all<00:04:48.180> perks<00:04:48.509> on<00:04:48.659> to

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
my MK 48 class I put all perks on to

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.450 
my MK 48 class I put all perks on to
speed<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.139> up<00:04:49.229> attachments<00:04:50.009> to<00:04:50.069> speed<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.370> up

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
speed it up attachments to speed it up

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.920 
speed it up attachments to speed it up
I'm<00:04:50.699> gonna<00:04:50.909> throw<00:04:51.120> stock<00:04:51.419> on<00:04:51.599> here<00:04:51.780> when<00:04:51.900> I

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
I'm gonna throw stock on here when I

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.260 
I'm gonna throw stock on here when I
have<00:04:52.139> it<00:04:52.310> that's<00:04:53.310> what<00:04:53.430> I<00:04:53.490> do<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.669> speed<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.090> up

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
have it that's what I do I speed it up

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.610 
have it that's what I do I speed it up
so<00:04:54.389> that<00:04:54.419> way<00:04:54.569> I<00:04:54.599> can<00:04:54.810> rush<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.319> be<00:04:55.409> aggressive

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
so that way I can rush and be aggressive

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.980 
so that way I can rush and be aggressive
more<00:04:56.340> kills<00:04:56.580> equals<00:04:57.090> more<00:04:57.210> headshots<00:04:57.449> more

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
more kills equals more headshots more

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.490 
more kills equals more headshots more
headshots<00:04:58.169> faster<00:04:58.979> I<00:04:59.189> get<00:04:59.639> this<00:04:59.789> done<00:05:00.090> and

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
headshots faster I get this done and

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.920 
headshots faster I get this done and
then<00:05:01.500> snipers<00:05:02.240> one<00:05:03.240> shot<00:05:03.419> kills<00:05:03.659> are<00:05:03.779> pretty

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
then snipers one shot kills are pretty

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.019 
then snipers one shot kills are pretty
easy<00:05:04.080> except<00:05:04.409> for<00:05:04.529> the<00:05:04.590> SVU<00:05:04.979> so<00:05:05.819> I<00:05:05.849> would

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.029 
easy except for the SVU so I would

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.490 
easy except for the SVU so I would
recommend<00:05:06.060> going<00:05:06.539> to<00:05:06.810> hardcore<00:05:07.110> for<00:05:07.319> that<00:05:07.409> as

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
recommend going to hardcore for that as

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.719 
recommend going to hardcore for that as
well<00:05:07.529> I<00:05:07.860> don't<00:05:08.039> have<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.310> sniper<00:05:08.550> but

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
well I don't have a sniper but

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.490 
well I don't have a sniper but
essentially<00:05:11.840> same<00:05:12.840> thing<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.169> want<00:05:13.319> to<00:05:13.379> set

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
essentially same thing you want to set

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.040 
essentially same thing you want to set
up<00:05:13.560> two<00:05:13.740> classes<00:05:14.250> one<00:05:15.120> maybe<00:05:15.719> just<00:05:15.930> a

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
up two classes one maybe just a

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.559 
up two classes one maybe just a
ballistics<00:05:16.469> site<00:05:16.650> or<00:05:17.069> no<00:05:17.909> attachments<00:05:18.419> if<00:05:18.509> you

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
ballistics site or no attachments if you

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.059 
ballistics site or no attachments if you
want<00:05:18.689> to<00:05:18.750> use<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:18.900> parks<00:05:19.199> and<00:05:19.439> again<00:05:19.680> make

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069 
want to use the parks and again make

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.559 
want to use the parks and again make
them<00:05:20.159> fast<00:05:20.430> perks<00:05:20.729> they'll<00:05:20.909> help<00:05:21.029> you<00:05:21.150> out<00:05:21.330> and

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
them fast perks they'll help you out and

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:23.629 
them fast perks they'll help you out and
then<00:05:21.599> when<00:05:22.020> you<00:05:22.080> do<00:05:22.229> use<00:05:22.409> attachments<00:05:22.979> you

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
then when you do use attachments you

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.429 
then when you do use attachments you
always<00:05:24.060> want<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.210> have<00:05:24.270> one<00:05:24.569> with<00:05:24.990> an<00:05:25.110> acog

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:25.439 
always want to have one with an acog

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.379 
always want to have one with an acog
site<00:05:25.770> but<00:05:26.250> having<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.699> cock<00:05:26.909> set<00:05:27.180> you<00:05:27.270> can

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
site but having a cock set you can

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.600 
site but having a cock set you can
handle<00:05:27.659> closer<00:05:28.500> range<00:05:28.860> maps<00:05:29.159> that<00:05:29.339> are<00:05:29.400> real

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
handle closer range maps that are real

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.670 
handle closer range maps that are real
scope<00:05:29.879> couldn't<00:05:30.270> so<00:05:30.930> ultimately<00:05:31.169> you'll<00:05:31.529> get

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
scope couldn't so ultimately you'll get

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.269 
scope couldn't so ultimately you'll get
more<00:05:31.889> one-shot<00:05:32.520> kills<00:05:32.849> to<00:05:34.099> complete<00:05:35.099> these

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
more one-shot kills to complete these

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.540 
more one-shot kills to complete these
challenges<00:05:36.169> what<00:05:37.169> you<00:05:37.289> do<00:05:37.409> need<00:05:37.560> a<00:05:37.620> lot<00:05:37.800> of<00:05:37.830> 250

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
challenges what you do need a lot of 250

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.469 
challenges what you do need a lot of 250
so<00:05:38.849> definitely<00:05:39.750> use<00:05:39.930> two<00:05:40.440> classes<00:05:40.889> for<00:05:41.099> thats

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
so definitely use two classes for thats

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.790 
so definitely use two classes for thats
so<00:05:42.479> anyways<00:05:42.779> that's<00:05:42.930> really<00:05:43.259> it's<00:05:43.560> all<00:05:43.650> about

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
so anyways that's really it's all about

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.409 
so anyways that's really it's all about
class<00:05:44.039> setups<00:05:44.669> here<00:05:44.849> you<00:05:45.029> want<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.270> make<00:05:45.360> them

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
class setups here you want to make them

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.939 
class setups here you want to make them
aggressive<00:05:45.870> you<00:05:46.020> want<00:05:46.169> to<00:05:46.229> make<00:05:46.349> multiples

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
aggressive you want to make multiples

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.510

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
will ultimately have more time to use
