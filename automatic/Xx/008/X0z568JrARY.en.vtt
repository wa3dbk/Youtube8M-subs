00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
I'd like to give a short demo of my lead

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.610 
I'd like to give a short demo of my lead
guitar<00:00:06.210> method<00:00:07.130> the<00:00:08.130> first<00:00:08.309> track<00:00:08.730> is

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
guitar method the first track is

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.610 
guitar method the first track is
designed<00:00:10.790> it's<00:00:11.790> produced<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.440> make<00:00:13.590> a

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
designed it's produced to to make a

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.269 
designed it's produced to to make a
pentatonic<00:00:14.099> sound<00:00:14.820> good<00:00:15.560> so<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.740> chords<00:00:17.130> are

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
pentatonic sound good so the chords are

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.460 
pentatonic sound good so the chords are
just<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.880> minor<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.170> half<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.970> all<00:00:21.210> all<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
just a minor in half so all all the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.450 
just a minor in half so all all the
notes<00:00:22.680> from<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.130> minor<00:00:23.460> tone<00:00:23.779> pentatonic

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
notes from the a minor tone pentatonic

00:00:25.460 --> 00:01:56.359 
notes from the a minor tone pentatonic
sound<00:00:26.460> right

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.730 

something<00:01:57.369> like<00:01:57.520> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
something like that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.469 
something like that
the<00:01:59.740> next<00:02:00.009> track<00:02:00.219> is<00:02:00.250> a<00:02:00.429> bit<00:02:00.579> more<00:02:00.850> challenging

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
the next track is a bit more challenging

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.749 
the next track is a bit more challenging
because<00:02:01.630> it's<00:02:01.960> got<00:02:02.140> more<00:02:02.520> notes<00:02:03.569> more<00:02:04.569> chords

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
because it's got more notes more chords

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.850 
because it's got more notes more chords
and<00:02:06.759> it<00:02:06.880> also<00:02:07.060> means<00:02:07.359> you<00:02:07.539> can<00:02:07.719> stick<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.590> few

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
and it also means you can stick to a few

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.940 
and it also means you can stick to a few
notes<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:09.310> see<00:02:09.459> what<00:02:09.700> happens<00:02:10.060> underneath

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
notes and see what happens underneath

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.100 
notes and see what happens underneath
but<00:02:11.950> anyway<00:02:12.819> I'll<00:02:14.549> throw<00:02:15.549> in<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.910> Blue<00:02:16.120> Note<00:02:16.360> 2

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
but anyway I'll throw in the Blue Note 2

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.740 
but anyway I'll throw in the Blue Note 2
so<00:02:17.410> I'll<00:02:17.950> play<00:02:18.220> them<00:02:18.280> I'll<00:02:18.760> also<00:02:19.239> play<00:02:19.599> the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
so I'll play them I'll also play the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:04:07.099 
so I'll play them I'll also play the
blue<00:02:19.930> scale

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:14.330 

and<00:04:08.109> now<00:04:08.700> we<00:04:09.700> got<00:04:09.909> a<00:04:11.579> -<00:04:12.579> all<00:04:12.969> it's<00:04:13.540> all<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.780> minor

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
and now we got a - all it's all a minor

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.970 
and now we got a - all it's all a minor
but<00:04:15.340> we<00:04:15.700> also<00:04:15.849> got<00:04:16.150> e<00:04:16.449> -<00:04:17.079> Devon

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.780 

and<00:04:20.220> g2

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
and g2

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:30.430 
and g2
so<00:04:23.360> that<00:04:23.570> means<00:04:23.920> we<00:04:24.920> gather<00:04:25.180> sometimes<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.360> see

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.320 

the<00:04:31.440> seed<00:04:31.680> from<00:04:31.920> them<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.730> tonic<00:04:33.030> scare

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
the seed from them and a tonic scare

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:43.660 
the seed from them and a tonic scare
doesn't<00:04:33.690> really<00:04:33.930> fit<00:04:34.670> so<00:04:35.670> we<00:04:36.420> just<00:04:36.690> add<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.770> B

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.700 

we<00:04:44.670> add<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:45.000> B<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:45.450> pentatonic<00:04:45.840> scale<00:04:46.380> so

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
we add the B to the pentatonic scale so

00:04:46.710 --> 00:07:17.820 
we add the B to the pentatonic scale so
six<00:04:47.040> notes<00:04:47.330> pentatonic<00:04:48.330> scale<00:04:48.540> plus<00:04:48.840> B

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:17.830 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.890
