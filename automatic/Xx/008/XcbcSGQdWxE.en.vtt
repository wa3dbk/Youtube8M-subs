00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.930
 I'll show you I showed you the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:11.929
 elevator is placed 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:17.760
 Colatto when passing glue here on the sides 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:19.619
 for the whole body and even this little corner 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.100
 where the twist begins 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.350
 I'll sit here and then they 'll turn 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.119
 she's upside down on the straight surface 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.210
 in case I'm using a table 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.910
 stone body and the plane's alignment 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.910
 dinho content that is aligned right 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.830
 the necklace that in real time I do not know if 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.510
 will get on the bed that has to be fast 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.510
 but the hot and dry glue 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.830
 beyond the west place came but the first 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.830
 another after 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.059
 bare the top side 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.290
 I do not know if it's going to be to see people together. 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.590
 here because it 's hard for you to be fast 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.590
 because 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.240
 there with a balanced square is 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.590
 it is a time that you put can not take away 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.590
 more people 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.290
 ae 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.360
 Good, let's see here and here we stayed 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.750
 you look like that 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.240
 Good now I'll put my helm there. 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.020
 behind it is not remembered only will not call 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.080
 is practically ready the carcass is ready 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:22.390
 go missing electronics and find cgd 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:26.260
 the cg is where people actually coming 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.260
 I'll see if it gives transparency to the rod that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.950
 It's up there, just put your finger on the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.520
 rod is a medium of water 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.190
 that's when you on drums it goes 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.510
 balance the plane right under the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.730
 now in the middle of the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.190
 Asia is not that theory and a 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.459
 third of the water that at the tip is 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.760
 that the middle of Asia arrives with 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.920
 All Electronic Engine Placed 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.709
 last but she would have who goes 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.500
 balance it related to this 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.280
 fused variant below and goes 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.950
 bringing the battery pack to 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.950
 balanced and if that is 20 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.640
 let's ride the back
