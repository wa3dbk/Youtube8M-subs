to<00:03:38.910> inverse<00:03:39.450> braid<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.380> this<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.709> just

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
to inverse braid this and this is just

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:41.930 
to inverse braid this and this is just
an<00:03:41.069> inside-outside

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
an inside-outside

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.570 
an inside-outside
braid<00:03:42.209> or<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> Dutch<00:03:42.780> braid<00:03:43.310> now<00:03:44.310> what<00:03:44.489> I'm

braid or a Dutch braid now what I'm
doing<00:03:44.610> that's<00:03:45.030> different<00:03:45.420> than<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> normal

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
doing that's different than a normal

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.020 
doing that's different than a normal
Dutch<00:03:46.230> braid<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.709> I'm<00:03:46.890> only<00:03:47.130> adding<00:03:47.430> hair<00:03:47.880> from

Dutch braid is I'm only adding hair from
the<00:03:48.390> top<00:03:49.069> so<00:03:50.069> it's<00:03:50.220> going<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.400> give<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.610> a

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
the top so it's going to give it a

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.400 
the top so it's going to give it a
different<00:03:50.880> kind<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.360> look<00:03:51.569> to<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.230> it's

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
different kind of look to it and it's

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.039 
different kind of look to it and it's
really<00:03:52.709> really<00:03:52.830> cute<00:03:53.370> what<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.750> could<00:03:54.900> also

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
really really cute what you could also

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.870 
really really cute what you could also
do<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.890> could<00:03:56.069> do<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> normal<00:03:56.489> French

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
do to this you could do a normal French

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.400 
do to this you could do a normal French
braid<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.330> do<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.510> same<00:03:57.720> technique<00:03:57.989> or

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
braid and do the same technique or

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.740 
braid and do the same technique or
instead<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.459> adding<00:03:59.640> hair<00:03:59.880> just<00:04:00.239> from<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.569> top

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
instead of adding hair just from the top

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.660 
instead of adding hair just from the top
you<00:04:01.049> could<00:04:01.200> also<00:04:01.350> add<00:04:01.620> hair<00:04:01.860> just<00:04:02.310> from<00:04:02.549> the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
you could also add hair just from the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.160 
you could also add hair just from the
bottom<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.209> it's<00:04:03.360> going<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.510> look<00:04:03.750> kind<00:04:03.989> of

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
bottom and it's going to look kind of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.050 
bottom and it's going to look kind of
like<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.410> opposite<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.130> this<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:05.940> it's

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
like the opposite of this but it's

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.430 
like the opposite of this but it's
really<00:04:06.150> cute<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:06.840> feel<00:04:07.049> like<00:04:07.170> it's<00:04:07.350> really

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
bohemian and you'll see as it starts to

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.650 
bohemian and you'll see as it starts to
come<00:04:10.500> along<00:04:10.739> how<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.100> looks<00:04:11.280> different<00:04:14.660> so
