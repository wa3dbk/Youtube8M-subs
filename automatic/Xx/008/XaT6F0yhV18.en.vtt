00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.909

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.630

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.060
 I always thought I could do anything 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.260
 I was better than I am 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.260

 Life 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.030
 May 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.590

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.920
 stay down when he falls it is 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.920
 shoot him 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.780
 I have to honestly say that this 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.250
 first trailer not really me yet 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.810
 Sometimes it's so hard to say 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.819
 what is it but only these together 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.650
 Namely, rescue of images is enough 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.000
 the only thing is this filmmusik the that 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.920
 I want to tell them all 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.730
 must find exciting and quiet now 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.590
 but somehow not even though the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.629
 history actually interesting because 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.459
 unbroken the universal pictures 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.650

 the true story of louis zamperini 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.560
 a man who once was a little boy 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.299
 It started to become an athlete 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.629

 at the olympic games in berlin 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.419
 to compete that so much success that 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.519
 the attention of adolf hitler 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.109
 him a very special were the 1940th 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.760
 wanted to start again but this 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.230
 Olympic games are due to the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.720
 from the calculation of the second world war 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.090
 canceled zamperini logs himself 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.919
 as a soldier then crashes must be 47 days 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.450
 on the open sea in a rubber boat 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.010
 over live and will then by the 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.569
 Japanese media picked up and 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.159
 comes in prisoner of war and must 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.750
 There a torture and hell 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.729
 experience and this long way one 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.290
 Mannes of the rise of the fall of 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.819
 under yokes and the second 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.829
 World War is behind in history 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.379
 to brocken and such a story 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.299
 such a biopics definitely worth watching 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.530
 only I somehow get how 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.519
 I will not be in front of this trailer 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.139
 anyway, watch because I have the 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.909
 find history exciting and because that 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.319
 a damned crass life has to be 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.209
 what design you have lived through and 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.199
 that's why it s.brocken so a movie there 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.359
 I would not be surprised if that 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.530
 predicate gets especially valuable and 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.609
 unfortunately not so completely 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.680
 is not seen by many 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.109
 Mainstream cinema but can definitely 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.699
 actually quite a lot and that's why 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.290
 somehow full of expectations though 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.940
 Trailer I can not like sometimes 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.829
 also happen that he quite like in the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.930
 comments because I'm through with mine 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.430
 trailer check to unbroken load like 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.560
 a thumb for this video made 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.849
 Let's not leave it that otherwise 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.530
 You know there are still a few left around 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.389
 me around and tomorrow at 15 o'clock 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.949
 Of course, at the latest a new video and 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.320
 I hope so for weeks again 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.320
 with the choice of course on 3
