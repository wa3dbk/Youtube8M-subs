even<00:00:12.660> more<00:00:12.929> specifically<00:00:13.469> when<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.799> came<00:00:14.009> to

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.689 
only were they extraordinarily excited
but<00:00:19.439> they're<00:00:19.560> also<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.800> little<00:00:20.010> nervous<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.609> get

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
but they're also a little nervous to get

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.640 
but they're also a little nervous to get
married<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.090> their<00:00:21.240> bride<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.080> chances<00:00:22.529> are

they're wearing a new suit and or a new
tux<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:26.580> kind<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> complicated<00:00:26.970> how

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
tux so it's kind of complicated how

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.060 
tux so it's kind of complicated how

he was the room was standing in one
particular<00:03:39.060> spot<00:03:39.240> I<00:03:39.420> had<00:03:39.630> him<00:03:39.750> take<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.930> couple

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
particular spot I had him take a couple

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.140 
particular spot I had him take a couple
steps<00:03:40.380> back<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.280> ended<00:03:41.520> up<00:03:41.610> liking<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.060> way

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
steps back and I ended up liking the way

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.880 
steps back and I ended up liking the way
that<00:03:42.360> light<00:03:42.540> worked<00:03:42.810> better<00:03:43.020> because<00:03:43.440> yes<00:03:43.680> he

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
that light worked better because yes he

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.470 
that light worked better because yes he
was<00:03:44.010> indoors<00:03:44.400> but<00:03:44.700> he<00:03:44.820> was<00:03:44.940> illuminated<00:03:45.450> by

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
was indoors but he was illuminated by

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.420 
was indoors but he was illuminated by
natural<00:03:46.080> light<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.680> we<00:03:46.740> got<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.890> mix<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.280> both

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
natural light so we got a mix of both

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.770 
natural light so we got a mix of both
lights<00:03:47.670> which<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:48.000> think<00:03:48.240> actually<00:03:48.420> had<00:03:48.750> a

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
lights which I think actually had a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.330 
lights which I think actually had a
little<00:03:49.050> bit<00:03:49.200> more<00:03:49.350> of<00:03:49.410> an<00:03:49.500> editorial<00:03:49.620> appeal

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
little bit more of an editorial appeal

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.700 
little bit more of an editorial appeal
