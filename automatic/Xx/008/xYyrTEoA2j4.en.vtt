the vehicle has sensors for the interior
is<00:01:48.909> quiet<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.569> everything<00:01:50.500> just<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:51.189> just

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
is quiet and everything just it just

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.399 
is quiet and everything just it just
works<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:54.030> 3.5<00:01:55.030> liter<00:01:55.090> EcoBoost<00:01:55.990> in<00:01:56.229> this

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
works the 3.5 liter EcoBoost in this

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.190 
works the 3.5 liter EcoBoost in this
truck<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.069> great<00:01:57.789> powerplant<00:01:58.149> really<00:01:58.869> the

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
truck is a great powerplant really the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.399 
truck is a great powerplant really the
torque<00:01:59.829> curve<00:02:00.099> actually<00:02:00.880> kicks<00:02:01.179> on<00:02:01.420> at<00:02:02.020> around

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
torque curve actually kicks on at around

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.469 
torque curve actually kicks on at around
2500<00:02:03.310> rpm<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:04.030> at<00:02:04.979> 2500<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.549> really<00:02:07.060> feel<00:02:07.329> it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
2500 rpm so at 2500 you really feel it

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.789 
2500 rpm so at 2500 you really feel it
you're<00:02:07.630> pushing<00:02:08.019> the<00:02:08.140> seat<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.560> it'll

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
you're pushing the seat and it'll

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.580 
you're pushing the seat and it'll
actually<00:02:08.979> break<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.789> rear<00:02:10.090> tires<00:02:10.329> loose<00:02:10.690> from

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
actually break the rear tires loose from

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.140 
actually break the rear tires loose from
a<00:02:11.680> rolling<00:02:11.920> start<00:02:12.340> which<00:02:12.579> is<00:02:12.610> pretty

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
a rolling start which is pretty

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.600 
a rolling start which is pretty
impressive<00:02:13.950> from<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.040> fuel<00:02:15.489> economy

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
impressive from a fuel economy

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.629 
impressive from a fuel economy
standpoint<00:02:16.540> over<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.139> past<00:02:17.350> week<00:02:18.010> we've

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:18.639 
standpoint over the past week we've

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.910 
standpoint over the past week we've
averaged<00:02:19.060> around<00:02:19.269> 18<00:02:19.870> miles<00:02:20.109> per<00:02:20.380> gallon<00:02:20.769> and

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
averaged around 18 miles per gallon and

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.550 
to say the Ford really did a good job
with<00:04:42.670> this<00:04:42.790> truck<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.390> know<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.990> lot<00:04:44.170> of<00:04:44.290> people

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
with this truck I know a lot of people

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.680 
with this truck I know a lot of people
are<00:04:44.860> probably<00:04:45.070> wondering<00:04:46.030> about<00:04:46.120> how<00:04:46.630> the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
are probably wondering about how the

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.600 
are probably wondering about how the
aluminum<00:04:47.380> body<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.920> going<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.220> hold<00:04:48.460> up

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
aluminum body is going to hold up

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.430 
aluminum body is going to hold up
especially<00:04:49.120> now<00:04:49.240> if<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.510> bed<00:04:49.690> is<00:04:49.720> aluminum<00:04:50.320> as

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
especially now if the bed is aluminum as

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.800 
especially now if the bed is aluminum as
well<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:51.060> from<00:04:52.060> a<00:04:52.180> fit<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.540> finish

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
well and from a fit and finish

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.570 
well and from a fit and finish
standpoint<00:04:53.320> they<00:04:53.710> hit<00:04:53.920> it<00:04:54.010> out<00:04:54.130> of<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.280> park

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
standpoint they hit it out of the park

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.210 
standpoint they hit it out of the park
this<00:04:54.640> truck<00:04:55.000> is<00:04:55.150> great<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:56.040> honestly<00:04:57.040> they've
