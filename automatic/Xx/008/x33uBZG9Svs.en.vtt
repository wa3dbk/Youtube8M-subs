I think so um it's not so bad it's not

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.070 
I think so um it's not so bad it's not
so<00:02:59.840> bad

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.740 

but<00:03:04.280> yeah<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.670> barbs<00:03:06.300> are<00:03:06.390> still<00:03:06.600> looking

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750

but yeah I think barbs are still looking
good<00:03:07.140> but<00:03:07.410> i'm<00:03:07.770> just<00:03:08.310> an<00:03:08.459> unexpected

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
good but i'm just an unexpected

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.990 
good but i'm just an unexpected
unexpected<00:03:10.319> change<00:03:11.100> in<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> patch<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.910> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
unexpected change in the patch in the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.140 
unexpected change in the patch in the
game<00:03:12.150> mechanics<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.080> i<00:03:13.440> will<00:03:14.069> have<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.490> go<00:03:14.819> over

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
game mechanics so i will have to go over

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.240 
game mechanics so i will have to go over
the<00:03:15.480> build<00:03:15.690> videos<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.230> i<00:03:16.260> made<00:03:16.530> adjust<00:03:17.069> them

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.130 
the build videos that i made adjust them
slightly<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.450> builds<00:03:18.690> are<00:03:18.810> still<00:03:19.050> gonna

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
slightly like the builds are still gonna

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.780 
slightly like the builds are still gonna
