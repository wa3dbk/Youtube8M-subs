what's up guys do you guys want an
in-depth<00:00:02.010> analysis<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.330> new<00:00:03.540> mass<00:00:03.959> effect

3<00:00:04.620> trailer<00:00:04.950> that<00:00:05.250> was<00:00:05.370> aired<00:00:05.670> on<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.120> vgas

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
3 trailer that was aired on the vgas

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:14.830 
3 trailer that was aired on the vgas
last<00:00:06.899> night<00:00:07.109> let's<00:00:07.560> do<00:00:07.799> it

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.960 

okay<00:00:15.770> so<00:00:15.830> first<00:00:16.100> of<00:00:16.309> all<00:00:16.340> I'm<00:00:16.550> going<00:00:16.700> to<00:00:16.790> stop

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
okay so first of all I'm going to stop

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.060 
okay so first of all I'm going to stop
it<00:00:17.090> right<00:00:17.360> there<00:00:17.440> if<00:00:18.440> you<00:00:18.560> look<00:00:18.740> at<00:00:18.860> all<00:00:19.040> of

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
it right there if you look at all of

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.030 
it right there if you look at all of
that<00:00:19.340> that's<00:00:19.670> turian<00:00:20.210> architecture<00:00:20.840> on<00:00:21.140> that

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
that that's turian architecture on that

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.730 
that that's turian architecture on that
tower<00:00:22.310> those<00:00:23.090> ships<00:00:23.480> those<00:00:24.140> are<00:00:24.320> all<00:00:24.439> terrian

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
tower those ships those are all terrian

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.290 
tower those ships those are all terrian
so<00:00:26.950> see<00:00:27.950> that<00:00:28.130> right<00:00:28.250> there<00:00:28.310> for<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:28.880> second<00:00:29.210> I

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
so see that right there for a second I

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.779 
so see that right there for a second I
thought<00:00:29.330> it<00:00:29.599> was<00:00:29.660> too<00:00:30.170> chonka<00:00:30.590> but<00:00:30.890> I'm<00:00:31.100> pretty

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
thought it was too chonka but I'm pretty

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.560 
thought it was too chonka but I'm pretty
certain<00:00:32.629> that<00:00:33.110> that<00:00:33.350> is<00:00:33.710> pal<00:00:34.010> oven<00:00:34.570> just

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
certain that that is pal oven just

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.500 
certain that that is pal oven just
because<00:00:35.780> of<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.900> architecture<00:00:36.860> palvin<00:00:37.820> also

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
because of the architecture palvin also

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.900 
because of the architecture palvin also
is<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:39.020> planet<00:00:39.620> that<00:00:39.650> has<00:00:39.949> a<00:00:39.980> lot<00:00:40.220> of<00:00:40.280> radiation

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
is a planet that has a lot of radiation

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.910 
is a planet that has a lot of radiation
on<00:00:41.059> it<00:00:41.210> that's<00:00:41.390> why<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.600> Tyrians<00:00:42.080> have<00:00:42.680> that

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
on it that's why the Tyrians have that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.009 
on it that's why the Tyrians have that
strong<00:00:43.280> skin<00:00:43.730> just<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.269> architecture<00:00:44.809> kind

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
strong skin just the architecture kind

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.170 
strong skin just the architecture kind
of<00:00:45.140> gives<00:00:45.500> it<00:00:45.650> away<00:00:45.739> as<00:00:46.129> probably<00:00:46.910> being

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
of gives it away as probably being

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.220 
of gives it away as probably being
paladin<00:00:47.840> at<00:00:48.079> least<00:00:48.320> I<00:00:48.710> haven't<00:00:49.370> heard<00:00:49.610> anybody

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
paladin at least I haven't heard anybody

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.080 
paladin at least I haven't heard anybody
confirm<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.649> yet<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.370> this<00:00:52.460> is<00:00:52.520> most<00:00:52.820> likely

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
confirm it yet so this is most likely

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.330 
confirm it yet so this is most likely
palette<00:00:53.630> getting<00:00:53.899> to<00:00:53.989> that<00:00:54.110> Tower<00:00:54.410> I<00:00:54.829> don't

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
palette getting to that Tower I don't

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.840 
palette getting to that Tower I don't
know<00:00:55.550> Cameron<00:00:57.760> that<00:00:58.760> closet<00:00:59.570> again<00:00:59.660> is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
know Cameron that closet again is

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.320 
know Cameron that closet again is
Arachne<00:01:01.850> husk<00:01:02.739> who<00:01:03.739> is<00:01:03.950> that<00:01:04.160> that's<00:01:04.729> in<00:01:04.970> pots

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
Arachne husk who is that that's in pots

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.600 
Arachne husk who is that that's in pots
probably<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.840> new<00:01:06.170> Krogan<00:01:06.590> he<00:01:06.740> kind<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.250> looks

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
probably a new Krogan he kind of looks

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.109 
probably a new Krogan he kind of looks
like<00:01:07.729> Oh<00:01:08.240> Keir<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.380> colors<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:09.979> means<00:01:10.190> those

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
like Oh Keir the colors that means those

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.090 
like Oh Keir the colors that means those
brown<00:01:11.420> colors<00:01:11.750> means<00:01:11.990> he's<00:01:12.140> an<00:01:12.259> older<00:01:12.649> Krogan

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
brown colors means he's an older Krogan

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.010 
brown colors means he's an older Krogan
he's<00:01:13.430> probably<00:01:13.640> going<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.060> be<00:01:14.149> a<00:01:14.180> new<00:01:14.450> new

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
he's probably going to be a new new

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.410 
he's probably going to be a new new
squad<00:01:15.619> number<00:01:15.979> because<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.399> is<00:01:16.550> not<00:01:16.580> Rex<00:01:17.119> and

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
squad number because that is not Rex and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.510 
squad number because that is not Rex and
that's<00:01:17.869> not<00:01:17.990> grunt<00:01:18.350> although<00:01:18.890> he's<00:01:19.280> probably

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
that's not grunt although he's probably

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.790 
that's not grunt although he's probably
not<00:01:19.880> part<00:01:20.149> of<00:01:20.209> the<00:01:20.300> team<00:01:20.539> though<00:01:20.780> because<00:01:21.050> he

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
not part of the team though because he

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.980 
not part of the team though because he
Shepherd<00:01:22.490> or<00:01:22.610> we<00:01:23.060> will<00:01:23.240> see<00:01:23.420> later<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.750> he

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
Shepherd or we will see later that he

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.930 
Shepherd or we will see later that he
does<00:01:24.140> have<00:01:24.350> already<00:01:24.709> his<00:01:25.160> team<00:01:25.429> members<00:01:25.759> it's

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
does have already his team members it's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.109 
does have already his team members it's
garrus<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.450> Vega<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.459> don't<00:01:28.640> know<00:01:28.729> who<00:01:28.940> this

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
garrus and Vega so I don't know who this

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.990 
garrus and Vega so I don't know who this
is<00:01:29.179> I'm<00:01:29.869> on<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.259> fence<00:01:30.440> of<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:31.009> being<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.550> this

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
is I'm on the fence of it being of this

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.740 
is I'm on the fence of it being of this
planet<00:01:32.450> being<00:01:32.660> too<00:01:32.899> chonka<00:01:33.380> or<00:01:33.890> pelvin<00:01:34.819> it

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
planet being too chonka or pelvin it

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.190 
planet being too chonka or pelvin it
looks<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.229> lot<00:01:36.649> like<00:01:36.890> Tatanka<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.759> this<00:01:38.509> Krogan

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
looks a lot like Tatanka and this Krogan

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.499 
looks a lot like Tatanka and this Krogan
is<00:01:39.410> kind<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:39.860> giving<00:01:40.009> it<00:01:40.310> away<00:01:40.429> as<00:01:40.819> being<00:01:41.149> too

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
is kind of giving it away as being too

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.660 
is kind of giving it away as being too
chunka<00:01:41.929> just<00:01:42.140> because<00:01:42.410> he's<00:01:42.560> probably<00:01:42.770> just<00:01:43.399> a

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
chunka just because he's probably just a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
chunka just because he's probably just a
follower<00:01:44.539> and<00:01:44.869> not<00:01:44.929> so<00:01:45.349> much<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:46.330> squad<00:01:47.330> number

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
follower and not so much a squad number

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.139 
follower and not so much a squad number
so<00:01:48.020> I'm<00:01:48.289> still<00:01:48.860> on<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:48.979> fence<00:01:49.069> but<00:01:49.429> just<00:01:49.849> the

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
so I'm still on the fence but just the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.770 
so I'm still on the fence but just the
architecture<00:01:50.990> really<00:01:51.440> looks<00:01:52.009> like<00:01:52.780> tourney

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
architecture really looks like tourney

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.240 
architecture really looks like tourney
and<00:01:53.990> architecture<00:01:54.530> let<00:01:54.770> me<00:01:54.860> look<00:01:54.979> at<00:01:55.099> those

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
and architecture let me look at those

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.820 
and architecture let me look at those
those<00:01:55.910> tiles<00:01:56.270> on<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.569> ground<00:01:56.840> those<00:01:57.410> sharp

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
those tiles on the ground those sharp

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.719 
those tiles on the ground those sharp
geometric<00:01:58.250> shapes<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.360> looks<00:01:59.720> too<00:01:59.989> much<00:02:00.020> like

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
geometric shapes it looks too much like

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.540 
geometric shapes it looks too much like
paladin<00:02:01.729> for<00:02:02.090> me<00:02:02.209> to<00:02:02.330> really<00:02:02.890> think<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.190> hundred

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
paladin for me to really think a hundred

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.630 
paladin for me to really think a hundred
percent<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:05.209> is<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.509> chonka<00:02:05.929> so<00:02:06.640> it's

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
percent that this is to chonka so it's
