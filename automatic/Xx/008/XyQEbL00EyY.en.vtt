get you to recreate the dish at home so

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.400 
get you to recreate the dish at home so

if I dissect one of my favorite

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.800 
if I dissect one of my favorite
restaurant<00:03:34.920> dishes<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:36.060> appears<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.570> me

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
restaurant dishes and it appears to me

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.509 
restaurant dishes and it appears to me
it's<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.260> example<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.010> came<00:03:38.130> up<00:03:38.340> with

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
it's the example that I came up with

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.729 
it's the example that I came up with
chicken<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.209> white<00:03:39.450> wine<00:03:39.750> sauce<00:03:40.350> with

chicken and white wine sauce with
shallots<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.400> would<00:03:41.820> appear<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.239> me<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.600> if

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
shallots it would appear to me that if

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.449 
shallots it would appear to me that if
there's<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.140> brown<00:03:43.500> coating<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.250> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
there's a brown coating on it the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.880 
there's a brown coating on it the
chicken<00:03:44.760> was<00:03:44.910> sauteed<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.720> oil<00:03:45.989> if<00:03:46.320> it's<00:03:46.680> nice

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
chicken was sauteed in oil if it's nice

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.800 
chicken was sauteed in oil if it's nice
and<00:03:47.130> crispy<00:03:47.670> especially<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.390> might<00:03:48.570> have<00:03:48.720> been

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
and crispy especially it might have been

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.320 
and crispy especially it might have been
roasted<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.530> brushed<00:03:50.310> with<00:03:50.580> oil<00:03:50.880> but<00:03:51.150> there's

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
roasted and brushed with oil but there's

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.990 
roasted and brushed with oil but there's
a<00:03:51.390> direct<00:03:51.870> heat<00:03:52.230> there<00:03:52.590> what<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.459> would<00:03:53.700> do<00:03:53.850> is

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
a direct heat there what I would do is

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.520 
a direct heat there what I would do is
probably<00:03:54.180> saute<00:03:54.750> chicken<00:03:54.780> breast<00:03:55.320> in<00:03:55.470> a
