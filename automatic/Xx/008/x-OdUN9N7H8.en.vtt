find myself always training multiple
virtual<00:00:09.990> machines<00:00:10.460> constantly<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.610> they're

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
virtual machines constantly and they're

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.030 
virtual machines constantly and they're
basically<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.240> same<00:00:12.269> concept<00:00:12.780> it's<00:00:13.650> either<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
need a virtual machine that's up and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.810 
need a virtual machine that's up and
running<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.380> I'm<00:00:34.469> gonna<00:00:34.620> show<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.829> guys<00:00:35.100> how

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
to take a snapshot of it so let's take a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.440 
to take a snapshot of it so let's take a
snapshot<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.810> let's<00:01:54.990> call<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.290> stable

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
snapshot and let's call it stable

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
gonna bring my library and so let's say

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.320 
gonna bring my library and so let's say
you<00:02:38.100> want<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.400> create<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.790> virtual<00:02:39.120> machine

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
you want to create a virtual machine

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.480 
you want to create a virtual machine
using<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.110> template<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.800> created<00:02:40.830> so

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
using the template that we created so

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.130 
using the template that we created so
the<00:02:42.000> next<00:02:42.180> thing<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.510> want<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.720> do<00:02:42.900> is

the next thing that you want to do is
within<00:02:43.650> your<00:02:43.800> library<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.580> here<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:45.060> want

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
within your library right here you want

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.710 
within your library right here you want

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
gonna click on next

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.490 
gonna click on next
give<00:03:41.400> your<00:03:41.630> virtual<00:03:42.630> machine<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.900> name<00:03:43.200> and

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
give your virtual machine a name and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.520 
give your virtual machine a name and
we're<00:03:43.590> gonna<00:03:43.680> do<00:03:43.890> BJ<00:03:44.310> test<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:45.230> give<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.350> a

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
we're gonna do BJ test and give it a

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.780 
we're gonna do BJ test and give it a
location<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:47.910> I'm<00:03:48.390> going<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:48.989> put<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:49.920> where

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
location so I'm going to put this where

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.210 
location so I'm going to put this where
my<00:03:50.820> other<00:03:51.239> virtual<00:03:51.690> machines<00:03:52.170> are<00:03:52.440> located

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
my other virtual machines are located

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.240 
my other virtual machines are located
and<00:03:53.340> create<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.299> nice<00:03:54.810> little<00:03:55.019> folder<00:03:55.470> core<00:03:55.709> BJ

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
and create a nice little folder core BJ

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.490 
and create a nice little folder core BJ
test<00:03:56.549> again<00:03:57.390> this<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.690> really<00:03:57.959> up<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.320> you

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500

which is pretty cool and we're gonna
start<00:04:13.049> our<00:04:13.140> virtual<00:04:13.530> machine<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:13.980> see<00:04:14.100> what

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
start our virtual machine and see what

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:22.180 
start our virtual machine and see what
happens

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.070

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
I think I'm gonna be doing this a lot I

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.460

think<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.360> only<00:04:32.509> thing<00:04:32.780> that<00:04:32.990> I'm<00:04:33.139> kind<00:04:33.409> of

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
think the only thing that I'm kind of

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.059 
think the only thing that I'm kind of
gonna<00:04:33.800> nitpick<00:04:34.340> is<00:04:35.650> kind<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:36.680> change<00:04:36.919> the

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
gonna nitpick is kind of change the

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.189 
gonna nitpick is kind of change the
naming<00:04:37.370> scheme<00:04:37.520> rather<00:04:38.509> than<00:04:38.629> doing<00:04:38.810> BJ

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
naming scheme rather than doing BJ

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.320 
naming scheme rather than doing BJ
template<00:04:39.650> I<00:04:39.680> might<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:40.099> probably<00:04:40.310> do<00:04:40.580> like<00:04:40.699> BJ<00:04:41.120> -

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
template I might I probably do like BJ -

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
guys because I had to give the Machine a

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.969 
guys because I had to give the Machine a
name<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.270> as<00:04:53.479> well<00:04:53.689> as<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.960> local<00:04:54.500> account<00:04:54.770> to
