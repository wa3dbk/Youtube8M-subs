 the advance of the river of the silver ' 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.730
 of semaphore services that generated a 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.400
 true chaos in transit according to 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.610
 ute primary information about 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.310

 hour evaluating the damages throughout the country

 at any time we will go live 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.790
 precisely to the executive tower the 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.800
 most intense moment of the storm in 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.530
 Montevideo was recorded around noon 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.250
 and it became chaotic the situation of those who 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.250
 they were on the street 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.060
 although we all knew that there was a 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.620
 great storm 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.870
 maybe the morning tonic in the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.360
 capital has been the surprise starting 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.180
 from mid-morning there, the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.280
 winds and rains and it was still complicated 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.110
 much more the circumstance that came from 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.690
 the early morning and the first hours of 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.750
 day with several fallen trees many leaf 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.880
 in the street complications to circulate 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.340
 many places where there were no traffic lights 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.730
 but mid-morning really the wind 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.500
 further complicated the situation there and in 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.470
 places like Independence Square will 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.010
 he clearly noticed that the thing was going to 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.010
 greater 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.320
 one hour 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.120
 way to cross for now we're crossing 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.470
 several has seen the quotient in skill 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.930
 and taxis 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.200
 the iron benches flew from their place 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.570
 the squares began to walk by the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.300
 square and everything was really transformed into 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.700
 chaos was difficult to walk they started to 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.830
 pedestrians and disappear 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.950
 began to break the glasses of 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.180
 buildings bordering the executive tower 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.880
 well the pressure of pendence where the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.730
 wind really complicates things but 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.490
 where the landscape of 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.020
 how the storm got into capital was 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.940
 in the ravine of Montevideo 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.950
 really a sudestada of proportions 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.650
 that lead again to the king of silver 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.660
 to hit the walls of the ravine 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.880
 of montevideo making it really difficult 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.300
 the circulation of vehicles in the 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.300
 rambla
