00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.950
 that of girls so I come back 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.779
 today in a video that was me 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.460
 asked on facebook about how I have 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.230
 made to have red hair whose 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.130
 I did you see but in the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.060
 last videos I had red so 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.619
 so I'll explain everything to you 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.810
 I did to have to go black 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.900
 red 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.360
 and how much did it cost me 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 and since this morning I have a hippie in 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.050
 the bangs I've never had pics in 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.579
 my bangs the agent nothing and it stresses me 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.960
 it's a sick thing 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.910
 well short so first of all how 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.809
 I did to remove black mount 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.629
 done so I used the foundation I 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.329
 wanted some colorful but my hair 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.100
 have not appreciated the fact of 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.440
 discolouring is to make red after 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.710
 so suddenly what I did is that 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.309
 I talked a bit with my cell 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.539
 of love who advised me to buy in 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 does it too what products 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:12.929
 healthy for his henna hair all that 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.229
 so nothing catastrophic and that we will 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.690
 say so suddenly she confided to me the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.860
 color of cats 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.630
 so it's a product that withdraws without 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.209
 damage your hair so there is no 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.090
 ammonia nothing and in fact it removes 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:33.149
 all your previous coloring 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.099
 so that's what I did so I'll you 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.360
 play the video link right there this 

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:39.149
 that I'm doing a video on the color of 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.160
 frames we just wanted there and so here 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.130
 the color of cats and cost me 12 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.509
 euros 50 true port included on ebay so 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.759
 play the link see info if that you 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.250
 interested 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.190
 so that's after 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.170
 so I was at my hairdresser at the base 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.550
 I did not think of doing it directly 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.039
 after the color bay 4 years wait 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.300
 two three weeks but he told me no 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:05.099
 exactly you sir do now 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.470
 like that like your hair and draws we go 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.489
 to say that the color goes better hook 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.759
 on it so you better do it 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.890
 now 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.180
 so suddenly that's what I did I 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.950
 had the magazine so bercy done 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.959
 now 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.420
 and so here is in fact I hesitated 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.480
 between a bright red or red 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.370
 cherry is so in fact if he made me 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.420
 the antrum-2 so this sentence to a tie and dye 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.970
 the watch in other words a number and r 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.000
 so in fact it made me taste a bit 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.129
 flashy on the top and he left in 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.720
 cherry red underneath so we see 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:43.200
 although the top and a lot more 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:45.180
 red that the rest so here I have 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.879
 so if he uses the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.129
 organic products and pure pigments for 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.549
 to do the colorations in fact you 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.110
 say no pro-life l'oréal style and 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.549
 so I'm really 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.700
 pigments all that in order to do so 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.370
 the note was rather salty from palm had 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.480
 makes an estimate of 90 euros 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.780
 and in the end I came out with 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.069
 123 wheels so that's it makes me shit 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.440
 but all the time I wanted hard where 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.609
 I have them I do not care about it 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.250
 had not warned himself enormously 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.450
 of maintenance and as I did not have 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.459
 planned to do directly 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.200
 I had bought nothing to maintain it I 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.450
 really thought predict troubles have 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.230
 make you all and after finally and before 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.909
 buy the products 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.919
 except that I play as I do on a 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.720
 head shot I had nothing for 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.489
 maintain my hair and he told me 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.400
 especially that do not wash them with 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.810
 shampoos 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.310
 that are not suitable for hair 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.610
 red otherwise you will remove all the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.250
 color 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.599
 so suddenly I'm directly 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.860
 coming home from the hairdresser 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.680
 directly i am eager to buy 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.989
 products except that sami super 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.909
 a long time coming Saturday a week and 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.680
 half and for a week and a half 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.109
 I had to use the dry shampoo so 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.390
 I was well that baptizes him as 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.069
 vehicle but for a week a 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.450
 mini shampoo dry and where I felt 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.030
 just barley barter and you got it to me 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.159
 every day it's horrible so what 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.819
 I received my order so in fact 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.819
 I had to buy care 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.090
 so pigmented at the base I had been 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.220
 at a wholesaler who sell it and 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.889
 vingrau cd l'oréal and I assure you 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.959
 l'oréal and my hairdresser had me 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.630
 recommended example raves at night 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.010
 tricolor cream so yielded evening against 7 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.000
 first so his pigmented drawings I 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:32.590
 would you like to see red caskill 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.229
 so you see it's red and actually 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.550
 that I paid them 22 euros 80 / master 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:46.490
 cap I write it in shades 600 red 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.139
 fire so here it is top for press in 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.940
 makes his fame of color what the 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.590
 red tends to leave at each 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.990
 shampoo except that once you put 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.449
 it makes me feel so 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.860
 your red does not fade at 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.900
 contrary more and more red 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.080
 so here it is looted begins 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.180
 seriously to take my head and 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.500
 then on the site elsewhere because 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.639
 the same for my shows justice no 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.750
 anything at the base I wanted 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.360
 buy I wanted to use the 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.740
 shampoos the egg except that it's 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.349
 strongly discouraged to use the 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.479
 shampoos the eye on the hair 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.870
 colorful flashy and I did 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.940
 the experience when I had 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.710
 school would have been obliged to do all 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.310
 the scenes while normally it lasts 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.440
 three weeks 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.910
 so that's so I had seen 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.300
 aude to make up I think I speak of 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:37.770
 shampoos his sweat so elsewhere 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.500
 breast shampoos we will say for the 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.620
 red hair so that's the mark 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.020
 giovanni the flames glueers notice 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.840
 wheat the ear is actually the age and 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.290
 the shampoo and the sloping page 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.110
 so they are top it looks super beautiful 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.150
 the red fruit 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.960
 so that's what I find it 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.030
 montrouge bassens who leave not here 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.430
 So here I do not know what you 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.000
 to say I ended up with my street and on my 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.910
 red hair 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.190
 in all the colossi do I took 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:16.020
 So that must come 68 euros and 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:19.230
 a few and that I have more of each 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.250
 it was 6 euros per unit I think 5 euros 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.150
 the unit choice I had to see there 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:26.460
 was rolling 4 and that's so it 's 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.890
 the interview I can not wash them 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.940
 cabbage with anything 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.300
 at the very beginning I made my color 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.160
 I had pink red red ears 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.650
 fluo 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.650
 so here but if not here I am very 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.640
 happy to have passed the course of my 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.480
 red hair it was one of my 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.300
 goals of the year 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.010
 so that's it and I think I'm not going 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.570
 not redo this stupidity that at each 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.960
 once once I get tired of 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.220
 colors I redo black and in the end 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.980
 black is one of the most 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.420
 difficult to remove and it's a 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.010
 color too much matte jamie no 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.990
 it was then starting to take on the 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:04.620
 head 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.010
 so that's so I have my red I 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.240
 keep 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.800
