00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.280 
really important to make sure that
you're<00:02:22.880> always<00:02:23.090> pulling<00:02:23.450> an<00:02:23.720> iron<00:02:23.900> through

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
you're always pulling an iron through

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.660 
you're always pulling an iron through
and<00:02:24.590> you're<00:02:24.709> not<00:02:24.770> letting<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.100> sit<00:02:25.340> on<00:02:25.490> what

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
and you're not letting it sit on what

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.910 
and you're not letting it sit on what
section<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.209> your<00:02:26.300> hair<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.560> doesn't

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
section of your hair so it doesn't

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.300 

again

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
again

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.670 
again
pull<00:02:38.310> through<00:02:38.990> any<00:02:39.990> pieces<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.470> don't

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
pull through any pieces that you don't

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.440 
pull through any pieces that you don't
get<00:02:40.890> didn't<00:02:41.520> quit<00:02:41.670> get<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.030> guy<00:02:42.180> right<00:02:42.390> here

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
get didn't quit get this guy right here

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.330 
get didn't quit get this guy right here
you<00:02:42.959> can<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.110> go<00:02:43.319> back<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.680> redo<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.010> it's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
you can just go back and redo it it's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.830 
you can just go back and redo it it's
easier<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.910> wait<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.360> cool<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.690> little

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
easier to wait for it to cool a little

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.949 
easier to wait for it to cool a little
and<00:02:46.200> then<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.530> back<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.860> my<00:02:46.950> knees<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.810> now<00:02:48.900> I'm

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
and then go back to my knees so now I'm

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.720 
and then go back to my knees so now I'm
using<00:02:49.050> this<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.470> do<00:02:49.650> shorty<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.280> kind<00:02:50.490> of<00:02:50.550> get

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
using this to do shorty to kind of get

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.240 
using this to do shorty to kind of get
at<00:02:51.090> my<00:02:51.270> bangs<00:02:51.480> lay<00:02:52.319> them<00:02:52.500> down<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.709> little<00:02:52.830> down

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
at my bangs lay them down a little down

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.670 
at my bangs lay them down a little down
a<00:02:53.280> little<00:02:53.459> bit<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.730> wave<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.209> them<00:02:54.410> I'm<00:02:55.410> halfway

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
a little bit of wave to them I'm halfway

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.770 
a little bit of wave to them I'm halfway
through<00:02:55.860> my<00:02:56.040> transformation<00:02:56.819> from<00:02:56.850> straight

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
through my transformation from straight

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:11.080 
through my transformation from straight
to<00:02:58.050> curly<00:02:58.970> not<00:02:59.970> my<00:03:00.330> hair<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.630> they'll<00:03:00.810> do

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.119 

so<00:03:11.660> here's<00:03:11.870> my<00:03:11.989> final<00:03:12.200> transformation<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:13.099> the

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
so here's my final transformation of the

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.240 
so here's my final transformation of the
updo<00:03:13.870> really<00:03:14.870> excited<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.379> see<00:03:15.560> what
