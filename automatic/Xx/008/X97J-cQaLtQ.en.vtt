00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 the gender the gender so many questions that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.210
 there has been in humanity about that there 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.730
 a philosopher that I like to quote always 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.340
 he managed to synthesize very well what for me 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.580
 means man with man and woman with 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:24.539
 woman in the same way in 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.670
 contrary, the important thing is the soul and the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.359
 spirit as it is possible that in this 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.910
 country let's be so so morrong 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 then as I do not share those 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.510
 philosophies here we are going to start doing 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.440
 some challenges and that's why I'm going to invite a 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.149
 friend to do things we do 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.370
 women so that we sensitize ourselves 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.829
 because it is very fashionable and in the books 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.510
 I read self - help we always 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.059
 they say you have to be sensitive to the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.100
 another I want to be sensitized with the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.329
 male gender and I want it to happen what 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.269
 same in vice versa so in the company of 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.159
 of my clothes I want to invite my friend 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:09.189

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:19.460
 you are already prepared to put yourself in 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.920
 the role of a woman because I was 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.720
 gives the barry wave wins for that because 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.009
 you are here and because your manhood can be 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.689
 questioned if you do not you want that 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.369

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.369
