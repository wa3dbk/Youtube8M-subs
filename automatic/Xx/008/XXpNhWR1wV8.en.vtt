the<00:02:42.569> reality<00:02:42.989> is<00:02:43.319> started<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.739> sink<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.280> has

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
the reality is started to sink in has

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.580 
the reality is started to sink in has
been<00:02:44.910> for<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.209> last<00:02:45.300> few<00:02:45.480> weeks<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.900> there

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
is probably not coming back so this team

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.290 
is probably not coming back so this team
is<00:02:49.260> kind<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.590> running<00:02:49.950> out<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.130> gas<00:02:50.489> at<00:02:51.239> the

them through around it two of the
playoff<00:02:59.850> yeah<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.420> puts<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.630> lot<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.810> pressure

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
playoff yeah that puts a lot of pressure

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.600 
playoff yeah that puts a lot of pressure
on<00:03:01.140> them<00:03:01.410> mentally<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.100> physically<00:03:02.489> so

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
on them mentally and physically so

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.309 
on them mentally and physically so
considering<00:03:03.269> all<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.540> how<00:03:03.720> far<00:03:03.959> can<00:03:04.080> they<00:03:04.200> go

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
considering all that how far can they go

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.600 
considering all that how far can they go
this<00:03:04.530> year<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.940> would<00:03:05.940> be<00:03:06.090> surprised<00:03:06.690> if<00:03:07.610> they

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
this year I would be surprised if they

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.630 
this year I would be surprised if they
got<00:03:09.080> anywhere<00:03:10.080> past<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.800> second<00:03:11.160> round<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.550> I

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
got anywhere past the second round and I

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.460 
got anywhere past the second round and I
know<00:03:11.730> there's<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.090> lot<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.239> people<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.840> think

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
know there's a lot of people that think

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.350 
know there's a lot of people that think
they<00:03:13.680> won't<00:03:14.100> even<00:03:14.280> get<00:03:14.459> there<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.180> get

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
they won't even get there so we get

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.460 
they won't even get there so we get
balanced<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.900> first<00:03:16.140> round<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
balanced in the first round of the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.289 
balanced in the first round of the
playoffs<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:17.040> all<00:03:17.130> depends<00:03:17.549> on<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.700> matchups

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
playoffs it all depends on the matchups

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.229 
playoffs it all depends on the matchups
as<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:19.110> always<00:03:19.230> does<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.489> playoffs<00:03:20.970> I

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
as it always does in the playoffs I

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.680 
as it always does in the playoffs I
think<00:03:21.720> they<00:03:21.950> could<00:03:22.950> be<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.549> team<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.120> Brooklyn

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
think they could be a team like Brooklyn

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.650 
think they could be a team like Brooklyn
they<00:03:25.140> could<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:26.040> Knicks<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.150> don't<00:03:27.480> see

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
they could be the Knicks but I don't see

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.140 
they could be the Knicks but I don't see
them<00:03:27.870> beating<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.860> theme<00:03:29.070> like<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.430> Pacers<00:03:29.910> I

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
them beating the theme like the Pacers I

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.069 
them beating the theme like the Pacers I
don't<00:03:30.930> see<00:03:31.170> any<00:03:31.769> chance<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.730> them<00:03:32.970> beating<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
don't see any chance of them beating the

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.759 
don't see any chance of them beating the
Miami<00:03:34.440> Heat<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:35.250> they're<00:03:36.030> looking<00:03:36.480> at<00:03:36.769> max

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
Miami Heat so they're looking at max

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.979 
Miami Heat so they're looking at max
probably<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.579> ceiling<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.420> second<00:03:39.870> round

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
probably a ceiling of the second round

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.140 
probably a ceiling of the second round
of<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.260> playoffs<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:41.010> if<00:03:41.489> they<00:03:41.730> got<00:03:41.940> their

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
of the playoffs and if they got their

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.490 
of the playoffs and if they got their
friend<00:03:42.480> Bulls<00:03:42.690> fans<00:03:42.959> don't<00:03:43.200> want<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.410> hear

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
friend Bulls fans don't want to hear

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.020 
friend Bulls fans don't want to hear
this<00:03:43.680> but<00:03:43.739> if<00:03:43.950> they<00:03:44.100> got<00:03:44.310> there<00:03:44.579> given<00:03:44.910> the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
this but if they got there given the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.330 
this but if they got there given the
circumstances<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.079> given<00:03:46.709> all<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.950> injuries

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
circumstances and given all the injuries

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.039 
circumstances and given all the injuries
they've<00:03:47.519> dealt<00:03:47.730> with<00:03:47.940> this<00:03:48.120> season<00:03:48.540> that

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
they've dealt with this season that

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.530 
they've dealt with this season that
would<00:03:49.260> be<00:03:49.440> great<00:03:50.160> for<00:03:50.670> Toms<00:03:50.910> divot<00:03:51.239> on<00:03:51.359> this

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
would be great for Toms divot on this

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.360 
would be great for Toms divot on this

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
wondering who could beat the miami heat

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.800 
wondering who could beat the miami heat
right<00:03:54.840> now<00:03:55.250> nobody<00:03:56.420> imagined<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.540> know<00:03:57.660> what

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
right now nobody imagined you know what

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.210 
right now nobody imagined you know what
that<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.140> age-old<00:03:58.410> question<00:03:58.440> for<00:03:59.130> the

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
that the age-old question for the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.670 
that the age-old question for the
chicago<00:03:59.700> business<00:03:59.940> even<00:04:00.630> if<00:04:00.840> Derek<00:04:01.079> were<00:04:01.440> a

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
chicago business even if Derek were a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.979 
chicago business even if Derek were a
hundred<00:04:02.010> percent<00:04:02.310> healthy<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.030> back<00:04:03.239> that

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
hundred percent healthy and back that

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.220 
hundred percent healthy and back that
still<00:04:04.500> be<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:06.120> ceiling<00:04:06.660> they're<00:04:06.870> running

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
still be the ceiling they're running

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.720 
still be the ceiling they're running
into<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.739> that's<00:04:07.859> going<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.160> be<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.340> case<00:04:08.519> the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
into and that's going to be the case the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.460 
into and that's going to be the case the
next<00:04:09.000> couple<00:04:09.209> years<00:04:09.359> assuming<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.079> Miami

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
next couple years assuming the Miami

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.190 
next couple years assuming the Miami
stays<00:04:10.769> intact<00:04:11.280> how<00:04:12.000> can<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.420> Bulls<00:04:12.630> get<00:04:12.930> past

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
stays intact how can the Bulls get past

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.110 
stays intact how can the Bulls get past
the<00:04:13.410> heat<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:14.010> think<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.700> that's<00:04:14.730> the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
the heat and I think that that's the

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.969 
the heat and I think that that's the
fear<00:04:15.390> within<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.900> organization<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.769> right

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
fear within the organization is right

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.009 
fear within the organization is right
now<00:04:17.220> given<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.150> peace<00:04:18.329> that<00:04:18.479> they<00:04:18.660> have<00:04:18.870> they

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
now given the peace that they have they

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.539 
now given the peace that they have they
may<00:04:19.169> not<00:04:19.289> be<00:04:19.350> able<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.859> all<00:04:20.220> right<00:04:20.370> Nick

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
may not be able to all right Nick

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.099 
may not be able to all right Nick
