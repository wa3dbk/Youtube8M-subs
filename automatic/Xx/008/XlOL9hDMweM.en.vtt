00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
two main kicks that we use the scuba

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.929 
two main kicks that we use the scuba
divers<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.590> they<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> flutter<00:00:29.490> kick<00:00:29.580> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
divers and they are the flutter kick and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
divers and they are the flutter kick and
the<00:00:30.510> frog<00:00:30.750> kick<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.410> important

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the frog kick and it's really important

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.330 
the frog kick and it's really important
that<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.980> understand<00:00:32.399> when<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.420> use<00:00:33.600> each<00:00:34.020> one

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
that you understand when to use each one

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.410 
that you understand when to use each one
because<00:00:35.340> by<00:00:35.460> doing<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:35.969> you're<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> be

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
because by doing so you're going to be

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.000 
because by doing so you're going to be
able<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> stay<00:00:36.930> underwater<00:00:37.170> longer<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.920> be

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
able to stay underwater longer and be

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
able to stay underwater longer and be
able<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.219> conserve<00:00:38.489> your<00:00:38.550> gas<00:00:38.910> supply<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
able to conserve your gas supply so the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.139 
able to conserve your gas supply so the
flutter<00:00:40.440> kick<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.730> assuming<00:00:41.910> my

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
flutter kick is and you know assuming my

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.060 
flutter kick is and you know assuming my
hands<00:00:42.450> were<00:00:42.570> my<00:00:42.690> feet<00:00:42.930> actually<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> one

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
hands were my feet actually is the one

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.229 
hands were my feet actually is the one
that<00:00:44.219> most<00:00:44.370> people<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.789> which<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.030> kind<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that most people do which is kind of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.400 
that most people do which is kind of
like<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> freestyle<00:00:45.809> kick<00:00:46.079> where<00:00:46.289> you're

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
like a freestyle kick where you're

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.529 
like a freestyle kick where you're
kicking<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> what<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
kicking like this so this is what the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.420 
kicking like this so this is what the
flutter<00:00:48.750> kick<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> kick

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
flutter kick is and this is the kick

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.760 
flutter kick is and this is the kick
that<00:00:50.460> most<00:00:50.789> people<00:00:51.090> will<00:00:51.210> naturally<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that most people will naturally do and I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.990 
that most people will naturally do and I
actually<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> video<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.850> check

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
actually have a video that you can check

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.580 
actually have a video that you can check
out<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.510> how<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> flutter<00:00:55.379> kick

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
out to see how to do a flutter kick

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
out to see how to do a flutter kick
properly<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.789> kick<00:00:57.059> what's<00:00:57.449> important

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
properly but that kick what's important

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.540 
properly but that kick what's important
to<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.829> has<00:00:58.949> no<00:00:59.160> resting

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
to know about it is it has no resting

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.799 
to know about it is it has no resting
face<00:00:59.760> so<00:00:59.940> whenever<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.359> doing<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.600> flutter

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
face so whenever you're doing a flutter

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.240 
face so whenever you're doing a flutter
kick<00:01:01.050> you're<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.320> constantly<00:01:01.829> wasting

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
kick you're just constantly wasting

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.160 
kick you're just constantly wasting
energy<00:01:02.430> kicking<00:01:02.699> kicking<00:01:03.149> kick<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
energy kicking kicking kick it's a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.600 
energy kicking kicking kick it's a
really<00:01:04.470> good<00:01:04.650> kick<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:05.040> you're<00:01:05.280> swimming

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
really good kick if you're swimming

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.130 
really good kick if you're swimming
straight<00:01:06.030> into<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> current<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
straight into a current so you have to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.410 
straight into a current so you have to
exert<00:01:07.530> power<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.760> need<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.939> move<00:01:09.180> rapidly

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
exert power or you need to move rapidly

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.780 
exert power or you need to move rapidly
underwater<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.280> not<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.549> kick

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
underwater but it's really not the kick

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.980 
underwater but it's really not the kick
that<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> want<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.299> doing<00:01:12.420> most<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that you want to be doing most of the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.719 
that you want to be doing most of the
time<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.680> has<00:01:13.710> no<00:01:14.070> resting<00:01:14.520> phase

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
time because it has no resting phase

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.030 
time because it has no resting phase
built<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.240> whatsoever<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.350> other<00:01:16.560> kick<00:01:16.860> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
built in whatsoever the other kick that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.410 
built in whatsoever the other kick that
we<00:01:17.159> use<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.520> we're<00:01:17.670> diving<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> frog

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
we use when we're diving is the frog

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.330 
we use when we're diving is the frog
kick<00:01:18.630> now<00:01:19.140> what<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.380> frog<00:01:19.590> kick<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.220> the

one<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.549> looks<00:01:20.610> similar<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> breaststroke

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
one that looks similar to a breaststroke

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.060 
one that looks similar to a breaststroke
it's<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.020> where<00:01:22.200> again<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:22.770> these<00:01:22.890> are<00:01:22.979> my

feet my knees come in they come around
and<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.430> happens<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.180> kick<00:01:27.479> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and then what happens is you kick and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.060 
and then what happens is you kick and
then<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.049> actually<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> resting<00:01:28.860> phase

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
then you actually have a resting phase

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.039 
then you actually have a resting phase
because<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.299> bring<00:01:30.450> your<00:01:30.509> feet<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
because as you bring your feet up and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.060 
because as you bring your feet up and
get<00:01:31.229> ready<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> next<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.040> just

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
get ready for the next one you're just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
get ready for the next one you're just
going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.430> gliding<00:01:32.640> along<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.360> water<00:01:33.570> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
going to be gliding along the water you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
going to be gliding along the water you
should<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.140> for<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.770> these<00:01:34.860> kicks<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
should be for all of these kicks in a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.590 
should be for all of these kicks in a
horizontal<00:01:35.579> trim<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> should<00:01:36.420> establish

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
horizontal trim and you should establish

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.899 
horizontal trim and you should establish
neutral<00:01:37.170> buoyancy<00:01:37.430> before<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.549> begin<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
neutral buoyancy before you begin to

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.840 
neutral buoyancy before you begin to
kick<00:01:39.030> butt<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:40.290> flutter<00:01:40.590> kick<00:01:40.710> I'm<00:01:41.460> sorry<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
kick butt the flutter kick I'm sorry the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.100 
kick butt the flutter kick I'm sorry the
frog<00:01:42.090> kick<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.479> actually<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> kick<00:01:42.990> that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
frog kick it's actually the kick that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.240 
frog kick it's actually the kick that
you<00:01:43.170> should<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.530> doing<00:01:43.770> most<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> time

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
you should be doing most of the time

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.950 
you should be doing most of the time
where<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.490> bring<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.759> knees<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.600> kick

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
where you bring your knees in you kick

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.899 
where you bring your knees in you kick
and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.320> you've<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> gliding<00:01:47.070> phase<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
and then you've got a gliding phase and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
and then you've got a gliding phase and
if<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.390> more<00:01:48.689> fraud<00:01:49.020> kicking<00:01:49.409> than<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.619> do

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
if you do more fraud kicking than you do

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.200 
if you do more fraud kicking than you do
flutter<00:01:49.950> kicking<00:01:50.250> you'll<00:01:50.490> find<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.030> your

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
flutter kicking you'll find that your

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.460 
flutter kicking you'll find that your
air<00:01:51.360> consumption<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.930> actually<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
air consumption is actually going to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.230 
air consumption is actually going to
improve<00:01:52.770> you're<00:01:52.950> gonna<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.280> better<00:01:54.000> air

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
improve you're gonna have better air

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.520 
improve you're gonna have better air
consumption<00:01:54.570> whenever<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.049> go<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.170> your<00:01:55.350> dive

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
consumption whenever you go on your dive

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.469 
consumption whenever you go on your dive
so<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> couple<00:01:56.759> other<00:01:56.880> videos<00:01:57.299> where
