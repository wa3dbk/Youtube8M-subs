00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.679
 or the one that you can I'm in the ifa of 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.529
 Berlin at the samsung stand and I have 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:11.120
 come to try the last wearable of 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.220
 samsung the samsung and the s a device 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.670
 based on say I'm going to count now 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:23.720
 my myth but let's get into background 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.930
 this if I remember correctly is the fifth 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.420
 wearable the sixth if we counted the jet 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.860
 fit that launches samsung in a year that does not 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.689
 we know very well that he does not know what 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.940
 sticks touching or you suddenly want 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.800
 throw everything is not going to be that there 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.630
 someone who does not find what they are looking for 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.480
 this case is also quite unique 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.579
 because we are talking about a clock that 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.840
 wants to be smartphones or a smartphone 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.850
 that has suddenly turned into a clock 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.140
 because it also has communications 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.450
 3g is to say that it is completely 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.239
 self-employed has a card and with it 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.210
 you can talk and receive calls has 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.370
 a sim in the back that I do not know if 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.770
 you can see it would be there 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.540
 with which allows us to perform and 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.220
 receive calls from certain that since 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.890
 We are looking at the back when 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.780
 again we have here the meter 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.330
 heart rate for this part of here 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.100
 we would have the speaker ahead of us 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.390
 we found with a screen of 2 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:25.490
 curved superamoled 360 x inches 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:28.970
 480 pixels resolution that is such that 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.840
 well and it is also accompanied by a little button 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.840
 this button 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.579
 is the button that will take us 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.460
 to the main screen or that even 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.700
 has thus offers us these functions 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.930
 to be able to turn off the device 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.579
 restart it etcetera etcetera so that 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.009
 you have an idea of ​​the size would be 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.429
 such that all seem so and truth 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.690
 futurama if something similar the belts 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.600
 are these 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.490
 that also allow us to be able to 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.650
 modify them and be able to choose a strap 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.420
 that we like more colors and even 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.580
 of different finishes that now 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.110
 I will certainly teach what swarovski how 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.690
 has gotten into the kitchen too 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.740
 It has customized samsung straps 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.560
 and ads 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.440
 as you see in the rear one 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.420
 correct and very feminine and pretty 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.100
 quite quite different otherwise 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.210
 that you already dare to joel whole and for 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.360
 inside it has a processor 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.240
 dual-core to a gigahercio 512 mb of ram 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.300
 and 4 gb of storage as I said 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.960
 before it is based on you gen and as you see 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.090
 Well man samsung is still betting on 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.640
 all the clubs we say say android 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.470
 android wear their own system to see 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.760
 which is exactly with the one that remains 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.410
 and which one works because 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.910
 final this keep it all going to be 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.820
 Quite complicated 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.680
 On the other hand, 300 milliamps battery 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.710
 promise two days of autonomy that already 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.890
 we will see if they comply and on the other hand 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.200
 he also told us that it is ip67 with 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.250
 which is submersible we can not put 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.840
 shower 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.640
 and in theory I do not know of any problem 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.640
 let's see if we do not see it
