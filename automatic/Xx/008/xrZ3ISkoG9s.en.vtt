 this video is presented by the site 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.090
 How to increase your dot muscle mass 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.570
 do not forget to subscribe to the hello channel 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.940
 people all and all to me is very 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.070
 common to see every day like many people 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.230
 believe that increasing muscle mass is 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.810
 something simple and easy to get 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.410
 when in fact it's practically all 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.689
 a science to increase your muscles is not 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.400
 just exercise at all times 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.890
 in the gym 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.719
 in fact do it this way 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.000
 will produce just the opposite the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.270
 little muscles will grow and burn more 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.329
 calories from the necessary does not surprise me 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.160
 see how many people day by day 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.559
 they just disappear from the gym and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 they do not come back for the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.910
 disappointment and discouragement when not seeing 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.090
 results after so much effort and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.489
 sweat invested in the exercises and how 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.920
 Hopefully they end up saying phrases 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.910
 how is that I'm slim by nature 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.100
 I do not gain muscle 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.610
 or you also hear say something like 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.670
 this 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.580
 is that my DNA is like that and that's why it did not 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.560
 build muscle as discussed in 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.380
 other occasions to grow the 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.830
 muscles is a process which involves 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.050
 many variants and aspects in some 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.870
 chances of growth may well 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.729
 to be so to speak blocked by something 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.820
 what are you doing wrong or are you not 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.950
 doing roughly I can tell you 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.229
 that when you want to grow the 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.600
 muscle first we must cause it a 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.869
 damage and then give it a rest period 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.420
 so that it is repaired and that way it grows 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.670
 this reason that resting is equal to 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.759
 important that the very fact of doing 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.830
 the exercises and surveys let's see 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.480
 now a few more details to win 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.620
 muscle 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.390
 the time in the exercise sessions 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.090
 usually thin people 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.130
 often seek the solution to their lack of 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.130
 muscles with more time in the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.470
 training sessions however 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.660
 after a while they realize that the 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.780
 growth has not been the most optimal 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.850
 let's say when you exercise for 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.190
 gain muscle mass do not look for 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.610
 a lot of resistance when spending several hours 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.620
 in the gym is more to put it on the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.500
 next way I tell you with these 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.560
 words an exercise session is not 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.840
 a triathlon I know it's an example something 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.570
 exaggerated but is that some people 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.490
 they take it so they leave the gym 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.220
 after three hours and feel 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.260
 champions for their great resistance and that 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.180
 It is good when you are looking to lose weight 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.610
 but when it comes to gaining mass 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.130
 muscle is not like that 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.110
 when you start your routine, focus on 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.990
 and in that it does not exceed what 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.240
 much an hour long of equal 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.880
 way it's important that you do not start 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.060
 talk or talk more once 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.670
 you have already started with the training 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.580
 this will only slow you down and cool you down 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.840
 let's see the other point 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.790
 the exercises quantity versus quality 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.150
 both quality and quantity both 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.890
 are important with regard to 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.380
 weight and so that your routines 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.630
 trainings are the most productive and 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.390
 possible effective you should reach the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.990
 less 80 or 90 percent of your load 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.880
 maximum 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.120
 approaching those numbers and limits is 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.070
 how can you grow your muscles 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.110
 so when it comes to hypertrophy 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.320
 it is better to do only 10 repetitions 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.750
 well worked instead of 25 or more 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.200
 repetitions with a weight of which you know 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.180
 that does not mean a challenge for you 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.250
 this also clarified that this is not 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.130
 try to necessarily reach the failure 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.580
 muscular why the range of 80 to 90 for 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.210
 cent of the maximum load is very good 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.890
 in the same way 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.310
 you must vary the cadence of the 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.230
 exercises is to say the speed with which 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.650
 the movements are carried out 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.540
 concentric like the eccentrics at 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.970
 moment there is not really something 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.790
 forceful as to which is the best 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.660
 cadence I personally do what 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.790
 next concentric movement 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.510
 relatively fast and movement 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:25.200
 eccentric I try to slow it down 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.130
 let's move to the last point the exercises 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.740
 compounds 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.500
 this point I leave it smaller but it is 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.110
 just as effective to have the greatest 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.690
 gain in each exercise and repetition 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.780
 to do the ideal thing is to do exercises 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.960
 compounds well you will take advantage of the best 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.300
 way every effort you make 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.550
 exercises are compounds in which 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.270
 works more than just one muscle in each 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.420
 repetition for example press squats 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.490
 of banking and deadweight among others the 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.740
 most of the exercises that are 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.970
 do in a gym are exercises 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.330
 compounds , however, not all 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.760
 example the bank curule is cold east 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.490
 exercise only works practically that 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.730
 the biceps and well that would be all for 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.710
