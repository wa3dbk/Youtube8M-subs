having a longer strap at the end range

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.430 
having a longer strap at the end range
we<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.699> now<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> way<00:00:42.449> out<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.629> the

jams into the bicep and just because of
the<00:00:58.080> way<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.409> most<00:00:58.559> straps<00:00:58.949> are<00:00:59.189> built<00:00:59.600> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the way that most straps are built so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.509 
the way that most straps are built so
all<00:01:01.320> you're<00:01:01.619> gonna<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:01.979> be<00:01:02.159> able<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.309> get

all you're gonna really be able to get
it<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.900> end<00:01:04.110> range<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.739> most<00:01:05.369> straps<00:01:05.729> but

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it is the end range of most straps but

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.580 
it is the end range of most straps but
with<00:01:06.570> most<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.020> them<00:01:07.110> you're<00:01:07.200> only<00:01:07.320> gonna<00:01:07.470> be

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
with most of them you're only gonna be

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.530 
with most of them you're only gonna be
able<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.909> ours<00:01:09.150> you're<00:01:09.450> gonna

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
be able to pull it way out the negative

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.510 
be able to pull it way out the negative
is<00:01:12.150> you're<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:12.990> able<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.170> get

is you're not going to be able to get
that<00:01:14.520> top<00:01:15.950> beginning<00:01:16.950> range<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> top<00:01:18.840> loops

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that top beginning range the top loops

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.730 
that top beginning range the top loops
are<00:01:20.159> shorter<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.960> able<00:01:22.079> to<00:01:22.259> give<00:01:22.560> your

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
are shorter to be able to give your

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
are shorter to be able to give your
hands<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.189> higher<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.119> full<00:01:24.360> stretch

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
hands up higher to get that full stretch

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.929 
hands up higher to get that full stretch
to<00:01:25.500> allow<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> greater<00:01:26.280> range<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.729> motion

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
to allow for a greater range of motion

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
to allow for a greater range of motion
but<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.899> negative<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.710> you're<00:01:28.859> not

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
but the negative here is you're not

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.649 
but the negative here is you're not
going<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.249> be<00:01:29.310> able<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.969> can<00:01:30.299> only<00:01:30.420> pull

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
going to be able to get I can only pull

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.020 
going to be able to get I can only pull
out<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.189> what<00:01:32.429> I'm<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.880> in

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
out to here so what I'm going to do in

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.249 
out to here so what I'm going to do in
this<00:01:33.119> set<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:33.749> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.929> see<00:01:34.140> I'm

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this set is you're going to see I'm

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.690 
this set is you're going to see I'm
going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.469> use<00:01:34.619> both<00:01:34.859> straps<00:01:35.249> it's<00:01:35.520> going<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
going to use both straps it's going to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.270 
going to use both straps it's going to
be<00:01:35.759> done<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.149> superset<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.710> able<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.100> work

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
be done as a superset to be able to work

00:01:38.280 --> 00:03:07.920 
be done as a superset to be able to work
the<00:01:38.460> full<00:01:38.670> length<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.149> muscle

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.009 

so<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.530> had<00:03:08.829> full<00:03:09.099> range<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.370> motion<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.629> range

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
so I had full range of motion and range

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.119 
so I had full range of motion and range
at<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.200> bottom<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:13.239> range<00:03:13.620> per<00:03:14.620> start<00:03:14.920> range

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
at the bottom and range per start range

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.280 
at the bottom and range per start range
at<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.519> top<00:03:15.730> without<00:03:16.540> any<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.900> them<00:03:17.019> being

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
at the top without any of them being

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.500 
at the top without any of them being
completely<00:03:17.890> full<00:03:18.250> because<00:03:18.939> of<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.239> way<00:03:19.360> that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
completely full because of the way that

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.199 
completely full because of the way that
the<00:03:19.689> straps<00:03:20.019> design<00:03:20.470> I'm<00:03:21.430> old<00:03:21.670> school<00:03:21.819> I<00:03:22.030> like

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
the straps design I'm old school I like

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.830 
the straps design I'm old school I like
to<00:03:22.360> Train<00:03:22.599> everything<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.110> failure<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.400> I

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
to Train everything to failure so I

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.569 
to Train everything to failure so I
don't<00:03:25.840> how<00:03:25.900> many<00:03:25.959> reps<00:03:26.290> just<00:03:27.099> go<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.400> say<00:03:27.519> you

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
don't how many reps just go and say you

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.670 
don't how many reps just go and say you
can't<00:03:27.760> do<00:03:27.909> any<00:03:28.090> more<00:03:28.120> go<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.170> other<00:03:29.290> strap

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
can't do any more go to the other strap

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.300 
can't do any more go to the other strap
I'm<00:03:30.670> more<00:03:31.090> partial<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.599> starting<00:03:32.079> with<00:03:32.310> bottom

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
I'm more partial to starting with bottom

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.369 
I'm more partial to starting with bottom
strap<00:03:33.549> first<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.659> it's<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.870> machine<00:03:35.140> with<00:03:35.260> this

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
strap first and it's a machine with this

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.619 
strap first and it's a machine with this
top<00:03:35.590> strap<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.670> isn't<00:03:37.000> making<00:03:37.269> difference

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
top strap it isn't making difference

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.870 
top strap it isn't making difference
that's<00:03:38.590> why<00:03:38.890> we<00:03:39.159> have<00:03:39.599> to<00:03:40.599> lose
