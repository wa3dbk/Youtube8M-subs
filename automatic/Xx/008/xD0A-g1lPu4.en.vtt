modifies all of the roid damage of the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.099 
modifies all of the roid damage of the
legendary<00:00:23.250> roid<00:00:23.550> shield<00:00:23.990> including<00:00:24.990> the

the big thumper

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.640 
the big thumper
I'm<00:00:28.710> unsure<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.539> non<00:00:30.539> legendary<00:00:31.080> roid<00:00:31.320> shields

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
I'm unsure if non legendary roid shields

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.709 
I'm unsure if non legendary roid shields
were<00:00:31.740> effective<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:32.850> all<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.360> legendary

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
were effective but all the legendary

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.319 
were effective but all the legendary
roid<00:00:34.050> shields<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> fact<00:00:34.950> were<00:00:35.610> lowered

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
roid shields for a fact were lowered

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.650 
roid shields for a fact were lowered
significantly<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.660> unfixed

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
significantly so this is the unfixed

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780 
significantly so this is the unfixed
shooting<00:00:40.200> star<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.430> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
shooting star and as you can see it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.240 
shooting star and as you can see it
basically<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.629> hits<00:00:42.899> everything<00:00:43.559> I'm<00:00:44.070> gonna

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
basically one hits everything I'm gonna

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.680 
basically one hits everything I'm gonna
show<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.610> few<00:00:44.879> enemies<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
show you a few enemies here with the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.900 
show you a few enemies here with the
shooting<00:00:45.989> star<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.489> an<00:00:47.610> idea

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
shooting star just so you have an idea

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
shooting star just so you have an idea
of<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> did<00:00:48.480> beforehand<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.379> lot<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.770> you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
of what it did beforehand a lot of you

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.439 
of what it did beforehand a lot of you
probably<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.399> saw<00:00:50.730> some<00:00:50.969> footage<00:00:51.300> of

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
probably know you saw some footage of

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.420 
probably know you saw some footage of
what<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> did<00:00:51.989> when<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.739> was<00:00:52.829> still<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
what it did when it was still at the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.049 
what it did when it was still at the
hundred<00:00:54.149> plus<00:00:54.530> thousand<00:00:55.530> ROI<00:00:55.739> damage<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.460> so

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
hundred plus thousand ROI damage and so

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.430 
hundred plus thousand ROI damage and so
right<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.870> kind<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> cruising

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
right now I'm just kind of cruising

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.500 
right now I'm just kind of cruising
around<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> Hyperion<00:00:59.219> hub<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.059> heroism

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
around in the Hyperion hub of heroism

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.540 
around in the Hyperion hub of heroism
and<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.500> killing<00:01:01.680> things<00:01:02.010> pretty<00:01:02.309> damn

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and it's killing things pretty damn

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.329 
and it's killing things pretty damn
quickly<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.989> particular<00:01:04.350> modification

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
quickly now this particular modification

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.420 
quickly now this particular modification
is<00:01:05.939> somewhat<00:01:06.659> reminiscent<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.740> bee

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
is somewhat reminiscent of the bee

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.719 
is somewhat reminiscent of the bee
shield<00:01:08.760> fix<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:10.100> because<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.580> was

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
shield fix and because you know that was

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.280 
shield fix and because you know that was
a<00:01:11.760> shield<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.299> was<00:01:12.450> overpowered<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
a shield that was overpowered when the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
a shield that was overpowered when the
game<00:01:13.439> came<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.189> then<00:01:14.820> gearbox<00:01:15.360> lowered

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
game came out and then gearbox lowered

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.749 
game came out and then gearbox lowered
it<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> point<00:01:16.860> where<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.369> still<00:01:17.580> very

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it to a point where it was still very

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.910 
it to a point where it was still very
very<00:01:17.909> powerful<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> lot<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> people<00:01:19.650> are

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
very powerful but a lot of people are

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
very powerful but a lot of people are
going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.310> bitch<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.909> moan<00:01:21.150> about<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.780> fact

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
going to bitch and moan about it in fact

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.289 
going to bitch and moan about it in fact
it's<00:01:22.650> been<00:01:22.830> probably<00:01:23.130> almost<00:01:23.549> two<00:01:23.970> years

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
it's been probably almost two years

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.679 
it's been probably almost two years
since<00:01:24.540> gearbox<00:01:25.049> fixed<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.060> ant<00:01:27.060> damage<00:01:27.479> on

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
since gearbox fixed the ant damage on

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.690 
since gearbox fixed the ant damage on
the<00:01:28.020> bee<00:01:28.259> shield<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.799> there<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.400> still

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the bee shield and there are still

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.090 
the bee shield and there are still
people<00:01:29.939> whining<00:01:30.390> about<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:32.070> just

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
people whining about it so that just

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.120 
people whining about it so that just
gives<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.909> an<00:01:33.030> idea<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.420> how

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
gives you kind of an idea of how

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
gives you kind of an idea of how
controversial<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.640> particular<00:01:36.060> fix<00:01:36.600> was

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
controversial that particular fix was

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.080 
controversial that particular fix was
for<00:01:37.650> me<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.920> wasn't<00:01:38.100> controversial<00:01:38.700> at<00:01:38.939> all

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
for me it wasn't controversial at all

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.740 
for me it wasn't controversial at all
and<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.960> think<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.640> 107,000<00:01:41.640> roid<00:01:42.060> damage<00:01:42.540> of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and I think the 107,000 roid damage of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.960 
and I think the 107,000 roid damage of
the<00:01:42.990> shooting<00:01:43.290> star<00:01:43.530> was<00:01:44.159> indeed<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> little

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the shooting star was indeed a little

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.030 
the shooting star was indeed a little
bit<00:01:45.180> broken<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.439> now<00:01:46.590> we're<00:01:46.710> gonna<00:01:46.829> take<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
bit broken and so now we're gonna take a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.700 
bit broken and so now we're gonna take a
look<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.700> hotfix<00:01:48.210> version<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.560> can

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
look at the hotfix version here we can

probably<00:03:33.949> take<00:03:34.129> more<00:03:34.310> than<00:03:34.489> one<00:03:34.639> hit<00:03:34.849> now<00:03:35.060> so

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
probably take more than one hit now so

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.289 
probably take more than one hit now so
I'm<00:03:35.959> just<00:03:36.139> gonna<00:03:36.230> go<00:03:36.500> ahead<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.980> oh<00:03:37.639> he<00:03:38.180> was

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
I'm just gonna go ahead and oh he was

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.300 
I'm just gonna go ahead and oh he was
frozen<00:03:38.569> so<00:03:38.840> he's<00:03:38.989> got<00:03:39.169> one<00:03:39.349> hit<00:03:39.530> I'm<00:03:39.919> gonna<00:03:40.099> try

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
frozen so he's got one hit I'm gonna try

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.699 
frozen so he's got one hit I'm gonna try
to<00:03:40.340> hit<00:03:40.849> this<00:03:41.060> guy<00:03:41.269> and<00:03:41.659> as<00:03:42.139> you<00:03:42.260> can<00:03:42.319> see<00:03:42.530> it

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
to hit this guy and as you can see it

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.819 
to hit this guy and as you can see it
takes<00:03:42.859> him<00:03:43.069> down<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.459> about<00:03:43.699> 60%<00:03:44.299> health<00:03:44.829> throw

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
takes him down to about 60% health throw

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.860 
takes him down to about 60% health throw
on<00:03:45.979> the<00:03:46.099> aspis<00:03:46.489> for<00:03:46.669> just<00:03:46.849> a<00:03:46.970> second<00:03:47.359> Maggy<00:03:47.599> him

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
on the aspis for just a second Maggy him

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.770 
on the aspis for just a second Maggy him
twice<00:03:48.139> and<00:03:48.530> he's<00:03:48.979> dead<00:03:49.190> again<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:50.329> it's<00:03:50.599> not

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
twice and he's dead again so it's not

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.409 
twice and he's dead again so it's not
like<00:03:51.109> these<00:03:51.530> guys<00:03:51.799> all<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.250> sudden<00:03:52.760> can't<00:03:53.239> be
