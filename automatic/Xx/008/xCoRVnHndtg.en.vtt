00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello to all of you guys or enough 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.440
 let's plant these things anyway chelsea 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.800
 well this is not unlike 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.269
 minecraft today is that this looks 13 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.519
 episodes of the series 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.250
 then we had prepared the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.470
 territory for the chain pyramid do 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 so in this episode I thank you 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 a lot first of all because you have from 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.710
 so many measures to give to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.670
 this pyramid 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.890
 let's say I think I do it 50 x 50 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.329
 that we're not going to build the first one 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.559
 will have to go and collect a lot of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.260
 sayo why really 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.829
 there will be a lot of mind here 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.600
 pole in the boat ok say hello to him 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 a monument is reduced only for the chicken 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.230
 horse let's stop with these things 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.760
 however, now let's go to the first one 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.500
 collect sand 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.780
 in fact, I wanted to say something to you 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.610
 more important that I also went to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.859
 digging in the mine I am determined 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.399
 finally to go there helped too 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.409
 pretty much profile this climb 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.290
 ho ho session in fact coins ho 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.680
 collected as many as 26 really one diamonds 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.140
 absurd thing 58 pieces of iron and 42 of 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.270
 gold so with that I think the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.229
 we will use to finally go to the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.310
 network 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.740
 obviously we haven't gone yet 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.960
 so we should also go there 27 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 while there are many guarantor diamonds 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.409
 and also I got the pick has like 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 see ahead then you are 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.860
 really very much alright then i 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.750
 fragments need I decide to go 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.159
 I really found all over the top stuff 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.509
 so you go for a moment to dig 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.170
 the less we take it out of our way 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.610
 collects the building rightly me 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.400
 seriously, however, a lot apart 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.100
 here the torch bug are double tests 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.829
 still correct after version versions of 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.420
 minecraft however ok details of you 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.880
 then go grazing back here 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.409
 because if we have already gone that time 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.570
 so I think we'll go here too 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.610
 however, I think we will do something else 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.409
 definitely a beautiful place here 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.820
 behind then i think we will go 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.340
 just one of these 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.310
 these episodes another thing I wanted 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.439
 tell you is the fact of the like because 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.369
 of course this thing I remember 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.950
 when I was writing type video start or 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.129
 meta video to watch writes is a tot of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.590
 v pleasant you put like nothing 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.750
 but now when I don't say anything you do 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.950
 wanted to do this let's say that 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.840
 when they said nothing therefore not them 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.450
 put it or because you forget 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.860
 I don't know anyway but then put them on 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.040
 always because they really make me 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.349
 current the desire to make you I wish that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.510
 when there was nothing then nothing holds 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.120
 very much under any of there too 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.400
 some other youtuber that you like 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.620
 I practically like it filled up 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.750
 the heart of god because it follows is 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.870
 in fact there is raga I don't really know 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.890
 I collected 3 stacks of sand or made 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.109
 just a sandstone stack ie 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.299
 this to make you understand how much it takes 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.819
 to make a goose pyramid guys 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.220
 finally I 'm back I put it 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.560
 really too long I was not telling you 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.319
 the sand has to be dug anyway 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.329
 pyramid haven usa were no longer of the 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.549
 my expectations like this result 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.769
 however we say that it is quite hairy 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.400
 I show you 123 here it is 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.130
 pyramid 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.319
 ok immediately at first glance it will seem like a 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.840
 however small it is in fact it is 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.370
 also quite anyway meters 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.519
 built I was real melt in 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.230
 mind to do it not too big because 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.870
 I wanted to make two the one to do one at 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.430
 behind viral we will go shopping 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.260
 Net throat measurements are not really 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.870
 because I said at the beginning but only 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.750
 like 20 x 20 so then we'll go to 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.940
 maybe make a figaro entry like that 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.889
 where we will go then to put 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.199
 some monument stuff like that 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.730
 however we will certainly do something at 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.470
 its inside because really if not 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.010
 would be wasted on this neighbor 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.919
 too many times really then really 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.629
 really really rather I would say of 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.699
 do it maybe i have next we don't have 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.769
 nothing else to do here engler 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.370
 at the entrance we do a little bit first 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.290
 bigger will resume 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.330
 the measures then another thing that I do not 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.080
 like what pyramid here on top 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.930
 cover of the two blocks so here's a bit 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.790
 ugly to see maybe so not 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.519
 take measures I have to go down indeed 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.049
 what perfect pyramid was already wrong 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.090
 here we also come from this other side 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.940
 let 's make the beautiful pretty big entrance 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.610
 this way very hot bad luck and there are 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.500
 bells that sound perfect anyway 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.720
 then quad to break even stuff 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.639
 here I understand now 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.160
 really very small as skilful here 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.630
 honestly I didn't want to shoot much 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.240
 in the building because then it would be 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.780
 wanted something out of proportion to 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.570
 world so here I did not dare 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.130
 to do something too big then 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.020
 the more we see everything in our sandstone 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.210
 we understand that we have advanced from this 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.830
 however, pyramid is not really advanced 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.139
 because we will use so much for 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.610
 make another pyramids back there 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.260
 maybe a little smaller king not 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.080
 we have all these hoc blocks 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.930
 inside a robot like that 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.419
 here I would say to put them block or not 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.729
 there's a lot of stuff like that is a lot 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.710
 I don't know if I keep the edge 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.780
 below because it is not very nice to see 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.160
 or cover it this way I don't know of 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.470
 who is also me in the comments anyway 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.270
 if you have that you do not reply comments 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.430
 and because it really is a beautiful one 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.950
 so it does not put me to answer for 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.020
 all however I read them all comments and 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.000
 very often to some of your comments 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.460
 that I really like I put an mi 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.740
 so like to say cup to answer 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.030
 I like it so I don't like it 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.699
 worry that all the things that you 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.199
 I always read, sign up for everything 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.210
 what you want in the comments 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.370
 so yes, immediately in a group 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.889
 covering the norm we started yesterday 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.780
 to cover it immediately so sincerely 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.180
 there really was nothing this 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.979
 especially the underground border only for 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.840
 wasting blogging we have already done 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.300
 try to me we should also do a little 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.120
 the elimination I think there at the top there 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.550
 I'll put some bluestone we 'll have one 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.860
 much cooler lighting anyway 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.930
 for now we are lighting 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.350
 pretty well and guys i love finishing up the 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.660
 our perfect sandstone 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.430
 wenes which is our beautiful entrance 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.650
 inside the milano tech pulls that beautiful is 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.750
 then becoming the mere ska I do it myself 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.850
 it is so it does not take anything will be a little 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.190
 but a casino will have to change all the 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.110
 floor making it very very cool 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.910
 stem of grass and crate of sand 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.980
 because I had finished it there is another factory 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.020
 another sandstone because I no longer had it 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.150
 however, it is really very good 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.280
 these pyramid with this biome seen 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.980
 that we are in the desert together with ours 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.410
 beautiful minecraft writing is there to 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.810
 perfection so we fall for the last one 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.550
 sandstone that seems to be there but I have 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.550
 I note lariana is wrong 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.510
 ok perfect we really have very little 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.160
 arrive at our disposal less than 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.030
 a madonna stack we are really put 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
 very bad 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.320
 however I think that then of camera or 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.180
 in another episode later the la 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.460
 we will certainly award the pyramid knows 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.830
 because there is also so much and to remain 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.010
 I could make some kind of golem stuff 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.720
 of the kind as we say I know monument 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.120
 near the pyramid I know enough 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.400
 cool in here but we'll put something 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.890
 almost certainly we try to put 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.930
 torches because otherwise it is all dark or 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.570
 maybe half we'll do specials of 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.920
 likewise cirov of the genus 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.680
 now mariah will want to do a lot 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.560
 very pussy put inside the 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.440
 pyramid a pyramid looks a bit like a 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.900
 contradiction but I will make a kind of this 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.060
 stuff but ryan I don't know what I created 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.220
 inside but it should be one 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.920
 pyramid which perhaps is not even 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:40.420
 centered we have created a kind of 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.420
 throne of the king 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.810
 honestly you like it inside now 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.210
 also quite 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.120
 hello a lot this style of throne 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:52.070
 which came thanks to the crooked pyramid 

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.960
 however it hurt to see that he came 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.390
 also its interior quite well 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.150
 also in the comments what you want me to do 

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.100
 peak inside it maybe some columns 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.870
 coming down stuff like that for 

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.250
 embellish so I believe this 

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.800

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:10.210
