00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.980
 moin moin and welcome to a new one 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.469
 video and now I feel really 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.629
 hot topic and that pc against the 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.799
 console one does not seem to end 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.480
 a war of faith already since 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.730
 years in progress is pc against the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.680
 Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360 as the 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.630
 main platform or there the nintendo wii 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.250
 which you can not forget 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.690
 what can be doing better playing where 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.380
 you have more advantages and a better one 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.000
 gaming experience 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.410
 But I wanted the team for a while 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.060
 Let's talk, now he has his own way 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.679
 offered there on the channel high five 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.089
 a win game gives that to it 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.039
 goes into a video explaining why 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.350
 the pc now the better platform for the 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.059
 shooter now comes my opinion 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.179
 and I wish you a lot 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.179
 fun 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.359
 Let's take a look first 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.010
 technology 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.780
 Of course it is beyond question that the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.500
 pc performance technically the consoles far 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.820
 is superior 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.170
 the hardware of the consoles can 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.370
 of course not with the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.780
 keep up the pcs 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.949
 many games are graphics 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.630
 Comparisons performed at the man 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.280
 can clearly see the difference 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.810
 Graphics is natural in a game 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.000
 not everything and does not do it for a long time 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.110
 good game but with newer titles 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.520
 how about battlefield 4 is the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.380
 difference between pc and console 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.060
 but already so big that many say 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 Battlefield 3 look on the consoles 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.170
 better than battlefield 4 less 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.670
 details low visibility no anti 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.710
 aliasing and thus unsightly edges 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.259
 pop up objects or even whole 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 building and and and when i get new titles 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.110
 those who want to play in the advertising 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.030
 a great graphic and never 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.310
 to be advertised 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.659
 I would like to see this graphic synonymous if 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.250
 you da one look at Crysis 3 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.170
 we see how cool that actually 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.149
 can look like what I personally but 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.890
 The most important is the frame rate 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.539
 especially the players like playing 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.179
 black ops 2 it plays much better 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.759
 with a frame rate of about 200 yet 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.380
 better of course with 120 hz monitor and 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.940
 when people say about 224 now 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.189
 meter per second takes the human 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.119
 Do not look at pictures anymore then that is 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.259
 sheer nonsense 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.180
 the picture then works a lot 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.310
 Liquid can be such a player yes 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.439
 usually only limited to 30 or 60 frames 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 In addition, multiplayer games have on the 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.220
 pc server in my opinion much 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.720
 better than the lobby system of the consoles 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.160
 Unfortunately, lech is also in the newer call 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.959
 part of duty was taken over 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.459
 which I am also very happy 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.769
 although it becomes a virtual reality 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.720
 want the first only with a pc 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.100
 or mobile device works and well 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.850
 continue not with the console 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.850
 will be compatible 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.010
 as the next point the control me 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.570
 personally come with mouse and keyboard 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.200
 much better than one 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.090
 controller 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.320
 the mouse is much more precise than that 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.150
 analog sticks the gamepad 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.770
 For one thing, because it is technically accurate 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.000
 but also because they are in the whole hand 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.040
 has and the steaks only with the thumb 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.390
 moved to one of the I think 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.950
 have used the most people 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.750
 they work on the pc with it now whether in 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.550
 The school is at work at home 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.290
 for paddling or surfing the internet 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.330
 especially in school I come with it 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.680
 so I can handle much better 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.640
 I appreciate that as well as me 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.530
 already on the consoles shooter 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.070
 played and there permanently miserable 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.290
 failed 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.120
 In addition, one is often on the consoles 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.550
 bound to a specific controller type 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.709
 For example, I have a ps3 and xbox 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.060
 360 controller at home of the xbox 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.130
 I like the controller much better 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.600
 since it much better in the hand is a 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.130
 xbox controller to a ps3 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.260
 but that will happen again 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.730
 There are difficult mice for the pc 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.080
 like sand on the sea and you have it 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.660
 thereby making a huge selection 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.070
 but who still with gamepad on pc 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.420
 this can be the picture in most 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.160
 easy to play 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.440
 For example, I have almost all ss 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.390
 Mitteile played on the pc and with 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.250
 controller what you at the control 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.620
 It is also important that you are all 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.880
 I have to prove keys individually 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.280
 in a new game so not at all 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.470
 Only a great key assignment 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.239
 accustom is now quite new should 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.860
 you can just watch as always 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.840
 certainly on a keyboard much more 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.920
 Keys as on the account had been missing 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.120
 It can be very, for example 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.860
 be practical if you are in one 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.989
 vehicle sits with the help of f keys 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.380
 exactly at the club can change at the 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.380
 you just want to 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.090
 a particularly important argument for the 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.590
 Consoles is the cost of course 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.310
 Consoles are much cheaper than 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.810
 a pc 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.430
 the pc components are there clearly 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.450
 more expensive and therefore decide too 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.220
 many for a console 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.049
 if you look at it, though 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.910
 long you have a console or a pc 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.680
 and how expensive the games are then 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.440
 the pc may not be in the end 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.730
 quite as expensive as initially suspected 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.010
 current to play title costs for the 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.270
 Consoles often over 60 euros for the pc 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.980
 you get the games clearly 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.490
 cheaper especially in the different ones 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.830
 keystone 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.720
 Also, there are often free for the pc 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.669
 Watch for various games when I go to 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.440
 example in gta4 as agent smith off 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.940
 matrix will run on and everything 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.320
 I would like to destroy then 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.889
 this modification is quite simple 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.810
 to install 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.520
 I think gta is a very good one 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.470
 example because on the consoles remains 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.120
 the game as it is on the pc against it 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.400
 you can play the game in your own 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.200
 interests after adapt no matter if it 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.870
 now the new favorite car weapons or 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.250
 a snow fashion is big title today 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.180
 like counterstrike like for example 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.950
 did not arise at all 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.780
 it plays a half-life modification 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.270
 is or is it a modification 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.860
 the military simulation arma 2 would be 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.390
 never appeared this place has the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.680
 developers of arman also again 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.419
 neat money introduced 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.380
 For weeks, the game was in fact 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.380
 Steam in the sales charts 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.730
 So now we have the conclusion and that 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.680
 I'm sure it's a bit different now 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.720
 as maybe I personally thought 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.100
 gamers on the pc he prefers 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.690
 I simply most of the advantages I 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.160
 can order just about anything to make in 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.080
 my eyes an all-in-one probably the 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.400
 media center on a screen one 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.780
 watch the movie and play on the other 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.230
 is not on the consoles, for example 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.150
 possible 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.530
 but seriously we all have 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.170
 the same hobby and if I am like that 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.150
 some i call it discussions in the 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.980
 Internet through reading what I really look at 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.510
 insulting the head over insult 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.550
 just because someone means his platform 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.170
 is the only true just plays 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.880
 where your friends are playing 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.390
 but no matter whether it is the pc's xbox 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.890
 the playstation or wii is let yourself 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.390
 as well as not incite if someone 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.400
 means a platform of shit and 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.260
 therefore soon you should be christmas 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.420
 this conflict can lay side 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.190
 There were some points in this video 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.440
 now a bit over the top and often and was 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.030
 so the typical pro pc arguments that 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.980
 Also not always very important, therefore 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.030
 I hope you do not take the whole thing 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.710
 too heartfelt 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.300
 Of course that's just mine too 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.430
 have been and you have this 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.570
 Of course I do not share 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.250
 hope anyway that video has you 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.900
 like and then say to have a first 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.900
 Merry Christmas and see you then
