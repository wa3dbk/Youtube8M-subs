00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.640
 good afternoon today i want you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.519
 introduce a super collective farm of some kind 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.530
 German Kulibin installed in my 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:19.760
 bus and so we have a sofa with a mind 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.760
 very homemade such mount 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:29.119
 my headrests were pre 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.119
 removed how it all works 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:44.190
 all the sofa will decompose remains only 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:44.190
 move the shelf and we have such a view 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:55.890
 no installation occurred 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:01:03.879
 completely trouble for all the fixings 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:10.330
 went to the home seating sofa 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:18.030
 assembled below these arcs are not here 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:21.720
 random arcs are thrown like this or 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.590
 under the sofa is such a regiment 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.520
 which is mounted here on these screws 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:37.020
 so we still have a bedroom 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:40.840
 about 30 centimeters 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.380
 bottom is quite large 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.380
 luggage space 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.740
 also when Lithuanians purchased was 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.369
 purchased caramel of sky trim with 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.369
 old year 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.070
 Here is a pair of chairs is the author's farm 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.070
 video from the ball on 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.320
 What we see behind the paneling with caramel 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.210
 was cracked 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.860
 why so for the collective farm there are gum and here 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:30.190
 so decided the question of the central castle 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:37.600
 top but the funniest thing about this 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:42.270
 shelf behind there is such a table table 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.350
 the bottom has legs telescopic legs 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.370
 therefore can be installed on 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.720
 big enough spill and heights 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:57.060
 nothing rattles nothing jumps in 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:03:01.000
 driving time naturally rear doors 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.700
 were not made I repeat everything was 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.230
 removed from the crackers 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:12.220
 the price of such pleasure before the new 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:20.080
 the year of 700 litas from Lithuanians is a sofa and 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:23.620
 all the trim further as 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.570
 Blow to that caramel was collective with 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.000
 installation of the rear stove was applied 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.680
 Here's a solution from the ventilation oven 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.770
 accordingly stands on its staff 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.770
 place 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.850
 not to bother with the regulator 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:47.650
 speeds stoves applied here such 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.650
 regulator from 2 golf 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:04.010
 and since the stoves of the old year in the case 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:11.450
 missing resistor was purchased 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:18.470
 resistor saved from both 3 and quickened in 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:20.660
 engine compartment right over here 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.560
 you can see two screws behind them sticks out 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:29.000
 resistor near handlebar fans for 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.200
 proper cooling were gnawed two 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.200
 TV holes
