but there's a lot of love that's gone

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.820 
but there's a lot of love that's gone
into<00:02:01.120> them<00:02:01.330> too<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:04.210> it's<00:02:04.570> been<00:02:04.810> an<00:02:05.020> incredible

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
into them too so it's been an incredible

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.890 
into them too so it's been an incredible
experience<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.910> come<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.480> Africa<00:02:07.690> and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
experience to come to Africa and

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.840 
experience to come to Africa and
actually<00:02:08.380> see<00:02:08.560> how<00:02:08.770> everything<00:02:09.670> comes

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
actually see how everything comes

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.880 
actually see how everything comes
together<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.510> certainly<00:02:11.470> think<00:02:11.620> it's<00:02:11.800> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
together I certainly think it's the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.960 
together I certainly think it's the
beginning<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.450> big<00:02:13.450> things<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.930> come
