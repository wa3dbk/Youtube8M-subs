00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.869
 I saw about this paint recently quite 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.980
 in a magazine and straight burned despite 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.900
 the fact that I have not painted for a year and I 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.470
 Opponent I want to grow all these colors 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.560

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.960
 to paint precisely the tips not completely 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.930
 the color and the tips are my tip already like 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.289

 a bunch of jars and here's a comb for that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.649
 to evenly distribute all this 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.970

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.040

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.210
 developer bottle and 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.200
 you need to fill the brightening powder and 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.350
 accordingly put it all on 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.229

 can also be worn not only at the tips 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.530
