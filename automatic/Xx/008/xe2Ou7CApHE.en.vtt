00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
paper or anything like that so basically

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.790

don't have to use the whole sponge so

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.229 
don't have to use the whole sponge so
basically<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.300> dip<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.140> sponge<00:00:52.410> into<00:00:53.239> clean

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
basically you dip the sponge into clean

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.700 
basically you dip the sponge into clean
water<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:56.129> sort<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.550> squeeze<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.180> out<00:00:57.710> just

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
water and sort of squeeze it out just

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.819 
water and sort of squeeze it out just
wet<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.219> end<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> want<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.829> use

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
wet the end of it that you want to use

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.770 
wet the end of it that you want to use

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
something light on it but for some

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.410 
something light on it but for some
reason<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.540> didn't<00:02:04.079> quite<00:02:04.320> work<00:02:05.420> let's

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
reason it just didn't quite work let's

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.749 
reason it just didn't quite work let's
see<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.750> will<00:02:06.810> work<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.290> blue<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.039> I

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
see if it will work in this blue and I

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:19.050 
see if it will work in this blue and I
put<00:02:08.970> alcohol<00:02:09.179> on

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.490 

sometimes<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.210> can<00:02:20.360> get<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.600> almost<00:02:21.020> back<00:02:21.290> to

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500
