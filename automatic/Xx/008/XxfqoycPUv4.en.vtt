 hashtag easter eggs hunters but 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.940
 It's not worth answering without suffering then 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.380
 pay close attention to the video or luck 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:43.920
 no further 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:46.770
 I'm not going to talk and I talked and started with 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 metal grinding and the nem of the cat and the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.660
 even his skin with that name and why 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.340
 mano if you bump into it do not try 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.070
 attack him because you're going to 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:03.030
 nervous disgrace of the tunnel disar 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.700
 fighting king davi fonseca the dr 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.530
 seriously I do not advise you to stay 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.110
 tried to kill him because probably 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.430
 You will lose your temper and will 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.430
 start cursing the cat 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:25.540
 the thief your shit hit pay the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.150
 Your russia target your shit boy you 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.920
 or just your homeless bum 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.320
 help was to help the system and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.130
 not only does this evil cat appear not 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.259
 in phase r 03 it appears again before 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.810
 the fight against monson if you come to 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.570
 the camera on the right you will see the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.580
 cat and its owner explains it a little 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.580
 It was off he was trained right. 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.250
 now we go with the time spenders of 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.740
 easter eggs is the following I'm going to drop 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.600
 a video of the vault ghosts and different from 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.550
 other videos I will not talk to 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.649
 I'm not a muggle because I was 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.230
 reading a T-shirt and the next one wins the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.720
 tshirt what idea better answer type 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.640
 refers to the film as it 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.260
 so if you explain well delivered 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.260
 you win the t-shirt then go 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.200
 and in the batman phase of the game decides 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.150
 it's the games you find an easter egg 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.790
 pretty crazy zinho 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.110
 it connects to this also gil turkey 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.500
 tchifutchi ano 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.310
 He is so accustomed to condoms that 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.310
 sell newspapers 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.130
 I think some have realized that here 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.500
 There's a wall that came down and a guy. 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.810
 died trying to get his hat or 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.520
 except he lost his arm and that's what he does 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.410
 reference to one of the Indian films 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.410
 Jones, how are you going to see it now? 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.030
 it's like i said before indiana jones is a 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.280
 of the films that have the most differences in 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.260
 games along with the future back 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.730
 these two my friend is present 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.890
 a bout of games 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.959
 and look at loc danny also entered the 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.660
 wave and did his homage to the movie 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.580
 indiana jones on a map location of a 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.709
 them and that was launched for the game you 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.410
 finds a trolley tucked away in 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.110
 he has a cap and a whip looks only one 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.810
 whip and the two both doll of the 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.200
 whip make references to the movie 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.200
 look that 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:20.870
 failed and moving on to strange game 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.450
 by dipp and here you are already seeing a 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.940
 and it is very familiar because it does 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.160
 reference to a very fucking movie and incidentally 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.950
 The first movie I watched in the movies 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.020
 the armor getting old and that box makes 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.820
 reference to the film castaway is one of the 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.300
 only things that it gets when it falls 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.490
 island 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:44.270
 only the box that is written ted 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:47.300
 ex-dex in the game you too 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.650
 find wilson face fuck you 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.410
 you do not understand anything, it's the following 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.990
 in the movie fell on the island and it stays there in the shit 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.180
 and the only friend he has is the ball. 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.310
 man he makes her his friend and has a 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.810
 moment of the movie that the ball disappears and he 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.810
 melo freak out is really cool 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:23.540
 and here in metal gear solid peace walker 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:25.460
 You take a leap and it's a family leap. 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.500
 that camera that sense I think 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.410
 everyone here has already joined in the reference 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.600
 It's not a guy, you did not call me. 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.660
 reference to the faith leap of assassin's 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.660
 believe 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.030
 It's okay, I do not even need this edition. 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:05.939
 all just to say that the power of faith but 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:07.949
 I did not resist and to close the easter egg 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:10.650

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.159

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.469

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:23.039

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.780

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.350
 We're coming to the end of yet another video. 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.390

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.580

 T-shirt bidding will not happen in 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.800
 all videos but it's something that will 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.360
 happen from time to time even 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.190

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.530
 band singing the beauty shirt then 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.850
 Do not even think about getting badly accustomed to beauty. 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.710
 remembering that I'm making a 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.750
