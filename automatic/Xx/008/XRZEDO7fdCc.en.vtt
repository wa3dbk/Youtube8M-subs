it straight up this is wrong you want to
take<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.780> transfer<00:02:17.170> taper<00:02:17.410> paper<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.489> pull

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
take the transfer taper paper and pull

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.770 
take the transfer taper paper and pull
it<00:02:19.620> horizontally<00:02:21.180> perpendicularly<00:02:22.180> back

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
it horizontally perpendicularly back

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.690 
it horizontally perpendicularly back
from<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.500> decal<00:02:23.860> perpendicular<00:02:24.489> would<00:02:24.610> be

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
from the decal perpendicular would be

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.789 
from the decal perpendicular would be
like<00:02:24.849> this<00:02:25.060> that's<00:02:25.330> wrong<00:02:25.650> horizontally<00:02:26.650> like

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
like this that's wrong horizontally like

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:27.840 
like this that's wrong horizontally like
this<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.220> correct

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
this is correct

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.990 
this is correct
this<00:02:28.720> puts<00:02:28.989> let's<00:02:29.260> less<00:02:29.650> stress<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.670> decal

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
this puts let's less stress on the decal

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.849 
this puts let's less stress on the decal
itself<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.769> as<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.070> see<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:35.290> decal<00:02:35.650> went

turn it around and we'll line up our

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.000 
turn it around and we'll line up our
edges<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:29.530> little<00:04:29.740> bit<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:29.919> a

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
edges this is a little bit of a

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.350 
edges this is a little bit of a
different<00:04:30.340> situation<00:04:30.940> because<00:04:31.090> you're

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
different situation because you're

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.150 
different situation because you're
lining<00:04:31.600> up<00:04:31.810> two<00:04:31.990> different<00:04:32.380> items<00:04:32.710> two

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.050 
time first variable you're lining up
here<00:04:37.389> is<00:04:37.539> this<00:04:38.050> black<00:04:38.349> edge<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:39.669> tip<00:04:39.880> of<00:04:40.030> my

at<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.800> center<00:05:24.039> and<00:05:24.310> create<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.550> pivot<00:05:24.910> point

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
at the center and create a pivot point

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.050 
at the center and create a pivot point
with<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.599> squeegee<00:05:26.310> at<00:05:27.310> this<00:05:27.520> point<00:05:27.820> this

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
with the squeegee at this point this

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.050 
with the squeegee at this point this
area<00:05:28.479> is<00:05:28.630> now<00:05:28.750> permanently<00:05:29.289> it<00:05:29.669> adhered<00:05:30.669> to

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
area is now permanently it adhered to

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.370 
area is now permanently it adhered to
the<00:05:31.210> tank

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
the tank

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.500 
the tank
from<00:05:34.040> this<00:05:34.160> point<00:05:34.400> we<00:05:34.640> which<00:05:34.910> is<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.300> very

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
from this point we which is a very

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.330 
from this point we which is a very
simple<00:05:35.750> apply<00:05:36.110> we're<00:05:36.470> going<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:36.740> maybe<00:05:36.980> run

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
simple apply we're going to maybe run

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.470 
simple apply we're going to maybe run
this<00:05:37.550> way<00:05:37.790> run<00:05:38.660> this<00:05:38.960> way<00:05:39.820> here's<00:05:40.820> a<00:05:40.910> wrinkle<00:05:41.180> I

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
this way run this way here's a wrinkle I

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.730 
this way run this way here's a wrinkle I
don't<00:05:41.690> think<00:05:41.870> it's<00:05:41.990> going<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:42.170> be<00:05:42.260> a<00:05:42.290> problem

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
don't think it's going to be a problem

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.870 
don't think it's going to be a problem
that<00:05:42.770> we're<00:05:42.920> going<00:05:42.950> to<00:05:43.100> need<00:05:43.250> to<00:05:43.340> use<00:05:43.460> too<00:05:43.730> much

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
that we're going to need to use too much

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.060 
that we're going to need to use too much
heat<00:05:44.120> maybe<00:05:44.390> just<00:05:44.660> a<00:05:44.750> little<00:05:47.740> to<00:05:48.740> get<00:05:48.860> that

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
heat maybe just a little to get that

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.640 
heat maybe just a little to get that
vinyl<00:05:49.630> to<00:05:50.630> be<00:05:50.750> a<00:05:50.780> little<00:05:50.960> bit<00:05:51.080> more<00:05:51.200> workable

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
vinyl to be a little bit more workable

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.590 
vinyl to be a little bit more workable
and<00:05:52.370> we're<00:05:52.520> going<00:05:52.640> to<00:05:52.700> use<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:52.970> squeegee<00:05:53.240> and

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
and we're going to use the squeegee and

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.060 
and we're going to use the squeegee and
just<00:05:54.110> push<00:05:54.350> it<00:05:54.500> down<00:05:56.260> working<00:05:57.260> the<00:05:57.530> water<00:05:57.740> out

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
just push it down working the water out

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.770 
just push it down working the water out
from<00:05:58.310> underneath<00:05:58.580> the<00:05:58.820> decal<00:05:59.210> you<00:05:59.420> can<00:05:59.600> see
