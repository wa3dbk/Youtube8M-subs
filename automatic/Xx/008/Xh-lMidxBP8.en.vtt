00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
really quick and I pretty much hopped

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.389 
really quick and I pretty much hopped
into<00:00:48.719> Titan<00:00:49.200> right<00:00:49.410> away<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
into Titan right away and that's the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.130 
into Titan right away and that's the
thing<00:00:50.610> about<00:00:50.640> titanfall<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.840> has<00:00:51.989> about

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
thing about titanfall is it has about

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.650 
thing about titanfall is it has about
these<00:00:52.379> same<00:00:52.710> game<00:00:53.550> times<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:54.120> i<00:00:54.210> should<00:00:54.270> say<00:00:54.510> as

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
these same game times as i should say as

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.209 
these same game times as i should say as
a<00:00:54.690> call<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> duty<00:00:55.140> game<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.010> range

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
a call of duty game like it can range

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.360 
a call of duty game like it can range
from<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> 7-minute<00:00:57.809> game<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.739> around<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
from like a 7-minute game to around a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.279 
from like a 7-minute game to around a
12-minute<00:01:00.000> game<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.750> kind<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> same

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
12-minute game so it's kind of the same

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.619 
12-minute game so it's kind of the same
match<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> call<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> duty<00:01:02.670> match<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.570> i

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
match as a call of duty match and when i

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.690 
match as a call of duty match and when i
go<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.870> cut<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> video<00:01:05.040> down<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:05.430> i<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
go to cut the video down when i go to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.910 
go to cut the video down when i go to
edit<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> video<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:07.530> kind<00:01:07.799> of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
edit the video it's actually kind of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.200 
edit the video it's actually kind of
hard<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> tightening<00:01:08.640> fall<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.970> reason

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
hard and tightening fall and the reason

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.940 
hard and tightening fall and the reason
I<00:01:09.299> say<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.689> because<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.770> much

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
I say this is because there is so much

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.039 
I say this is because there is so much
stuff<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:12.330> throughout<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.869> game

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
stuff going on throughout the game

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.030 
stuff going on throughout the game
there's<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.470> you're<00:01:13.619> always<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
there's like you're always in a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.560 
there's like you're always in a
different<00:01:14.369> Titan<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:14.939> you're<00:01:15.090> always<00:01:15.420> in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
different Titan or you're always in

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.140 
different Titan or you're always in
combat<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.350> you're<00:01:16.860> always<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.430> pilot<00:01:17.939> mode

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
combat or you're always in a pilot mode

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.210 
combat or you're always in a pilot mode
and<00:01:18.360> there's<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.780> much<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.590> it's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and there's so much going on that it's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
and there's so much going on that it's
actually<00:01:20.670> pretty<00:01:20.970> hard<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.659> choose<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.350> pick

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
actually pretty hard to choose and pick

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.070 
actually pretty hard to choose and pick
and<00:01:22.740> choose<00:01:23.009> when<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.060> go<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.330> actually<00:01:24.900> edit

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and choose when I go to actually edit

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
and choose when I go to actually edit
