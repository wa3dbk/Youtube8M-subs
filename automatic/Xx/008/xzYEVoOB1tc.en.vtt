00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.360
 this show I'm on my way 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.590
 with the new trainer of psv 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.090
 eric gerets 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.220
 and that band 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.220
 this beautiful hurray 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.640
 to organize 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 so will last for the matter 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.320
 I just wonder 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.340
 the man would then do other things 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.690
 whatever 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.760
 9 th 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.710
 for 2011 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.949
 Youtube Channel 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.189
 keeping that year than expected is a shame 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.159
 but after that I once heard I could open it for you 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:12.890
 to become 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.780
 especially in the wider world that also applies to those few years ago that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.000
 made the uci to the last years he was during his 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.920
 but where 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 I think you are her editors 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.720
 this is not going through heerenveen suffered this way by the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.870
 average area of ​​more than a quarter of this group 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.640
 the market square is for the champion of wit in 2009 2 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 whether or not through but I hope that the engine is from Europe 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.600
 I could become a PSV 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.040
 It should not be the case that we seemed to have the promise of a resident 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.460
 not Eric De Bruyn and there were absolutely 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.240
 psv 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.830
 and I stand and 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.429
 according to a very serious injury resulting in billion 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.960
 or like 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.470
 by the inconvenience 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.470
 against all suspects 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.040
 he has 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.410
 the car 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.359
 jesse r 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.189
 that's what we're talking about 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:15.909
 You also have a bit small striking that is completely distracted though where you are at 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:16.709
 can do 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.180
 Congratulations 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.990
 to take that moment and take a private bus to the dam 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.890
 nor do paramaribo sound on the success of psv in a duel in which 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.890
 this kind of terrorist how that a 2 3 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.879
 josé mourinho 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.359
 mayor 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.729

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.559

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:49.329
 you want to be you actually no longer and certainly looking forward to a 3 and in 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.259
 Years from Nijmegen was surrounded by the current year in a number of cases 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.949
 how is that possible? 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:03.799
 we have 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.169
 there is a lot of demand for gold 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.339
 he is indeed a strong everyone there is awaiting in eindhoven but yes 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.760

 the campaign is on or below 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.849
 I hear strength leader anytime and anywhere 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.419
 who does not go with 4s 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.669
