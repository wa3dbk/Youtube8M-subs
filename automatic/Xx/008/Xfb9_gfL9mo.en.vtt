(Tim Marlow) Over the last 20 years

00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:31.515
I've been to many artist studios

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:34.855
and I find them enchanting places, impressive places

00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:38.073
places of refuge, places of sanctuary

00:00:38.073 --> 00:00:43.203
and sometimes places of grand statement or intent

00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:46.043
but I've never encountered anything like Barjac.

00:00:48.687 --> 00:00:52.275
It's everything from an amphitheatre

00:00:52.275 --> 00:00:54.770
to an underground labyrinth

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.383
to a series of individual pavilions

00:00:57.383 --> 00:01:00.263
like the Giardini in Venice

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.900
to a whole configuration of towers

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.730
rather like those that were put in the Royal

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.010
Academy courtyard, five or six years ago

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.750
but some have collapsed

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.400
as well as the house, as well as

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.675
the library that Kiefer has there

00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:17.185
and what you feel is that you're encountering

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:19.845
an ancient civilisation that

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:23.125
has declined and been rediscovered

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:26.905
and some extraordinarily ambitious

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:30.145
almost crazy contemporary construction

00:01:30.154 --> 00:01:34.556
it's a wonderful meeting of time and intent

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:38.716
♪ Atmospheric music ♪

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.629
Kiefer is one of those artists where

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:58.309
nothing seems impossible

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:59.893
and often when he's told

00:01:59.893 --> 00:02:01.393
that something is impossible,

00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:03.223
he'll spend a lot of time trying

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.293
to show that it is or can be possible

00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:07.253
the other interesting thing about Barjac is,

00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:09.303
it really is the "gesamtkunstwerk"

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:10.963
it's a single entity, in a way

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:14.173
of extraordinary disparate parts

00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:17.231
but he's now moved to the next stage

00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:19.661
which is to invite another artist,

00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:21.641
and in theory, other artists in the future

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.901
to come and work there

00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:25.871
So, Wolfgang Laib has made a beautiful piece

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:27.511
down in one of the labyrinths

00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:29.272
and there are plans for other artists

00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:30.422
to work there

00:02:30.422 --> 00:02:31.942
so it's evolving, it's moving on

00:02:31.942 --> 00:02:33.802
he has completed his work there,

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:36.752
but I love the idea that his workplace

00:02:36.752 --> 00:02:39.452
becomes a work of art

00:02:39.452 --> 00:02:42.622
then becomes a site, a canvas

00:02:42.622 --> 00:02:45.712
a space, a gallery, an inspiration

00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:47.972
in which other artists will create.

00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:50.622
so there's a generosity of vision and spirit

00:02:50.622 --> 00:02:54.808
about Kiefer too, and Barjac in particular
