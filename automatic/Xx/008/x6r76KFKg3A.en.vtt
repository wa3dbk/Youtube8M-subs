00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 in this video we will look at the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.230
 samsung ha 62100 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.030
 A full HD LED TV that has a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.639
 smart platform to provide you with the necessary 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.389
 provide multimedia and entertainment 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.030
 it is available in a number 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.220
 different inch sizes namely 32-inch 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.189
 that is this model but there is also one 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.410
 larger 40 and 48 55 and 60 inch model TV 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.660
 has a thin black currant 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.750
 has no built-in camera that you can 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.399
 buy separately and connect 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.260
 and if you do that then you can 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.870
 for example an application such as skype 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.570
 use it on a chrome 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 crossfoot looks very elegant too 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.350
 he has a chrome border here 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 sit at the bottom and you can also see it there 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.399
 samsung logo 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.039
 the television is 6.3 centimeters thick and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.739
 so you can also hang on the wall nicely 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.870
 thanks to the bracket fixing points and 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.170
 he also has connections 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.059
 4 HDMI 3 USB and also has in common 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.949
 interface and that means you 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.719
 can receive digital television without 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.210
 having to use a digital one 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.860
 decoder stop throne a smart card with 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.439
 Combs push in and so you already have 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.280
 digital TV so it is a full HD 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.210
 television 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.700
 that means everything is whole 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.680
 detailed and thanks to the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.619
 You enjoy 200 hertz clear motion rate 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.490
 also from fast and smoothly moving images 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.740
 so you no longer suffer from it 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.030
 after-effects or shocks and that is 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.200
 of course completely fine 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.270
 at a fast race competition 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.490
 for example, he also has a 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.170
 quad core processor and this quad core 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.610
 processor then ensures that if 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.740
 for example in the smart platform 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.970
 that is also a bit faster 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.040
 to operate 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.840
 it is only getting a 3d television 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.970
 no 3d glasses are at these 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 optionally available and available 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.229
 Bear in mind that you are the active 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.540
 3d glasses must order from samsung 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.520
 because it is an active 3d television 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.500
 where the tv you also get one 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.479
 remote control that is standard 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.460
 remote control from samsung where then 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.240
 again the smart hub button in the middle 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.009
 sit 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.270
 The television is a smart TV and that 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.100
 means that you are on the smart 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.689
 platform of samsung different 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.060
 can consult applications 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.899
 for example, netflix video land 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.250
 missed the broadcast 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.379
 but you can also perfect your social 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.720
 network tracking thanks to applications 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.410
 as facebook and twitter on the smart 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.260
 platform 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.840
 also a part where you see movies that 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.010
 you are recommended based on you 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.360
 viewing behavior 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.390
 so you can immediately on demand 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.830
 and there is also a part in it 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.990
 this smart platform where you for example 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.450
 the most popular videos from youtube 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.430
 looks or photos that are now very popular 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.120
 are on flickr for example 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.670
 also very nice is social tv that is this one 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.770
 app here so if you select it then 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.750
 you can for example while viewing from 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.760
 a program still your twitter feed 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.350
 keep in addition or for example the feed 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.820
 from your facebook 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.950
 and so you see, for example, very much 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.870
 good what will be seen by other viewers 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.730
 said about a program 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.710
 very nice is also football note in this 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.180
 engine adjusts the image and sound 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.040
 automatically for optimum 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.360
 experience while viewing a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.590
 football match 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.090
 the football emergency button is on the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.710

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.570

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.920
 a lot becomes greener everything becomes the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.440
 a bit more boosted in colors and yes this 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.330
 really gives an optimal viewing experience too 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.120
 very cool is that if you have a hard drive 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.160
 or USB stick on the TV that he connects 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.260
 then also all highlights 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.120
 will record the match by going to 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.430

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.450
 note in and out and that is 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.790
 of course very handy to see if 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.150
 For example, construction may or may not have the 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.100
