00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
program called gzip which is slightly

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.130

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
is being compressed opcom 0 8 2010 now

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.219 
is being compressed opcom 0 8 2010 now
what<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> want<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.140> copy<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.619> file

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.850 
what I want to do is just copy this file
someone<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.500> copy<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:22.650> then<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
someone I think copy that and then I

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.499 
someone I think copy that and then I
want<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.040> paste<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.000> folder<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
I think see it's got jer 2819 items it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.250 
I think see it's got jer 2819 items it
might<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.880> slightly<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.480> slightly<00:01:42.810> less<00:01:43.110> on
