00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
pretty far behind but this is not what

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.570 
pretty far behind but this is not what
concerns<00:03:34.090> me<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.780> concerns<00:03:35.260> me<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.550> when<00:03:36.550> I

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
in the States but anyway it was kind of

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.180 
in the States but anyway it was kind of
weird<00:05:37.390> and<00:05:37.840> it's<00:05:38.200> interesting<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.890> see<00:05:39.070> how

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
weird and it's interesting to see how

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.710 
weird and it's interesting to see how
that<00:05:39.370> stuff<00:05:39.730> works<00:05:39.790> I<00:05:40.180> guess<00:05:40.390> if<00:05:40.600> you're

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
that stuff works I guess if you're

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.530 
that stuff works I guess if you're
interested<00:05:41.170> by<00:05:41.320> things<00:05:41.590> sometimes<00:05:42.160> I<00:05:42.550> don't

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540
