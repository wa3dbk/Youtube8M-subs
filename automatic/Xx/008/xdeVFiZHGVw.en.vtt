00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:14.729
 at gunpoint 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:15.749
 but 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:16.940
 then they have that with m 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.940
 you get a big loss 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.609

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.199
 stephen hawking 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.419

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.060
 that switch 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.150
 you can see 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.890
 melaga pvv 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.890

 yes this is the netherlands 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.000
 because i want to write my books about 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.230
 employ people 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.480
 Zambia 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.210
 done before noon to the boy in the middle 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.890
 but the first meeting 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.260
 The first meeting 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.560
 in front of 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.480
 but once 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.480
 the 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.970
 it still 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.980
 the sister of books 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.760
 that makes sense 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.230
 the volunteers 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.040
 he did that one too 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.870
 we see it as one of the things in it 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.470
 dnb 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.930
 9 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.930
 absolutely not 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.100
 the region 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.830
 so i didn't think i was able to manage it a year ago 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.250
 life 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 written extra delivery 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 make allowed 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.090
 goal scorer 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
 the fire in a home 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.130
 he is defeated 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.759
 and they cannot be discussed against me, but there must be traffic 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:04.910
 also logical 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.890
 there are so lost 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 there is still something to think about 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.089
 uncle 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.089
 alan 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.329

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:24.179
 in jail 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.179
 that exist 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.249
 the three rounds do that 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.679
 the animals were up again 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:34.929
 read in the book 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.929
 stolen bicycles stolen from 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.829
 I had to get used to it 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.590
 but doing these things that actually do in real life so I also miss 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.449
 who always let the book know 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.969
 tell me i have been a few times in addition there are a few more 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.949
 the euro went down on Monday afternoon 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.949
 the book the new season 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.439
 how were popular 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.909

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.909
 the sludge oath 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.119

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:16.559
 together with his wife 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:20.059

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.639
 paramaribo we have the suspects 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.329
 this procedure 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.819
 the only ones that aren't 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:39.769
 well can summarize the rise 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.590
 you are a little model but finished 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.659

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.180

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.659
 Thank you to the Israeli for your cooperation 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:59.179

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:01.699
 give it a try 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:02.869
 costs money 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:05.669
 stay 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.130
 calculated 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.880
