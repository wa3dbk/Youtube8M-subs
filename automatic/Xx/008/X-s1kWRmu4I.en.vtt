00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.470 
model into the fuselage and i believe
that<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.519> for<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.819> TV<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.359> radio

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
that this is for the TV and radio

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.140 
that this is for the TV and radio
signals<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:22.450> here's<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.019> engine<00:03:23.440> i<00:03:24.150> believe

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
signals so here's the engine i believe

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.750 
signals so here's the engine i believe
that<00:03:25.510> this<00:03:26.139> is<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.970> GE<00:03:27.970> engine<00:03:28.599> I'm<00:03:29.590> not<00:03:30.130> very

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
that this is a GE engine I'm not very

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.839 
that this is a GE engine I'm not very
sure<00:03:32.220> but<00:03:34.169> in<00:03:35.169> the<00:03:35.290> back<00:03:35.500> here<00:03:35.859> they<00:03:36.160> painted

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
sure but in the back here they painted

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.240 
sure but in the back here they painted
green<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.510> represent<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.139> heat<00:03:38.349> from<00:03:38.799> engines

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
green to represent the heat from engines

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.120 
green to represent the heat from engines
which<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:41.440> makes<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.829> look<00:03:42.459> more<00:03:42.489> realistic

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
which is it makes it look more realistic

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.740 
which is it makes it look more realistic
