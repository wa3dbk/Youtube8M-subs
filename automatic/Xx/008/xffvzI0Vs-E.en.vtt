00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.319
 another follow the best yu gi oh 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.030
 I'm putting cards in the jugo world today 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.860
 another on top because today it works 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.450
 not just the best junior cards 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.670
 but also the most precious yu gi 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.710
 oh cards stay tuned if you 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.150
 lucky you find a card in 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.970
 your collection again i here 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.850
 and you're multi 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.890
 millionaires okay maybe not like that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.769
 extreme but we will definitely 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.510
 get a little more pocket money 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.800
 for these cards I'm here in this 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.899
 series will go 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.579
 and I thought about it now 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.700
 Of course there are cards that are mine 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.770
 a lot of time I value a certain amount of time 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.379
 So I'll be in this series too 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 The tickets are then taken 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.940
 little bit worth it 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.370
 and what does anything worth? 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.989
 I'm just talking about cards here 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.420
 Worth 20 euros 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.610
 because I think 20 euro that's it 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.280
 a lot more beautiful there you can ever 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.289
 Build one up here and me 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.239
 would say we start with the same time 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.369
 a map where I did not think myself 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.600
 that's actually right 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.970
 it is worth ex so liane kroos 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.670
 and of course this card reminds a lot 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.509
 our max o dia and what can this 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.210
 map whole 1 recycle htk from 1800 and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.070
 if you all exo the shares on your 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.979
 cemetery then survived the only 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.040
 otherwise it will be destroyed immediately and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.409
 she holds 500 of you per standby face 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.180
 Attika in addition and she can neither 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.310
 through came neither by effects of 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.799
 magic hand falling cards are destroyed 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.070
 So the only monster effect is you 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.600
 destroyed and this card was up at that time 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.159
 every case very powerful she has 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.869
 also only four stars that is if we 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.390
 all the parts on your cemetery 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.869
 it was really easy to get this card 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.060
 call 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.040
 how much is the total value and there 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.120
 I orient myself to the highest 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.350
 praise 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.600
 it is clear that he is in reality 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.280
 usually gets a little less 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.080
 but I think that's a good one 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.030
 orientation and I even have two 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.580
 auctions can be found here 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.350
 both are green both are sold 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.130
 been for 25 euros 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.110
 and that makes this card one here 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.390
 the most precious yu gi oh cards and 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.850
 is in third place of the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.240
 series the best and most valuable yu gi 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.690
 oh cards in the judo bed goes on 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.270
 it with the relative, so to speak, namely 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.520
 um exotic, and here I am 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.270
 now above all things ex or complete 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.700
 consider 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.130
 that means the whole parts are 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.920
 of course, and in the highest 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.520
 rarer than stage namely ultra and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.930
 here we all the parts and the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.450
 head are worth 75 euro and how 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.670
 said a little less in reality 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.620
 Most ebay wise are very very expensive 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.070
 that's why it's better not to orient yourself 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.000
 so strong at it but ex or should 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.730
 you can not explain anymore 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.090
 if you all ex or divide up 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.630
 the hand you have the duel 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.400
 automatically won and defeated 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.480
 Players against players just in the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.879
 ground 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.140
 edge and the card has always 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:20.159
 style and therefore here on place 2 of the 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.650
 best judoka and at number one there are 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.860
 a relatively new card how can you 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.230
 from the so-called sigrid forces 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.730
 If you are lucky, of course, bring booster 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.290
 of course that has always been part of it 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.739
 and that is the nexus s is one 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.409
 fusion card with a total of 2300 ateka 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.530
 and one of the fans of 1400 you can 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:46.560
 this card with any micros 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.609
 ritual clean card material summon 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.150
 I had no idea why I am now 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.370
 American speech definitely has to 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.160
 Summoned them as a ritual summon 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.109
 be without axles of brian ax too 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.560
 Use and can not be different 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:05.250
 to be weakened and the beautiful 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.530
 is at each of these once per turn 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.810
 namely activate the following effects 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.150
 once you can discard this card 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.700
 and your hand a micro monster of 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.849
 your and add your gone and the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.440
 two defect is that you are up to two 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.180
 open monsters go on the field 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.039

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.660
 deck to rhythmic can do that 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.720
 the card, of course, extremely strong because yes 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.250
 everything really on this whole 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.700

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.270
 is currently based and therefore ne kroos of 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.090
 Bavaria 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.849
 how much do you get there for this 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.889
 card that it is also a very big one 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.560
 and high price so if you have them 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.210
 jackpot there have the whole display again 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.529
 I will also link it again 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.779
 where you can get that 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.399
 the display quite cheap and for this 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:58.509
 I also have two auctions at my card 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:05:03.189
 ebay found at a price of say 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:05.169
 and write 119 euros have been achieved 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.179
 So this price is really huge 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.869
 for a julio card you have to 

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:09.669
