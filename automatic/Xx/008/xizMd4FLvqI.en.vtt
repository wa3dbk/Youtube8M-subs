to need I know the Dark Matter pedestal

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.740 
to need I know the Dark Matter pedestal
is<00:01:03.129> a<00:01:03.159> little<00:01:03.429> bit<00:01:03.519> expensive<00:01:03.819> but<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.600> is

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
is a little bit expensive but it is

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.830 
is a little bit expensive but it is
completely<00:01:05.320> worth<00:01:05.620> it<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:07.000> as<00:01:07.360> you<00:01:07.570> can<00:01:07.659> see

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
completely worth it so as you can see

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.540 
completely worth it so as you can see
there's<00:01:08.110> random<00:01:08.500> sugar<00:01:08.710> came<00:01:08.950> flying<00:01:09.220> in<00:01:09.400> the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
there's random sugar came flying in the

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.410 
there's random sugar came flying in the
air<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.770> turn<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.100> off<00:01:12.310> we<00:01:12.610> just<00:01:12.850> right

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
air and to turn this off we just right

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.280 
air and to turn this off we just right
click<00:01:13.720> on<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.270> there<00:01:16.420> we<00:01:16.540> go<00:01:16.570> now<00:01:17.050> we<00:01:17.110> have

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
click on this so there we go now we have

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
click on this so there we go now we have
it<00:01:17.410> turned<00:01:17.590> off<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.210> if<00:01:19.270> we<00:01:19.390> go<00:01:19.540> in<00:01:19.690> here<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:21.250> you

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
it turned off so if we go in here as you

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.340 
it turned off so if we go in here as you
can<00:01:21.580> see<00:01:21.700> that's<00:01:22.210> only<00:01:22.420> been<00:01:22.600> on<00:01:22.750> for<00:01:22.810> about<00:01:23.020> a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
can see that's only been on for about a

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.020 
can see that's only been on for about a
minute<00:01:23.770> or<00:01:23.890> two<00:01:23.980> and<00:01:24.130> it's<00:01:24.430> already<00:01:24.730> got<00:01:24.850> three

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
minute or two and it's already got three

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.340 
minute or two and it's already got three
dark<00:01:25.270> matter<00:01:25.480> in<00:01:25.660> it<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.430> it's<00:01:28.330> just<00:01:28.510> producing

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
dark matter in it so it's just producing

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.020 
dark matter in it so it's just producing
producing<00:01:29.620> sugarcane<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.370> then<00:01:30.580> turning<00:01:30.820> the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
producing sugarcane and then turning the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.960 
producing sugarcane and then turning the
sugar<00:01:31.300> cane<00:01:31.480> with<00:01:32.200> into<00:01:32.950> more<00:01:33.160> entered<00:01:33.700> red

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
sugar cane with into more entered red

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.360 
sugar cane with into more entered red
matter<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.680> is<00:01:35.710> how<00:01:35.950> we're<00:01:36.160> going<00:01:36.280> to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
matter so this is how we're going to

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.510 
matter so this is how we're going to
make<00:01:36.550> it<00:01:36.760> first<00:01:37.630> thing<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:37.810> wanna<00:01:38.020> do<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.170> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
make it first thing you wanna do is you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.730 
make it first thing you wanna do is you
want<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.580> just<00:01:39.790> do<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:40.870> in<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.080> ground<00:01:41.380> here

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
want to just do this in the ground here

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.130 
want to just do this in the ground here
this<00:01:42.160> little<00:01:44.550> after<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.850> nap<00:01:46.210> we<00:01:46.930> want

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
this little after the nap we want

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.810 
this little after the nap we want
to<00:01:47.230> fill<00:01:47.470> up<00:01:47.710> these<00:01:48.160> bits<00:01:48.460> here<00:01:48.550> with<00:01:48.940> dirt

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
to fill up these bits here with dirt

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.220 
to fill up these bits here with dirt
then<00:01:51.820> put<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.630> water<00:01:52.810> bucket<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.320> middle

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
then put the water bucket in the middle

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.570 
then put the water bucket in the middle
next<00:01:56.230> we're<00:01:56.590> going<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.800> put<00:01:56.950> our<00:01:57.010> sugar<00:01:57.400> cane

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
next we're going to put our sugar cane

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.890 
next we're going to put our sugar cane
round<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.670> these<00:02:00.910> Tippett<00:02:01.270> these<00:02:01.510> two<00:02:01.720> bits

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
round but these Tippett these two bits

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.120 
round but these Tippett these two bits
here<00:02:02.050> we're<00:02:02.230> going<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.410> leave<00:02:02.590> them<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:02.980> we'll

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
here we're going to leave them and we'll

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.780 
here we're going to leave them and we'll
add<00:02:03.340> them<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.640> later<00:02:05.100> snow<00:02:06.100> for<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.430> glass

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:22.700 

whoops<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.610> was<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.270> machine<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.930> it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
whoops so this was this machine and it

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.590 
whoops so this was this machine and it
wasn't<00:02:23.490> really<00:02:23.670> insane<00:02:24.000> it's<00:02:24.180> more<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:25.490> set

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
wasn't really insane it's more of a set

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.170 
wasn't really insane it's more of a set
thing<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.840> guess<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.290> don't<00:02:28.590> know<00:02:28.680> what<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.860> is

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
thing I guess I don't know what it is

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.230 
thing I guess I don't know what it is
coupling<00:02:30.180> Ford<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.600> describe<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.880> but<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.030> does

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
coupling Ford to describe it but it does

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.330 
coupling Ford to describe it but it does
it<00:02:33.450> produces<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.290> think<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.830> diamond<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
it produces I think it's a diamond the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.570 
it produces I think it's a diamond the
second<00:02:36.170> as<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.380> can<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.740> isn't<00:02:38.490> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
second as you can see this isn't the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.630 
second as you can see this isn't the
Shogun's<00:02:39.120> already<00:02:39.390> growing<00:02:39.710> but<00:02:40.710> what<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.430> we

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
Shogun's already growing but what so we

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.750 
Shogun's already growing but what so we
want<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:41.940> move<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.510> dirt<00:02:42.900> one<00:02:43.170> up<00:02:43.760> so

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
want to just move that dirt one up so

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.660 
want to just move that dirt one up so
this<00:02:44.970> glass<00:02:45.210> has<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.570> be<00:02:45.660> three<00:02:45.990> high<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
this glass has to be three high the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.920 
this glass has to be three high the
dirts<00:02:47.880> going<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.210> be<00:02:48.300> one<00:02:48.480> up<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:49.700> then<00:02:50.930> we

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
dirts going to be one up and then we

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.890 
dirts going to be one up and then we
want<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.520> do<00:02:53.520> it<00:02:53.670> around<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.030> outside

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:05.150 

like<00:02:57.900> this<00:03:02.570> no<00:03:03.570> we<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.470> make<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> bottom<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
like this no we want to make a bottom to

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.330 
like this no we want to make a bottom to
this<00:03:05.280> bit<00:03:09.020> that's<00:03:10.020> up<00:03:10.230> there<00:03:10.380> this<00:03:10.740> bit<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
this bit that's up there this bit on the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.340 
this bit that's up there this bit on the
top<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.790> essential<00:03:12.630> as<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.870> can<00:03:12.990> see<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.260> up

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
top is essential as you can see it up

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.210 
top is essential as you can see it up
there<00:03:13.380> because<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.330> thing<00:03:15.570> because

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
there because it is the thing because

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.750 
there because it is the thing because
the<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:18.320> harvesting<00:03:19.320> ring<00:03:19.500> thinks<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.700> is

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
the the harvesting ring thinks this is

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.720 
the the harvesting ring thinks this is
the<00:03:21.030> top<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.480> sugarcane<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.280> then<00:03:23.280> that

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
the top of the sugarcane and then that

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.100 
the top of the sugarcane and then that
harvest<00:03:24.270> it<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.570> how<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.780> will<00:03:28.290> work

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
harvest it so that is how it will work

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.130 
harvest it so that is how it will work
but<00:03:31.110> we<00:03:31.560> don't<00:03:31.800> want<00:03:31.980> this<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.220> grow<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.510> we're

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
but we don't want this to grow so we're

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.880 
but we don't want this to grow so we're
going<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.470> put<00:03:34.500> one<00:03:35.720> piece<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.900> glass<00:03:37.170> on<00:03:37.470> top

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
going to put one piece of glass on top

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.410 
going to put one piece of glass on top
of<00:03:38.130> each<00:03:38.250> bit<00:03:40.370> we're<00:03:41.370> almost<00:03:41.550> done<00:03:42.000> it's<00:03:42.239> so

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
of each bit we're almost done it's so

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.170 
of each bit we're almost done it's so
easy<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:43.290> just<00:03:43.860> costs<00:03:44.190> quite<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.430> bit<00:03:44.670> for<00:03:44.910> the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
easy it just costs quite a bit for the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.199 
easy it just costs quite a bit for the
Dark<00:03:45.630> Matter<00:03:45.870> pedestal<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:47.100> mill<00:03:47.489> it's<00:03:47.790> I

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
Dark Matter pedestal to mill it's I

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.780 
Dark Matter pedestal to mill it's I
think<00:03:48.420> it's<00:03:48.769> for<00:03:49.769> dark<00:03:50.070> matter<00:03:50.130> blocks<00:03:50.580> and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
think it's for dark matter blocks and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.670 
think it's for dark matter blocks and
five<00:03:51.000> red<00:03:51.300> matter<00:03:51.480> but<00:03:52.080> on<00:03:52.290> one<00:03:52.470> hundred

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
five red matter but on one hundred

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.940 
five red matter but on one hundred
percent<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:54.110> so<00:03:55.110> next<00:03:55.350> thing<00:03:55.500> we<00:03:55.620> want<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.830> do

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
percent not so next thing we want to do

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.690 
percent not so next thing we want to do
is<00:03:56.100> we<00:03:56.550> want<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.790> get<00:03:56.910> all<00:03:56.970> chemical<00:03:57.660> chastine

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
is we want to get all chemical chastine

chest then condensed down into more as
you<00:04:59.010> see<00:04:59.550> we've<00:04:59.700> already<00:04:59.790> made<00:05:00.060> six<00:05:00.360> diamonds

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
you see we've already made six diamonds

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.920 
you see we've already made six diamonds
and<00:05:00.960> seven<00:05:01.620> eight<00:05:02.070> nine<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:05.210> this<00:05:06.210> this<00:05:06.630> will

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
and seven eight nine so this this will

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.200 
and seven eight nine so this this will
can<00:05:07.110> make<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.560> richest<00:05:07.980> man<00:05:08.130> ever<00:05:08.460> on<00:05:08.760> or
