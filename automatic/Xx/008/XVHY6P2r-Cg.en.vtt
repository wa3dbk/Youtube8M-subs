it and how it advance order and then I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.020 
it and how it advance order and then I
don't<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.370> cheaper<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
don't know if it's cheaper to get the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.600 
don't know if it's cheaper to get the
harnesses<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.660> whatnot<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.340> as<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.489> go

windshield doesn't exactly go the way it
should<00:01:30.409> in<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.650> case<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.579> mid<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.119> shade<00:01:33.420> is

should in this case my mid for shade is
too<00:01:33.869> long<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> hit<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.460> had<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.640> make<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
too long so I hit it so I had to make a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910 
too long so I hit it so I had to make a
bracket<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.290> I'll<00:01:37.380> show<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.799> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
bracket for it so I'll show you that in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.469 
bracket for it so I'll show you that in
a<00:01:37.950> little<00:01:37.979> bit<00:01:38.280> too<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:41.400> being<00:01:41.610> said<00:01:41.700> see

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
a little bit too so that being said see

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.859 
a little bit too so that being said see
what<00:01:42.509> I'm<00:01:42.720> doing<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:44.540> I'll<00:01:45.540> show<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.810> a

couple other things as we go along here
well<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.079> right<00:01:49.259> here<00:01:49.409> there's<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.649> switch

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
well you see right here there's a switch

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.600 
well you see right here there's a switch
that<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.820> installed<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:52.950> install<00:01:53.340> this

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that I installed you can install this

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.420 
that I installed you can install this
switch<00:01:54.329> any<00:01:54.930> kind<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.290> switch<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> won't<00:01:55.860> put

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430

a<00:01:56.460> switch<00:01:56.700> anywhere<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.869> just

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
a switch anywhere you want this is just

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.510 
a switch anywhere you want this is just
something<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.380> came<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.829> with<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.219> all<00:01:59.340> right

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
something I came up with it's all right

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.399 
something I came up with it's all right
here<00:01:59.820> what<00:02:00.329> does<00:02:00.540> switch<00:02:00.750> operates<00:02:01.259> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
here what does switch operates is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.770 
here what does switch operates is
actually<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.860> driving<00:02:02.430> lights<00:02:02.759> my<00:02:03.299> fog<00:02:03.509> lights

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
actually my driving lights my fog lights

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.859 
actually my driving lights my fog lights
of<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> bar<00:02:05.450> there's<00:02:06.450> many<00:02:06.659> ways<00:02:06.719> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
of the bar there's many ways to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.109 
of the bar there's many ways to
different<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.220> different<00:02:08.550> ways<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.940> do

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
different do it the different ways to do

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.880 
different do it the different ways to do
it<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.420> I'll<00:02:09.899> talk<00:02:10.050> about<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.379> circuitry<00:02:10.770> in

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
it and I'll talk about the circuitry in

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.020 
it and I'll talk about the circuitry in
a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.129> bit<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.489> thought<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.879> show

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
a little bit but I just thought to show

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.830 
a little bit but I just thought to show
you<00:02:12.090> this

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
you this

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.750 
you this
so<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.200> know<00:02:13.440> what<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:13.680> were<00:02:13.800> doing<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.459> you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so you know what we were doing and you

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.930 
so you know what we were doing and you
come<00:02:15.000> around<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.300> side<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.230> see<00:02:16.440> how

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
come around the side you can see how

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.370 
come around the side you can see how
there's<00:02:17.940> two<00:02:18.120> wires<00:02:18.330> here<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.930> went<00:02:19.290> ahead

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
there's two wires here but I went ahead

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.020 
there's two wires here but I went ahead
and<00:02:19.500> taped<00:02:19.739> them<00:02:19.800> together<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.459> wrapped<00:02:20.880> up

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and taped them together and I wrapped up

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.260 
and taped them together and I wrapped up
nice<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.209> neat<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.690> clutch<00:02:21.900> cable<00:02:22.140> again

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
nice and neat to the clutch cable again

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.210 
nice and neat to the clutch cable again
your<00:02:24.270> own<00:02:24.390> ideas<00:02:24.900> whatever<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.980> feel<00:02:26.160> like

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
your own ideas whatever you feel like

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.580 
your own ideas whatever you feel like
this<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.239> something<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.260> did

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
this is just something that that I did

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.670 
this is just something that that I did
that<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.860> come<00:02:29.099> up<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.300> all<00:02:30.300> right<00:02:30.500> one<00:02:31.500> thing

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
that I come up with all right one thing

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.170 
that I come up with all right one thing
about<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.040> light<00:02:32.280> bar<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.610> was<00:02:32.790> telling<00:02:33.120> about

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
about this light bar I was telling about

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.750 
about this light bar I was telling about
my<00:02:33.630> my<00:02:34.170> windshield<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.739> everything<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.340> had<00:02:35.670> to

my my windshield and everything I had to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.300 
my my windshield and everything I had to
build<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.060> bracket<00:02:36.599> here<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.830> see<00:02:38.040> I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
build this bracket here you can see I

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.979 
build this bracket here you can see I
knew<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> had<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.239> come<00:02:39.390> out<00:02:39.540> an<00:02:39.690> inch<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:39.959> a

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
knew I had to come out an inch and a

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.370 
knew I had to come out an inch and a
half<00:02:40.019> so<00:02:41.010> these<00:02:41.130> are<00:02:41.310> inch<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> half<00:02:41.760> out

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
half so these are inch and a half out

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
have you light up here lumen immed us a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.559 
have you light up here lumen immed us a
really<00:02:56.010> good<00:02:56.190> job<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:57.420> doesn't

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
really good job of that it doesn't

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.479 
really good job of that it doesn't
really<00:02:57.840> give<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> band<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:58.890> does<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.069> break

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
really give a band if it does a break

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.820 
really give a band if it does a break
and<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.060> most<00:03:00.239> cases<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:01.470> does<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.620> really

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
and in most cases but it does a really

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.530 
and in most cases but it does a really
good<00:03:02.040> job<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.549> that's<00:03:02.880> about<00:03:03.000> an<00:03:03.180> eighth<00:03:03.360> of

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
good job and that's about an eighth of

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.509 
good job and that's about an eighth of
an<00:03:03.660> inch<00:03:03.780> thick

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519

an inch thick
you<00:03:06.209> know<00:03:06.330> I'll<00:03:07.080> show<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.290> come<00:03:07.530> up<00:03:07.680> with<00:03:07.799> your

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
you know I'll show you come up with your

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.570 
you know I'll show you come up with your
own<00:03:08.069> thing<00:03:08.340> there<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.790> four<00:03:09.750> spaces<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.549> I

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
own thing there to four spaces on that I

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.420 
own thing there to four spaces on that I
actually<00:03:11.910> use<00:03:12.420> some<00:03:13.349> rod<00:03:13.530> couplings<00:03:14.099> like

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
actually use some rod couplings like

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.699 
actually use some rod couplings like
you'll<00:03:14.610> see<00:03:14.760> here<00:03:15.090> symmetric<00:03:15.959> rod<00:03:16.140> couplings

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
you'll see here symmetric rod couplings

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.069 
you'll see here symmetric rod couplings
um<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.970> whatever<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.420> have<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.780> can<00:03:18.810> even

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
um but whatever you have you can even

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.110 
um but whatever you have you can even
use<00:03:19.260> standard<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:20.340> bike<00:03:20.609> is<00:03:20.790> actually<00:03:21.060> a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
use standard this bike is actually a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.780 
use standard this bike is actually a
metric<00:03:21.480> bikes<00:03:22.700> VTX<00:03:23.700> 1300<00:03:24.180> AR<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.609> luck<00:03:26.609> would

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
metric bikes VTX 1300 AR and luck would

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.720 
metric bikes VTX 1300 AR and luck would
have<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.299> bought<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.049> used<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.709> like<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.430> said

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
have it I bought it used and like I said

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.759 
have it I bought it used and like I said
trying<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.630> go<00:03:30.750> through<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.440> make<00:03:31.620> this

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
trying to go through this and make this

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.770 
trying to go through this and make this
my<00:03:31.980> bike<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.269> some<00:03:33.569> of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.690> problems

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
my bike this is some of the problems

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.059 
my bike this is some of the problems
I've<00:03:34.140> ran<00:03:34.350> into<00:03:35.660> there's<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.780> bracket<00:03:37.230> as<00:03:37.950> you

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
I've ran into there's the bracket as you

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.190 
I've ran into there's the bracket as you
can<00:03:38.250> see<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.700> should<00:03:39.359> drill<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.569> hole<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.989> match

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
can see I should drill a hole to match

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.490 
can see I should drill a hole to match
so<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.680> could<00:03:40.859> run<00:03:40.980> my<00:03:41.130> wires<00:03:41.340> up<00:03:41.609> in<00:03:41.790> there<00:03:42.000> and

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
so I could run my wires up in there and
