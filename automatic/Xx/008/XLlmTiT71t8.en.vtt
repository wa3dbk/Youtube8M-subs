00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.000
 river fell by 2 to 0 in the bonbon 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.590
 in front of mouth after the match 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.389
 marcelo gallardo you spoke to reporters 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.700
 we left the one that said we lost a match 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.590
 there 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.020
 I do not say either that we were for 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.680
 win it but a match that was that 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:33.180
 it did not generate any kind of danger 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:33.180
 so that's why I think the second goal 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.540
 second ball all the time 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.970
 at the head of waldo and win the 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.489
 second does not bounce and from there 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.160
 want to hurt 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.190
 it was not a match in which the two 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.110
 teams felt like playing 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.110
 we were expecting to be wrong 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.129
 you do not want 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.340
 good in a match rubbed some 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.340
 ball 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.659
 the team that made the mistake what 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.010
 less possible and it will end 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:17.330
 coming out favored 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.330
 and the second time here 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.409
 with a part of some balls because 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.120
 I did not have a game out there that is 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.480
 delivered 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.520
 and peacock benefited him a little bit and 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.050
 He started to put in a little water but 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.030
 until there they gave us a second time 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.100
 fairly even in which we do not 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.220
 we suffered and we tried to have a 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.970
 little more space to play some 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.159
 against because we did not have either 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.640
 and a lot 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.920
 a lot of relationship with the game does not 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.229
 we found or we lost for it 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.409
 some personal duels that were played 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.869
 out there especially in the frontcourt 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.149
 our good but the party was 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.240
 to remember that is a match that 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:07.009
 he painted for a 0 to 0 so he committed 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.349
 an error and I would lose as much 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.399
 important of all this is beyond the 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.399
 pain of having lost today 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.939
 we quickly revenge or is 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.939
 in four days we have revenge 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.900
 equal or more important than the 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.490
 classification in the cup we did not want 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.340
 We wanted to do a shared to be able 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.230
 we have that possibility to leave 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.810
 with a mental advantage they will have it 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.540
 done but good to us will not give us 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.970
 we will have to chew the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.240
 but do not give a positive rebuke to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.260
 on court on Thursday our try to 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.260
 win our match
