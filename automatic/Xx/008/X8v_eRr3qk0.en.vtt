00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 in this first example I'm going to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.160
 explain how to calculate a staircase 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.950
 right from this scheme so I have a 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.650
 height 300 cm cross a hopper 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.259
 already existing 350 cm and a 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.580
 thickness of 20 centimes slabs I 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.359
 report on the site that she is killing and 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 stairs point fr and directs me to the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.619
 calculation page let's first look at the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.170
 diagram so I gave three that I 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.119
 know the height the hopper and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.340
 the thickness of the lgv so I go back these 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.270
 values â€‹â€‹in the form 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:39.390
 a height of 3000 mm a hopper of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.579
 3500 mm and a ball thickness of 200 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:49.350
 mm I run the calculation and looking at the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.870
 where results so I market 266 18 67 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.410
 mm a lap of 276 points 66 mm a 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.410
 grip of canes 1703 22 mm a 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.930
 escaped from 1909 milly but the law the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.140
 blondel is equal to 610 and the angle to 31 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.630
 07 degrees thanks to the party 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.610
 results interpretation 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.010
 I realize that the results 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.810
 are in the comfort criteria 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.590
 however, I would like to increase my 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.400
 breakaway which is 2009 109 mm at the value 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.330
 ideal of 2100 mm 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:31.710
 I have between these two news 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:34.430
 data in the form 2100 mm I 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.430
 start the calculation 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.270
 the site gives me the new value 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.240
 of my stairs with a breakaway of 200 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.750
 mm for practical issues game 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.760
 round bend of 268 points 54 mm 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:56.610
 at 270 I enter this value in the 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:58.200
 forms and we restart the calculation and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.390
 here after some adjustments I 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.510
 calculated my stairs 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:12.570
 let's look at what this gives here my 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:15.390
 departure situation and that's my staircase 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.380
 comic I hope this example has us 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.560
 allowed to understand the operation 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.970
 of the site calculates stairs point fr as 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.860
 you could see it so you do not have to 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.390
 hesitate to proceed step by step to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.390
 adjust your staircase
