00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
simple all you need to do is cut the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.759 
simple all you need to do is cut the
potatoes<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.160> half<00:00:23.189> first<00:00:23.760> along<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.769> thinner

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
potatoes in half first along the thinner

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.740 
potatoes in half first along the thinner
half<00:00:26.070> horizontally<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.539> that<00:00:31.250> and<00:00:32.750> then

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
half horizontally so like that and then

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.740 
half horizontally so like that and then
just<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> flat<00:00:35.160> side<00:00:35.190> down<00:00:35.540> just<00:00:36.540> cut

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
just with the flat side down just cut

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.350 
just with the flat side down just cut
them<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.050> half<00:00:37.079> again<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.100> depending<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.180> how

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
them in half again and depending on how

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600 
them in half again and depending on how
big<00:00:39.570> your<00:00:39.719> potatoes<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.070> might<00:00:41.250> want<00:00:41.489> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
big your potatoes are you might want to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.090 
big your potatoes are you might want to
cut<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.270> half<00:00:42.329> again<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.890> that's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
cut them in half again so that's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.279 
cut them in half again so that's
probably<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.640> little<00:00:44.760> bit<00:00:44.910> too<00:00:45.120> big<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.600> one

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
probably a little bit too big for one

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.450 
probably a little bit too big for one
potato<00:00:46.620> wedge<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:48.030> cuts<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.200> half<00:00:49.230> again

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.720 

like<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:54.110> easy<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.280> pop<00:00:56.430> them<00:00:56.550> into

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
like that easy so just pop them into

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.029 
like that easy so just pop them into
your<00:00:56.910> bowl<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:58.379> do<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> exactly<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
your bowl and just do the exactly the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:14.590 
your bowl and just do the exactly the
same<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> other<00:01:00.170> potatoes

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.840

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:30.199

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
and cut the other one in half again we

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:36.679 
and cut the other one in half again we
go<00:01:33.709> this<00:01:34.709> is<00:01:34.859> a<00:01:34.890> great<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:36.000> easy
