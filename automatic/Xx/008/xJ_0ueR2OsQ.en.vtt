00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.380 
accident which is great but I wrote in
green<00:01:15.180> letters<00:01:15.540> com<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.880> then<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.180> will

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
green letters com a and then this will

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.249 
green letters com a and then this will
be<00:01:21.570> an<00:01:21.659> S<00:01:21.869> there'll<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:23.909> couple<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.630> pieces

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.370 
be an S there'll be a couple of pieces
that<00:01:25.500> will<00:01:25.770> make<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.130> into<00:01:26.400> an<00:01:26.490> S<00:01:27.110> but<00:01:28.110> I

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that will make that into an S but I

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.520 
that will make that into an S but I
think<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.619> looks<00:01:28.890> pretty<00:01:29.070> cool

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.560 

I<00:01:32.619> don't<00:01:33.250> have<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.549> walls<00:01:33.760> built<00:01:34.150> over<00:01:34.420> here

I don't have the walls built over here

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.330 
I don't have the walls built over here

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009
