what<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:22.850> mean<00:02:22.880> but<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:24.020> is<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.260> little<00:02:24.470> bit

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
what I mean but this is a little bit

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.620 
what I mean but this is a little bit
different<00:02:25.040> from<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.280> lip<00:02:25.460> balm<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.940> think<00:02:26.270> it's<00:02:26.420> a

different from a lip balm I think it's a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.740 
different from a lip balm I think it's a
little<00:02:26.930> bit<00:02:27.790> creamier<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:28.820> it's<00:02:29.480> definitely

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
little bit creamier and it's definitely

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.650 
little bit creamier and it's definitely
really<00:02:30.260> moisturizing<00:02:31.130> but<00:02:31.460> I<00:02:31.790> just<00:02:32.090> love<00:02:32.390> that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
really moisturizing but I just love that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.360 
really moisturizing but I just love that
