and<00:00:06.089> I've<00:00:07.020> been<00:00:07.230> playing<00:00:07.470> with<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.770> new<00:00:08.160> tarot

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
and I've been playing with a new tarot

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.089 
and I've been playing with a new tarot
spread<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.630> made<00:00:09.900> up<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.380> other<00:00:10.500> day<00:00:10.620> it

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
spread that I made up the other day it

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.370 
spread that I made up the other day it
was<00:00:11.519> actually<00:00:11.820> inspired<00:00:12.030> by<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.570> Roman<00:00:13.259> II

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
was actually inspired by the Roman II

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.829 
was actually inspired by the Roman II
spread<00:00:13.769> out<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> sacred<00:00:14.910> circle<00:00:15.089> Tarot's

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
spread out of the sacred circle Tarot's

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.710 
spread out of the sacred circle Tarot's
text<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.890> comes<00:00:17.130> with<00:00:17.369> their<00:00:17.640> tarot<00:00:18.300> deck

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
text that comes with their tarot deck

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.800 
text that comes with their tarot deck
but<00:00:19.680> um<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.160> kind<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.670> adjusted<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> reading

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
but um I kind of adjusted the reading

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.660 
but um I kind of adjusted the reading
and<00:00:22.080> did<00:00:22.230> some<00:00:22.410> different<00:00:22.710> things<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.160> so

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
and did some different things with it so

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.189 
and did some different things with it so
that<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:23.970> works<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.330> little<00:00:24.449> bit<00:00:24.660> better<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.080> me

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
that it works a little bit better for me

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.259 
that it works a little bit better for me
and<00:00:25.320> I'd<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.680> show<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.890> what<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.099> did

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
and I'd like to show you what I did

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.089 
and I'd like to show you what I did
basically<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.660> cosmic<00:00:28.199> gypsy<00:00:28.590> spread<00:00:28.890> is

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
basically the cosmic gypsy spread is

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.389 
basically the cosmic gypsy spread is
going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.789> utilize<00:00:30.029> 21<00:00:30.960> cards<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.130> looks<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
going to utilize 21 cards so it looks a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.580 
going to utilize 21 cards so it looks a
bit<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.210> tableau<00:00:33.690> arrangement<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.469> we

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
bit like the tableau arrangement that we

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.020 
bit like the tableau arrangement that we
teach<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.980> how<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.130> lay<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.790> Major

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
teach you how to lay out the Major

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.100 
teach you how to lay out the Major
Arcana<00:00:36.510> cards<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:37.140> in<00:00:37.399> our<00:00:38.399> course<00:00:39.110> but

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
Arcana cards in in our course but

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.740 
Arcana cards in in our course but
instead<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.250> having<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.640> majors<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.329> 21

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
instead of having the majors in this 21

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.160 
instead of having the majors in this 21
position<00:00:43.530> spread<00:00:44.309> position<00:00:45.020> what<00:00:46.020> you're

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
position spread position what you're

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.020 
position spread position what you're
actually<00:00:46.350> going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.280> you're<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
actually going to do is you're going to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.170 
actually going to do is you're going to
shuffle<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.570> deck<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.050> deal<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.100> cards

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
shuffle the deck and deal out the cards

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.700 
shuffle the deck and deal out the cards
to<00:00:51.180> put<00:00:51.420> them<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.809> these<00:00:52.050> positions

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
to put them into these positions

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.000 
to put them into these positions
randomly<00:00:53.550> or<00:00:54.239> intuitively<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.829> can

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
randomly or intuitively so that you can

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.580 
randomly or intuitively so that you can
actually<00:00:56.190> read<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.329> card<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.079> lay<00:00:58.379> out

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
actually read the card that you lay out

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.430 
actually read the card that you lay out
and<00:00:59.149> the<00:01:00.149> basic<00:01:00.510> idea<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.140> we're

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and the basic idea here is that we're

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.039 
and the basic idea here is that we're
going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.739> three<00:01:02.100> rows<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> past<00:01:03.750> one

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
going to have three rows one is past one

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.320 
going to have three rows one is past one
is<00:01:04.199> present<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.710> future<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.339> we're<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
is present is future and we're going to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.250 
is present is future and we're going to
have<00:01:06.680> seven<00:01:07.680> columns<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.820> cards<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
have seven columns of cards going on and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.609 
have seven columns of cards going on and
I'm<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.799> go<00:01:11.010> really<00:01:11.670> briefly<00:01:12.180> into<00:01:12.930> what

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
I'm going to go really briefly into what

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.410 
I'm going to go really briefly into what
those<00:01:13.799> columns<00:01:14.220> are<00:01:14.369> all<00:01:14.460> about<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.060> here

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
those columns are all about for you here

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.780 
those columns are all about for you here
so<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> three<00:01:16.920> rows<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
so the three rows that we're going to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.600 
so the three rows that we're going to
have<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> represent<00:01:18.570> past<00:01:19.610> present

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
have are going to represent past present

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.600 
have are going to represent past present
and<00:01:20.850> future<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.890> then<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> seven<00:01:23.400> rows

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and future and then the seven rows

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.219 
and future and then the seven rows
roughly<00:01:24.180> correlates<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:26.150> seven

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
roughly correlates to the seven

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.120 
roughly correlates to the seven
quote-unquote<00:01:28.229> planets<00:01:28.799> they're<00:01:28.979> not

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
quote-unquote planets they're not

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.090 
quote-unquote planets they're not
actually<00:01:29.430> planets<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:29.909> they're<00:01:30.090> planets<00:01:30.780> as

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
actually planets but they're planets as

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.410 
actually planets but they're planets as
as<00:01:32.180> seen<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.960> skies<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.290> our<00:01:35.420> ancestors

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
as seen in the skies of our ancestors

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
as seen in the skies of our ancestors
before<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.990> discovered<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.590> outer<00:01:37.799> planets

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
before we discovered the outer planets

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.960 
before we discovered the outer planets
and<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.329> those<00:01:39.710> seven<00:01:40.710> positions<00:01:41.159> are<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> Sun

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and so those seven positions are the Sun

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.510 
and so those seven positions are the Sun
the<00:01:42.930> Moon<00:01:43.170> Venus<00:01:44.960> Mars<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:47.130> I'll<00:01:47.250> tell<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the Moon Venus Mars and I'll tell you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.950 
the Moon Venus Mars and I'll tell you
why<00:01:47.640> these<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.119> order<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> minute

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
why these are out of order in a minute

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.929 
why these are out of order in a minute
mercury<00:01:49.909> Saturn<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> Jupiter<00:01:52.640> now<00:01:53.640> I've<00:01:53.759> got

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
mercury Saturn and Jupiter now I've got

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.550 
mercury Saturn and Jupiter now I've got
the<00:01:54.060> Sun<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.299> position<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.049> because<00:01:55.409> he

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the Sun in position one because he

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.459 
the Sun in position one because he
correlates<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.310> lot<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:57.140> images<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.439> have

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
correlates a lot to images that we have

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.149 
correlates a lot to images that we have
of<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.280> column<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.329> tableau<00:02:00.840> ie<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
of the one column in the tableau ie the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.410 
of the one column in the tableau ie the
magician<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.939> strength<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.740> devil<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
magician and strength and the devil and

we'll<00:04:43.550> deal<00:04:43.820> out<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.240> cards<00:04:44.270> as<00:04:44.960> follows<00:04:45.770> now

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
we'll deal out the cards as follows now

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.670 
we'll deal out the cards as follows now
of<00:04:46.610> course<00:04:46.789> you<00:04:47.060> could<00:04:47.479> if<00:04:47.870> you're<00:04:48.349> an

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
of course you could if you're an

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.800 
of course you could if you're an
intuitive<00:04:49.130> enough<00:04:49.639> reader<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.389> like<00:04:50.630> to

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
intuitive enough reader and you like to

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.839 
intuitive enough reader and you like to
do<00:04:50.930> it<00:04:51.020> this<00:04:51.139> way<00:04:51.349> you<00:04:51.919> don't<00:04:52.130> have<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.639> lay<00:04:52.820> out

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
do it this way you don't have to lay out

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.120 
do it this way you don't have to lay out
these<00:04:53.150> cards<00:04:53.539> sequentially<00:04:54.470> like<00:04:54.889> we're

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
these cards sequentially like we're

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.070 
these cards sequentially like we're
showing<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:55.639> how<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:56.240> do<00:04:56.509> here

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
showing you how to do here

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.249 
showing you how to do here
you<00:04:57.830> could<00:04:58.009> also<00:04:58.280> lay<00:04:58.729> them<00:04:58.970> out<00:04:59.090> just<00:05:00.020> sort<00:05:00.199> of

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
you could also lay them out just sort of

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.430 
you could also lay them out just sort of
intuitively<00:05:01.030> one<00:05:02.030> at<00:05:02.180> a<00:05:02.210> time<00:05:02.479> as<00:05:02.840> they<00:05:03.139> come

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
intuitively one at a time as they come

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.550 
intuitively one at a time as they come
to<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:03.770> so<00:05:04.160> I'm<00:05:04.639> sort<00:05:04.940> of<00:05:05.030> randomly<00:05:05.560> depending

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
to you so I'm sort of randomly depending

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.680 
to you so I'm sort of randomly depending
on<00:05:06.650> where<00:05:06.830> you<00:05:07.009> intuitively<00:05:07.370> feel<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.389> card

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
on where you intuitively feel that card

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.589 
on where you intuitively feel that card
belongs<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:10.280> you'd<00:05:10.610> read<00:05:10.820> them<00:05:10.970> accordingly

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
belongs and you'd read them accordingly

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.960 
belongs and you'd read them accordingly
now<00:05:12.560> one<00:05:12.770> thing<00:05:12.979> that<00:05:13.039> I<00:05:13.250> have<00:05:13.520> discovered

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
now one thing that I have discovered

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.360 
now one thing that I have discovered
that<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.330> can<00:05:14.479> do<00:05:14.810> here<00:05:15.110> as<00:05:15.560> if<00:05:15.800> there's<00:05:16.009> a<00:05:16.099> row

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
that you can do here as if there's a row

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.120 
that you can do here as if there's a row
that<00:05:16.639> you<00:05:16.729> have<00:05:17.030> a<00:05:17.360> number<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.139> tricky<00:05:18.620> cards

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
that you have a number of tricky cards

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.189 
that you have a number of tricky cards
in<00:05:19.280> or<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.520> number<00:05:19.820> of<00:05:20.000> stumbling<00:05:20.479> blocks<00:05:20.900> show

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
in or a number of stumbling blocks show

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.420 
in or a number of stumbling blocks show
up<00:05:21.409> in<00:05:21.650> such<00:05:22.340> as<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.699> lot<00:05:22.940> of<00:05:23.090> reversed<00:05:23.510> cards<00:05:24.139> or

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
up in such as a lot of reversed cards or

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.029 
up in such as a lot of reversed cards or
more<00:05:25.430> negative<00:05:25.669> cards<00:05:26.449> you<00:05:27.139> could<00:05:27.500> then<00:05:27.770> ask

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
more negative cards you could then ask

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.610 
more negative cards you could then ask
the<00:05:28.370> Tarot<00:05:28.639> well<00:05:29.389> what<00:05:29.599> can<00:05:29.780> I<00:05:29.900> do<00:05:29.960> about<00:05:30.409> this

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
the Tarot well what can I do about this

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.460 
the Tarot well what can I do about this
to<00:05:31.070> change<00:05:31.520> this<00:05:31.940> what<00:05:32.240> can<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.479> do<00:05:32.539> to<00:05:32.900> work<00:05:33.139> on

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
to change this what can I do to work on

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.890 
to change this what can I do to work on
this<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:34.010> let's<00:05:34.909> say<00:05:35.180> for<00:05:35.419> instance<00:05:35.449> that<00:05:35.840> we

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
this and let's say for instance that we

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.990 
this and let's say for instance that we
had<00:05:36.139> some<00:05:36.289> tricky<00:05:36.680> cards<00:05:37.159> show<00:05:37.520> up<00:05:37.699> in<00:05:37.880> the

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
had some tricky cards show up in the

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.510 
had some tricky cards show up in the
Mars<00:05:38.270> row<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:38.960> we<00:05:39.440> asked<00:05:39.860> well<00:05:40.039> what<00:05:40.220> can<00:05:40.400> I<00:05:40.460> do

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
Mars row and we asked well what can I do

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.920 
Mars row and we asked well what can I do
about<00:05:40.789> this<00:05:41.060> you<00:05:41.210> can<00:05:41.360> then<00:05:41.539> draw<00:05:41.750> an

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
about this you can then draw an

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.409 
about this you can then draw an
additional<00:05:42.500> card<00:05:42.770> down<00:05:43.130> at<00:05:43.340> the<00:05:43.400> bottom<00:05:43.789> to

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
additional card down at the bottom to

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.089 
additional card down at the bottom to
sort<00:05:44.690> of<00:05:44.750> show<00:05:44.960> you<00:05:45.020> how<00:05:45.440> you<00:05:45.500> can<00:05:45.830> work<00:05:46.039> with

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
sort of show you how you can work with

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.460 
sort of show you how you can work with
this<00:05:46.490> your<00:05:46.729> growth<00:05:46.970> point<00:05:47.419> for<00:05:47.810> that<00:05:47.990> row<00:05:48.289> of

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
this your growth point for that row of

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.159 
this your growth point for that row of
cards<00:05:48.740> or<00:05:49.010> that<00:05:49.130> column<00:05:49.460> of<00:05:49.580> cards<00:05:50.030> and<00:05:50.270> you

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
cards or that column of cards and you

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.100 
cards or that column of cards and you
can<00:05:51.320> also<00:05:51.500> have<00:05:52.340> a<00:05:52.760> growth<00:05:53.120> point<00:05:53.479> you<00:05:53.810> know<00:05:53.930> in

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
can also have a growth point you know in

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.529 
can also have a growth point you know in
any<00:05:54.500> number<00:05:54.860> of<00:05:54.949> rows<00:05:55.130> so<00:05:55.400> if<00:05:55.760> we<00:05:56.120> had<00:05:56.300> some

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
any number of rows so if we had some

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.089 
any number of rows so if we had some
tricky<00:05:56.840> card<00:05:57.080> show<00:05:57.320> up<00:05:57.380> in<00:05:57.470> our<00:05:57.560> expansion

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
tricky card show up in our expansion

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.810 
tricky card show up in our expansion
column<00:05:58.900> we<00:05:59.900> could<00:06:00.110> again<00:06:00.650> put<00:06:01.070> a<00:06:01.099> growth<00:06:01.460> point

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
column we could again put a growth point

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.960 
column we could again put a growth point
card<00:06:02.060> there<00:06:02.419> at<00:06:02.630> the<00:06:02.720> bottom<00:06:03.190> so<00:06:04.190> it's<00:06:04.370> a<00:06:04.580> very

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
card there at the bottom so it's a very

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.230 
card there at the bottom so it's a very
very<00:06:05.330> deep<00:06:05.680> expletive<00:06:06.680> reading<00:06:07.130> that<00:06:07.940> you<00:06:08.060> can

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
very deep expletive reading that you can
