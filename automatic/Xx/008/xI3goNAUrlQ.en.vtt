00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
if this is damaged you could end up with

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.440 
if this is damaged you could end up with
some<00:02:45.190> numbness<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.850> very<00:02:49.000> important<00:02:49.420> for

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
some numbness so it's very important for

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.240 
some numbness so it's very important for
the<00:02:49.570> surgeon<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.230> know<00:02:50.440> their<00:02:50.740> Anatomy

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
the surgeon to know their Anatomy

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.110 
the surgeon to know their Anatomy
obviously<00:02:51.970> as<00:02:52.660> with<00:02:52.930> any<00:02:53.010> surgery<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.910> to

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
obviously as with any surgery and to

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.320 
obviously as with any surgery and to
avoid<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:57.090> ideally<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.420> want<00:02:58.570> your<00:02:58.780> chin<00:02:59.140> to

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
avoid that ideally you want your chin to

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.920 
avoid that ideally you want your chin to
hit<00:03:01.330> your<00:03:01.840> lower<00:03:02.290> lip<00:03:02.650> if<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:03.460> line<00:03:04.240> was<00:03:04.540> dropped

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
hit your lower lip if a line was dropped

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.640 
hit your lower lip if a line was dropped
straight<00:03:05.320> from<00:03:05.620> your<00:03:05.740> lower<00:03:05.950> lift<00:03:06.220> your<00:03:06.520> chin

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
straight from your lower lift your chin

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.440 
straight from your lower lift your chin
tangentially<00:03:08.650> that's<00:03:09.550> about<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.850> projection

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
tangentially that's about the projection

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.050 
tangentially that's about the projection
that<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.660> want<00:03:11.370> another<00:03:12.370> interesting<00:03:12.970> aspect

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
that you want another interesting aspect

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.979 
that you want another interesting aspect
of<00:03:14.040> augmentation<00:03:15.090> implants<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.300> that<00:03:16.510> area<00:03:16.780> is

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
of augmentation implants in that area is

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.710 
of augmentation implants in that area is
a<00:03:17.170> pre<00:03:17.860> jowl<00:03:18.190> implant<00:03:18.850> which<00:03:19.120> doesn't<00:03:19.600> really

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
a pre jowl implant which doesn't really

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.830 
a pre jowl implant which doesn't really
have<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.830> projection<00:03:21.790> for<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.060> chin<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:22.720> it

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
have the projection for the chin but it

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.340 
have the projection for the chin but it
has<00:03:22.989> projection<00:03:23.250> out<00:03:24.250> here<00:03:24.880> for<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.720> jowl<00:03:25.989> and

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
has projection out here for the jowl and

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.250 
has projection out here for the jowl and
this<00:03:26.860> in<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.430> pre<00:03:27.730> jello<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.510> what<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.900> does<00:03:29.080> is

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
this in the pre jello so what it does is

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.280 
this in the pre jello so what it does is
it<00:03:29.290> blends<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:30.100> jowl<00:03:30.400> area<00:03:30.780> with<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.959> chin

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
it blends the jowl area with the chin

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.270 
it blends the jowl area with the chin
and<00:03:32.560> gives<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.640> patient<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:34.239> stronger<00:03:35.280> chin

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
and gives the patient a stronger chin

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.380 
and gives the patient a stronger chin
light<00:03:36.520> or<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.420> chin<00:03:38.200> line<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.000> sits<00:03:40.209> there

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
light or a chin line so it sits there

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.910 
light or a chin line so it sits there
like<00:03:40.600> this<00:03:40.900> doesn't<00:03:41.470> really<00:03:41.709> give<00:03:41.890> you

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
like this doesn't really give you

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.190 
like this doesn't really give you
projection<00:03:42.610> but<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:43.060> fills<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.780> jowl<00:03:44.170> area

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
projection but it fills in the jowl area

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.220 
projection but it fills in the jowl area
criminally<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.880> both<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.209> chin<00:03:46.420> implant<00:03:46.810> and

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
criminally so both the chin implant and

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.420 
criminally so both the chin implant and
the<00:03:47.590> pre<00:03:48.220> gel<00:03:48.459> implant<00:03:48.940> are<00:03:49.239> available<00:03:50.250> it's<00:03:51.250> a

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
the pre gel implant are available it's a

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.340 
the pre gel implant are available it's a
relatively<00:03:51.760> simple<00:03:52.150> procedure<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:53.140> takes

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
relatively simple procedure it takes

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.590 
relatively simple procedure it takes
probably<00:03:54.070> about<00:03:54.280> 30<00:03:54.580> minutes<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.030> do<00:03:55.300> it's

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
probably about 30 minutes to do it's

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.930 
probably about 30 minutes to do it's
usually<00:03:55.840> done<00:03:56.140> in<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.380> operating

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
usually done in the operating

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.510 
usually done in the operating
and<00:03:57.680> certainly<00:03:58.680> if<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:58.830> have<00:03:58.980> any<00:03:59.190> more

one<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.150> really<00:04:06.510> nice<00:04:06.720> things<00:04:07.080> about<00:04:07.230> a

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
one of the really nice things about a

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.290 
one of the really nice things about a
chin<00:04:07.710> implant<00:04:07.740> is<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.400> bigger<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.850> chin<00:04:09.090> is

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
chin implant is the bigger the chin is

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.690 
chin implant is the bigger the chin is
the<00:04:09.510> smaller<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.080> nose<00:04:10.260> looks<00:04:10.590> be<00:04:11.520> well

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the smaller the nose looks be well

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.300 
the smaller the nose looks be well
