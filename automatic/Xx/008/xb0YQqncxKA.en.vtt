00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.709
 6 6 there 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.949
 placed in sixth place 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.539
 the first broadcast 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.240
 3 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.079
 the first broadcast there was doubt 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.509
 in June 2009 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.489
 and in Amsterdam in the small studio it even worse the then 50 companies 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.810
 from the region 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.810
 and I was then asked by an albers not in it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.470
 a kind of station directors 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.490
 violated that can talk about its own radio program 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.420
 there was a kind of dream come true 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.880
 because I always am 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.480
 As a small child listening to the radio that literally goes on the radio schedule 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.020
 from the upper mountain 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.690
 and I just knew yes 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.160
 I think radio is magical radio 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.330
 what makes radio nice for me is that radio 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.040
 maki tsuji now x current 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.590
 you can get something from the past to now but I can't get it from the future either 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.060
 an album still has to be released or an hour or 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.790
 a party that arrives that you can now also finish that is the power of radio and that 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.470
 in front of the radio the boy sends someone watching television through the front door 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.970
 with all due respect you have to go through the front door 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.750
 you still have to share a room and a camera is often nevertheless from people 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.140
 that is the threshold 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.430
 it is radio is much intimate it has been a year and me 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.400
 I talk to the listener about the liebaut list 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 and I think that tia I am also a big fan of radio plays 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.859
 stimulate people's imagination and that is what radio does 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.750
 versus new music 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.390
 and the radio is everywhere too 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.770
 with you you know where is your boyfriend the boat box or whether that your car radio or 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.330
 no matter what you are doing radio always goes with you 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.060
 yes so by the unbelieving role in ours 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.120
 yes society it is music it is 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.880
 information m 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.299
 yes you can always build a big band with your boots radios 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.320
 continue to exist and that power 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.370
 that's why I started with radio 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.720
 so you are asked 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.509
 why 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.849
 I was asked for an Albert I have been there everywhere for a long time that all three met 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.999
 from which they get out of the jeep that 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.779
 and the week before he had been there in the studio 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.779
 with koen van tijn to a number of his broadcasts 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.279
 to attend and do nothing there and 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:28.119
 yes i think so 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.739
 that he saw that something in me I also always had a clear overview 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.509
 a big fan of its value program for boxes seems like a test 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:35.700
 and that wasn't either 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.720
 been once with 3fm when i made that and i'll get to know you if 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.799
 plates and 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.379
 due to its strange program also ruble through even region with the of a residential area 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.659
 in and an inspection 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.139
 I call the delivery yes 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.769
 stated programs on the netherlands if I am sick I say 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.769
 I have the luxury with Jansen 3voor12 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.519
 all those radio programs together made most fascinating by it 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.359
 phenomenon 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.840
 radio the power of radio and i assumed i still have home and the cupboard full of 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.369
 all cassette tapes 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:09.340
 from that time 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.509
 and with the interviews and the conversations and 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:17.919
 the real radio freak nancy that you sit that chance that you have and that you then 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.429
 it is worth yes nostalgic yes I listen very often while running 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:22.619
 party leader 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:26.579
 resumed within one week after all episodes of production 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.609
 He was founded in 2003 a long time ago that I keep the time that I am on 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:31.279
 headline 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.919
 what I like so much about the way in which curry is presented 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.779
 mb the choice of plates of the mill dike that just 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.179
 the rest of the union 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:43.489
 and he turned everything together into a full house to rock hard 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.379
 Twente Tecno and 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.469
 that all went well when it turned out that it became all common one denominator 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.809
 they viewed that with all turned so viewed 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:54.389
 and I wasn't old enough to go to a discotheque myself 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.149
 it so i got my 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.439
 in education in the Danish actually had through those radio programs as 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.829
 thanks guys 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.459

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.499

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.269
 the box 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.779
 the state because this time there was a neat because i found it funny 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.549
 bit fat there nothing for what it wants to make anniversary match over it 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.539
 number of tumors always goes 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.150
 Only then don't tell themselves so seriously about the announcement 

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.300
 pile the plates 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.720
 so certainly in the store yes that you can no longer imagine makes the scheme 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.999
 very satisfied with it 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:33.789
 what to say now as a precaution on television was then and on the radio 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.370
 curry matches that 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.949
 just an old man up the stairs in the radio studio and he would rather stay home 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.879
 Stocks program of the Friday night Friday night year and that was between 17 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:50.060

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.110
 that was culture i know there was a neat in it was really one of the members 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.070
 can be set that was real 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.059
 if it really is very bad 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:04.559
 was really a very different time but 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.259
 I grew up in that time and I was immediately fascinated
