00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello there will be no video today 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.969
 like all my other videos on 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.960
 channel here today we will mine 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.109
 matchless fire 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.170
 all of you are watching the channel Gregory Falcon 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.730
 very interesting channel on here and in 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.529
 some videos he says that 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.019
 ideological inspirer Evgeny kolesniki 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.149
 who lives along narrow here and along 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.160
 lapse it turned out that 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.680
 came living with me literally on 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.820
 the next street and kinda started 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.879
 friendship began to communicate and it turned out that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.230
 very interesting creative person 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.800
 there are a lot of ideas at all 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.230
 but that's a lot of coincidence to 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.449
 Unfortunately , Eugene himself can not shoot 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.270
 video he has a group in contact 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.100
 Be sure to give a link to his group under 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.740
 video 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.909
 so I kinda decided on my channel 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.409
 make a separate playlist will he 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.140
 to be called a matchless fire 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:22.259
 where will the videos be laid out on which 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.470
 here actually gave the idea let's say evgeny 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.470
 wheels 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.460
 well for today 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.439
 now you will see the first video of this 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:41.000
 series let's say here we will fire 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:44.360
 using potassium permanganate and antifreeze 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.060
 now for the practical part 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.310
 look no further 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:57.619
 and so now we will make fire without 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.329
 matches or using potassium permanganate and 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.530
 antifreeze 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.509
 Here is a cap on top lay flew off 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.489
 me 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:19.860
 so now I will be with Oleg 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:23.390
 add not to overdo it so take 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.660
 a piece of paper on some dry and 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.640
 add manganese spike a little bit 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:39.920
 about a teaspoon and add 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:39.920
 antifreeze here a little bit by mixing and 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:56.150
 very tightly compress the paper now 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.870
 leave our mixture for a couple of minutes and 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.870
 see what happens 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:37.510
 well we got fire without matches with 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:40.030
 using potassium permanganate antifreeze if you 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.240
 you are somewhere and you have no 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.370
 matches need to make a fire but there is 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.840
 for example, near cars you can get 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.740
 antifreeze and let's say medical first aid kit then 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.050
 This way you can quite well 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:00.730
 make fire in the winter make a fire and 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.680
 keep warm subscribe to the channel 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.030
 like everyone thanks for watching 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.030
 bye everyone
