five<00:00:22.560> different<00:00:22.980> uses<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.580> tool<00:00:23.850> but

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
five different uses for this tool but

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.029 
five different uses for this tool but
seems<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.080> keep<00:00:25.260> running<00:00:25.439> into<00:00:25.590> people<00:00:25.859> who

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
seems we keep running into people who

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.640 
seems we keep running into people who
found<00:00:26.460> new<00:00:26.640> uses<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.230> look<00:00:28.410> at<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
found new uses for it if we look at the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
found new uses for it if we look at the
gauge<00:00:28.830> itself<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.550> top<00:00:29.760> T<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.660> have

gauge itself on the top T we have

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.590 
gauge itself on the top T we have
increments<00:00:31.289> marked<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.800> every<00:00:32.040> quarter<00:00:32.399> inch

in between for those measurements that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.369 
in between for those measurements that
we<00:00:49.739> use<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.160> lot<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> very<00:00:51.690> bottom<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.110> gauge

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
we use a lot at the very bottom of gauge

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.680 
we use a lot at the very bottom of gauge
we<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:53.070> pivot<00:00:53.370> point<00:00:53.579> they<00:00:54.210> hate

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
we have a little pivot point they hate

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.189 
we have a little pivot point they hate

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
us in inscribing arcs or circles then we

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.880 
us in inscribing arcs or circles then we
might<00:00:58.410> need<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.770> draw<00:00:58.980> just<00:01:00.469> by<00:01:01.469> depressing

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890

inch increments on the gauge this is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.649 
inch increments on the gauge this is
very<00:01:10.710> helpful<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.670> want<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> major<00:01:12.150> perfect

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
very helpful if we want a major perfect

very helpful if we want a major perfect
amps<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.140> seam<00:01:14.040> allowances<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.750> also<00:01:15.950> use

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
amps or seam allowances we can also use

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.280

the increments on the top and increments
on<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> side<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.909> measure<00:01:21.110> width

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
on the side so that we can measure width

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.950 
on the side so that we can measure width
and<00:01:22.380> length<00:01:22.409> at<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> same<00:01:23.400> time<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.780> also

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and length at the same time we can also

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.649 
and length at the same time we can also
use<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.470> gauge<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.130> measure<00:01:26.310> any<00:01:27.240> kind<00:01:27.570> of

use this gauge to measure any kind of

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.370 
use this gauge to measure any kind of
markings<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.409> spacings<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> pattern<00:01:29.700> and

duplicate those on the project that we

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.910 
duplicate those on the project that we
happen<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.150> working<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.710> need<00:01:34.740> to

arc as as desired so we can use it in
it's<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> very<00:01:56.280> handy<00:01:56.790> tool<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.149> fact<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it's a very handy tool in fact you

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.149 
it's a very handy tool in fact you
probably<00:01:57.930> need<00:01:58.170> three<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.040> your
