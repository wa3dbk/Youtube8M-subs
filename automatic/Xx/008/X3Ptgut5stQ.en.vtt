00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.860
 no 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.970
 wants 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.420
 of view 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.640
 if to say a child listened so much nina 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.719
 simone also listened to gino paoli and le 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.250
 her women obviously listened to me 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.829
 so much gino paoli because anyone 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.570
 even not wanting to be short 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.940
 songs that just get inside you 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.940
 they remain in the DNA and do not go away 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:18.770
 now he will come back but 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.630
 Yup 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.010
 this dress that sometimes a lot 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.550
 particular very nina zilli 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.680
 thank you is a dress and videos elsewhere 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.930
 English designer is another great one 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.310
 strong female in the history of fashion but 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.640
 also music because he invented 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.180
 the world handle so it's very rock 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.400
 and roll 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.680
 in short, despite being a very big one 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.580
 very elegant dress there is always that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.580
 touch of crazy 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.330
 for me 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.599
 in that thinking 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.260
 I worked with the most important women 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.730
 of the Italian music that they were then 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.750
 the muses of all time not only for the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.860
 Italians but for the panorama 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.960
 international 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.960
 now in this historical moment who 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.510
 listen when it's alone but I don't have 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.880
 never listened to anyone almost heard 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.390
 listen to masters what I am 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.790
 always liked I listen to them a lot of music 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.830
 classical 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.959
 I really like rachmaninov a lot instead 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.830
 ie the costs I like very different and 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:55.220
 couple there is very puccini and then the real ones 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.590
 those who have an extra gear 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.250
 how are the nets that the neck 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.430
 tony bennett the real ones are caruso 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.860
 that is, those who had those 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.850
 actually an extra gear those 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.959
 there and I'm curious to understand what the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.230
 secret to be like that is with there is 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.750
 there is something there is an alchemy in 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.570
 certain characters mean blacksmith 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.239
 streisand is one that has an alchemy 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.130
 an alchemy that makes it better 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.870
 of all the most exceptional ones no longer 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.670
 good that maybe the best one has nothing to do with it 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.440
 nothing but with such pathos that 11 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.480
 try to understand how it can have that 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.599
 practically 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.599
 now 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.230
 Yes No 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.540
 in conclusion
