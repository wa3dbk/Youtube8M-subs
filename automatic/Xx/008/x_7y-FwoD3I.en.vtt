00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.930
 Y 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.200
 ah 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.320
 hello everyone today I'm also with the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.590
 update of the terrarium of the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.809
 terrarium of the false coral and that's how 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.510
 we take it right now I would have 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.290
 liked to record more the process of how 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.360
 we put the coconut and good these 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.510
 elements like we used to throw the cement with 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.420
 a dye is worth to leave color but 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.600
 these days have been a very busy 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.360
 for me I could not record anything but 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.720
 well that's how it goes now I explain a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.110
 little but before I'll talk about this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.200
 Okay, this is going up, it's going to go here 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.620
 the bulb and this goes on the roof it 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.170
 we are putting this grid 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.790
 it's for a guaranteed heating bulb 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.120
 because most trades do not 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.370
 they need baby uv rays so what 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.940
 we are going to put only this this 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.020
 heat bulb is worth the fence so that 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.810
 not escape not to target not 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.840
 snakes and it's already there as you see we are 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.860
 hitting we're hitting directly with 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.870
 the white carpenter's tail is worth it and 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.560
 we are pressing there 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.110
 the leather 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.509
 and we are trying to keep it tense 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.790
 well that with the boats vital because not 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.060
 we can be here and holding it because 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.509
 we want it to be well tense 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.560
 and here they go as I say the light bulb and dance 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.979
 in this 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.650
 is a 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.450
 a castle the ceramic is worth a 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.670
 lampholder and not vice versa no but no 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.040
 I'm going to turn it around now but I would say 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.830
 that is worth we are thinking about taking one 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.590
 bigger maybe but good for now 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.460
 we have this as you see we have done 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.750
 larger 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.319
 the box not in case we do not change it but 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.810
 it also serves as ventilation 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.689
 because you have the ventilations 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.469
 Late truces are a little small 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:50.040
 no and and so we complement with the 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:53.640
 of the roof agreement and good continuing 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.040
 with this equal is what interests you most 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.890
 I already explained how most of the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.850
 things here we have already put the crystal 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.610
 which is equivalent in hammer tub this is going to 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.459
 go dated for that it is worth as you already know 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.190
 then to open the cave and catch 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.790
 the snake gets here because we have to 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.209
 lift this glass according and this 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.520
 we have stuck it with silicone vale we have 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.970
 put silicone and then the coconut over 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.420
 and it looks like this, we've already gone 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.520
 we throw first all the coconut does not 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.220
 we take a significant layer and then we 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.010
 we turn around and that does not fall 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.900
 drop the pieces that have stuck us 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.350
 well it 's a while there that was coming 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.739
 hitting vale before rumbling the and 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.200
 this is how you see is in the foam and 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.900
 It has a cement cement layer with 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.680
 ink and also keep cool look at him 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.680
 lifted to the pin 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.709
 I have put back a little but good and 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.680
 well that's cement with dye there has 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.209
 a little 15 times that looks very good 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.849
 look at the aspects of quite well 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.849
 all and that's just cement 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.650
 you see all the time and then what you 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.290
 I said the coconut with the silicone and nothing 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.140
 more we have not done much more is a 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.300
 process that takes its time to 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.720
 application and drying but there's not much 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.110
 more history only remains in the chest and 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.970
 put more polyurethane foam and already 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.540
 it is then that the rest practically 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.030
 is good on top of this we will put a 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.610
 protective layer we will see still not 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.490
 we have decided with what it is and with varnish or 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.500
 latex or 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:50.009
 or me that I know already you ok well but until 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.009
 Now it goes like this 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.360
 It has been good not 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.980
 tell me if you are happy to tell me to see 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.950
 and good 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.150
 so I'm going to leave the video because 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.150
 I think there is no more to say 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:11.799
 we have to place here we will place 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:14.289
 what is the sprue and a set one 

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:16.679
 skull we bought and decorated 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.809
 well we are thinking if here or here 

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:22.419
 but well you will see that already they are 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:24.519
 end things and you're done 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.979
 we are going to imagine you up here already 

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:28.630
 petro with the imports lamps that I have 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.820
 taught 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.700
 good and until the next video until the 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.830
 next update of this terrarium and 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.830
 see you and goodbye 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.920
 and good
