then I live streamed for one day on moon
yeah<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.619> was<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> strategy<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.580> used

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
yeah this was a strategy that I used

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.640 
yeah this was a strategy that I used
past<00:00:18.289> 61<00:00:19.340> because<00:00:20.340> before<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.199> well<00:00:22.199> eels

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
past 61 because before that well eels

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.160 
past 61 because before that well eels
you'll<00:00:22.920> see<00:00:23.100> okay<00:00:23.640> yeah<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.449> i'm<00:00:24.869> not<00:00:25.050> going

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
you'll see okay yeah and i'm not going

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.240 
you'll see okay yeah and i'm not going
to<00:00:25.199> show<00:00:25.260> much<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.650> strategy<00:00:25.830> because

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
to show much of this strategy because

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.609 
to show much of this strategy because
it's<00:00:26.279> really<00:00:26.760> really<00:00:27.480> simple<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:28.289> run

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it's really really simple you just run

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.939 
it's really really simple you just run
in<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> circle<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:31.170> happens<00:00:31.740> is

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
in the circle and then what happens is

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.319 
in the circle and then what happens is
you<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.239> way<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.540> gun<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> max<00:00:34.980> wave

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
you use the way you gun on the max wave

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.510 
you use the way you gun on the max wave
excuse<00:00:36.329> me<00:00:36.510> I'm<00:00:36.780> sorry<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.920> I'm<00:00:38.160> yet<00:00:38.399> you'll

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
um now there we go yeah so um after you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.189 
um now there we go yeah so um after you
run<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.760> family<00:00:51.270> didn't<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:51.690> moon<00:00:51.840> which

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
run in family didn't know one moon which

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.350 
run in family didn't know one moon which
you<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.620> should<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> get<00:00:53.730> max

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
you probably should you have to get max

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.779 
you probably should you have to get max
ammo<00:00:54.570> cuz<00:00:54.930> there's<00:00:55.079> no<00:00:55.199> trap<00:00:55.469> sir<00:00:55.649> stuff<00:00:55.890> so

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
ammo cuz there's no trap sir stuff so

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.510 
ammo cuz there's no trap sir stuff so
natural<00:00:57.750> thing<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.350> throw<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> grocery

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
natural thing to do is throw the grocery

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.639 
natural thing to do is throw the grocery
basis<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.989> give<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.379> mo

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
basis because they give you a mo

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.130 
basis because they give you a mo
obviously<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:03.059> well<00:01:03.420> they<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.750> drops

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
obviously or well they can have drops

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050 
obviously or well they can have drops
and<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.559> hack<00:01:04.739> drops<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.670> he<00:01:05.850> maybe

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and you can hack drops which he maybe

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.170 
and you can hack drops which he maybe
max<00:01:06.330> ammo<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.350> um<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.860> happened<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.729> me<00:01:08.880> was

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
max ammo but um what happened for me was

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.380 
max ammo but um what happened for me was
I<00:01:09.390> got<00:01:09.600> nothing<00:01:09.960> from<00:01:10.409> all<00:01:10.619> three<00:01:11.060> which<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
I got nothing from all three which is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.230 
I got nothing from all three which is
really<00:01:13.380> annoying<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.490> had<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> bounce

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
really annoying so I had to bounce

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.780 
really annoying so I had to bounce
around<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.960> these<00:01:16.140> things<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> long<00:01:17.460> time

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
around on these things for a long time

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
around on these things for a long time
to<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:18.720> drops<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.630> yeah<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.140> means<00:01:22.380> either

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
to get drops and yeah that means either

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.410 
to get drops and yeah that means either
a<00:01:22.710> new<00:01:22.950> Carnot<00:01:23.340> cycle<00:01:23.729> because<00:01:24.000> he<00:01:24.119> can't<00:01:24.299> get

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
a new Carnot cycle because he can't get

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.620 
a new Carnot cycle because he can't get
max<00:01:24.630> ambos<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.110> these<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.560> uh<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:27.150> about

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.940 
can just walk those slower with
oh<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.619> it's<00:02:04.040> not<00:02:04.670> comfortable<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:06.260> do<00:02:06.710> with

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
oh so it's not comfortable to do with

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.940 
oh so it's not comfortable to do with
that<00:02:07.149> hacking<00:02:08.149> drop<00:02:08.569> stuff<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.649> I'm<00:02:09.800> right

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
that hacking drop stuff and I'm right

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.430 
that hacking drop stuff and I'm right
here<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.759> can<00:02:10.940> see<00:02:11.120> I'm<00:02:11.510> in<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.720> bottle<00:02:12.110> this

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
here you can see I'm in this bottle this

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.260 
here you can see I'm in this bottle this
is<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:13.010> train<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.459> Iran<00:02:13.990> pre<00:02:15.580> terror<00:02:16.580> round

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
is the train that Iran pre terror round

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.210 
is the train that Iran pre terror round
will<00:02:17.990> call<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.610> yeah<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:21.220> say

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
will call it that and yeah this is I say

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.600 
will call it that and yeah this is I say
this<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.550> safer<00:02:23.360> than<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.690> stand<00:02:24.020> up<00:02:24.230> trained

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
this is safer than the stand up trained

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.340 
this is safer than the stand up trained
by<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.640> lot<00:02:25.970> cuz<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.840> don't<00:02:27.020> get<00:02:27.200> hit<00:02:27.470> ever<00:02:27.980> and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
by a lot cuz you don't get hit ever and

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.260 
by a lot cuz you don't get hit ever and
yeah<00:02:30.350> except<00:02:31.069> right<00:02:31.250> there<00:02:31.430> oh<00:02:31.580> my<00:02:31.819> god<00:02:32.030> I

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
yeah except right there oh my god I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.310 
yeah except right there oh my god I
counted<00:02:32.780> myself<00:02:32.959> ah<00:02:33.350> but<00:02:33.980> yeah<00:02:34.069> it's<00:02:34.340> fast<00:02:34.940> and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
counted myself ah but yeah it's fast and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.320 
counted myself ah but yeah it's fast and
you<00:02:36.320> get<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.500> bunch<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.920> zombies<00:02:37.040> in<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.239> you

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
you get a bunch of zombies in and you

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.630 
you get a bunch of zombies in and you
get<00:02:38.450> no<00:02:38.600> crawlers<00:02:39.050> because<00:02:39.260> that's<00:02:39.860> good<00:02:40.100> if

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
get no crawlers because that's good if

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.840 
get no crawlers because that's good if
thrown<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.030> crawlers<00:02:41.420> if<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:42.370> once<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.550> labs

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
thrown in crawlers if that once the labs

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.280 
thrown in crawlers if that once the labs
that<00:02:44.180> would<00:02:44.330> be<00:02:44.420> awesome<00:02:44.600> because<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.200> can

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
that would be awesome because you can

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.770 
that would be awesome because you can
want<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.650> train<00:02:45.800> their<00:02:45.980> previously<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:47.300> I'm

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
want to train their previously and I'm

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.030
