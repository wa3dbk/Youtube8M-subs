over<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.590> years<00:01:10.710> who<00:01:11.370> were<00:01:11.520> told<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.150> part<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
over the years who were told as part of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
over the years who were told as part of
their<00:01:13.260> left<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.650> they<00:01:13.770> needed<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.250> have

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
their left that they needed to have

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.970 
their left that they needed to have
implants<00:01:15.260> there's<00:01:16.260> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.560> bit<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> truth

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
implants there's a little bit of truth

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.340 
implants there's a little bit of truth
to<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.160> sometimes<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.080> case

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to that sometimes but not in this case

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.920 
to that sometimes but not in this case
and<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.550> my<00:01:20.820> point<00:01:21.120> that<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.330> started<00:01:21.720> with

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and this is my point that I started with

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.500 
and this is my point that I started with
I<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.010> important<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.550> really<00:01:24.150> sit

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
I think it's important to really sit

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.030 
I think it's important to really sit
down<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.720> talk<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.050> patients<00:01:25.320> figure<00:01:25.920> out

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
down and talk to patients figure out

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.680 
down and talk to patients figure out
what<00:01:26.190> they<00:01:26.340> want<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.880> make<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.510> right

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
what they want and make the right

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.230 
what they want and make the right
diagnosis<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.550> that<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.730> can<00:01:29.850> come<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.120> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
diagnosis so that you can come up with a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.520 
diagnosis so that you can come up with a
surgical<00:01:30.600> plan<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.140> will<00:01:31.260> be<00:01:31.350> more

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
surgical plan that will be more

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.040 
surgical plan that will be more
appropriate<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.850> lady<00:01:33.120> had<00:01:33.360> plenty<00:01:33.660> of<00:01:33.930> her

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
appropriate this lady had plenty of her

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.240 
appropriate this lady had plenty of her
own<00:01:34.200> breast<00:01:34.470> tissue<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.130> no

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
own breast tissue and there was no

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.050 
own breast tissue and there was no
reason<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.730> put<00:01:35.910> an<00:01:36.000> implant<00:01:36.150> there<00:01:37.940> making<00:01:38.940> me

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
reason to put an implant there making me

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
reason to put an implant there making me
a<00:01:39.090> realist<00:01:39.510> smaller<00:01:39.890> lifting<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.010> breast

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
a realist smaller lifting the breast

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.420 
a realist smaller lifting the breast
tissue<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:42.270> ended<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.260> creating<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.890> much<00:01:44.220> more

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
tissue all ended up creating a much more

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.330 
tissue all ended up creating a much more
pleasing<00:01:44.760> aesthetic<00:01:45.390> result<00:01:45.690> for<00:01:45.960> her<00:01:46.160> but<00:01:47.160> if

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
pleasing aesthetic result for her but if

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.280 
pleasing aesthetic result for her but if
I<00:01:47.490> had<00:01:47.610> gone<00:01:47.820> out<00:01:48.150> from<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> beginning<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
I had gone out from the beginning and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.580 
I had gone out from the beginning and
performed<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> breast<00:01:50.370> reduction<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:51.090> her<00:01:51.270> I

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
performed a breast reduction for her I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.560 
performed a breast reduction for her I
personally<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.830> that<00:01:53.130> her<00:01:53.670> body<00:01:54.000> would<00:01:54.390> not

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
personally think that her body would not

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.720 
personally think that her body would not
have<00:01:54.720> carried<00:01:55.280> breasts<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.430> were<00:01:56.550> much

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
have carried breasts that were much

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.790 
have carried breasts that were much
smaller<00:01:57.060> very<00:01:57.360> well<00:01:57.720> so<00:01:58.260> when<00:01:58.470> all<00:01:58.620> was<00:01:58.740> said

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
smaller very well so when all was said
