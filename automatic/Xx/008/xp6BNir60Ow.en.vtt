00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
with the 949 loader which will lift just

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.499 
with the 949 loader which will lift just
short<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.009> two<00:01:29.159> tons<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:30.119> about<00:01:30.240> four

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.620 
short of two tons to just about four
meters<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.429> machine<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:33.060> think<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.479> the

meters so this machine we think is the
ultimate<00:01:33.810> loader<00:01:34.319> package<00:01:34.740> when<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.189> take

ultimate loader package when you take

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.700
