 one more curiosity easter eggs her 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.680
 As you want to call it was 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.900
 walking here why the iron 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.180
 when I found this tank that 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.750
 I do not talk but it's an entire tank. 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.580
 rusty on the lips bororÃ³ beauty at a 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.750
 really rusty tank but it is 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.009
 a t-34 tank from the former Soviet Union 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.050
 which was used in the first in the second 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.420
 world war galley 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.550
 the soviet union fabricable students 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.950
 belch right 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.220
 this tank was what helped a lot 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.410
 he leaves in the war and such I will speak 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.330
 some technical specifications for 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.509
 You when you 're watching, she's 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.250
 there is almost 84 in a tank average viet 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.600
 first produced in 1940 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.780
 the rest of World War II 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.220
 although widely used by the sheet 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.080
 during the Second World War 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.780
 exported in large quantities 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.229
 for many countries with their last 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.420
 model is the 3485 still integrates the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.320
 armed forces of many sub- 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.140
 developed in 1940, the 34 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.229
 battlefield as successor to the series 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.830
 bt tank replacement by replacing the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:11.180
 light tanks of 28 e or bt 7 galera 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:15.590
 which were lower than recent 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.500
 panzer field fifo wagen 4 which was a 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.120
 German version of the 34 was considered the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.330
 best tanks of his time precisely 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.130
 for having an excellent balance of all 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.040
 essential aspects for a tank in the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.450
 time power of fire mobility protection 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.520
 cost and simplicity 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.810
 the 34 was also the first tank of 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.750
 warfare when using a shielding system 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.430
 gaining more protection without having 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.209
 that increase the weight of the vehicle 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.570
 is're such a tactic and practice pioneered 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.310
 and is used to this day by mb tanks 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.799
 modern ts 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.620
 however, the maximization of some 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.720
 characteristics of 34 did not happen without 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.850
 loss its angled shield and silhouette 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.920
 reduced means are sacrificed 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.489
 the internal space of the 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.980
 making the world brought 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.650
 much more uncomfortable to crew 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.260
 especially on long trips galley 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.320
 so he was much faster 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.410
 he had very good armor for his 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.180
 time and he was such a compact guy 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.130
 then automatically who expected who 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.840
 was in there because he had not 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.760
 very cool internal space this galera 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.769
 to make the combatants do a 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.760
 long journey ends up taking in the 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.720
 attack 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.030
 in battle 8834 he proved superior 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.040
 to the various German equivalent aspects 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.900
 So, uh, Brits and North Americans? 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.209
 this tank over came out in the second war 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.070
 World no doubt shade your 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.510
 last performance against the Germans 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.970
 was mainly due to its 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.900
 superiority because it was cheap and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.150
 simple to build 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.890
 and it ensures the advantage against tanks 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.450
 Germans usually heavier then 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.360
 guys is something you put on and 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.150
 I do not know a freak for a car 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.680
 small to walk in a tall pitch 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.390
 so the big cars was much more 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.090
 heavy old tanks was much more 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.430
 heavy and 34,000 who revolutionized this 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.739
 stop there the Soviets 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.329
 kicked off and to this day 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.840
 tank is still used by some countries 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:14.840
 developed and that it has 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.479
 if you will see that you have to be allies 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.329
 to the former Soviet union in the case 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.160
 them at that time is at the end of the 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.660
 World War II production 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.889
 had been replaced is had bra 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.610
 replace all tank design 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:34.310
 Soviets except the number of tanks 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.300
 tankers logo cef is on 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.729
 as with the rise of the Cold War 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.349
 34 did not meet the modern and 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.970
 many have been provided to 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.039
 underdeveloped as he had already 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.440
 aligned with the Soviet Union as a 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.330
 to arm them and to unburden the stocks 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.520
 Soviet second line material 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.130
 so people in the cold war and guarujÃ¡ 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.550
 it was no longer useful in the second war 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.889
 he was the great asset there is of the 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.889
 Soviet right in this matter 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:07.360
 the number of units produced had been so 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:10.880
 large in 1975 the Soviet Union still 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.740
 had large quantities of 34 in the 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.710
 reserve even though there are times model already 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.280
 have been replaced by the new 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.889
 younger than 44 and t5 85 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.419
 so guys this one is just a 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.010
 information I brought I'll leave the 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.870
 The page where I got these 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.000
 information from this Soviet tank to 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.220
 you then remembering that this is 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.139
 just to get acquainted with 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.060
 the game as I talked about the atmosphere of this game 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.349
 is very large so it is a relic of 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.150
 World War II could not 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.470
