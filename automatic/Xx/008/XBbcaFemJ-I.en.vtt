00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello everyone was employed FÃ©ile 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.400
 we find a new spoiler on 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.469
 the future 1.8 the future version of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.269
 minecraft and good he is people of today 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.029
 I've been bringing them to ryan hills 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.160
 developer of minecraft from pc and makes 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.110
 a few months ago or a month or so the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.210
 day brought a spoiler about being able to create 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.399
 worlds costumized the point microphone 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.020
 8 said video you have it here below 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.090
 which was basically a video in which 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.860
 I taught a series of patterns with 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.989
 which we could create a world in 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.670
 our measure but aside now those 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.990
 he has added a new option 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.490
 which is what I have today in this 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.650
 video and that is may be 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.210
 previously a biome as we see are the 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.980
 image that the post on your twitter and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.320
 down to the left the column to the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.090
 left all the way down then we see that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.440
 there is an option that says biome and that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.810
 feels allows you to select what else 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.450
 you want from default thesis by 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.489
 example has put the island of z the 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.870
 seven giants I do not have them to be 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.190
 selected biome you can touch all 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.590
 the patterns you want so put that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.079
 there are caves that have villages that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.030
 have temples give jones what you want 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.680
 just as you see there are three pages 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 of customization this we are in the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280
 last page on page 3 of the back 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.590
 how it goes up 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.930
 and we go backwards we can customize 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.280
 other options said options that come out 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.510
 in the previous pages are from the video 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.490
 to leave here below as I say that 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.890
 go up a month or so ago not what 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.360
 I count and as there is quite a 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.490
 a lot of modifications and this 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.350
 allows you to pre-select 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.940
 the world that you want in this case 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.009
 select the world of mushrooms or 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.840
 you can select the world of prairie and 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.130
 once you have the prairie biome 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.570
 you can modify everything else that 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.890
 you want us to get lost and mountainous 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.960
 good mountains that you want there to be 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.270
 lots of water, a lot of water, whatever you like 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.580
 and pretty cool in this case he has 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.590
 put as I say the world of mushrooms and it 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.240
 has been something almost and as you see 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.490
 everything is very modifiable pretty cool 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.110
