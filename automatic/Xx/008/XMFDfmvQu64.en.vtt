00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.110
 arturo brizio cárter gerardo keeps 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.930
 welcoming to this summary 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.150
 of televisadeportes.com of cougars against 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.740
 chivas of the day 16 arturo that such 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.230
 degree that is a because a party that 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.970
 he promised a lot and that he did not disappoint 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.039
 future actions of goals that 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.380
 career shots and the deviated from 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.210
 Curbstone very well let's see 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.880
 frequently to the goalkeeper of the chivas 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.210
 they have a really outstanding performance 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.310
 Here you can see the distance 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.770
 speed 103 kilometers per hour 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.350
 it really was complicated and it solved well 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.660
 the goalkeeper of chivas the two teams 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.220
 Pikolín affiliates were provided to 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.710
 despite the weather conditions 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.080
 they offered they come without chivas tried 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.360
 by the bands and especially with these 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.640
 ramírez that put her first to the spark 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.450
 and then avant ranking the crazy rags 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.370
 I think they should exploit more 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.620
 that was a bad exit chivas 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.490
 our for q larger as the fault 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.350
 of dante lopez because it's really misses 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.060
 the profile was to have gotten it and 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.580
 after the first hard-hitting chivas 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.080
 with tepa solís and behind the pikolin very 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.340
 well yes as we can see it is a match 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.100
 round trip again no 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.100
 The teams' efforts were spared 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.500
 the truth is that in the end the 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.479
 archers were meant but cougars were 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.690
 was consolidating more and more in the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.910
 playing field that was taking that 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.340
 cohesion between the half court and the 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.440
 front and good then at the end of accounts 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.400
 let's see when I entered 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.400
 ramírez that was what happened 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.000
 this is supporting 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.400
 and indeed I live 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.230
 it's almost a bowl of many meetings and 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.810
 very hot like that because seeing you is the 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.490
 that gives showing the play for for the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.790
 ball defenses of the boys left 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.890
 very back reaction tepa solís and 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.200
 when you plug it you have some 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.970
 fortune to the university and after 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.070
 authors like the shot he pulled 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.050
 really impressive high the little 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.500
 impossible duty for the unemployed of 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.509
 your 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.610
 the pikolin does what he does best 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.370
 and healthy that is good with the feet 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.370
 that allows you to prevent it 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.190
 because it is sometimes the one that brings out the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.470
 shot at the base of the forest and good 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.180
 well ya chivas trying to recover the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.910
 lost ground but it really could 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.100
 to have taken the ball from him and over and over 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.100
 once the goalkeeper Rodríguez saved 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.360
 but it was also that inside others 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.340
 that very interesting play cougars that 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.270
 is qualified is very good area besides 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:48.040
 and chivas because he's going to have problems with 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.990
 a remote possibility but possibility 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.300
 to advance to the league is still missing 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.180
 a day but with yes no points 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.700
 the problem will come in the percentage 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.930
 the next tournament a problem 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.970
 quite serious 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.650
 well the ticket everything we go we're going to give 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.640
 all thank you very much to your keep on
