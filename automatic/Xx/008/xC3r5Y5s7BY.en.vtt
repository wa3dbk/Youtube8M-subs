while<00:02:15.640> Richard<00:02:16.210> was<00:02:16.390> talking<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:18.640> fact<00:02:18.910> it's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
while Richard was talking in fact it's

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.690 
while Richard was talking in fact it's
hard<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.900> see<00:02:20.080> but<00:02:20.440> I'll<00:02:21.220> switch<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.460> wireframe

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
hard to see but I'll switch to wireframe

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.110 
hard to see but I'll switch to wireframe
for<00:02:22.270> these<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:23.140> maybe<00:02:23.440> I'll<00:02:23.590> scale<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:24.160> along

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
for these so maybe I'll scale this along

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.210 
for these so maybe I'll scale this along
the<00:02:25.240> Y<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:26.800> I'll<00:02:26.920> scale<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:27.400> on<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.330> Z<00:02:29.220> so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
the Y then I'll scale this on the Z so

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.360 
the Y then I'll scale this on the Z so
now<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.430> can<00:02:30.580> see<00:02:30.790> top<00:02:31.540> front<00:02:32.260> side<00:02:32.650> but<00:02:33.280> if

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
now you can see top front side but if

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.120 
now you can see top front side but if
that's<00:02:33.490> enough<00:02:33.730> for<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.210> can<00:02:34.530> click<00:02:35.530> and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
that's enough for you you can click and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.100 
that's enough for you you can click and
this<00:02:36.520> time<00:02:36.730> I'm<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:36.910> left<00:02:37.300> clicking<00:02:37.420> and

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
this time I'm just left clicking and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.240 
this time I'm just left clicking and
dragging<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.800> lying<00:02:39.070> down<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:41.010> what<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.040> want

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
dragging this lying down and what I want

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.590 
dragging this lying down and what I want
to<00:02:42.310> do<00:02:42.430> is<00:02:42.760> save<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.270> name<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.330> see<00:02:46.450> that

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
to do is save you name you can see that

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.540 
to do is save you name you can see that
this<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:46.870> top<00:02:47.140> ortho<00:02:47.950> that's<00:02:48.220> something<00:02:48.520> I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
this is top ortho that's something I

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.330 
this is top ortho that's something I
added<00:02:48.820> four<00:02:48.970> two<00:02:49.090> two<00:02:49.420> four<00:02:49.930> six<00:02:50.340> orthographic

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
added four two two four six orthographic

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.400 
added four two two four six orthographic
or<00:02:51.460> not<00:02:51.610> ortho<00:02:51.940> orthographic<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:53.110> this<00:02:53.260> is

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
or not ortho orthographic but this is

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.590 
or not ortho orthographic but this is
about<00:02:54.010> configuring<00:02:54.790> viewports<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.390> that's

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
about configuring viewports so that's

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.030 
about configuring viewports so that's
one<00:02:56.050> way<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.230> do<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.650> when<00:02:56.740> you<00:02:56.830> want<00:02:56.980> to

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
one way to do it and when you want to

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.970 
one way to do it and when you want to
change<00:02:57.520> them<00:02:57.640> around<00:02:57.820> again<00:02:58.000> right-click

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
change them around again right-click

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.120 
change them around again right-click
they<00:02:59.980> join<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:01.080> then<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.650> have<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:02.860> do<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.040> in

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
they join and then you have to do it in

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.180 
they join and then you have to do it in
the<00:03:03.220> right<00:03:03.310> order<00:03:03.550> though<00:03:03.760> here<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.300> can<00:03:04.420> say

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
the right order though here you can say

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.790 
the right order though here you can say
right<00:03:06.190> click<00:03:06.430> join

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
right click join

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.290 
right click join
right<00:03:08.800> click<00:03:09.040> join<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.230> even<00:03:11.230> go<00:03:11.410> further

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
right click join and even go further

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.060 
right click join and even go further
join<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.440> now<00:03:14.590> you've<00:03:14.709> got<00:03:14.740> this<00:03:14.950> big<00:03:15.850> area<00:03:16.420> and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
join so now you've got this big area and

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.710 
join so now you've got this big area and
if<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.190> really<00:03:18.580> like<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.740> you<00:03:20.740> could<00:03:21.720> say

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
if you really like this you could say

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.820 
if you really like this you could say
add<00:03:23.440> new<00:03:23.500> oh<00:03:25.560> look<00:03:26.560> at<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.680> duplicate<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:28.830> or

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
add new oh look at that duplicate and or

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
duplicate that's that's new there so

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.660 
duplicate that's that's new there so
we'll<00:03:34.480> call<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:34.930> one<00:03:37.680> like<00:03:38.680> using<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:39.280> single
