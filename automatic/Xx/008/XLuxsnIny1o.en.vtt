00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
shotgun across the entire map it's

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.890 
shotgun across the entire map it's
freaking<00:01:57.790> ridiculous<00:01:57.910> I<00:01:58.450> don't<00:01:58.630> do<00:01:58.780> it

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
freaking ridiculous I don't do it

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.270 
freaking ridiculous I don't do it
because<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:01.450> equipping<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.229> shotgun<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.010> a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
because really equipping a shotgun to a

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.730 
because really equipping a shotgun to a
sniper<00:02:03.729> class<00:02:04.060> isn't<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.870> best<00:02:05.110> way<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:05.380> run

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
sniper class isn't the best way to run

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.410 
sniper class isn't the best way to run
with<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.010> sniper<00:02:06.190> class<00:02:06.490> you're<00:02:07.060> just<00:02:07.240> better

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
with the sniper class you're just better

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.150 
with the sniper class you're just better
off<00:02:07.479> using<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.110> engineer<00:02:08.590> with<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:08.740> medic<00:02:09.040> in

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
off using the engineer with the medic in

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.190 
off using the engineer with the medic in
my<00:02:09.220> opinion<00:02:09.520> yeah<00:02:10.030> there's<00:02:10.270> advantages<00:02:10.899> to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
my opinion yeah there's advantages to

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.870 
my opinion yeah there's advantages to
the<00:02:11.320> sniper<00:02:11.590> but<00:02:11.920> they<00:02:12.070> don't<00:02:12.250> outweigh<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the sniper but they don't outweigh the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.370 
the sniper but they don't outweigh the
medic<00:02:13.180> or<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.390> engineer<00:02:13.810> my<00:02:13.990> personal

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
wrong this game as far as the HUD I

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.979 
wrong this game as far as the HUD I
could<00:03:12.130> defend<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.760> fact<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.570> didn't

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
could defend the fact that I didn't

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.340 
could defend the fact that I didn't
revive<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.680> bunch<00:03:15.070> of<00:03:15.220> people<00:03:15.840> because<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.050> was

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
revive a bunch of people because I was

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.949 
revive a bunch of people because I was
the<00:03:17.470> last<00:03:17.590> one<00:03:17.769> surviving<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.850> was<00:03:19.030> being<00:03:19.750> a

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
the last one surviving and I was being a

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.270 
the last one surviving and I was being a
spawn<00:03:20.290> point<00:03:20.590> for<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.830> rest<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.130> my<00:03:21.220> team

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
spawn point for the rest of my team

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280 
spawn point for the rest of my team
because<00:03:21.550> this<00:03:21.820> particular<00:03:22.360> part<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:22.840> this<00:03:22.989> map

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
because this particular part of this map

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.880 
because this particular part of this map
is<00:03:24.330> extremely<00:03:25.330> hard<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.959> get<00:03:26.470> into<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.739> base

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
is extremely hard to get into the base

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.610 
is extremely hard to get into the base
of<00:03:27.130> from<00:03:27.820> a<00:03:27.880> defensive<00:03:28.440> perspective<00:03:29.440> of

a<00:03:47.060> pond<00:03:47.269> is<00:03:47.480> there<00:03:47.599> trying<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.840> get<00:03:47.959> up<00:03:48.109> to

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
a pond is there trying to get up to

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.599 
a pond is there trying to get up to
these<00:03:48.349> demolition<00:03:48.829> points<00:03:49.159> and<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:49.430> when<00:03:49.549> you

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
these demolition points and so when you

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.800 
these demolition points and so when you
get<00:03:49.730> up<00:03:49.819> to<00:03:49.909> this<00:03:50.000> demolition<00:03:50.269> point<00:03:50.689> you

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
get up to this demolition point you

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.140 
get up to this demolition point you
really<00:03:51.349> want<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.739> stay<00:03:51.980> alive<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.549> so<00:03:53.120> I

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
really want to stay alive and so I

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.130 
really want to stay alive and so I
suppose<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.109> can<00:03:54.349> argue<00:03:54.939> that<00:03:55.939> I<00:03:56.269> didn't<00:03:56.780> revive

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
suppose I can argue that I didn't revive

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.199 
suppose I can argue that I didn't revive
people<00:03:57.470> because<00:03:58.069> I<00:03:58.099> was<00:03:58.400> serving<00:03:58.639> a<00:03:58.879> spawn

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
people because I was serving a spawn

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.319 
people because I was serving a spawn
point<00:03:59.510> and<00:03:59.720> I<00:03:59.870> outweighed<00:04:00.319> that<00:04:00.349> over

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
point and I outweighed that over

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.789 
point and I outweighed that over
reviving<00:04:02.329> my<00:04:02.450> team<00:04:02.689> because<00:04:02.870> there's<00:04:03.620> that

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
reviving my team because there's that

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.500 
reviving my team because there's that
potential<00:04:04.340> if<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.639> revive<00:04:05.120> one<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.450> my

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
potential if I revive one of my

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.449 
potential if I revive one of my

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
right now but without advertising I'm
