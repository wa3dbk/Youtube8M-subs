00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.990 
them up and over the little supporting
frame<00:02:51.670> there<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:54.010> course<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.370> standard<00:02:54.640> set

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
frame there of course the standard set

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.059 
frame there of course the standard set
up<00:02:55.180> one<00:02:55.900> thing<00:02:56.080> that<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.290> did<00:02:56.530> do<00:02:56.680> differently

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
up one thing that I did do differently

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.900 
up one thing that I did do differently
though<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.209> ran<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:59.190> up<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.370> there<00:03:00.580> and

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
though is I ran this up to there and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.830 
though is I ran this up to there and
then<00:03:01.810> out<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.140> each<00:03:02.620> little<00:03:03.069> speaker<00:03:03.519> and

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
then out to each little speaker and

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.120 
then out to each little speaker and
hopefully<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:05.019> will<00:03:05.110> keep<00:03:05.319> people<00:03:05.799> from

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
hopefully that will keep people from

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.970 
hopefully that will keep people from
tripping<00:03:06.610> over<00:03:07.290> my<00:03:08.290> speakers<00:03:08.769> as<00:03:09.160> much<00:03:09.610> so

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
tripping over my speakers as much so

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.069 
tripping over my speakers as much so
there's<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.160> setup<00:03:12.579> I'm<00:03:13.510> using<00:03:13.810> their

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
there's the setup I'm using their

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.050 
there's the setup I'm using their
generator<00:03:14.650> I've<00:03:14.950> actually<00:03:15.160> got<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.549> generator

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
generator I've actually got a generator

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.800 
generator I've actually got a generator
built<00:03:16.329> into<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:16.930> van<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:18.360> if<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:19.510> look<00:03:19.690> at

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
built into this van and if you look at

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.940 
built into this van and if you look at
the<00:03:19.900> back<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:21.670> sit<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:21.970> little<00:03:22.120> panel<00:03:22.510> there

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
the back you sit a little panel there

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.800 
the back you sit a little panel there
behind<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.400> generator<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:26.579> 1500<00:03:27.810> 6500

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
behind that is a generator a 1500 6500

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.990 
behind that is a generator a 1500 6500
watt<00:03:29.010> Onan<00:03:30.010> which<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.519> inside<00:03:30.819> that

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
watt Onan which is inside that

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.780 
watt Onan which is inside that
compartment<00:03:31.329> there<00:03:31.720> however<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:33.430> needs<00:03:33.609> a

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
compartment there however it needs a

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.870 
compartment there however it needs a
tune-up<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:35.739> ran<00:03:36.010> when<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.310> first<00:03:36.549> bought<00:03:36.700> the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
tune-up it ran when I first bought the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.750 
tune-up it ran when I first bought the
van<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.680> then<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.100> last<00:03:39.250> time<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.459> tried<00:03:39.730> to

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
van and then the last time I tried to

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.210 
van and then the last time I tried to
crank<00:03:40.209> at<00:03:40.359> it<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.930> went<00:03:41.139> and<00:03:41.260> crank<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.769> I

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
crank at it it went and crank and I

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.910 
crank at it it went and crank and I
think<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.549> just<00:03:42.700> needs<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:43.000> tune-up<00:03:43.569> so<00:03:43.930> for

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
think it just needs a tune-up so for

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.289 
think it just needs a tune-up so for
right<00:03:45.010> now<00:03:45.069> I'm<00:03:45.340> using<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.910> event

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
right now I'm using the event

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.750 
right now I'm using the event

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
helping to weight down the table and I'm

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:43.969 
helping to weight down the table and I'm
just<00:05:42.599> kind<00:05:42.780> of<00:05:42.810> standing<00:05:43.199> here<00:05:43.380> beside<00:05:43.530> it<00:05:43.889> I

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
just kind of standing here beside it I

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.499 
just kind of standing here beside it I
got<00:05:44.130> everything<00:05:44.370> on<00:05:44.580> plug<00:05:44.880> turns<00:05:45.210> a<00:05:45.330> generator

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
got everything on plug turns a generator

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.999 
got everything on plug turns a generator
off<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.380> now<00:05:46.710> we're<00:05:46.889> just<00:05:46.919> waiting<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.400> see

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
off and now we're just waiting to see

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.559 
off and now we're just waiting to see
what's<00:05:50.009> gonna<00:05:50.159> happen<00:05:50.250> they<00:05:51.120> think<00:05:51.389> it'll

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
what's gonna happen they think it'll

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.120 
what's gonna happen they think it'll
probably<00:05:51.659> go<00:05:51.990> on<00:05:52.080> in<00:05:52.199> about<00:05:52.349> 20<00:05:52.650> minutes<00:05:52.949> but

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
probably go on in about 20 minutes but

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.580 
probably go on in about 20 minutes but
I'm<00:05:53.280> not<00:05:53.490> sure<00:05:53.699> what<00:05:54.139> they're<00:05:55.139> planning<00:05:55.379> on

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
I'm not sure what they're planning on

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.189 
I'm not sure what they're planning on
doing<00:05:55.650> after<00:05:56.190> that<00:05:56.520> 20<00:05:56.849> minutes<00:05:57.180> so<00:05:57.389> that's

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
doing after that 20 minutes so that's

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.730 
doing after that 20 minutes so that's
the<00:05:58.349> fun<00:05:58.560> of<00:05:58.590> a<00:06:00.289> that's<00:06:01.289> the<00:06:01.409> fun<00:06:01.560> of<00:06:01.650> an
