right<00:00:26.000> now<00:00:26.240> there<00:00:26.720> are<00:00:26.749> inflammations<00:00:27.619> and

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
right now there are inflammations and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.980 
right now there are inflammations and
views<00:00:28.039> let's<00:00:28.999> try<00:00:29.240> injecting<00:00:29.660> these
