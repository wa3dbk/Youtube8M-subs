00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.569
 well today I find you for 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.650
 a makeup tutorial made with the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.870
 neo kit 3 2 at urban decay I you 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.900
 had posted a few weeks ago a 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.150
 photo on instagram with this guy hours 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.369
 you had been many to appreciate it at 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.890
 ask me for a tutorial so I'm running 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.330
 the principle of this guy is to use 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.220
 darker headlights at the level of the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.470
 mobile eyelid is to actually go up 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.240
 towards the brow bone with 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.009
 lighter headlights I think it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 change a little bit of regulars where we 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.760
 often has lighthouses a little bit more 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.020
 light on the eyelid and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.210
 headlights a little darker for 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.530
 dig at the level of the eyelids 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.899
 so here I managed a little bit a 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.000
 kind of smokey with this neo who 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.950
 prosperous that this tutorial will please you 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.840

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.890
 please share this video with 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.980
 your girlfriends 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.059
 here I am doing you lots of kisses and I 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.350
 tell you very soon 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.989
 by I start by applying a kohl 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.580
 black at the level of the upper ratti of 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.510
 way a little bit coarse for 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.510
 to make a base 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.030
 and management that this black collar with a small 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.030
 brush 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.820
 I grab but naked and I take the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.520
 dark side lighthouse with a flat brush that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.390
 I apply at the level of the black collar which 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.390
 on the eyelid 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.570
 then with another person I take 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.020
 mugshot that I put at the level of the hollow 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.600
 eyelids and then that will help me 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.690
 melt a little bit the demarcation with 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.910
 the darkseid lighthouse so this brush is a 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.260
 brush of checchi that he is very good 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.260
 because it is slightly beveled 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.880
 with a clean brush you can 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.880
 demarcations 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.560
 I'm applying a little darkseid to 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.670
 level of the eyelid hollow in order to re 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.700
 but the angel is a little bit all 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.960
 colors and re intensify the color 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.960
 that I recover with the fading 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.690
 and then I take the lighthouse limits with a 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.230
 brush you that I'm applying above the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.190
 iron same shot in order to finish this pretty 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.190
 color gradient 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.450
 a little bit of clean with strange 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.450
 under the brow bone 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.510
 and I reply a little bit of iron 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.510
 limitations 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.040
 I finish with their lower assets 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.040
 with the dark side lighthouse 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.000
 and with the lighthouse black heart I do my 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.000
 higher rating 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.530
 and 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.910
 a little hangover in the 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.390
 lower and upper mucosa for 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.830
 well emphasize the look is good 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.830
 obviously a good layer of mascara 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.670
 to warm up the time I use a 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.930
 brother's tub from home and lips 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.900
 I'm not really looking to make a 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.209
 touring tale but really to warm 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.870
 this time a little bit of everything 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.870
 alibert 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:22.000
 then I catch my blush artist from 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.370
 sephora so this is their new bluff 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.530
 so in pink color that are really 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.530
 top top top I forget the girls advice 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.660
 we end with a certain marie lou 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.820
 who will illuminate our complexion I love 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.110

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.680

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.960
 it lights up super well and I put a 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.870
 good dose because I love that's it 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.500
 a glory at this time a little bit 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.500
 sad 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.860
 where the student I use a pale pink here 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.860

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.780

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.780
 gloss in collection 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.860
