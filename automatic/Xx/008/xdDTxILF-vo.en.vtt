00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
CES this is a new style at case for auto

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.670 
CES this is a new style at case for auto
box<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:36.989> they<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.230> course<00:00:37.260> make<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
box you know they of course make the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.680 
box you know they of course make the
defender<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> real<00:00:38.940> well<00:00:39.149> known<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
defender on the real well known for the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.940 
defender on the real well known for the
defender<00:00:40.110> case<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
defender case this is going to be a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.619 
defender case this is going to be a
two-piece<00:00:41.160> design<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> idea<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.480> this

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
two-piece design so the idea with this

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
two-piece design so the idea with this
is<00:00:42.870> you'll<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.590> able<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.920> take<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> bottom<00:00:44.640> off

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
is you'll be able to take the bottom off

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
is you'll be able to take the bottom off
and<00:00:45.090> dock<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.899> example<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> little

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
and dock it as an example but a little

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
and dock it as an example but a little
bit<00:00:47.039> interesting<00:00:47.550> stuff<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
bit interesting stuff with this on it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.299 
bit interesting stuff with this on it
has<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:48.899> they're<00:00:49.020> called<00:00:49.200> impact<00:00:49.770> zones<00:00:50.039> and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
has what they're called impact zones and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.639 
has what they're called impact zones and
they<00:00:50.610> said<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:51.030> sort<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.989> model<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.320> after

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
they said they sort of model this after

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.279 
they said they sort of model this after
a<00:00:52.680> car's<00:00:53.010> crumple<00:00:53.520> zone<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.719> idea<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
a car's crumple zone so the idea is it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.420 
a car's crumple zone so the idea is it
should<00:00:55.469> give<00:00:55.620> pretty<00:00:55.860> good<00:00:55.949> impact

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
should give pretty good impact

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.040 
should give pretty good impact
protection<00:00:56.670> without<00:00:57.210> adding<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> whole<00:00:57.870> lot<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
protection without adding a whole lot of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.720 
protection without adding a whole lot of
bulk<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.469> phone<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.949> let's<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.609> whole

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
bulk to the phone so let's do the whole

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.420 
bulk to the phone so let's do the whole
case<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.570> let's<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> ideal<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.350> then<00:01:02.280> with

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
case so let's the ideal there then with

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.889 
case so let's the ideal there then with
the<00:01:02.550> otterbox<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> little<00:01:03.449> accessory

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.649 
looks so that's that slider style design
and<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.710> pops<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.450> just

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and just pops on just like that so just

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.450 
and just pops on just like that so just
doing<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> quick<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.350> look<00:01:31.439> at<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.890> um<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
doing a quick little look at this um it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.370 
doing a quick little look at this um it
is<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> pretty<00:01:32.939> smaller<00:01:33.420> case<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.990> not<00:01:34.140> very

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
is a pretty smaller case is not very

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.890 
is a pretty smaller case is not very
bulky<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.310> right<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.509> rubber

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
bulky and then right here is this rubber

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.600 
bulky and then right here is this rubber
area<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:39.960> could<00:01:40.200> actually<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.070> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
area so you could actually you can you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
area so you could actually you can you
can<00:01:41.759> kind<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.939> poke<00:01:42.150> through<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:42.659> bit

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
can kind of poke through it a little bit

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
can kind of poke through it a little bit
so<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.259> whole<00:01:43.380> area<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.799> isolated<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
so this whole area is isolated from the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.639 
so this whole area is isolated from the
rest<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> case<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.110> an

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
rest of the case so that's an

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
rest of the case so that's an
interesting<00:01:47.340> design<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.270> they've<00:01:48.390> been

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
interesting design and all they've been

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
interesting design and all they've been
working<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.140> while<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.619> really
