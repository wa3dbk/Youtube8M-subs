00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
activate by holding down B is really

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.619 
activate by holding down B is really
good<00:02:20.830> for<00:02:20.950> locking<00:02:21.069> closes<00:02:21.430> yeah<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.760> also<00:02:22.360> it

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629
