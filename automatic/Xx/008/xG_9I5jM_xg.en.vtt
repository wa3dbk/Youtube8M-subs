will<00:01:59.869> be<00:02:00.049> very<00:02:00.259> tough<00:02:00.500> first<00:02:01.280> there<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.520> not

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
will be very tough first there is not

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.029 
will be very tough first there is not
the<00:02:02.060> same<00:02:02.210> amount<00:02:02.329> of<00:02:02.509> stages<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.770> it's<00:02:03.950> not

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
the same amount of stages so it's not

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.300 
the same amount of stages so it's not
possible<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:05.119> also<00:02:05.329> I<00:02:05.960> mean<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.229> have<00:02:06.859> to<00:02:06.890> start

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
possible but also I mean I have to start

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.859 
possible but also I mean I have to start
first<00:02:07.549> on<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.820> road<00:02:07.939> on<00:02:07.969> day<00:02:08.269> one<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:08.750> of

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
first on the road on day one so of

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.749 
first on the road on day one so of
course<00:02:09.140> it's<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:10.100> will<00:02:10.310> be<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.489> disadvantage

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
course it's a it will be a disadvantage

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.060 
course it's a it will be a disadvantage
for<00:02:11.209> me<00:02:11.359> and<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.750> will<00:02:11.810> lose<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.500> bit<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.739> time<00:02:13.010> on

think you've written the best notes in
the<00:03:14.480> world<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.049> can't<00:03:15.260> can't<00:03:15.680> trust<00:03:16.040> them

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the world and you can't can't trust them

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.039 
the world and you can't can't trust them
so<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.670> think<00:03:16.849> we're<00:03:17.360> going<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.569> be<00:03:17.690> good<00:03:17.810> job

so I think we're going to be good job
they<00:03:18.170> felt<00:03:18.440> felt<00:03:18.980> pretty<00:03:19.130> consistent<00:03:19.700> on

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
they felt felt pretty consistent on

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.780 
they felt felt pretty consistent on
shakedown<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.290> if<00:03:21.860> we<00:03:21.920> can<00:03:22.519> take<00:03:22.760> that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
shakedown so if we can take that

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.789 
shakedown so if we can take that
confidence<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.630> just<00:03:24.170> trust<00:03:24.349> those<00:03:24.560> notes

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
confidence and just trust those notes
