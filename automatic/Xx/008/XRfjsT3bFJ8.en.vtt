 We all passed through childhood 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.940
 every one of us has exciting game films 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.100
 which came from our ancestors 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.660
 one here is the patintero 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.840
 the water source, which is more commonly known as the patintero 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.540
 is a game where two battles or fought groups 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.320
 Each group has three or more players 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.320
 the middle one is cheering 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.560
 the purpose of the players, to cross, 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.460
 and return to obscure or offensive opponents 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.120
 which is not considered, grasped, or reached. 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.400
 Another of the Filipino games, is called 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.120
 players can round around the can 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.960
 and put it in the middle 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.160
 The man will also draw for another player 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.280
 the bet will stand on the tin cans 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 and other players are some of the players
