this to get to the top of your tree now

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.300 
this to get to the top of your tree now
when<00:01:11.420> you're<00:01:11.539> lighting<00:01:11.720> your<00:01:11.990> tree<00:01:12.349> use

when you're lighting your tree use

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.430 
when you're lighting your tree use
end-to-end<00:01:13.819> lights<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.599> plug<00:01:14.810> one<00:01:15.110> into<00:01:15.259> the

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
end-to-end lights that plug one into the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.520 
end-to-end lights that plug one into the
other<00:01:15.470> I<00:01:15.970> like<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.090> use<00:01:17.270> 50<00:01:17.840> light<00:01:18.110> strand

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
other I like to use 50 light strand

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.190 
other I like to use 50 light strand
lights<00:01:18.860> when<00:01:19.340> I'm<00:01:19.429> doing<00:01:19.700> my<00:01:19.729> tree<00:01:20.030> they<00:01:21.020> come

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
lights when I'm doing my tree they come

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.370 
lights when I'm doing my tree they come
hundreds<00:01:21.709> hundred<00:01:22.099> and<00:01:22.220> fifty<00:01:22.550> s<00:01:22.610> also<00:01:23.599> but

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
hundreds hundred and fifty s also but

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.960 
hundreds hundred and fifty s also but
you<00:01:24.470> can<00:01:24.619> only<00:01:24.740> put<00:01:25.069> three<00:01:25.459> hundred<00:01:25.759> lights

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
you can only put three hundred lights

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.559 
you can only put three hundred lights
into<00:01:26.569> n<00:01:26.720> without<00:01:27.440> them<00:01:27.770> blowing<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.970> 50<00:01:29.390> light

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
into n without them blowing so 50 light

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.600 
into n without them blowing so 50 light
strands<00:01:30.140> really<00:01:30.470> work<00:01:30.649> well<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.369> that<00:01:31.490> once

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
strands really work well so that once

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.120 
strands really work well so that once
you<00:01:31.670> get<00:01:31.789> your<00:01:31.970> trees<00:01:32.270> done<00:01:32.810> if<00:01:33.080> one<00:01:33.649> strand<00:01:34.039> of

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
you get your trees done if one strand of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.440 
you get your trees done if one strand of
lights<00:01:34.250> goes<00:01:34.520> out<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:34.880> it's<00:01:34.970> only<00:01:35.090> fifty

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
lights goes out so it's only fifty

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.249 
lights goes out so it's only fifty
lights<00:01:35.660> to<00:01:35.840> take<00:01:36.020> out<00:01:36.200> not<00:01:36.800> a<00:01:36.830> hundred<00:01:37.190> or<00:01:37.250> 150

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
lights to take out not a hundred or 150

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.300 
lights to take out not a hundred or 150
but<00:01:39.259> then<00:01:39.440> as<00:01:39.679> soon<00:01:39.800> as<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:39.979> finish<00:01:40.280> your

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
but then as soon as you finish your

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.400 
but then as soon as you finish your
three<00:01:40.550> hundred<00:01:40.789> lights<00:01:40.970> start<00:01:41.869> again<00:01:42.140> at<00:01:42.319> the

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
three hundred lights start again at the

bottom of your tree plug into your power

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.969 
bottom of your tree plug into your power
source<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:49.280> start<00:01:49.940> at<00:01:50.030> another<00:01:50.270> branch<00:01:50.979> going

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
source and start at another branch going
