00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.140
 Dear customers and partners! 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.870
 The company "PAT" welcomes you and provides another 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.450
 video review of working safety shoes of premium class MICHELIN. 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.219
 And this time, it will be about the Titanium shoes, equipped with 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.590
 lightweight polyurethane outsole. 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.080
 In December 2012, in the framework of the company's cooperation 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.900
 "PAT" and divisions of the Michelin Group Footwea in Russia entered 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.449
 The first batch of branded safety shoes. 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.300
 Already, these exclusive models are available to customers. 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.410
 from the Russian Federation, Belarus and Kazakhstan. 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.690
 Eight specially selected Michelin shoe models, the most 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.900
 suitable for use in the conditions of the CIS countries are available 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.750
 for purchase to any client of the company "PAT". 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.540
 Michelin has become famous around the world for 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.149
 reliable tires that have been popular for over a century 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.780
 among a wide range of car enthusiasts. 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.289
 Long work in this area has allowed 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.219
 Michelin experts apply knowledge in a slightly different 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.329
 but a similar sphere of production of special footwear. 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.110
 Therefore, the contact of the soles of Michelin shoes with surfaces 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.680
 any character is provided with specialized patterns 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.350
 on the sole, which are based on the popular tread pattern 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.560
 Michelin tire series. 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.180
 Single-layer soles of Titanium work boots are made 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.460
 from dense polyurethane, respectively, possess 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.890
 low weight, high flexibility, wear resistance, anti-static, 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.780
 as well as resistance to oils and acids. 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.750
 The prototype of the outer part of the soles of working shoes 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.210
 Titanium served as Michelin Pilot tire protector 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 Sport 3. 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.640
 It is this design that provides the flexibility 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.939
 and maximum shoe stability on slippery surfaces, 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.090
 which is confirmed by the results of tests of the European standard 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.970
 EN ISO 20345. 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.320
 The top of Titanium protective work boots is made of 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.000
 soft genuine leather from hides 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.409
 cattle with a natural face, so shoes 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.409
 very comfortable and reliable. 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.619
 In addition, the top of the shoe provides full water resistance. 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.770
 within 60 minutes, which classifies the model as S3, according to 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.420
 regulations of the European standard. 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.259
 The inside of the boot contains comfortable lining 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.270
 Mesh type materials and two protective elements made 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.690
 from non-metallic materials. 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.770
 Thanks to this, the antiprokolnaya insole and protective toe cap 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.010
 possess high elasticity, resistance to high 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.960
 and low temperatures, magnetic fields, electricity, 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.210
 corrosion, with a fairly low weight, which is 30 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.860
 percent lower than the weight of analogues of steel. 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.961
 Protective toe cap made of composite materials 

00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:38.400
 high-class, therefore, resistant to loads of 200J, 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.300
 but at the same time, it does not take up extra space inside the boot. 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.000
 Insole resistant to punctures with sharp objects, made 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.010
 from ballistic fabric of the last generation and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.800
 completely covers the surface of the foot. 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.740
 Working protective shoes Titanium have the most 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.630
 high riding from the entire collection of Michelin shoes, 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.180
 submitted by the company "PAT". 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.760
 But, at the same time, the composition of the materials and the work of leading Italian 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.141
 Designers have provided an acceptable weight for shoes that 

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:09.050
 by no means exceeded the weight characteristics 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.310
 other models. 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.850
 Titanium boots are a quality combination 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.040
 light soles with a tread based on the pattern of the series 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.500
 Pilot Sport 3 tires, durable and comfortable top of 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.050
 natural leather and protective elements of the latest generation. 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.760
 Titanium work boots from Michelin 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.570
