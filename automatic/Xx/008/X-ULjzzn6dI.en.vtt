00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 in the good football moments you gave him 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.350
 if he showed me he showed me more or 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.710
 less shows today that comes after 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.570
 several years 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.469
 and he thanks me and because people also 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:19.430
 here is noble and noble are people here 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.349
 in this club are people who are dealing with 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.529
 another way differently with a lot 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.290
 honey and I know that I gave him things I know 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.780
 I gave my soccer my football I left it 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.080
 here 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.680
 I know I gave it all many very good years 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.190
 some very bad 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.020
 I could not be champion but I have wanted and I have 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.700
 wanted to be champion I've done everything 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.070
 possible so that with the group that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.590
 we were to be champions but I do not know 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.750
 gave Lima was given in 2011 is going to be more 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.760
 difficult to explain the new generations 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.700
 those who did not see you play will be 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.480
 explain when the jump 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.010
 probably what will be the doubt 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.100
 largest in the history of tigers 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.690
 who was better lucas lobos or gaitán 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.150
 gaitán and wolves and the new generations 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.979
 they are probably going to defend wolves and 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.940
 it will be difficult to defend yourself if in the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.140
 title so it's because he knows the time I've 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.880
 listened but I tell the truth miami 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.800
 I know I like them I always like them 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.990
 good footballers whenever he stays 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.680
 in the best and what 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.980
 I have not played riquelme treats me very 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.880
 well it made me feel important I do not know 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.829
 I never had a 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.539
 a degree neither of anger nor of envy 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.369
 because he came out champion and because he plays 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.750
 very good football and because it was 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.049
 called the Mexican national team because 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.240
 it was naturalized that it's going very well for him 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.480
 to the whole squad of the players of the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.750
 club 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.140
 I never managed to have that degree of evil or 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.850
 of envy that exists a lot within 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.640
 the locker room inside the leak in the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.360
 Envy life is something big 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.490
 You've smelled it so much you smell it and thank you 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.010
 I do not have that club 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.530
 footballer puts an envied excompañero 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.660
 clear that lucas is better than me and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.510
 for people better than me I tell myself if 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.520
 people say it and do an analysis and if 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.740
 other people say that I am better than 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.750
 barbadillo for example or jerónimo 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.790
 we were here all I do not have any 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.080
 no problem on the contrary what follows 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.670
 giving satisfaction to the team to the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.610
 institution I have no problem the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.170
 legacy of the athletes is not only 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.360
 in the title is not only the style 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.010
 pause of many other intangibles with 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.910
 which can be compared for example 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.520
 This is a part of your legacy that 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.480
 but it has never been commented there is a 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.160
 generation of young players at least 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.860
 here in monterrey 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.820
 as of the year born of the year 93 97 something 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.319
 like that 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:55.549
 and those children are inspired by gaitán 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.260
 to the best of war espericueta and I do not know why 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.049
 what but I have a lot to see it so 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.810
 they have spoken very well of him they did not see it 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.950
 well the selection did not either I did not 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.340
 but they have told me what it is 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.450
 a good footballer is not there he can not 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.800
 everything did not follow up but I 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.019
 they have spoken very well of him 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:21.760
 walter very well and hopefully if what 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:25.599
 have spoken and that's how it was every Mexican and 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.939
 the best I hope he can play and that 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.079
 can see what it is to play at first 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:34.019
 division that is the cutest thing that you 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.019
 You can have the best New Year's party
