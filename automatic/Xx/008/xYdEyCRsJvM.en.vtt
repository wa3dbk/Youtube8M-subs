not it's probably the warmest has been
for<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> while<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:33.620> think<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.450> almost<00:00:36.450> 30

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
for a while I think it's like almost 30

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.160 
for a while I think it's like almost 30
degrees<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.140> can't<00:00:40.140> depend<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:40.680> heater

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
degrees out so can't depend on my heater

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.509 
degrees out so can't depend on my heater
if<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.380> pan<00:00:43.860> down<00:00:44.220> there<00:00:45.470> and<00:00:46.470> see<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.769> it<00:00:47.309> is

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
if I pan down there and see that it is

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.560 
if I pan down there and see that it is
just<00:00:47.550> about<00:00:48.210> completely<00:00:49.199> out<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:50.670> front<00:00:51.269> pain
