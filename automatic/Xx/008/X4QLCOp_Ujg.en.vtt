00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hey, it's all good, this time, I'm 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.710
 here to order you the use of the subway 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.210
 because what many guitarists and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.179
 many musicians in general 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.849
 not so they prefer to use the subway at 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.240
 River are studying technical eg 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.730
 spain are there are studying to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.869
 alternating avoiding are studying theory 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.140
 and technical and other more 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.039
 applicable to other guitar 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.170
 instruments 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.510
 here on the channel you will find the classes 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.399
 on techniques applied on guitar 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.649
 solo receive alternate matches well says 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.649
 chem sue has the name pink pink 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:51.239
 a series of requirements and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.120
 interesting techniques but nothing 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.000
 you will study all this without 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.000
 electronic aid because the subway in a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.570
 tool that will help you not have 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.790
 they just need that it is very important to 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.780
 there's no point in you playing fast if you 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:16.350
 is not precise as to which 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.110
 In what situation are you okay, which one are you? 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.430
 You want to play fast as well but what is the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.909
 your speed 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.609
 in fact how fast you play 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.329
 good if you play with speed but with 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.700
 precision 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:34.079
 then the subway will not give you a guide 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.590
 so you know it is how you are 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.649
 huh 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.990
 anyone with your progress at all 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.299
 the instrument invented in the 19th century 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.380
 causes rain and with the knee you will only have one 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.659
 shop and was adapted was improved 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.599
 negatively to the step in which the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.899
 technology applied to 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:58.349
 also involved the subway in the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.860
 talent and developing and today we 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:04.079
 we have several is the possibility of 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.000
 these options on the market since the 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:11.879
 battery-operated electronic 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.400
 produces 40 years electronic metronomy 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.420
 us that still works by the system of 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.730
 by the play will go if you do not have conditions 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.709
 since I read number 11 that maybe the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.579
 load are you do not have any your 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.340
 condition 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.329
 Still, this is no excuse for your 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.269
 return 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.310
 if you have internet access, you 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.120
 can you find the iphone 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.220
 and then you cut the subway in your 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.130
 computer as a program is what I 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.680
 I said below the video I'm going 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.290
 put a link through which you 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.359
 you can download the program which is a 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.500
 then you can 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:55.109
 study there with the electronic aid 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.359
 last touch if you are 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.329
 studio musician you will already know that 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:05.310
 usually at or at least studios 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:07.350
 Serious studios and studio tones to you 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.940
 will always record a metronome 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.720
 because usually what happens to the person 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.290
 is to record a track in the low grass is 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.750
 only 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.880
 after entering the drummer enter the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.380
 low and they have to keep a 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.870
 rhythmic unit 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.180
 how a rhythm unit is 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.300
 still keep rhythmic through the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.100
 marking the subway in hockey then 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.140
 you study with oil when you went 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.390
 recorded in the studio will be much more 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.870
 easy for you you will not be scared 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.650
 so much so when you hear that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.380
 marking the subway on your return 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.040
 I strongly embrace good studies and even 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.160
 next 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.090
