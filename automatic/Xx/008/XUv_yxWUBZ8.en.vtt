00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.110
 Hi, Doctor Maria is with us 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.870
 VÃ¡zquez Roque of that is frentero loga in 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.840
 the clinic may doctor welcome 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.060
 thank you we love that you accompany us and 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.279
 The first thing I want to ask is what 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.600
 is what makes a gastroenterologist the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 spending between then study everything 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.020
 they are diseases of the tract 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.610
 gastrointestinal while you're interested 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.190
 throw you start in the mouth and continue 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.099
 all the keys of the esophagus the stomach 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.750
 the intestines to the end in the anus 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.190
 that's what we 're crazy about 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.499
 but there are other organs too that are 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.679
 part of the digestive tract system 

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:43.170
 the pancreas the liver that are part 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.760
 also of the gastrointestinal tract and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.890
 obviously the digestive system is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.019
 a very important device in the body 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.879
 because we usually love to eat 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.469
 from the clearly and we need it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.680
 to be able to absorb all the nutrients 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.030
 of what we eat 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.880
 what are some of the conditions 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.830
 most common that are presented with the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.930
 digestive system reflux 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.990
 fairly common gastroesophageal 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.979
 that although I acidity the acidity is 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.860
 We have much treasure level of 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.810
 problem of defecating this is the problem 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.080
 of dead pretty common either as the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.080
 constipation 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.940
 it is quite common associated with pain 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.580
 abdominal or no abdominal pain term in 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.370
 clear irritable bowel syndrome 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.650
 that a lot of people complain about that and not 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.620
 knows exactly what happens and is when 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.420
 the gastroenterologists exactly the 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.830
 exactly super city now 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.640
 because we do not speak a little bit of the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.110
 perfect acidity because it's acidity is 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.480
 something that happens in the stomach 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.340
 naturally we always produce acid 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.130
 because it's part of the normal process for 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.330
 able to digest and break the food that 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.390
 we eat to be able to eventually 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.460
 absorb the nutrients from the food what 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.580
 it happens that in several conditions the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.470
 acid that occurs in the stomach 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.869
 trickles back or what the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.600
 acid reflux process towards the 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.520
 esophagus and the esophagus is not so 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.470
 used to receiving acid from 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.450
 stomach and that because in the long run you can 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.090
 bring problems annoyances and 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.430
 complications and obviously that when 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.530
 you have too often three times 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.470
 the week or more it is important to treat it 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.130
 it is important to treat it because the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.290
 exposition 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.810
 has been in the continuous esophagus can 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.950
 bring complications in the long run so 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.020
 that they are taking their 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.840
 pills and antacids with that they are 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.940
 remove is not enough it's important to go 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.040
 with the specialist is important because 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.530
 depending on the severity of the acidity 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.710
 It is possible that other medications 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.420
 use to control acidity better 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.190
 so sometimes that antacid 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.160
 for an acidity that happens maybe a 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.800
 once a month or at that level that frequency 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.380
 It is enough when you eat food 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.960
 china mexican food the excess there is 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.160
 once in a while or when they passed 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.290
 maybe to take the glasses that time of 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.060
 suddenly it's fine but very often not 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.040
 clear very often not definitely 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.290
 when it's more often then there's 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.450
 other alternatives and interventions that 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.850
 can be done to better control the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.490
 acid process or acid reflux 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.890
 of the stomach towards the esophagus super 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.510
