00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello and welcome to atlas 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.880
 today again with an international 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.139
 Maybe she 'll recognize everyone else 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.830
 and you probably already have 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.429
 eaten 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.570
 The Turkish pizza called Lahmacun 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.550
 originally one comes already from the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.689
 south of anatolia and the name comes out 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.519
 the Arabic and means as much as 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.050
 translated , it may mean part 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.000
 in this video I show the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.160
 authentic preparation of turkish 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.890
 pizza let's have a look at the ingredients 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.950
 For a man needs 600 grams of flour 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.410
 four tablespoons of oil a cube of yeast 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.390
 teaspoon of salt and of course lukewarm 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.530
 water first I prepare the dough with it 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.329
 he can rest 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.190
 I would like to do everything for you 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.629
 and knead them together 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.629
 nice elastic mass 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.920
 The dough should not be on your hands 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.350
 I stick the blanket with me 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.600
 fresh foil that has none can also 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.950
 take a normal kitchen towel and 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.330
 great rest of the half an hour 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.340
 Meanwhile, I prepare the match 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.640
 topping for the minced meat mixture 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.110
 you need 500 grams of minced meat five 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.740
 tomatoes a red paprika and four 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.740
 green pepperoni 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.360
 1 bunch of parsley onions 2 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.580
 onions 3 garlic cloves 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.020
 Spices I have salt pepper red 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.980
 chilli peppers and two tablespoons 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.980
 paprika market 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.760
 I give the mincemeat in a big one 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.010
 bowl and add all finely chopped 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.440
 ingredients and spices I have the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.170
 tomatoes onions garlic and chillies 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.090
 it finely chopped and who got something 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.230
 want to save work crushed 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.230
 easy in a kitchen machine 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.500
 because 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.590
 I spend very thoroughly with the 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.329
 mince and knead for as long as one 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.329
 very delicate consistency arises 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.799
 So the mass does not have to stick and 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.799
 must be nice spreadable 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.610
 if the dough is good enough for me 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.430
 from the little balls were my goods 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.810
 about the size of a table tennis ball 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.380
 The role I am on a floured 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:31.210
 work area out and give it on it about 2 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.210
 tablespoon of minced meat mixture 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.790
 So you can mix the meat 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.530
 smooth with a spoon 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.500
 or just with your fingers 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.060
 I personally prefer to distribute the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.810
 finger because it is easy to handle 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.810
 is better 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.110
 if the minced meat mixture 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.030
 have been distributed evenly 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.080
 First, the two tips in the oven 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.210
 at 250 degrees for about 15 minutes 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.189
 I put my eyes on the bottom of it 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.949
 bottom and there are those of the bottom 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:40.050
 side baked crispy brown 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.729
 when the pizzas are ready baked 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.740
 The best way to enjoy them is if they are still 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.499
 comes fresh from the oven 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.840
 Served a fresh salad and 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.789
 has made tasci sauce or man himself 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.110
 It can be simply pure with a glass 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.120
 drink 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.099
 yes and that's my art lahmacun 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.080
 I hope the video has 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.759
 you like it if yes then I am glad 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.099
 Huge when you have a positive 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.930
 rating leaves me thank you 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.879
 to watch and wish you much 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.169
 fun while imitating and say goodbye 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.860
 Until next time 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.860
 Bon Appetit
