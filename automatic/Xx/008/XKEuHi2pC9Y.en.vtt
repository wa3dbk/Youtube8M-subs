that was up about this was kinda messed

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.260 
that was up about this was kinda messed
up<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.570> way<00:00:33.719> because<00:00:34.820> you<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.059> change

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
up in a way because you have to change

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.100 
up in a way because you have to change
the<00:00:36.450> title<00:00:36.690> ID<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.719> for<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:39.870> reason

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the title ID on it and for some reason

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.110 
the title ID on it and for some reason
it's<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> way<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.309> modding<00:00:41.670> tool<00:00:41.879> does

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.020 
it's just the way the modding tool does
it<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.870> messes<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.350> up<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.590> guess<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it and it messes it up I guess and so a
