better than majora's mask by firstly
stating<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.119> few<00:00:18.300> facts<00:00:18.660> majora's<00:00:18.900> mask<00:00:19.109> was

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
stating a few facts majora's mask was

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.140 
stating a few facts majora's mask was
made<00:00:19.650> as<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.189> result<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.730> bet<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
made as the result of a bet the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150 
made as the result of a bet the
developers<00:00:21.600> basically<00:00:22.109> made<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.529> bet<00:00:22.830> that

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
developers basically made this bet that

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.650 
developers basically made this bet that
they<00:00:23.310> couldn't<00:00:23.609> make<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> zelda<00:00:24.180> game<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.600> a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
they couldn't make a zelda game in a

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.150 
they couldn't make a zelda game in a
certain<00:00:24.960> time<00:00:25.140> limit<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:25.769> did<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
certain time limit and they did and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.980 
certain time limit and they did and
that's<00:00:26.279> why<00:00:26.519> majora's<00:00:27.060> mask<00:00:27.210> was<00:00:27.539> made<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
that's why majora's mask was made and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870 
that's why majora's mask was made and
coincidentally<00:00:28.650> that's<00:00:28.769> also<00:00:28.980> why<00:00:29.369> majora's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
coincidentally that's also why majora's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.150 
coincidentally that's also why majora's
mask<00:00:30.000> has<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.570> time<00:00:30.840> system<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.009> that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
mask has that time system in it so that

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.010 
mask has that time system in it so that
being<00:00:32.309> said<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.820> making<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.180> game<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.660> little

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
being said that making a game is little

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.959 
being said that making a game is little
time<00:00:34.200> cuz<00:00:34.380> they<00:00:34.469> did<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.920> still<00:00:35.250> impressive
