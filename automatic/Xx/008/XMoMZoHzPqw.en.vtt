Galaxy Nexus or any device that on jelly

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.759 
Galaxy Nexus or any device that on jelly
bean<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:41.040> runs<00:02:41.250> runs<00:02:41.790> very<00:02:42.060> well<00:02:42.620> let's<00:02:43.620> go

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
bean it runs runs very well let's go

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.500 
bean it runs runs very well let's go
back<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.269> have<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
back and this and then you have the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.180 
back and this and then you have the
drawer<00:02:45.920> for<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.040> apps<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.640> widgets<00:02:48.239> drawer

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.699 
so now you can change the background
transparency<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.660> i'll<00:02:54.780> demonstrate<00:02:55.230> that

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
transparency so i'll demonstrate that

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.390 
transparency so i'll demonstrate that
real<00:02:55.890> quick<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:57.209> before<00:02:57.420> when<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:58.140> would<00:02:58.400> open

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
real quick so before when you would open

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.130 
real quick so before when you would open
the<00:02:59.640> drawer<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.239> get<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.570> would<00:03:00.690> be<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> black

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
the drawer you get it would be a black

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.099 
the drawer you get it would be a black
screen<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:02.220> now<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.430> could<00:03:02.640> just<00:03:02.870> now<00:03:03.870> it

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
screen and now you could just now it

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.280 
screen and now you could just now it
will<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.410> same<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:04.739> your<00:03:04.890> wallpaper<00:03:05.010> I

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
will be the same as your wallpaper I

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:17.720 
will be the same as your wallpaper I
thought<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.350> was<00:03:07.530> pretty<00:03:07.739> cool<00:03:09.140> go<00:03:10.140> back

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.340 

we<00:03:18.269> go<00:03:18.450> back<00:03:18.629> to<00:03:18.870> it

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.400 

so<00:03:21.950> then<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.250> have<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.840> drawer<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:24.020> I<00:03:24.140> said

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
so then you have the drawer like I said

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.780 
so then you have the drawer like I said
you<00:03:24.560> got<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.740> couple<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.040> sightings<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.520> here

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
you got a couple of sightings in here

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.540 
you got a couple of sightings in here
you<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.090> change<00:03:26.300> stuff<00:03:26.690> around<00:03:27.520> down<00:03:28.520> here

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
you can change stuff around down here

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.070 
you can change stuff around down here
where<00:03:29.000> it's<00:03:29.120> this<00:03:29.240> prime<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:29.780> means<00:03:29.990> you

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
where it's this prime that means you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.490 
where it's this prime that means you
have<00:03:30.110> to<00:03:30.260> get<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:31.120> paid<00:03:32.120> version<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:33.140> nova

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
so that there's a little downside to the

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.590 
so that there's a little downside to the
free<00:03:39.380> version<00:03:39.560> but<00:03:39.970> free<00:03:40.970> version<00:03:41.330> is<00:03:41.390> pretty

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
free version but free version is pretty

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.510 
free version but free version is pretty
nice<00:03:41.950> then<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:43.070> have<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.310> doc<00:03:43.870> here<00:03:44.870> where

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
nice then you have the doc here where

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.550 
nice then you have the doc here where

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
you can enable scrolling you can change

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.490 
you can enable scrolling you can change
the<00:03:48.770> height<00:03:48.950> on<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:50.570> mines<00:03:50.750> was<00:03:50.960> on<00:03:51.110> medium

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
the height on it so mines was on medium

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.070 
the height on it so mines was on medium
i'll<00:03:51.830> go<00:03:52.010> ahead<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.190> show<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.460> that<00:03:53.080> see

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.320 
i'll go ahead and show you that see
right<00:03:54.230> now<00:03:54.320> it's<00:03:54.590> it's<00:03:54.950> on<00:03:55.130> high<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:56.030> can<00:03:56.150> see

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
right now it's it's on high you can see

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.520 
right now it's it's on high you can see
it's<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.450> little<00:03:56.480> bit<00:03:56.810> taller<00:03:56.990> maybe<00:03:57.350> like

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
it's a little bit taller maybe like

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.020 
it's a little bit taller maybe like
half-inch<00:03:59.830> going<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:00.920> change<00:04:01.160> that<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.610> should

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
half-inch going to change that it should

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.930 
half-inch going to change that it should
get<00:04:02.210> smaller<00:04:02.570> so<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.290> doc<00:04:03.500> height<00:04:03.800> go<00:04:04.790> to

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
get smaller so the doc height go to

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.840 
get smaller so the doc height go to
medium<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:06.190> now<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.250> can<00:04:07.490> see<00:04:07.520> it's<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.820> little

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
medium and now you can see it's a little

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.580 
medium and now you can see it's a little
bit<00:04:08.120> smaller<00:04:08.390> so<00:04:08.860> that's<00:04:09.860> all<00:04:10.040> that<00:04:10.070> does

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
bit smaller so that's all that does

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.810 
bit smaller so that's all that does
that's<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.860> doc<00:04:13.070> I'll<00:04:13.280> go<00:04:13.370> ahead<00:04:13.490> and<00:04:13.610> put<00:04:13.730> it

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
that's the doc I'll go ahead and put it

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.120 
that's the doc I'll go ahead and put it
back<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:15.880> then<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:17.000> have<00:04:17.710> show<00:04:18.710> scroll

back and then you have show scroll

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.280 
back and then you have show scroll
indicator<00:04:19.670> you<00:04:19.880> can<00:04:20.030> have<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.630> there's
