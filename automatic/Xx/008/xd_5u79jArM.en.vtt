00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
time to do videos so it's really good

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.580 
time to do videos so it's really good
yeah<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.800> they're<00:04:54.190> having<00:04:54.340> a<00:04:54.520> fun<00:04:54.729> walk<00:04:54.940> I

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
yeah so they're having a fun walk I

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.990 
yeah so they're having a fun walk I
think<00:04:56.590> Emma<00:04:56.919> likes<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.250> new<00:04:57.370> carriage<00:04:57.700> cuz<00:04:57.910> she

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
think Emma likes a new carriage cuz she

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.910 
think Emma likes a new carriage cuz she
can<00:04:58.150> just<00:04:58.240> put<00:04:58.390> her<00:04:58.450> feet<00:04:58.630> up

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.810 

I<00:05:03.920> think<00:05:04.760> lien<00:05:04.970> likes<00:05:05.150> being<00:05:05.360> up<00:05:05.570> top<00:05:05.780> oh<00:05:06.820> we

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
I think lien likes being up top oh we

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.580 
I think lien likes being up top oh we
lost<00:05:07.970> connection<00:05:08.330> with<00:05:08.540> Shaw<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:09.140> little<00:05:09.440> while

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
lost connection with Shaw a little while

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.680 
lost connection with Shaw a little while
ago<00:05:09.770> I<00:05:09.860> guess<00:05:10.160> so<00:05:10.490> we<00:05:10.970> will<00:05:11.180> definitely<00:05:11.390> call

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
ago I guess so we will definitely call

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.830 
ago I guess so we will definitely call
her<00:05:11.780> back<00:05:11.900> when<00:05:12.110> we<00:05:12.200> get<00:05:12.290> back<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:13.040> house
