00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.699 

Windows<00:00:14.180> 8<00:00:14.330> is<00:00:14.389> of<00:00:14.570> course<00:00:14.719> the<00:00:14.929> processor<00:00:15.559> to

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
Windows 8 is of course the processor to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.380 
Windows 8 is of course the processor to
windows<00:00:16.039> 7<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:16.550> in<00:00:16.699> my<00:00:16.849> opinion<00:00:16.970> I<00:00:17.330> think

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
windows 7 and in my opinion I think

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.999 
windows 7 and in my opinion I think
windows<00:00:17.900> a<00:00:18.020> is<00:00:18.200> kind<00:00:18.439> of<00:00:18.529> ahead<00:00:18.619> of<00:00:18.740> its<00:00:18.950> time

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
windows a is kind of ahead of its time

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.890 
windows a is kind of ahead of its time
windows<00:00:19.820> 8<00:00:19.970> definitely<00:00:20.360> works<00:00:20.539> a<00:00:20.720> lot

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
windows 8 definitely works a lot

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.690 
windows 8 definitely works a lot
differently<00:00:21.349> compared<00:00:21.829> to<00:00:21.950> windows<00:00:22.099> 7<00:00:22.610> and

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
differently compared to windows 7 and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.220 
differently compared to windows 7 and
all<00:00:22.910> other<00:00:23.150> previous<00:00:23.599> versions<00:00:24.020> of<00:00:24.079> Windows

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
Windows 8 has removed the start menu and

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.830 
Windows 8 has removed the start menu and

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
Windows 8.1 whenever that actually comes

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.670 
Windows 8.1 whenever that actually comes
out<00:01:05.330> we'll<00:01:05.479> be<00:01:05.509> adding<00:01:05.780> these<00:01:06.050> Start<00:01:06.410> menu

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.410 
out we'll be adding these Start menu
back<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:07.160> Windows<00:01:07.430> 8<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:07.820> that's<00:01:07.940> always<00:01:08.119> good

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
back to Windows 8 so that's always good

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.480 
back to Windows 8 so that's always good
not<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:08.899> lot<00:01:09.229> of<00:01:09.259> people<00:01:09.350> have<00:01:09.679> adopted<00:01:09.979> windows

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
not a lot of people have adopted windows

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.100 
not a lot of people have adopted windows
8<00:01:10.640> into<00:01:10.910> the<00:01:11.030> main<00:01:11.210> systems<00:01:11.720> even<00:01:11.960> though

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
8 into the main systems even though

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.749 
8 into the main systems even though
Windows<00:01:12.410> 8<00:01:12.530> is<00:01:12.560> really<00:01:12.920> kind<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.220> faster<00:01:13.610> than

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
Windows 8 is really kind of faster than

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.310 
Windows 8 is really kind of faster than
windows<00:01:13.910> 7<00:01:14.360> or<00:01:14.479> of<00:01:14.630> course<00:01:14.840> every<00:01:15.229> other

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
windows 7 or of course every other

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.080 
windows 7 or of course every other
version<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.860> Windows<00:01:16.369> that's<00:01:16.880> probably

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
version of Windows that's probably

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.850 
version of Windows that's probably
because<00:01:17.299> Microsoft<00:01:17.900> focus<00:01:18.200> too<00:01:18.470> much<00:01:18.500> of

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
because Microsoft focus too much of

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.710 
because Microsoft focus too much of
Windows<00:01:19.159> late<00:01:19.310> on<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.580> tablet<00:01:20.150> portion<00:01:20.509> and
