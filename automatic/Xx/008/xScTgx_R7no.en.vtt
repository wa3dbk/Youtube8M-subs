00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
for the Power Plus wheel so we get

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
for the Power Plus wheel so we get

advantage<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.500> fact<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:11.070> use<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.640> cog

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
advantage is the fact that we use a cog

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.980 
advantage is the fact that we use a cog
pulley<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> motor<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.280> well<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.990> opposed

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
pulley on the motor as well as opposed

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
pulley on the motor as well as opposed
to<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.619> standard<00:01:16.890> v-groove<00:01:17.700> pulley<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
to the standard v-groove pulley and the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
to the standard v-groove pulley and the
diameter<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.439> cogged<00:01:19.979> pulley<00:01:20.280> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
diameter of that cogged pulley is

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.130 
diameter of that cogged pulley is
smaller<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.439> does<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.100> well<00:01:23.430> is

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
smaller and what that does as well is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
smaller and what that does as well is
again<00:01:25.140> gives<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.590> another<00:01:25.830> power<00:01:26.130> advantage

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
again gives you another power advantage

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.569 
again gives you another power advantage
and<00:01:27.270> decreases<00:01:27.960> speed<00:01:28.080> once<00:01:28.619> again<00:01:28.920> in

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and decreases speed once again in

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.210 
and decreases speed once again in
practice<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.900> advantage<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> Power<00:01:31.920> Plus

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
practice the advantage of the Power Plus

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.270 
practice the advantage of the Power Plus

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.190 
needle down I can I can run the foot
control<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.940> stop<00:02:22.180> with<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.480> needle<00:02:22.600> up<00:02:22.930> and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
control to stop with the needle up and

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.229 
control to stop with the needle up and
then<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.680> don't<00:02:24.010> have<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.280> touch<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.820> flywheel

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
then I don't have to touch the flywheel

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.810 
then I don't have to touch the flywheel
to<00:02:25.450> get<00:02:25.600> going<00:02:25.959> again<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.950> just<00:02:27.070> fantastic

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
to get going again it's just fantastic

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.940 
to get going again it's just fantastic
control<00:02:28.540> with<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.840> power<00:02:29.080> plus<00:02:29.380> wheel<00:02:29.620> makes

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
control with the power plus wheel makes

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.410 
control with the power plus wheel makes
a<00:02:30.070> big<00:02:30.280> difference<00:02:30.700> over<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:30.970> standard

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
a big difference over the standard

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.590 
a big difference over the standard
arrangement<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:33.160> again<00:02:34.000> let's<00:02:34.209> look<00:02:34.270> at<00:02:34.510> that

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
arrangement and again let's look at that

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.350 
arrangement and again let's look at that
range<00:02:34.900> on<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.290> foot<00:02:35.470> control<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.209> can

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
range on the foot control so we can

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.130 
range on the foot control so we can
start<00:02:37.600> off<00:02:37.720> very<00:02:38.080> slowly<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:39.720> then<00:02:40.720> as<00:02:40.930> we

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
start off very slowly and then as we

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.440 
start off very slowly and then as we
ramp<00:02:41.380> up<00:02:41.620> speed<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.430> see<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.820> enormous

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
ramp up speed you can see the enormous

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.490 
ramp up speed you can see the enormous
range<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:44.320> speed<00:02:44.620> control

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.500 

and<00:02:48.890> my<00:02:49.220> materials<00:02:49.670> not<00:02:49.790> long<00:02:50.030> enough<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.420> get

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
and my materials not long enough to get

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.420 
and my materials not long enough to get
to<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.750> bottom<00:02:51.020> of<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.320> speed<00:02:51.590> control<00:02:51.980> but

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
to the bottom of that speed control but

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.600 
to the bottom of that speed control but
it's<00:02:52.850> it's<00:02:53.150> quite<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.480> range<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:55.280> really<00:02:55.580> a

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
it's it's quite a range it's really a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.280 
it's it's quite a range it's really a
very<00:02:55.880> impressive<00:02:56.180> device<00:02:56.720> I'm<00:02:56.930> gonna<00:02:57.050> do<00:02:57.200> it

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
very impressive device I'm gonna do it

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.750 
very impressive device I'm gonna do it
much<00:02:57.440> faster<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.070> can<00:02:58.280> see<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.580> range

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
much faster so you can see the range

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.850 
much faster so you can see the range
here<00:03:03.850> there<00:03:04.850> your<00:03:05.000> top<00:03:05.240> speed<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:06.680> you've<00:03:06.770> got

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
here there your top speed so you've got

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.140 
here there your top speed so you've got
a<00:03:06.890> good<00:03:07.160> amount<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.460> movement<00:03:07.700> in<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.000> foot

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
a good amount of movement in the foot

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.660 
a good amount of movement in the foot

you<00:03:47.690> can<00:03:47.870> see<00:03:48.020> I<00:03:48.050> get<00:03:48.350> reasonably<00:03:49.130> good<00:03:49.370> lift

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
you can see I get reasonably good lift

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.390 
you can see I get reasonably good lift
under<00:03:49.940> there<00:03:50.150> but<00:03:50.840> if<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:51.770> I'll<00:03:51.860> leave<00:03:52.370> it

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
under there but if I and I'll leave it

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.850 
under there but if I and I'll leave it
lifted<00:03:52.880> manually<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:53.600> I'll<00:03:53.720> use<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.680> foot

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
lifted manually and I'll use the foot

pedal on top of it watch how much

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.500 
pedal on top of it watch how much
additional<00:03:56.660> lift<00:03:57.019> I<00:03:57.170> can<00:03:57.350> get<00:04:01.209> so<00:04:02.209> I'm<00:04:02.330> getting

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
additional lift I can get so I'm getting

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.770 
additional lift I can get so I'm getting
at<00:04:02.780> least<00:04:02.810> another<00:04:03.880> well<00:04:04.880> let's<00:04:05.090> let's<00:04:05.480> do<00:04:05.690> it

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
at least another well let's let's do it

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.150 
at least another well let's let's do it
again<00:04:06.019> I'm<00:04:06.140> getting<00:04:06.260> at<00:04:06.500> least<00:04:06.530> another

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
again I'm getting at least another

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.000 
again I'm getting at least another
eighth<00:04:07.850> of<00:04:08.120> an<00:04:08.209> inch<00:04:08.330> or<00:04:08.540> so<00:04:08.780> on<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.620> lift<00:04:09.830> of

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
eighth of an inch or so on the lift of

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.430 
eighth of an inch or so on the lift of
the<00:04:10.040> foot<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.489> that<00:04:10.970> additional<00:04:11.269> lift<00:04:11.780> makes

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
the foot and that additional lift makes

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.870 
the foot and that additional lift makes
a<00:04:12.590> big<00:04:12.769> difference<00:04:13.220> when<00:04:13.430> you're<00:04:13.580> trying<00:04:13.760> to

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
a big difference when you're trying to

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.330 
a big difference when you're trying to
get<00:04:14.120> heavy<00:04:14.840> thick<00:04:15.200> items<00:04:15.590> under<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:15.950> foot<00:04:16.250> of

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
get heavy thick items under the foot of
