00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.639
 hello outside I 'm it again and again 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.860
 nice that you turned on at 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.640
 I have the glossybox again today 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:22.619
 I believe unboxing for the month of april 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.939
 we did not wonder exactly 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.529
 maybe it's still a bit 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.210
 weird if I choose because I have 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.490
 my further teeth get pulled up 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.859
 that's why it's everything on the right side 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.399
 still a bit deaf and so if 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.739
 I talk so unilaterally because of that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.719
 my move on 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:51.030
 So we start even more glossybox 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:57.059
 the glossybox looks like this and it penetrates 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.829
 I have to say pretty well that's how it looks 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.800
 All this month I hope you 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.899
 can see it very well 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.330
 I 'm going to the biggest house and 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.330
 Although it's over there was already something 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.049
 because I know a shampoo and shower 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.869
 gel and that is probably from chamomile 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.920
 and Indian water advertising and that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:26.460
 calms the skin and smells does 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.470
 not so good on everyone 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.570
 fall is wrong for the spring for 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.500
 the summer is nothing strong or 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:39.450
 something really such a little after 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.070
 drink but I do not know what 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.340
 a bit like caipirinha me that 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.720
 so now it smells like sugar again 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.570
 So, I like it too 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.500
 can describe 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.850
 but I do not think so 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.369
 a bit too loud sugar but me 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.729
 find it cool is 200 milliliters 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.330
 and that's what I guess is 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.340
 original 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.200
 size one yes and that costs 14 euro 40 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.910
 and he is only there for application 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.300
 we just let on wet skin 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.130
 cock applies next to it beautifully massaged 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.170
 and therefore plays one can as you 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:19.200
 stands as well as to use as a hair shampoo 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.110
 then there was something of sauce there too 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:30.660
 something new there and indeed one 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:33.960
 motto, we better do it this way 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.980
 looks like that and what should that be now 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.560
 to be precise 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.120
 it should bones the man in the brown 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.270
 and a light blackboard 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.140
 and shine for a long time 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.690
 So a kind of highlighter I would 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.630
 So now I do not know 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.950
 does not look like a highlighter and that 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.850
 is it so roségold with too glittering 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.739
 particle 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.150
 I do not know if we can see that 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.070
 Here I have this applied now 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.920
 is a little bit thicker because of that 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.290
 nice view i believe in the summer 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.390
 really nice brown skin brown 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.880
 sunburned sunshine skin you 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.209
 that is not really on such a kind 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:27.140
 replaced bronze and yes I think completely 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:27.140
 nice those are now 15 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.150
 and yes, apparently it is an original 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.280
 product and costs 25 euro then would have 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.110
 nice celebration then it goes on with the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.910
 with a day face cream than with one 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.470
 I guess from moisturizer 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.260
 run ii green and here are 15 meters 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.010
 in original size of 50 milliliters and 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.560
 would cost 1790 and at the same time 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.350
 especially that it's made from organic products 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.720
 has been established and is just 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.319
 just after the facial cleansing 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.689
 face and dékolleté applied 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.849
 be and yes I think we need us 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.689
 to a day cream moisturizer 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.889
 not say 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.859
 then I have here it is already 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.269
 dropped out of such a small one 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.660
 cave from a small cover of a 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.669
 tweezers for the eyebrows looks 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.509
 Servus Tauss is from the brand 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.580
 I know the rent or he means or 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.699
 no idea 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:31.389
 is pronounced and that is 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.940
 just a brow in the side 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.979
 an eyebrow pluck note and 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.900
 costs 22 euros the piece 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.090
 I will definitely try it 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.979
 because I wanted one with one 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.590
 larger area because you are one 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.870
 weird 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.949
 and yes the price promises ever 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.740
 a lot and i think i need more 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.250
 also do not say to a pair of tweezers and 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.830
 Last but not least, here is a lot 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:04.720
 strong blue nail polish from carla 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:11.050
 works and in the color 993 wide 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:14.380
 it should royal blue yes something I would it 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.550
 describe and that's what I guess 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.800
 on 15 milliliters the original product 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.710
 is not on it and that costs 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.599
 usually seven euros and here it is 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.729
 also equal to the application to that one 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.870
 just one to two layers order as 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.400
 I do not know 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:38.560
 try now just like a 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:40.570
 first layer covers that was a bit 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.710
 too much that goes down the page 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.500
 no matter 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.070
 So yes you can see the first 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.110
 layer is already relatively covering so 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.430
 you do not need to force 2 layer though 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.340
 it could be running i need some 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.790
 paperback yes and that this Nageler 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.040
 costs as I said seven euros and me 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.390
 really must say this glossybox has 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.130
 from the price-performance ratio so if 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.830
 I'm thinking of paying 15 euros for the 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.350
 classic boxers in the blood while the 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.330
 worth of loose over 50 euros 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.990
 I mean so much about tweezers 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.510
 costs 22 euros the shower gel already 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.710
 Almost 15 euros that we are already alone 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.480
 at 37 euro so heaps of money and 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.110
 i think products are really cool okay the 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.820
 Day cream or after cleaning plans 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.040
 I do not think so special though 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.990
 You can always use tweezers 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.400
 I very cool the nail polish the color 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.470
 I think it's good though it is not 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.000
 but it fits so early 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:45.550
 just a strong color and yes it is 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.110
 There were eight more masters I think 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.190
 also kuwait I have to definitely again 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.900
 try and how do I always forget 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.650
 go create a year I find 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.630
 quite well 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.550
 and yes, if you are from others or 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.140
 had GLOSSYBOX I could me happy times 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.420
 something is going up in the comments 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.190
 was in it or something for different 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.910
 colors of nail polish or what do I know 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.890
 not everything 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.340
 and then stay until the 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.340
 next time
