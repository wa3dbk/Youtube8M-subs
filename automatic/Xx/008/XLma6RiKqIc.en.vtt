00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.069
 bag I would not like a pair of boots 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.399
 crocodile skin steals wallets not 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:46.340
 steal lives if they say the desert is 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.340
 a cruel lover I like how that sounds 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:57.509
 to collect and leave, I fight for a 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.390
 cause but I will not die for one the kings 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.520

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.799
 world has a price the wealth is the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.619
 type of cargo that I prefer I do my 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.080
 own fortune loyalty is not earned 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.360

 moment the heroes are starving 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.810
 the robberies and they are already dead the only thing 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.910
 that I look up is the sky the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.430
 honor is the rust of a sword without 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.769
 edge if you have problems I have a 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.209
 clear price that I have values I 'm going 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.220

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.090
 catch it take this better crouch 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.090

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.750
