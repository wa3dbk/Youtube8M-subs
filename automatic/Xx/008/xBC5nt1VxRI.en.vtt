okay hopefully you heard that and then
and<00:00:26.710> then<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:28.099> sometimes<00:00:28.669> the<00:00:28.789> breaker<00:00:29.090> will

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
and then the sometimes the breaker will

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.180 
and then the sometimes the breaker will
shut<00:00:29.480> off<00:00:30.220> about<00:00:31.220> eight<00:00:31.460> out<00:00:31.640> of<00:00:31.669> ten<00:00:31.939> times

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
shut off about eight out of ten times

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.340 
shut off about eight out of ten times
what<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.220> is<00:00:34.309> that<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:34.730> capacitor<00:00:35.329> is<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:36.079> so

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
what it is that the capacitor is that so

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.670 
what it is that the capacitor is that so
here's<00:00:36.800> what<00:00:37.010> what<00:00:37.370> you<00:00:37.460> want<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:37.760> do<00:00:38.530> first<00:00:39.530> of

your screwdriver across both of the
electrical<00:01:26.009> things<00:01:26.640> okay

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
electrical things okay

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:38.580 
electrical things okay
terminals<00:01:28.380> mm-hmm<00:01:29.399> all<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.330> we<00:01:30.420> do<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.850 
this is a very common problem and what
you<00:01:49.119> want<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.360> do<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:50.229> want<00:01:50.439> to<00:01:50.500> look<00:01:50.680> at

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
you want to do is you want to look at

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.800 
you want to do is you want to look at
the<00:01:50.950> numbers<00:01:51.310> on<00:01:51.579> here<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:51.909> they<00:01:52.180> match<00:01:52.420> I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
the numbers on here that they match I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.230 
the numbers on here that they match I
don't<00:01:53.170> know<00:01:53.289> if<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:53.409> can<00:01:53.470> get<00:01:53.649> this<00:01:53.799> or<00:01:53.979> not<00:01:54.240> it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
something but anyway it's got to try to

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.550 
something but anyway it's got to try to
try<00:02:03.369> to<00:02:03.429> match<00:02:03.640> them<00:02:03.789> up<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:04.840> get<00:02:05.079> your<00:02:05.289> new

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
try to match them up just get your new

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:34.640 
try to match them up just get your new
one

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.010 

I'm<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.830> gonna<00:02:35.950> test<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.400> before<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:37.270> put<00:02:37.930> it

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
I'm just gonna test it before I put it

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.780 
I'm just gonna test it before I put it
together

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.980 

and<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.909> awesome

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.800 

so<00:02:48.990> here's<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.500> thing<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:50.360> little<00:02:51.360> part

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
so here's the thing that little part

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.530 
so here's the thing that little part
cost<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:53.150> maybe<00:02:54.150> $40<00:02:54.990> possibly<00:02:55.950> um<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.910> you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
cost like maybe $40 possibly um and you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.760 
cost like maybe $40 possibly um and you
see<00:02:57.750> how<00:02:57.900> easy<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:59.180> so<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:01.410> know<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
see how easy it is to do so you know a

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.290 
see how easy it is to do so you know a
lot<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.040> people<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.700> their<00:03:02.910> motors

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
lot of people think that their motors

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.420 
lot of people think that their motors
are<00:03:03.450> shot<00:03:03.900> or<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.740> know<00:03:04.830> they<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.280> get<00:03:05.400> a

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
are shot or you know they have to get a

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.370 
are shot or you know they have to get a
whole<00:03:05.640> new<00:03:05.820> motor<00:03:06.150> which<00:03:06.630> has<00:03:06.750> got<00:03:06.930> hundreds

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
whole new motor which has got hundreds

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.060 
whole new motor which has got hundreds
of<00:03:07.500> dollars<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.390> eight<00:03:09.390> out<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.690> ten<00:03:09.960> times

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
of dollars and eight out of ten times

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.720 
of dollars and eight out of ten times
it's<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.190> capacitor<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.750> um<00:03:13.500> anyway<00:03:13.920> I'm

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
it's the capacitor so um anyway I'm

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.000 
it's the capacitor so um anyway I'm
really<00:03:14.970> excited<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:16.320> this<00:03:16.470> one<00:03:16.620> went<00:03:16.860> bad
