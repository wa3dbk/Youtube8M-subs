00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.050 
the most actually and I like that he was
a<00:02:57.810> man<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.050> principle<00:02:58.770> I<00:02:58.890> wish<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.430> had<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.730> friend

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
a man of principle I wish I had a friend

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.900 
a man of principle I wish I had a friend
like<00:03:00.300> writer<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.200> wish<00:03:01.709> my<00:03:01.890> dad<00:03:02.190> was<00:03:02.610> writer

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
like writer I wish my dad was writer

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.820 
like writer I wish my dad was writer
then<00:03:03.420> I'd<00:03:03.570> probably<00:03:03.780> end<00:03:04.080> up<00:03:04.260> looking<00:03:04.620> like<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
then I'd probably end up looking like a

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.680 
then I'd probably end up looking like a
really<00:03:05.220> buff<00:03:05.459> Viking<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.360> know<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.540> know

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
he's not a Viking just so I could like

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.720 
he's not a Viking just so I could like
trade<00:03:09.930> my<00:03:10.080> dragon<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.160> know<00:03:11.310> they<00:03:11.459> had<00:03:11.610> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
that I was really kicking out about is

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.970 
that I was really kicking out about is
that<00:03:30.180> when<00:03:30.390> caster<00:03:30.900> thought<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.470> saber<00:03:31.709> was

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
thinking maybe she was Joan of Arc in a

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.460 
thinking maybe she was Joan of Arc in a
past<00:03:35.820> life<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.390> then<00:03:36.630> somehow<00:03:36.959> savories
