looks<00:02:29.260> like<00:02:29.610> somebody<00:02:30.610> just<00:02:30.690> tore<00:02:31.690> up<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
looks like somebody just tore up the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.809 

then<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.520> stops

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
then it stops

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.780 
then it stops
