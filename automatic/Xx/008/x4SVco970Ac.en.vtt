video I encourage you to watch that
before<00:00:18.779> watching<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.800> explains

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
before watching this and it explains

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.370 
before watching this and it explains
hardware<00:00:20.820> or<00:00:20.939> software<00:00:21.230> pretty<00:00:22.230> much

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
hardware or software pretty much

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.920 
hardware or software pretty much
everything<00:00:22.970> about<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.150> robot<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:25.650> depth

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
everything about the robot in in depth

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.070 
everything about the robot in in depth
so<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.439> robot<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.580> same<00:00:30.330> nothing<00:00:30.929> was

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so the robot is the same nothing was

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.380 
so the robot is the same nothing was
changed<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.710> except<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> laptop<00:00:33.090> has<00:00:33.239> been

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
changed on it except the laptop has been

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.650 
changed on it except the laptop has been
changed<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.899> laptop<00:00:34.680> acts<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> bridge<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> you

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
changed a laptop acts as a bridge so you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.200 
changed a laptop acts as a bridge so you
go<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.559> jump<00:00:37.860> from<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> wii<00:00:38.280> remote<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
go you jump from the wii remote to the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
go you jump from the wii remote to the
laptop<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> laptop<00:00:40.469> transmits<00:00:41.070> data<00:00:41.460> to

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
laptop then the laptop transmits data to

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.479 
laptop then the laptop transmits data to
the<00:00:41.760> arduino<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.739> vice<00:00:43.739> versa<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:47.190> wii

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the arduino and vice versa so the wii

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.119 
the arduino and vice versa so the wii
remote<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> four

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
remote is right here you have the four

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.860 
remote is right here you have the four
lights<00:00:50.399> down<00:00:50.670> there<00:00:50.700> i'll<00:00:51.120> explain<00:00:51.510> those<00:00:51.750> in

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
lights down there i'll explain those in

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.569 
lights down there i'll explain those in
a<00:00:51.930> minute<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> vibrating<00:00:53.340> motor

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
a minute you have the vibrating motor

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.240 
a minute you have the vibrating motor
inside<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:54.180> well<00:00:54.239> as<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.170> four<00:00:55.710> buttons<00:00:56.129> up

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
inside as well as the four buttons up

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.299 
inside as well as the four buttons up
here<00:00:56.660> these<00:00:57.660> are<00:00:57.960> four<00:00:58.170> directional<00:00:58.620> control

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.810 

get<00:01:05.309> forward<00:01:05.909> back<00:01:06.720> left<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.439> right<00:01:07.820> it's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
get forward back left and right it's

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.469 
get forward back left and right it's
quite<00:01:09.060> simple<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> last<00:01:10.380> one

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
quite simple just like the last one

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.630 
quite simple just like the last one
except<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> Wii<00:01:12.900> Remote<00:01:13.580> now<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
except is on the Wii Remote now the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.550 
except is on the Wii Remote now the
thing<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.330> did<00:01:15.509> change<00:01:15.840> was<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:18.049> alert<00:01:19.049> system

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
thing I did change was the alert system

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
thing I did change was the alert system
I<00:01:19.740> didn't<00:01:20.580> realize<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.119> could<00:01:21.299> do<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
I didn't realize that I could do this

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.179 
I didn't realize that I could do this
until<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.900> started<00:01:22.170> playing<00:01:22.439> with<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.860> forgot

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
until I started playing with it I forgot

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.219 
until I started playing with it I forgot
about<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.509> four<00:01:24.780> lights<00:01:24.990> at<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
about it but the four lights at the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.760 
about it but the four lights at the
bottom<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.740> use<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.189> signify<00:01:27.770> becoming

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
bottom I use it to signify becoming

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.760 
bottom I use it to signify becoming
closer<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.549> an<00:01:29.700> object<00:01:29.820> when<00:01:30.780> there's<00:01:30.990> four

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
closer to an object when there's four

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.940 
closer to an object when there's four
like<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.360> means<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.259> 26

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
like it is now that means that you're 26

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.190 
like it is now that means that you're 26
inches<00:01:35.189> are<00:01:35.369> more<00:01:35.520> away<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:35.970> an<00:01:36.030> object

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
inches are more away from an object

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.580 
inches are more away from an object
right<00:01:37.200> about<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.829> around<00:01:38.220> 26<00:01:38.939> inches

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
right about now it's around 26 inches

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.899 
right about now it's around 26 inches
exactly<00:01:40.880> now<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.180> round<00:01:42.649> its<00:01:43.649> 22<00:01:44.520> inches<00:01:44.759> or

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
exactly now it's round its 22 inches or

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.749 
exactly now it's round its 22 inches or
less<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.960> get<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.770> means<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.280> 18

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
less you get to that means it's 18

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.569 
less you get to that means it's 18
inches<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.149> os<00:01:48.299> 1<00:01:48.720> means<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.770> 14<00:01:50.159> inches<00:01:50.399> or

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
inches and os 1 means it's 14 inches or

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.539 
inches and os 1 means it's 14 inches or
less<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:52.020> when<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.680> go<00:01:52.829> below<00:01:53.009> 1<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
less and then when you go below 1 I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.580 
less and then when you go below 1 I
don't<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.240> guys<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.390> hear<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.960> but

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
don't know if you guys can hear that but

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.429 
don't know if you guys can hear that but
the<00:01:58.590> wii<00:01:59.399> remote<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.939> vibrating<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the wii remote is vibrating with the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.440 
the wii remote is vibrating with the
motor<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.860> science<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.579> signify<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.180> you're

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
motor in science to signify that you're

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.160 
motor in science to signify that you're
about<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.810> hit<00:02:03.990> an<00:02:04.170> object<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.990> like<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
about to hit an object I like the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.499 
about to hit an object I like the
vibrating<00:02:07.590> feature<00:02:07.979> more<00:02:08.610> than<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
vibrating feature more than the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.050 
vibrating feature more than the
computers<00:02:10.200> audible<00:02:11.190> tone<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.940> was

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
computers audible tone because it was

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.080 
computers audible tone because it was
incredibly<00:02:12.660> annoying<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.370> wii<00:02:14.489> remote<00:02:14.790> i

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
incredibly annoying so the wii remote i

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.160 
incredibly annoying so the wii remote i
think<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.739> good<00:02:17.400> choice<00:02:17.660> except<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
think it's all a good choice except the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.020 
think it's all a good choice except the
only<00:02:19.290> thing<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.310> wii<00:02:20.489> remote<00:02:20.819> is

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
only thing is that the wii remote is

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.759 
only thing is that the wii remote is
completely<00:02:21.540> dependent<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.140> computer<00:02:22.590> in

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
completely dependent on the computer in

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.640 
completely dependent on the computer in
this<00:02:23.010> case<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.840> believe<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.050> can<00:02:25.200> connect<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
this case I believe you can connect it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.380 
this case I believe you can connect it
directly<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> Arduino<00:02:26.550> but<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.239> would

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
directly to the Arduino but that would

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.050 
directly to the Arduino but that would
take<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.959> lot<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.680> time<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.280> me<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.519> get<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
take a lot of time for me to get the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.009 
take a lot of time for me to get the
code<00:02:30.269> right<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:32.310> computer<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.090> running<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
code right the computer is running the

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.880 
code right the computer is running the
managed<00:02:35.010> wiimote<00:02:35.430> library<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.410> detects

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
managed wiimote library so it detects

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.400 
managed wiimote library so it detects
when<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.760> push<00:02:39.269> these<00:02:39.450> buttons<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.260> also

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
when I push these buttons and it also

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.920 
when I push these buttons and it also
allows<00:02:40.709> me<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.950> control<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.430> lights<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
allows me to control the lights and the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.170 
allows me to control the lights and the
motor<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.349> everything<00:02:44.250> else<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:44.970> remote

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
motor and everything else that we remote

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.390 
motor and everything else that we remote
I<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.569> plug<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.080> attachments<00:02:46.860> like<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
I can plug in attachments like the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.880 
I can plug in attachments like the
nunchuck<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.299> classic<00:02:48.720> controller<00:02:48.890> but

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
nunchuck and the classic controller but

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.890 
nunchuck and the classic controller but
I<00:02:49.920> didn't<00:02:50.220> see<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> reason<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:51.000> do<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.180> there's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
I didn't see a reason to do that there's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.360 
I didn't see a reason to do that there's
only<00:02:52.079> two<00:02:52.319> motors<00:02:52.620> long<00:02:52.769> as<00:02:52.920> it's<00:02:53.130> not<00:02:53.220> like

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
only two motors long as it's not like

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.400 
only two motors long as it's not like
you<00:02:53.459> can<00:02:53.519> do<00:02:53.730> much<00:02:53.910> on<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:56.519> laptop<00:02:57.150> though<00:02:57.410> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
you can do much on the laptop though the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.729 
you can do much on the laptop though the
problem<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.819> I<00:03:00.180> see<00:03:00.540> what<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.049> just

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
problem that I I see what this is just

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.849 
problem that I I see what this is just
because<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.989> said<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.380> completely

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
because it's as I said it's completely

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.000 
because it's as I said it's completely
dependent<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.840> laptop<00:03:07.319> at<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.500> laptop

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
dependent on the laptop at the laptop

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.210 
dependent on the laptop at the laptop
the<00:03:08.400> laptops<00:03:08.790> like<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> bridge<00:03:09.299> between<00:03:09.630> the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
the laptops like a bridge between the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.120 
the laptops like a bridge between the
wii<00:03:11.220> remote<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.930> robot<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.139> it's<00:03:13.739> missing

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
wii remote and the robot if it's missing

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.720 
wii remote and the robot if it's missing
the<00:03:14.310> data<00:03:14.760> doesn't<00:03:15.180> get<00:03:15.420> either<00:03:15.840> end<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.730> the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
the data doesn't get either end and the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.309 
the data doesn't get either end and the
computer<00:03:18.299> does<00:03:18.480> most<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:18.989> number

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
computer does most of the number

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.199 
computer does most of the number
crunching<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:20.100> figure<00:03:20.370> out<00:03:20.489> what<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.150> thing

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
crunching to figure out what this thing

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.569 
crunching to figure out what this thing
is<00:03:21.389> doing<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.920> then<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.190> drives<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:24.470> arduino

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
is doing and then it drives the arduino

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.150 
is doing and then it drives the arduino
so<00:03:26.579> it's<00:03:26.970> pretty<00:03:27.450> good<00:03:27.630> robot<00:03:28.019> i'm<00:03:28.889> probably

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
so it's pretty good robot i'm probably

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.530 
so it's pretty good robot i'm probably
going<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.430> take<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.670> apart<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.030> week<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.389> if<00:03:30.450> you

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
going to take it apart a week so if you

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.180 
going to take it apart a week so if you
guys<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:30.989> any<00:03:31.109> questions<00:03:31.290> or<00:03:31.620> comments<00:03:32.069> or
