00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
announcement is going to be sometime

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.510 
announcement is going to be sometime
towards<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> end<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.439> May<00:00:19.650> but<00:00:20.160> yeah<00:00:20.340> we'll

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
towards the end of May but yeah we'll

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.830 
towards the end of May but yeah we'll
start<00:00:20.760> off<00:00:20.850> with<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.029> design<00:00:21.420> here<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.779> it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
start off with the design here and it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.900 
start off with the design here and it
looks<00:00:21.869> pretty<00:00:22.410> similar<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> g2<00:00:23.550> which<00:00:23.760> was

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
looks pretty similar to the g2 which was

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.880 
looks pretty similar to the g2 which was
highly<00:00:24.150> credited<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:24.720> having<00:00:25.109> tiny<00:00:25.380> bezels

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
highly credited for having tiny bezels

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220 
highly credited for having tiny bezels
and<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> near<00:00:26.430> edge-to-edge<00:00:26.670> display<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
and a near edge-to-edge display and it

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.419 
and a near edge-to-edge display and it
seems<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.560> though<00:00:28.650> that's<00:00:28.830> been<00:00:29.099> carried

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
seems as though that's been carried

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.310 
seems as though that's been carried
across<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> g3<00:00:30.539> which<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.869> good<00:00:31.080> it

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
across to the g3 which is good it

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
across to the g3 which is good it
retains<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> volume<00:00:32.130> buttons<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> back

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
retains the volume buttons on the back

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.190 
retains the volume buttons on the back
of<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> device<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:33.660> seem<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.079> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
of the device but they seem to have a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.229 
of the device but they seem to have a
flatter<00:00:34.590> design<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.250> time<00:00:35.489> hopefully

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
flatter design this time hopefully

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.060 
flatter design this time hopefully
leading<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> sleeker<00:00:37.200> build<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.920> also

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
leading to a sleeker build it's also

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.069 
leading to a sleeker build it's also
said<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.700> polycarbonate<00:00:39.480> back<00:00:39.690> just

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
said to have the polycarbonate back just

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.530 
said to have the polycarbonate back just
like<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> LG<00:00:40.829> g2<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.610> while<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> g2s<00:00:42.329> had<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
like the LG g2 but while the g2s had a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.600 
like the LG g2 but while the g2s had a
glossy<00:00:42.840> finish<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.770> time<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.250> said<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.460> be

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
glossy finish this time is said to be

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.279 
glossy finish this time is said to be
matt<00:00:44.910> although<00:00:45.210> from<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.570> image<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.050> still

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
matt although from this image it still

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.990 
matt although from this image it still
looks<00:00:46.530> pretty<00:00:46.649> shiny<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.399> pretty<00:00:47.520> slippery

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
looks pretty shiny and pretty slippery

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000 
looks pretty shiny and pretty slippery
to<00:00:48.149> me<00:00:48.270> we'll<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> wait<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.050> now

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to me we'll have to wait and see now

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.290 
to me we'll have to wait and see now
there's<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> cutout<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.789> something<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
there's a cutout for something in the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.459 
there's a cutout for something in the
top<00:00:51.480> right-hand<00:00:51.690> corner<00:00:51.870> which<00:00:52.230> isn't

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
top right-hand corner which isn't

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.869 
top right-hand corner which isn't
entirely<00:00:52.770> clear<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.489> saw<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
entirely clear but we saw on the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.459 
entirely clear but we saw on the
previous<00:00:53.910> image<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> headphone<00:00:54.960> jack<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.350> on

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
previous image the headphone jack is on

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.630 
previous image the headphone jack is on
the<00:00:55.559> bottom<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> device<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.460> probably

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the bottom of the device so it probably

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.340 
the bottom of the device so it probably
isn't<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.780> could<00:00:57.960> either<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
isn't that so this could either be a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.439 
isn't that so this could either be a
stylist<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.100> more<00:00:59.340> likely<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> Korean

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
stylist or more likely it's the Korean

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.540 
stylist or more likely it's the Korean
version<00:01:00.629> which<00:01:00.899> has<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> TV<00:01:01.770> antenna<00:01:01.890> built<00:01:02.399> in

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
version which has a TV antenna built in

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.729 
version which has a TV antenna built in
which<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.000> seen<00:01:03.180> before<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.379> moving<00:01:04.650> on

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
which we have seen before so moving on

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.080 
which we have seen before so moving on
to<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.890> software<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> right<00:01:05.790> hand<00:01:05.970> side

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to the software on the right hand side

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.760 
to the software on the right hand side
you<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.540> g3<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> left<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.740> have

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
you have the g3 and on the left you have

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.160 
you have the g3 and on the left you have
the<00:01:07.920> g2<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.729> definitely<00:01:09.450> seems<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> new

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the g2 it definitely seems like the new

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
the g2 it definitely seems like the new
software<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.830> less<00:01:11.070> cluttered<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.850> quite

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
software is less cluttered and not quite

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.120 
software is less cluttered and not quite
as<00:01:12.270> cartoonish<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> previous<00:01:13.470> version<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
as cartoonish as the previous version of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.499 
as cartoonish as the previous version of
course<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> will<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.790> running<00:01:15.000> kick<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
course it will be running kick out the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.120 
course it will be running kick out the
box<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.290> see<00:01:16.439> from<00:01:16.560> those<00:01:16.770> taskbar

box as you can see from those taskbar

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.580 
box as you can see from those taskbar
icons<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> I'm<00:01:18.360> sure<00:01:18.570> LG<00:01:18.960> will<00:01:19.110> bundle<00:01:19.350> in

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
icons and I'm sure LG will bundle in

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.170
