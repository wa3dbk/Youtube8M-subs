00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.420
 the icons are also known as 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.000
 tiles are these big icons here 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.320
 also known as tiles in the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.689
 windows 8 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.840
 the scenario that we had this one 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.490
 stop where all applications 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.250
 same click on the little picture had to click 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.189
 right click here and select 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.220
 all applications the option here 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.280
 right side and below by clicking here 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.670
 it's exactly the apps 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.610
 soccer city does not give you a choice 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.079
 sort here by by name or by more 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.520
 use 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.549
 there in windows 8.1 I already have this option 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.040
 here to sort by date 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.670
 most used installation category 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.020
 then this is also a novelty that 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.570
 I wanted to show you 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.960
 Let's go for another novelty, I'll stay. 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.450
 here that shows that the icons are from the area 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.979
 meter and the other novelty that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.830
 I wanted to show you exactly that. 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.860
 that the icons realize that 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.750
 they are larger in relation to the icons 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.200
 of windows 8 version 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.660
 I'm going back there on windows 8 note that 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.170
 they have the option to click the button 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.720
 only lower or higher right 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.300
 let's vote on windows 8 and another 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.250
 novelty you by clicking the 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.310
 right and gives you an option here is 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.540
 resize it gives you four options 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.940
 medium and small the small is 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.410
 much smaller than that of the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.230
 windows 8 version 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.870
 I have the option of the average that's it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.550
 would be the little né of the version of 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.150
 windows 8 wide which is great 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.190
 version of windows 8 and the big option that 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.370
 It's what was here. 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.420
 then this is another novelty of the 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.709
 windows 8 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.320
 another novelty from the appointment of the 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.600
 group of this block here for example 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.310
 right-clicking I have 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.209
 here to customize on the right side 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.540
 bottom 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:29.670
 then he already gives me the option given here O 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:32.370
 type a group name as it was 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.470
 done before on windows 8 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.570
 Let's go back there at the station with the windows 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.560
 8 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.480
 before naming a block had to stay 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.900
 here the lower bottom right 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.110
 this small arrow less here O would 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.540
 decrease all blocks and click 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.350
 right- click on the name 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.330
 group 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.220
 so I had all this work to 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.820
 give a name to a block for a group 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.450
 here from windows 8 applications then 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:07.739
 it was a facility a breakthrough in that 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.820
 in this new option of windows 8.1 we will 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.630
 return there on 8.1 show one more 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.220
 novelty 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.979
 look here in this finance icon 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.250
 Yeah, I gotta have a preview. 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:26.150
 some information that he is here from 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.150
 online way 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.150
 and you have how to enable or disable 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.520
 in windows 8.1 as clicking the button 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.470
 right down here you try to hang up 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.940
 dynamic block 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.360
 ready he does not bring more information 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.640
 online it simply fixes the icon 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.410
 The same thing happens through e-mail this 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.140
 here is already disabled just click with the 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.760
 right click and turn on the dynamic block 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.100
 He's going to show me here. 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.060
 the message I have in my box 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.740
 input 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.660
 as will enter the message will get you 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.360
 warning you then you click the button 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.260
 right to turn off the dynamic block 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.300
 ready 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.790
 ready turned off the dynamic block here 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.100
 so he will not be notifying here 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.850
 when there are changes 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.670
 there on windows 8 we no longer had 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.310
 this option only has the option of fixing 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.310
 said installed and decreased icon 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.080
 so another interesting novelty 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.980
 which is useful for sharing with you 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.720
