00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
hey guys just meet one of these CD

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.280 
hey guys just meet one of these CD
hovercraft<00:00:04.940> with<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.060> balloon<00:00:06.330> on<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.670> I

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
hovercraft with a balloon on it and I

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.320 
hovercraft with a balloon on it and I
often<00:00:10.290> get<00:00:10.469> questions<00:00:11.000> what<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.300> use

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
often get questions what can I use

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.450 
often get questions what can I use
instead<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.200> CD<00:00:13.469> for<00:00:14.340> half<00:00:14.730> my<00:00:15.030> projects

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
instead of a CD for half my projects

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.620 
instead of a CD for half my projects
because<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.820> admit<00:00:18.090> most<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.539> my

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
because I have to admit most of my

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.689 
because I have to admit most of my
projects<00:00:19.140> seem<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> involve<00:00:19.650> using<00:00:20.070> CDs<00:00:21.109> so

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
projects seem to involve using CDs so

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.400 
projects seem to involve using CDs so
I'll<00:00:23.699> use<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> piece<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.150> polystyrene<00:00:24.570> instead

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
I'll use a piece of polystyrene instead

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.450 
I'll use a piece of polystyrene instead
this<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.570> polystyrene<00:00:27.619> pizza<00:00:28.619> tray<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.400> I

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
this is a polystyrene pizza tray that I

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.870 
this is a polystyrene pizza tray that I
get<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:29.910> my<00:00:29.970> cheap<00:00:30.660> pizzas<00:00:31.520> you<00:00:32.520> don't<00:00:32.700> have

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
get with my cheap pizzas you don't have

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.760 
get with my cheap pizzas you don't have
to<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> polystyrene<00:00:33.600> Pizza<00:00:34.350> tray<00:00:34.559> any

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
to have a polystyrene Pizza tray any

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.540 
to have a polystyrene Pizza tray any
piece<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.570> polystyrene<00:00:36.570> sheet<00:00:37.320> will<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.739> in

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
piece of polystyrene sheet will do in

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.160 
piece of polystyrene sheet will do in
fact<00:00:38.820> there<00:00:38.940> may<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.239> disadvantage<00:00:39.450> with

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
fact there may be a disadvantage with

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.510 
fact there may be a disadvantage with
this<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.559> because<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.040> got<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.460> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
this one because it's got a bit of a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.630 
this one because it's got a bit of a
dish<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> middle<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:43.440> bows<00:00:43.739> up<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
dish in the middle of it it bows up and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
dish in the middle of it it bows up and
I<00:00:44.730> don't<00:00:44.820> know<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> will<00:00:45.390> help<00:00:45.690> or<00:00:46.260> hinder

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
I don't know if that will help or hinder

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.529 
I don't know if that will help or hinder
it<00:00:47.420> anyway<00:00:48.420> assuming<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.379> don't<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> CD

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
it anyway assuming you don't have a CD

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
it anyway assuming you don't have a CD
you<00:00:51.539> need<00:00:51.719> something<00:00:52.140> round<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.039> can

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
you need something round that you can

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:10.120 
you need something round that you can
draw<00:00:53.430> around<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.140> I've<00:00:55.140> got<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.410> dish

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.870 

cut<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.280> out

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
cut that out

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.160 
cut that out
and<00:01:12.120> we<00:01:12.210> need<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> hole<00:01:13.410> in<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.740> middle<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.100> well

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
and we need a hole in the middle as well

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.320 
and we need a hole in the middle as well
so<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.230> need<00:01:16.410> to<00:01:16.530> make<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> hole<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:18.000> I've<00:01:18.210> got

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
so I need to make a hole and I've got

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.219 
so I need to make a hole and I've got
another<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:18.930> bottle<00:01:19.710> tops<00:01:21.229> it's

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
another one of these bottle tops it's

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.200 
another one of these bottle tops it's
just<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.560> right<00:01:22.740> shape<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.430> put<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> balloon

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
just the right shape to put the balloon

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.260 
just the right shape to put the balloon
over<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.900> holds<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.260> in<00:01:25.380> place<00:01:26.270> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
over and it holds it in place and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.040 
over and it holds it in place and
that'll<00:01:27.600> go<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> middle<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:29.960> because<00:01:30.960> I

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
that'll go in the middle and because I

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.520 
that'll go in the middle and because I
usually<00:01:31.470> use<00:01:31.650> hot<00:01:32.160> blue<00:01:32.660> this<00:01:33.660> time<00:01:33.720> I'll<00:01:34.350> try

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
usually use hot blue this time I'll try

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
usually use hot blue this time I'll try
News<00:01:35.270> super<00:01:36.270> glue

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
News super glue

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
News super glue
I<00:01:36.840> don't<00:01:37.530> know<00:01:37.619> how<00:01:37.770> well<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.100> will<00:01:38.160> glue<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
I don't know how well it will glue that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.430 
I don't know how well it will glue that
type<00:01:39.300> of<00:01:39.450> plastic<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.170> type<00:01:40.410> of

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
type of plastic to that type of

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:55.650 
type of plastic to that type of
polystyrene<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:42.360> we'll<00:01:42.509> find<00:01:42.750> out

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:06.870 

so<00:01:56.660> that's<00:01:56.840> our<00:01:57.020> disk<00:02:01.450> hold<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.720> middle

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.080 

all<00:02:07.880> right<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.240> need<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.869> glue<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.260> on<00:02:09.470> these

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
all right I need to glue that on these

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.550 
all right I need to glue that on these
bottle<00:02:11.090> tops<00:02:11.360> have<00:02:11.570> often<00:02:11.870> got<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.050> rough<00:02:12.350> edge

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
bottle tops have often got a rough edge

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.660 
bottle tops have often got a rough edge
around<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.070> bottom<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:15.280> smooth<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.490> off

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
around the bottom so smooth that off

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:30.280 
around the bottom so smooth that off
with<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> bit<00:02:17.060> sandpaper<00:02:20.260> giggles<00:02:21.260> okay<00:02:29.260> put<00:02:30.260> a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
with a bit sandpaper giggles okay put a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.340 
with a bit sandpaper giggles okay put a
bit<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.500> pressure<00:02:30.560> right<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:32.080> get<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.200> in<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
bit of pressure right to get it in the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:43.460 
bit of pressure right to get it in the
right<00:02:33.530> place<00:02:35.080> okay<00:02:36.080> we<00:02:36.710> can<00:02:36.890> test<00:02:37.100> it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.920 

seems<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.250> work<00:02:44.280> almost<00:02:44.760> as<00:02:45.060> well<00:02:45.270> as<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.510> CD

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
seems to work almost as well as the CD

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.360 
seems to work almost as well as the CD
although<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.290> seems<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.620> dragging<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.220> bit

not<00:03:25.180> really

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.730 

I've<00:03:35.130> made<00:03:35.310> some<00:03:35.550> changes<00:03:36.210> I've<00:03:37.080> made<00:03:37.110> those

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
I've made some changes I've made those

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.830 
I've made some changes I've made those
slots<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.280> little<00:03:38.490> bit<00:03:38.610> deeper<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.330> don't<00:03:39.750> know

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
slots a little bit deeper I don't know

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.930 
slots a little bit deeper I don't know
if<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.110> makes<00:03:40.320> any<00:03:40.440> difference<00:03:40.760> I've<00:03:41.760> also

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
if that makes any difference I've also

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.960 
if that makes any difference I've also
taken<00:03:42.240> some<00:03:42.540> sandpaper<00:03:42.990> and<00:03:43.530> smooth

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
taken some sandpaper and smooth

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.050 
taken some sandpaper and smooth
the<00:03:45.150> outside<00:03:45.600> edge<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.580> give<00:03:47.580> us<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.790> slightly

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
the outside edge to give us a slightly

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.170 
the outside edge to give us a slightly
better<00:03:48.300> air<00:03:48.630> seal<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:50.400> I'm<00:03:50.490> using<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.880> smaller

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
better air seal and I'm using a smaller

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.170 
better air seal and I'm using a smaller
bloom<00:03:51.570> to<00:03:51.870> make<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:52.170> lighter<00:03:54.320> and<00:03:55.320> those

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
bloom to make it lighter and those

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.060 
bloom to make it lighter and those
orange<00:03:57.180> markings<00:03:57.990> there<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.500> indicate<00:03:58.620> where

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
orange markings there to indicate where

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:09.760 
orange markings there to indicate where
the<00:03:59.100> slots<00:03:59.490> are

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.900 

don't<00:04:10.770> know<00:04:10.860> if<00:04:10.950> any<00:04:11.069> of<00:04:11.220> those<00:04:11.310> changes<00:04:11.730> made

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
don't know if any of those changes made

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.370 
don't know if any of those changes made
any<00:04:12.090> difference<00:04:12.239> or<00:04:12.569> not<00:04:14.989> I'll<00:04:15.989> blow<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.290> up

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
any difference or not I'll blow it up

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:28.850 
any difference or not I'll blow it up
again<00:04:16.680> anyway<00:04:18.470> try<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.650> again

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.680 

well<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.890> think<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.220> went<00:04:30.370> better<00:04:31.980> summary<00:04:32.980> time

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
well I think it went better summary time

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.850 
well I think it went better summary time
does<00:04:34.690> it<00:04:34.720> work<00:04:35.050> yes<00:04:36.420> does<00:04:37.420> it<00:04:37.570> work<00:04:37.750> as<00:04:38.050> well<00:04:38.500> as

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
does it work yes does it work as well as

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.900 
does it work yes does it work as well as
a<00:04:39.100> CD<00:04:39.700> hovercraft<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:41.310> think<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.400> jury's<00:04:42.760> out

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
a CD hovercraft I think the jury's out

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.200 
a CD hovercraft I think the jury's out
on<00:04:42.970> that<00:04:43.120> probably<00:04:44.080> not<00:04:46.260> but<00:04:47.260> it<00:04:47.380> does<00:04:47.410> work<00:04:47.770> I

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
on that probably not but it does work I

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.180 
on that probably not but it does work I
don't<00:04:49.210> know<00:04:49.300> whether<00:04:49.480> those<00:04:49.750> air<00:04:50.260> vents<00:04:50.980> make

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
don't know whether those air vents make

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.670 
don't know whether those air vents make
any<00:04:51.370> difference<00:04:51.820> or<00:04:52.360> air<00:04:52.750> slots<00:04:53.230> make<00:04:53.470> any

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
any difference or air slots make any

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.900 
any difference or air slots make any
difference<00:04:54.040> at<00:04:54.160> all<00:04:55.170> but<00:04:56.170> certainly<00:04:56.910> running

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
difference at all but certainly running

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.300 
difference at all but certainly running
the<00:04:58.150> supp<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.690> sand<00:04:59.440> paper<00:04:59.650> around<00:04:59.980> the<00:05:00.100> edge

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
the supp the sand paper around the edge

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.610 
the supp the sand paper around the edge
to<00:05:00.340> smooth<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.090> edges<00:05:01.120> off<00:05:01.540> a<00:05:01.570> bit<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:02.080> think

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
to smooth the edges off a bit I think

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.310 
to smooth the edges off a bit I think
that's<00:05:02.950> helped<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:07.030> smaller<00:05:07.330> bloom<00:05:07.690> so

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
that's helped and a smaller bloom so

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.920 
that's helped and a smaller bloom so
it's<00:05:08.500> not<00:05:08.620> so<00:05:08.800> heavy
