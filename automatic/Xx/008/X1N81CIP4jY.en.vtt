00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
insane I've actually want to say a big

thanks<00:06:03.060> to<00:06:03.150> number<00:06:03.330> 1<00:06:03.449> boss<00:06:03.599> as<00:06:03.810> well<00:06:05.479> because

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
thanks to number 1 boss as well because

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:07.550 
thanks to number 1 boss as well because
he's<00:06:06.930> helped<00:06:07.169> her<00:06:07.259> grow<00:06:07.349> my<00:06:07.529> channel

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
he's helped her grow my channel

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.079 
he's helped her grow my channel
obviously<00:06:08.159> as<00:06:08.250> well<00:06:08.430> without<00:06:08.669> him<00:06:08.969> I<00:06:09.029> don't

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.089 
obviously as well without him I don't

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:10.369 
obviously as well without him I don't
think<00:06:09.389> it<00:06:09.479> would<00:06:09.569> be<00:06:09.629> anywhere<00:06:09.900> near<00:06:10.050> Roseau

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379 
think it would be anywhere near Roseau

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.290 
think it would be anywhere near Roseau
so<00:06:10.949> if<00:06:11.339> he's<00:06:11.520> watching<00:06:11.669> I<00:06:11.909> don't<00:06:12.089> think<00:06:12.240> he

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
so if he's watching I don't think he

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.420 
so if he's watching I don't think he
probably<00:06:12.419> is<00:06:12.690> but<00:06:12.979> some<00:06:13.979> of<00:06:14.039> you<00:06:14.129> may<00:06:14.219> know<00:06:14.279> who
