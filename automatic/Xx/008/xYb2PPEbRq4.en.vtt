out<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.669> looking<00:00:33.510> at<00:00:33.629> this<00:00:33.720> board<00:00:34.019> we're<00:00:34.470> gonna

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
out so looking at this board we're gonna

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.910 
out so looking at this board we're gonna
start<00:00:34.949> with<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:36.149> RC<00:00:36.960> technology<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.680> rst

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
start with the RC technology and rst

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.740 
start with the RC technology and rst
technology<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.640> rocker<00:00:39.180> camber

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
technology is just rocker camber

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.510 
technology is just rocker camber
technology<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.770> we've<00:00:40.980> got<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> rocker

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
technology that's we've got the rocker

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
technology that's we've got the rocker
between<00:00:42.000> your<00:00:42.450> feet<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:43.350> you've<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.559> camber

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
between your feet then you've got camber

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.790 
between your feet then you've got camber
near<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:44.399> feet<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.809> transitions<00:00:46.469> into

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
near your feet and that transitions into
