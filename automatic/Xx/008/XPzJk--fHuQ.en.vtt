not know how to do a full rapper on my

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.880 
not know how to do a full rapper on my
head<00:05:04.880> whether<00:05:05.660> it's<00:05:05.900> with<00:05:06.020> my<00:05:06.200> natural<00:05:06.770> hair

head whether it's with my natural hair
with<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.250> lead<00:05:07.430> I've<00:05:07.930> tried<00:05:08.930> so<00:05:08.960> hard<00:05:09.260> to

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
with the lead I've tried so hard to

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.370 
with the lead I've tried so hard to
learn<00:05:09.830> and<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:11.210> just<00:05:11.270> didn't<00:05:11.900> work<00:05:11.990> out<00:05:12.170> for<00:05:12.230> me

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
learn and it just didn't work out for me

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.950 
learn and it just didn't work out for me
so<00:05:12.680> this<00:05:12.920> method<00:05:13.250> has<00:05:13.700> just<00:05:14.690> been<00:05:16.120> easier<00:05:17.120> it's

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
so this method has just been easier it's

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.710 
so this method has just been easier it's
the<00:05:18.170> same<00:05:18.410> result<00:05:18.920> same<00:05:19.280> effect<00:05:19.640> gets<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.510> job

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
the same result same effect gets the job

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.010 
the same result same effect gets the job
done<00:05:21.010> so<00:05:22.030> if<00:05:23.030> you<00:05:23.120> don't<00:05:23.330> like<00:05:23.480> using<00:05:23.750> the

done so if you don't like using the

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.320 
done so if you don't like using the
bobby<00:05:24.230> pins<00:05:24.590> you<00:05:25.250> can<00:05:25.280> still<00:05:25.730> use<00:05:26.000> them<00:05:26.120> to

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
bobby pins you can still use them to

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.560 
bobby pins you can still use them to
attach<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:27.620> you<00:05:27.860> can<00:05:28.130> come<00:05:28.880> under<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.420> then

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
attach and you can come under and then

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.940 
attach and you can come under and then
like<00:05:30.880> pull<00:05:31.880> them<00:05:32.060> out<00:05:32.180> I<00:05:32.240> guess<00:05:32.860> actually<00:05:33.860> all

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
like pull them out I guess actually all

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.650 
like pull them out I guess actually all
know<00:05:34.100> how<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.250> do<00:05:34.520> that<00:05:34.730> because<00:05:34.940> these<00:05:35.450> will

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
know how you do that because these will

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.360 
know how you do that because these will
be<00:05:35.810> under<00:05:36.080> here<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:36.530> you<00:05:36.680> can't<00:05:36.950> get<00:05:37.040> them<00:05:37.220> out

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
be under here and you can't get them out

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.090 
be under here and you can't get them out
so<00:05:38.020> what<00:05:39.020> guess<00:05:39.170> you<00:05:39.290> have<00:05:39.440> these<00:05:39.560> value<00:05:39.920> minus

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
so what guess you have these value minus

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.400 
so what guess you have these value minus
one<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.580> mean<00:05:41.510> if<00:05:41.570> your<00:05:41.690> hair<00:05:41.810> is<00:05:41.840> really<00:05:42.230> long

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
one I mean if your hair is really long

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.020 
one I mean if your hair is really long
maybe<00:05:43.010> you<00:05:43.130> wouldn't<00:05:43.340> have<00:05:43.430> to<00:05:43.550> because<00:05:43.940> you

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
maybe you wouldn't have to because you

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.860 
maybe you wouldn't have to because you
