00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.049
 hola como estan this writing 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.010
 novel is very good the triumph of 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:16.689
 I'm super chopped love, take advantage of it better 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.540
 It's wide to record this because I've 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.700
 seen that they have written to me asking 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.160
 much much much much much much about something 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.020
 to remove the frizz from the hair and the 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.210
 end of the hair I usually say 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.189
 it is done many of us have the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.210
 hair and as well as that very porous very 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.940
 all right 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.980
 I curse and then I say that's why it's 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.900
 well true but also many times 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.690
 we do not help our hair 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.000
 we do not dry it well but you spend the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.520
 dryer that others explained that is passed 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.880
 a dryer and you feel that it is already 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.280
 dry but surprise you go out and everything about 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.790
 here from inside of pegadito al tuco what 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.010
 scalp is not totally dry and with 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.390
 the sun and obviously the seer or lahar and 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.170
 all that starts to come out and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 precisely a vapor and that steam 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.540
 it is done here it is here and the sources 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.159
 well yes super lists well then my 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.780
 greatest advice on which side you fall super 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.710
 well they make sure super well with their 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.229
 dryer I tell you what is not 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.200
 more the most important thing to get this 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.780
 a well-formed hairstyle is the root that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.259
 it's really dry ok then that's what 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.240
 the other is going to suit you the other is that 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.920
 you can apply after bathing have 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.530
 an applicator a spray with 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.180
 I say put him before you get to bathe him 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.450
 tantito put a lot of mineral water or 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450
 Water 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.429
 I do not know how to say what we call 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.810
 something mineral the water gasified water of 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:54.960
 spring this club soda I made him in usa 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.350
 I do not know well the rice ones 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.350
 so many 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.560
 you supposedly avoid being offered 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.659
 both the hair and the other is to use 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.729
 treatments truth I'm fascinated 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.070
 He had told them of oil 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.040
 argan or oil of morocco the wall that 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:17.290
 not me that is also a tree oil 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.420
 of argan that is in morocco this that 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.000
 I had already achieved it, not like that in the 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.650
 droplets I really love them but they are 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.890
 droplets and it is for after drying you 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.070
 I put hair or you're inside 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.950
 droplets and mousse true and I applied it 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.890
 in good hair this one I now 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.920
 I found the whole kit or it's part of the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.390
 drops I found the shampoo 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.239
 good that conditioner this is the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.290
 shampoo that has served me very well and 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.329
 apart from an intensive mask 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.920
 hair tabulator is that I 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.659
 it worked a lot very well this one if you did not 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.879
 You can buy everything and say I'm there 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.579
 Well, it 's that I and I can not 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.739
 buy everything better later if I 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.859
 works very well station point the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.870
 true yes of the four things that 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:11.739
 are these two the oil and the mask 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.000
 reconstructive mask for you 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.370
 hair not the mask the mask 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.400
 reconstructive I would recommend that you 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.579
 you stay with this one 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.390
 because this is because it's great because 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.829
 as those whom we painted on 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.209
 hair we have our hair with 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.090
 box teeth now that inside 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.750
 something like that comes a conditioner 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.549
 maybe you ching because they do not see it in the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.040
 body of nothing is gross you put it 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.439
 There are hundreds of enrico your hair in the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.319
 sprinkler you slip on what it does for 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.989
 nice that day and this little boat that is 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.269
 as for four days you use it but that 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.730
 if you take care of it and that you love it and that it 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.690
 would fascinate that they sold it truthfully and 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.400
 here I have another this good is this is there 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.579
 tell what this is so that is is the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.030
 effect that leaves you apart this this 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.379
 rest of your hair you take it off there I 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.609
 you take it off in the shower, I really 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.280
 what do I do sometimes that claw 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.760
 bit 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.540
 it is very creamy little and just when 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.600
 me mus or my bus for hair that 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.459
 also be the foam I mix it and I 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.340
 I put in my hair and it looks nice to me 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.900
 I like it a lot so much I like the 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.080
 consistency that I have left and then 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.030
 it's good for my little horse this super 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.970
 recommended this is understood saline 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.300
 it's a is not exclusive of it went out there what 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.840

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.240
 this 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.300
 I had the opportunity to go to the USA and 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.699
 I have also seen them in the moll in these 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.160
 carts for mice that sell things 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:49.720
 in the middle of the furniture and I've seen that 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:53.530
 they sell this this one and only brand 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.200
 arian today so it's called ok be I here 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.680
 in Mexico they buy salt 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.920
 and then the club soda and the way then 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.110
 they buy it in a supermarket and the 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.670
