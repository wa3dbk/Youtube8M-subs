system now the new of that

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.140 
system now the new of that
so<00:02:49.769> let's<00:02:50.120> first<00:02:51.560> figure<00:02:52.560> out<00:02:52.739> how<00:02:53.400> long<00:02:53.819> we

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
so let's first figure out how long we

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.050 
so let's first figure out how long we
need<00:02:54.329> to<00:02:54.569> have<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:55.049> adjusted<00:02:55.760> from<00:02:56.760> this

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
need to have this adjusted from this

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.030 
need to have this adjusted from this
washer<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.069> shoulder<00:03:00.739> because<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.769> need

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
washer to this shoulder because you need

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.870 
washer to this shoulder because you need
to<00:03:02.519> have<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.180> just<00:03:03.450> slightly<00:03:04.019> slightly

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
to have this just slightly slightly

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.960 
to have this just slightly slightly
shorter<00:03:05.880> than<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.690> depth<00:03:07.349> of<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.519> end<00:03:08.700> pin

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
shorter than the depth of the end pin

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.840 
shorter than the depth of the end pin
Jack<00:03:09.299> so<00:03:10.139> that<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.709> little<00:03:11.160> nut<00:03:11.400> washer

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
Jack so that this little nut washer

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.360 
Jack so that this little nut washer
combination<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:13.410> something<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.859> push<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.250> in

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
combination have something to push it in

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.120 
combination have something to push it in
it's<00:03:14.489> got<00:03:14.639> something<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.120> tighten<00:03:15.540> against<00:03:16.130> so

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
it's got something to tighten against so

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.780 
it's got something to tighten against so
we<00:03:17.819> make<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.299> little<00:03:18.540> hook<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.459> end<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:20.670> our

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
we make a little hook in the end of our

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.599 
we make a little hook in the end of our
wire<00:03:22.010> feed<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.130> through<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.370> hole

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
wire feed it through the hole

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.750 
wire feed it through the hole
oops<00:03:23.970> looks<00:03:24.359> too<00:03:24.510> big<00:03:25.220> make<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> really<00:03:26.579> little

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
oops looks too big make a really little

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.979 
oops looks too big make a really little
hook<00:03:28.220> try<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.280> make<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.639> nice<00:03:29.790> crisp<00:03:30.329> crisp

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
hook try to make it a nice crisp crisp

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.009 
hook try to make it a nice crisp crisp
Bend<00:03:32.780> right<00:03:33.780> angles<00:03:35.480> stick<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.660> through<00:03:36.870> the

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
Bend right angles stick that through the

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:45.229 
Bend right angles stick that through the
hole<00:03:37.200> pull<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:40.010> there<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:43.549> length<00:03:44.549> that

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
hole pull and there is the length that

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.789 
hole pull and there is the length that
we<00:03:45.359> need<00:03:45.389> to<00:03:45.630> adjust<00:03:46.819> this<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:49.260> currently

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
we need to adjust this to and currently

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.490 
we need to adjust this to and currently
it's<00:03:50.069> quite<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.370> bit<00:03:50.549> too<00:03:50.730> long<00:03:50.970> if<00:03:51.299> there's<00:03:52.260> too

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
it's quite a bit too long if there's too

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.449 
it's quite a bit too long if there's too
much<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.799> this<00:03:52.889> sticking<00:03:53.280> out<00:03:53.489> if<00:03:55.069> if<00:03:56.069> this

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
much of this sticking out if if this

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.960 
much of this sticking out if if this
adjustment<00:03:57.090> needs<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.049> go<00:03:58.170> this<00:03:58.349> way<00:03:58.970> if

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
adjustment needs to go this way if

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.839 
adjustment needs to go this way if
there's<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.720> too<00:04:01.139> much<00:04:01.319> of<00:04:01.500> this

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
there's so that too much of this

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.460 
there's so that too much of this
larger-diameter<00:04:02.849> sticking<00:04:03.569> out<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:04.260> won't

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
larger-diameter sticking out you won't

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.250 
larger-diameter sticking out you won't
be<00:04:04.590> able<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:04.950> tighten<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:06.269> jack<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.780> place<00:04:07.019> in

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
be able to tighten the jack and place in

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.379 
be able to tighten the jack and place in
a<00:04:07.319> spin<00:04:07.739> if<00:04:08.299> it's<00:04:09.299> too<00:04:09.660> little<00:04:10.560> if<00:04:10.919> we<00:04:11.880> just<00:04:12.180> is

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
a spin if it's too little if we just is

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.380 
a spin if it's too little if we just is
not<00:04:12.569> too<00:04:12.810> far<00:04:13.109> this<00:04:13.319> way<00:04:13.380> so<00:04:13.620> there's<00:04:13.920> too

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
not too far this way so there's too

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.430 
not too far this way so there's too
this<00:04:14.950> larger-diameter<00:04:15.950> barrel<00:04:17.140> we<00:04:18.140> will<00:04:18.260> be

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
this larger-diameter barrel we will be

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.650 
this larger-diameter barrel we will be
able<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.769> fit<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:19.760> tighten<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.239> nut<00:04:20.450> and

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
able to fit and tighten the nut and

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.450 
able to fit and tighten the nut and
washer<00:04:20.810> early<00:04:21.260> in<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.040> need<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.310> get

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
washer early in so you need to get

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.720 
washer early in so you need to get
pretty<00:04:22.730> close<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:24.650> lot<00:04:24.830> of<00:04:24.920> times<00:04:25.160> it<00:04:25.490> takes

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
pretty close and a lot of times it takes

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:32.470 
pretty close and a lot of times it takes
a<00:04:25.880> couple<00:04:26.090> of<00:04:26.240> tries<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:28.340> currently<00:04:30.100> we're<00:04:31.480> an

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
a couple of tries so currently we're an

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.970 
a couple of tries so currently we're an
eighth<00:04:32.870> of<00:04:33.020> an<00:04:33.140> inch<00:04:33.460> -<00:04:34.460> too<00:04:35.150> long

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
eighth of an inch - too long

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.940 
eighth of an inch - too long
so<00:04:37.340> we<00:04:37.850> just<00:04:39.340> turn<00:04:40.340> this<00:04:40.670> nut<00:04:41.290> about<00:04:42.290> that<00:04:42.680> much

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
so we just turn this nut about that much

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.780 
so we just turn this nut about that much
I<00:04:44.320> like<00:04:45.320> it<00:04:45.350> if<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:45.920> have<00:04:46.070> something<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.430> jam

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
I like it if I have something to jam

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.490 
I like it if I have something to jam
against<00:04:47.420> like<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:48.080> do<00:04:48.140> here<00:04:49.930> push<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.110> washers

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
against like I do here push the washers

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.000 
against like I do here push the washers
back<00:04:51.740> down<00:04:53.800> check<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:55.070> leg<00:04:56.060> thing<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:57.010> can

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
back down check the leg thing I can

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.160 
back down check the leg thing I can
start<00:04:58.280> where<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:59.480> they<00:04:59.570> want<00:04:59.780> to<00:04:59.810> have<00:04:59.990> that

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
start where and they want to have that

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.400 
start where and they want to have that
in<00:05:00.260> place<00:05:00.290> okay<00:05:00.890> I<00:05:00.920> think<00:05:01.070> we<00:05:01.280> got<00:05:01.310> about<00:05:01.700> right

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
in place okay I think we got about right

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.880 
in place okay I think we got about right
about<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:03.680> same<00:05:03.980> length<00:05:05.320> like<00:05:06.320> I<00:05:06.440> said<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.680> lot

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
about the same length like I said a lot

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.350 
about the same length like I said a lot
of<00:05:06.950> times<00:05:07.130> it<00:05:07.340> takes<00:05:07.490> more<00:05:07.850> than<00:05:07.910> one<00:05:08.120> try

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
of times it takes more than one try

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.470 
of times it takes more than one try
we've<00:05:09.290> got<00:05:09.560> our<00:05:09.710> jack

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
we've got our jack

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.430 
we've got our jack
we're<00:05:11.480> ready<00:05:11.660> to<00:05:11.780> feed<00:05:11.990> it<00:05:12.110> through<00:05:12.760> clearly

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
we're ready to feed it through clearly

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.100 
we're ready to feed it through clearly
we<00:05:15.440> need<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.740> stick<00:05:16.460> this<00:05:16.640> piece<00:05:16.880> of<00:05:17.030> wire<00:05:17.210> in

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
we need to stick this piece of wire in

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.290 
we need to stick this piece of wire in
through<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.680> jack<00:05:19.480> hold<00:05:20.480> down<00:05:21.410> here<00:05:22.150> feed<00:05:23.150> it

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
through the jack hold down here feed it

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:33.460 
through the jack hold down here feed it
through<00:05:23.330> until<00:05:24.050> we<00:05:24.200> can<00:05:24.410> catch<00:05:24.830> you<00:05:32.290> should<00:05:33.290> be

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
through until we can catch you should be

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.670 
through until we can catch you should be
doing<00:05:33.680> on<00:05:33.860> them<00:05:34.040> yeah<00:05:34.600> call<00:05:35.600> my<00:05:35.810> braces<00:05:36.410> it<00:05:36.560> all

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
doing on them yeah call my braces it all

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:45.490
