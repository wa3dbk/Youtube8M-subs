on<00:00:27.869> my<00:00:27.960> Vegas<00:00:28.260> Nick<00:00:28.529> Cannon<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.970> that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
on my Vegas Nick Cannon and on that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.060 
on my Vegas Nick Cannon and on that
really<00:00:30.869> really<00:00:30.990> powerful<00:00:31.140> gun<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:31.920> like

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
really really powerful gun really like

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.190 
really really powerful gun really like
it<00:00:32.279> rips<00:00:32.550> apart<00:00:32.669> armor<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.570> hulls<00:00:33.719> really

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
it rips apart armor and hulls really

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.530 
it rips apart armor and hulls really
easily<00:00:34.469> I've<00:00:34.920> chucked<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.640> laser<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.210> Peters

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
easily I've chucked to laser of Peters

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.229 
easily I've chucked to laser of Peters
on<00:00:37.050> her<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.770> her<00:00:37.980> wings<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.879> think<00:00:39.180> this

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
on her on her wings and I think this

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.389 
on her on her wings and I think this
gives<00:00:39.390> her<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> later<00:00:39.780> sustain<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.590> means<00:00:41.190> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
gives her a later sustain and means that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.250 
gives her a later sustain and means that
in<00:00:42.059> bad<00:00:42.270> was<00:00:42.420> swarmed<00:00:42.840> she<00:00:42.930> doesn't<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.200> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
in bad was swarmed she doesn't have to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
in bad was swarmed she doesn't have to
worry<00:00:43.290> about<00:00:43.469> ammo<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.760> toying<00:00:45.030> with

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
worry about ammo and I was toying with

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.130 
worry about ammo and I was toying with
the<00:00:45.300> idea<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.690> giving<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.050> her<00:00:46.670> size<00:00:47.670> 1

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
the idea of giving in her size 1

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.170 
the idea of giving in her size 1
ballistic<00:00:49.140> cannons<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.910> longsword<00:00:50.910> moines

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
ballistic cannons the longsword moines

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.080 
ballistic cannons the longsword moines
and<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.500> mean<00:00:52.649> she<00:00:52.800> runs<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.039> family<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.789> she

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and but I mean she runs a family and she

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.279 
and but I mean she runs a family and she
can<00:00:54.210> survive<00:00:54.420> quite<00:00:54.719> long<00:00:54.899> cuz<00:00:55.050> she's<00:00:55.170> got

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
can survive quite long cuz she's got

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.290 
can survive quite long cuz she's got
that<00:00:55.350> 220<00:00:55.770> speed<00:00:56.039> which<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.550> relatively<00:00:57.059> good

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
that 220 speed which is relatively good

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
that 220 speed which is relatively good
for<00:00:57.390> outrunning<00:00:57.660> most<00:00:57.899> ships<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.590> that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
for outrunning most ships and that

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.080 
for outrunning most ships and that
aren't<00:00:59.579> super<00:00:59.940> fast<00:01:00.120> I've<00:01:00.989> also<00:01:01.199> given<00:01:01.530> her

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
so that's pressing ctrl-c a few is a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.979 
so that's pressing ctrl-c a few is a
mouse<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.519> keyboard<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.299> that<00:03:42.480> all<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.720> the

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
mouse and keyboard so that all of the

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.170 
mouse and keyboard so that all of the
guns<00:03:43.709> fire<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.100> same<00:03:44.250> direction<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:45.000> have

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
guns fire in the same direction you have

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.259 
guns fire in the same direction you have
that<00:03:45.500> 220<00:03:46.500> speed<00:03:46.860> which<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.430> faster<00:03:47.850> than<00:03:48.090> a

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
that 220 speed which is faster than a

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.150 
that 220 speed which is faster than a
lot<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.660> ships<00:03:48.900> it's<00:03:49.260> faster<00:03:49.620> than<00:03:49.709> pretty

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
lot of ships it's faster than pretty

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.350 
lot of ships it's faster than pretty
much<00:03:50.250> all<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.580> ships<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.820> aren't<00:03:51.120> built

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
much all the ships that aren't built

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.509 
much all the ships that aren't built
this<00:03:51.780> week<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.200> because<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:52.799> that<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.070> have<00:03:53.220> a

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
this week and because of that you have a

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.520 
this week and because of that you have a
great<00:03:53.760> just

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
great just

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.020 
great just
I can<00:03:55.800> track<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.220> are<00:03:56.310> getting<00:03:56.520> much<00:03:56.640> easier

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
I can track it are getting much easier

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.020 
I can track it are getting much easier
and<00:03:57.209> with<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:58.319> with<00:03:59.040> both<00:03:59.400> weapons<00:03:59.670> and

speed<00:04:20.310> it's<00:04:20.730> just<00:04:20.880> fucking<00:04:21.060> great<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:22.079> it

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
speed it's just fucking great and it it

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.680 
speed it's just fucking great and it it
out<00:04:22.710> at<00:04:23.160> speeds<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.820> most<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.300> other<00:04:24.480> ships

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
out at speeds of most of the other ships

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.330 
out at speeds of most of the other ships
that<00:04:24.780> aren't<00:04:24.990> built<00:04:25.169> for<00:04:25.230> speed<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.770> just<00:04:26.220> I

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
that aren't built for speed I just I

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.460 
that aren't built for speed I just I
really<00:04:26.490> like<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.389> would<00:04:27.930> like<00:04:28.140> it<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.380> be

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
really like it and I would like it to be

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.380 
really like it and I would like it to be
faster<00:04:28.950> but<00:04:29.130> I'd<00:04:29.490> like<00:04:29.700> all<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.090> ships<00:04:30.240> to

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
faster but I'd like all of the ships to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.610 
faster but I'd like all of the ships to
be<00:04:30.450> faster<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:30.900> flight<00:04:31.140> because<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.560> gives

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
be faster that I flight because it gives

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.800 
be faster that I flight because it gives
me<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.830> advantage<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:33.120> way<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.270> pay<00:04:33.570> is

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
me the advantage and the way I pay is

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.409 
me the advantage and the way I pay is
very<00:04:33.990> much<00:04:34.140> sweepy<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:34.890> i<00:04:35.610> think<00:04:35.910> one<00:04:36.060> swoop

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
very much sweepy and i think one swoop

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.900 
very much sweepy and i think one swoop
in<00:04:36.600> try<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.560> kill<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.710> target<00:04:38.130> if<00:04:38.669> we<00:04:38.730> don't

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
in try and kill a target if we don't

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.730 
in try and kill a target if we don't
kill<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.240> my<00:04:39.780> break<00:04:40.020> off<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.320> either<00:04:40.440> let<00:04:40.620> my

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
kill it my break off and either let my

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.990 
kill it my break off and either let my
teammate<00:04:41.040> kill<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:43.010> will<00:04:44.010> run<00:04:44.190> or<00:04:44.610> just<00:04:44.790> engage

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
teammate kill it will run or just engage

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.350 
teammate kill it will run or just engage
and<00:04:45.510> try<00:04:45.630> something<00:04:45.870> else<00:04:46.610> well<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.210> other

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
and try something else well so the other

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.080 
and try something else well so the other
major<00:04:48.660> thing<00:04:49.500> on<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:49.979> field<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.640> I<00:04:50.669> really

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
major thing on this field that I really

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.240 
major thing on this field that I really
really<00:04:51.330> really<00:04:51.360> really<00:04:51.660> fuckin<00:04:52.110> like<00:04:52.229> is<00:04:52.620> the

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
really really really fuckin like is the

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.010 
really really really fuckin like is the
cluster<00:04:53.610> missals<00:04:53.729> these<00:04:54.270> girls<00:04:54.570> tumor<00:04:54.780> cells

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
cluster missals these girls tumor cells

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.550 
cluster missals these girls tumor cells
are<00:04:55.229> sick<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:56.450> you<00:04:57.450> can<00:04:57.600> lock<00:04:57.690> on<00:04:57.870> around<00:04:58.169> like

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
are sick and you can lock on around like

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.740 
are sick and you can lock on around like
4k<00:04:59.160> away<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.460> think<00:04:59.550> it's<00:04:59.910> quite<00:05:00.060> right<00:05:00.600> long

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
4k away I think it's quite right long

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.310 
4k away I think it's quite right long
distance<00:05:01.050> for<00:05:01.169> a<00:05:01.229> lock<00:05:01.700> but<00:05:02.700> you're<00:05:03.660> not<00:05:03.960> gonna

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
distance for a lock but you're not gonna

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.570 
distance for a lock but you're not gonna
bout<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:04.680> kill<00:05:04.830> anything<00:05:05.040> about<00:05:05.310> rent<00:05:05.490> you

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
bout to kill anything about rent you

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.820 
bout to kill anything about rent you
need<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:05.790> be<00:05:05.880> about<00:05:06.030> two<00:05:06.419> kilometers<00:05:06.900> away<00:05:06.990> and

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
need to be about two kilometers away and

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.830 
need to be about two kilometers away and
then<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.790> just<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.180> just<00:05:09.210> kill<00:05:09.510> whatever<00:05:09.690> you

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
then you just you just kill whatever you

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.360 
then you just you just kill whatever you
target<00:05:10.200> let's<00:05:10.410> go<00:05:10.590> somewhere<00:05:10.800> let's<00:05:11.190> have<00:05:11.340> a

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
target let's go somewhere let's have a

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.210 
target let's go somewhere let's have a
show<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:12.150> show<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.560> five<00:05:13.560> clunkers<00:05:13.890> way<00:05:14.010> I

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
show to show you five clunkers way I

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.210 
show to show you five clunkers way I
should<00:05:14.460> have<00:05:14.580> to<00:05:14.729> lock<00:05:14.910> on<00:05:15.120> full<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:16.680> I<00:05:17.070> think

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
should have to lock on full and I think
