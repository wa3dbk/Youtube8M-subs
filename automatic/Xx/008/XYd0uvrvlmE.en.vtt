00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
little feature my conclusion with the

little feature my conclusion with the
rifle<00:02:52.849> I<00:02:52.969> did<00:02:53.180> take<00:02:53.449> it<00:02:53.599> down<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:54.049> a<00:02:54.079> place

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
rifle I did take it down to a place

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.800 
rifle I did take it down to a place
where<00:02:54.769> I<00:02:54.799> have<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> lot<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.340> open<00:02:56.239> space<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.750> could

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
where I have a lot of open space I could

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.530 
where I have a lot of open space I could
shoot<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.139> lot<00:02:57.319> I<00:02:57.590> found<00:02:58.159> that<00:02:58.280> it's<00:02:58.430> very<00:02:58.730> very

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
shoot a lot I found that it's very very

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.339 
shoot a lot I found that it's very very
effective<00:02:59.870> up<00:03:00.409> to<00:03:00.469> about<00:03:01.069> 50<00:03:01.459> feet<00:03:01.699> and<00:03:02.169> I<00:03:03.169> mean

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
effective up to about 50 feet and I mean

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.470 
effective up to about 50 feet and I mean
like<00:03:03.530> pinpoint<00:03:04.430> accuracy<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:05.120> could<00:03:05.329> hit<00:03:05.419> a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
like pinpoint accuracy I could hit a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.259 
like pinpoint accuracy I could hit a
quarter<00:03:05.900> or<00:03:05.989> so<00:03:06.169> at<00:03:06.349> that<00:03:06.500> range<00:03:07.239> consistently

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
quarter or so at that range consistently

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.750 
quarter or so at that range consistently
and<00:03:08.650> then<00:03:09.650> once<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.129> gets<00:03:10.280> out<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.430> about<00:03:10.699> a

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
and then once it gets out to about a

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.699 
and then once it gets out to about a
hundred<00:03:11.209> that's<00:03:11.629> when<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:11.959> start<00:03:12.199> pushing

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
hundred that's when you start pushing

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.429 
hundred that's when you start pushing
and<00:03:13.430> pushing<00:03:13.639> the<00:03:13.909> consisting<00:03:14.419> of<00:03:14.449> it<00:03:14.840> at<00:03:15.379> a

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:15.439 
and pushing the consisting of it at a

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.689 
and pushing the consisting of it at a
hundred<00:03:15.739> feet<00:03:15.919> you<00:03:16.099> could<00:03:16.250> probably<00:03:16.400> get<00:03:16.669> a

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:16.699 
hundred feet you could probably get a

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.140 
hundred feet you could probably get a
three<00:03:17.389> or<00:03:17.479> four<00:03:17.659> inch<00:03:18.430> grouping<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.609> that's

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
three or four inch grouping and that's

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.390 
three or four inch grouping and that's
not<00:03:20.359> too<00:03:20.569> bad<00:03:20.780> considering<00:03:21.199> it's<00:03:21.799> considering

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
not too bad considering it's considering

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.099 
not too bad considering it's considering
the<00:03:22.489> round<00:03:22.699> is<00:03:22.879> fairly<00:03:23.540> small<00:03:24.079> and<00:03:24.759> that's<00:03:25.759> my

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
the round is fairly small and that's my

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.659 
the round is fairly small and that's my
conclusions<00:03:27.109> about<00:03:27.229> the<00:03:27.439> Crossman<00:03:27.859> tip<00:03:28.009> 77
