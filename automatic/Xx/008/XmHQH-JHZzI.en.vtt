00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.600
 I'm no gameplay I'm not 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.150
 commenting on none of that because I'm 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.250
 answering some subscribers that 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.770
 they also wanted to start from youtube and 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.900
 they did not want to start with the capturing and 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.120
 all that and wanting to start recording 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.910
 I placed on the computer and they wanted 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.550
 ask me they wanted to know we were 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.400
 what was the best solution to record 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.920
 the pc screen without wanted the afi 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.200
 all that and well here I show you what 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.950
 I use that is the catcher that is 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.430
 this program 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.800
 that we are going to open it will seem like that and 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.050
 you can download videos you can see everything 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.300
 that with our program and the screen 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.440
 record in this present here you appear 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.050
 what is to record the screen of the 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.090
 the PC computer and any 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.400
 window as you can see in station 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.559
 of a window, if you click, you have to 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.270
 select the window you want 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.030
 record well would be that of the game by 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.010
 example should trace to area is the air 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.010
 what you want is just then record by 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.000
 example choose you leave this is for 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.920
 example if you want to record all the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.920
 screen them click on the top corner 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.619
 and it 's like I finished the dimensions of what 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.690
 that has been selected and you choose 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.990
 corner another corner click and it's 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.580
 selected after we can also 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.380
 how to select audio source here 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.850
 you can fill in the micro with which 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.770
 do you want to record it continues to work with 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.690
 micro me for example I have this disk 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.910
 I'm recording and good in general 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.520
 what is it that brings you then 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.140
 also the output format that we are going 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.440
 where the video is in the format of 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.910
 windows media video this format is by 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.409
 defect you come and in this program and 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.469
 no then change 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.420
 all the videos will come out like this then if 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.549
 wants to change them another format 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.549
 have to buy to buy 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.219
 another program to change format 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.950
 and all that is an output folder 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.560
 means where it will be saved for 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.289
 give here here to choose in what 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.410
 folder and I for example in my case the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.720
 desktop avoids the petite technique 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.220
 then I choose my folder they also have 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.040
 other options as are the options of 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.110
 capture and having after 160 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.690
 seconds if the click like this has 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.950
 multiplied means that in 60 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.299
 seconds in which you choose by 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.329
 example 40 or 50 or those that are the ones 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.459
 you choose after that the 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.250
 video and will be with a minute of 40 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.930
 seconds of what you put 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.790
 and then also other options for 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.890
 science after five seconds that 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.320
 also when five seconds pass 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.120
 since you give when you start is when 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.370
 I started recording is in another option that 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.440
 it's also pretty good at minimizing 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.690
 to start means that if you do not have 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.880
 explained feels selected 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.370
 it means that you just give it to start 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.250
 this tab will be like this will remain 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.930
 only what is selected that is 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.220
 it seems to me that it's pretty good 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.230
 I have my what I'm recording now 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.900
 it goes pretty well then to treat the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.820
 cursor structure what you want 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.950
 follow the mouse and follow the mouse this 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.200
 is a little different already means that you 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.270
 it focuses a little what this approach it 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.739
 what is the mouse and what are you going 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.200
 following as it is displacing you what 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.380
 is following the camera then you a 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.570
 hot cakes means that you use this 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.510
 means that this option is for example 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.390
 to start would be efe 7 to stop 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.430
 Efe 8 and to play Efe 9 and you 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.080
 windows as you can see is so that this 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.180
 top part of the I also recorded 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.160
 and it 's that easy when you finish 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.110
 record you go to the folder you're in and 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.940
 you will have a windows video file 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.740
 half video so easy and simple 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.020
 I hope you liked it but that 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.350
 it would be very helpful and good until the 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.350
 next
