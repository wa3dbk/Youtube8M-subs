difficult<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.220> incorporate<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.000> trees<00:01:13.560> no

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
difficult to incorporate the trees no

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.219

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
was putting together an ensemble and I'm

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.200 
was putting together an ensemble and I'm
fascinated<00:01:50.649> by<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.159> because<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.670> sound<00:01:51.909> that

fascinated by it because the sound that

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.539 
fascinated by it because the sound that
it<00:01:52.360> makes<00:01:52.509> is<00:01:52.719> very<00:01:52.750> similar<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.310> sine

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
it makes is very similar to the sine

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.639 
it makes is very similar to the sine
wave<00:01:54.820> if<00:01:55.000> it's<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.360> most<00:01:55.719> pure<00:01:56.020> tone<00:01:56.350> in

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
wave if it's the most pure tone in

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.940 
wave if it's the most pure tone in
digital<00:01:57.130> electronic<00:01:57.939> music<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:59.409> yet<00:01:59.590> it's<00:01:59.860> a

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
digital electronic music and yet it's a

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.190 
digital electronic music and yet it's a
very<00:02:00.189> there<00:02:00.909> this<00:02:01.450> instrument<00:02:01.930> is<00:02:02.020> made<00:02:02.079> of

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
very there this instrument is made of

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.249 
very there this instrument is made of
handmade<00:02:02.590> crystal<00:02:03.430> balls<00:02:03.810> some<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.930> them<00:02:05.110> are

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
handmade crystal balls some of them are

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.230 
handmade crystal balls some of them are
a<00:02:05.289> bit<00:02:05.500> wobbly<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.189> so<00:02:06.399> they<00:02:06.880> don't<00:02:07.090> produce

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
a bit wobbly and so they don't produce

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.330 
a bit wobbly and so they don't produce
pure<00:02:07.780> tones<00:02:08.140> but<00:02:08.410> they're<00:02:08.590> just<00:02:08.769> as<00:02:08.979> visceral

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
pure tones but they're just as visceral

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.729 
pure tones but they're just as visceral
they're<00:02:09.640> very<00:02:10.320> they<00:02:11.320> can<00:02:11.500> give<00:02:11.620> you

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
they're very they can give you

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.009 
they're very they can give you
goosebumps<00:02:11.950> these<00:02:12.459> sounds<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.840> thought

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
goosebumps these sounds and I thought

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.199 
goosebumps these sounds and I thought
the<00:02:14.230> history<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:14.920> was<00:02:15.040> really<00:02:15.310> much<00:02:15.970> more

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
the history of it was really much more

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.680 
the history of it was really much more
compelling<00:02:17.220> still<00:02:18.299> Benjamin<00:02:19.299> Franklin

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
compelling still Benjamin Franklin

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.400 
compelling still Benjamin Franklin
invented<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.320> 1761<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.900> Marie<00:02:22.900> Antoinette

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
invented it in 1761 and Marie Antoinette

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.069 
invented it in 1761 and Marie Antoinette
learned<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.739> play<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.570> Mozart<00:02:25.660> even<00:02:25.900> learned

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
learned to play it Mozart even learned

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.449 
learned to play it Mozart even learned
to<00:02:26.170> compose<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.799> it

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
to compose for it

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.349 
to compose for it
so<00:02:28.170> Franz<00:02:29.170> Mesmer<00:02:29.620> tried<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.220> even<00:02:30.430> hypnotize

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
so Franz Mesmer tried to even hypnotize

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.160 
so Franz Mesmer tried to even hypnotize
people<00:02:32.070> in<00:02:33.070> his<00:02:33.310> healing<00:02:33.700> sessions<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.780> I

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
people in his healing sessions so I

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.720 
people in his healing sessions so I
think<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.470> instrument<00:02:35.980> was

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
think the instrument was

disappeared for nearly 200 years
interesting<00:02:52.390> was<00:02:52.540> also<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:52.989> they<00:02:53.110> thought

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
interesting was also that they thought

those<00:03:01.120> are<00:03:01.269> some<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.660> ideas<00:03:02.620> around<00:03:02.920> it's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
those are some of the ideas around it's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.880 
those are some of the ideas around it's
simple<00:03:03.489> because<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.930> was<00:03:05.079> women<00:03:05.470> who<00:03:05.500> were

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
simple because the it was women who were

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.600 
simple because the it was women who were
subject<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.579> being<00:03:06.879> cured<00:03:07.569> by<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:09.040> this

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
subject to being cured by it and so this

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.789 
subject to being cured by it and so this
idea<00:03:09.970> of<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.269> vibration<00:03:11.019> as<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.470> mentioned

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
idea of the vibration as I mentioned

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.009 
idea of the vibration as I mentioned
earlier<00:03:12.099> this<00:03:12.310> vibration<00:03:12.910> as<00:03:13.060> as<00:03:13.360> something

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
earlier this vibration as as something

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.500 
earlier this vibration as as something
that<00:03:14.049> can<00:03:14.500> be<00:03:14.560> healing<00:03:14.980> or<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:16.209> can<00:03:16.329> be<00:03:16.480> a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
that can be healing or it can be a

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.099 
that can be healing or it can be a
destructive<00:03:17.019> force<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:18.569> these<00:03:19.569> and<00:03:19.900> this<00:03:20.049> is

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
destructive force so these and this is

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.800 
destructive force so these and this is
the<00:03:20.620> society<00:03:21.250> thinking<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.329> well<00:03:22.569> these

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
the society thinking that well these

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.220 
the society thinking that well these
this<00:03:23.019> hysterical<00:03:23.590> women<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:23.980> know<00:03:25.230> first

this hysterical women you know first

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.050 
this hysterical women you know first
maybe<00:03:26.590> we<00:03:27.220> need<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.430> protect<00:03:27.760> them<00:03:27.910> from

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
maybe we need to protect them from

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.000 
maybe we need to protect them from
excess<00:03:28.480> stimulus<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.200> then<00:03:29.440> some<00:03:29.650> thought<00:03:29.829> no

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
excess stimulus and then some thought no

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.619 
excess stimulus and then some thought no
they<00:03:30.190> need<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.430> have<00:03:30.579> more<00:03:30.609> access<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.269> access

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.969 
apart but if you were to play them
together<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:28.550> tone<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:30.110> church<00:05:30.380> thought<00:05:30.740> the

together the tone the church thought the

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.260 
together the tone the church thought the
medieval<00:05:31.370> church<00:05:31.550> thought<00:05:31.729> that<00:05:31.940> it<00:05:32.030> was<00:05:32.150> an

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
medieval church thought that it was an

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.980 
medieval church thought that it was an
unsettling<00:05:33.139> tone<00:05:33.409> and<00:05:33.740> that<00:05:34.430> feeling<00:05:35.240> coupled

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
unsettling tone and that feeling coupled

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.510 
unsettling tone and that feeling coupled
with<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.199> notion<00:05:36.770> that<00:05:36.800> it<00:05:37.009> had<00:05:37.159> six

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
with the notion that it had six

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.310 
with the notion that it had six
intervals<00:05:37.970> in<00:05:38.060> between<00:05:38.090> it<00:05:38.780> must<00:05:39.020> be<00:05:39.169> the

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
intervals in between it must be the

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.770 
intervals in between it must be the
devil's<00:05:39.620> tone<00:05:39.889> so<00:05:40.220> it<00:05:40.400> was<00:05:40.490> banned<00:05:40.699> from<00:05:40.970> from

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
devil's tone so it was banned from from

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.159 
devil's tone so it was banned from from
for<00:05:42.530> being<00:05:42.770> used<00:05:43.340> but<00:05:43.780> what<00:05:44.780> I<00:05:44.810> think<00:05:45.080> is

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
for being used but what I think is

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.249 
for being used but what I think is
interesting<00:05:45.349> here<00:05:46.070> is<00:05:46.219> that<00:05:46.659> if<00:05:47.659> you<00:05:47.870> were<00:05:48.020> to

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
interesting here is that if you were to

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.629 
interesting here is that if you were to
play<00:05:48.440> these<00:05:48.590> two<00:05:48.770> notes<00:05:48.800> on<00:05:49.219> the<00:05:49.340> piano

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
play these two notes on the piano

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.159 
play these two notes on the piano
keyboard<00:05:49.880> for<00:05:50.210> example<00:05:50.300> it<00:05:50.750> does<00:05:50.900> sound

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
keyboard for example it does sound

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.040 
keyboard for example it does sound
almost<00:05:51.469> like<00:05:51.830> a<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:53.090> horror<00:05:53.360> film<00:05:53.630> are<00:05:53.870> very

and again not creating an installation
that<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:35.240> conclusive<00:06:36.240> but<00:06:36.480> it's<00:06:36.660> really<00:06:37.100> meant

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
that is conclusive but it's really meant

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
that is conclusive but it's really meant
to<00:06:38.720> be<00:06:39.720> suspended<00:06:40.340> in<00:06:41.340> this<00:06:41.580> state<00:06:41.910> of

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
to be suspended in this state of

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.330 
to be suspended in this state of
excitation<00:06:42.570> almost<00:06:43.380> a<00:06:43.500> moment<00:06:43.860> frozen<00:06:44.040> in

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
excitation almost a moment frozen in

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.700 
excitation almost a moment frozen in
time<00:06:44.600> yeah<00:06:45.600> so<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:46.320> second<00:06:46.680> component<00:06:46.800> in<00:06:47.510> the

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
time yeah so the second component in the

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.640 
time yeah so the second component in the
composition<00:06:49.710> is<00:06:50.010> made<00:06:51.080> from<00:06:52.080> the<00:06:52.290> sounds<00:06:52.590> of

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
composition is made from the sounds of

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.650 
composition is made from the sounds of
the<00:06:52.770> glass<00:06:52.950> armonica<00:06:53.160> itself<00:06:53.850> and<00:06:54.450> I'm

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
the glass armonica itself and I'm

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.620 
the glass armonica itself and I'm
actually<00:06:54.900> sending<00:06:55.320> those<00:06:55.620> tones<00:06:55.980> through

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
actually sending those tones through

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.840 
actually sending those tones through
selected<00:06:57.630> broken<00:06:58.620> pieces<00:06:58.980> of<00:06:59.130> glass<00:06:59.250> in<00:06:59.790> the

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
selected broken pieces of glass in the

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.570 
selected broken pieces of glass in the
installation<00:07:00.800> during<00:07:01.800> the<00:07:01.950> process<00:07:02.400> we

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
installation during the process we

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.360 
installation during the process we
actually<00:07:02.910> took<00:07:03.030> quite<00:07:03.090> a<00:07:03.330> bit<00:07:03.510> of<00:07:03.600> time<00:07:03.810> to

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
actually took quite a bit of time to

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.670 
actually took quite a bit of time to
define<00:07:05.370> specific<00:07:05.850> tones<00:07:06.690> like<00:07:07.050> each<00:07:07.230> piece<00:07:07.500> of

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
define specific tones like each piece of

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.670 
define specific tones like each piece of
glass<00:07:07.890> like<00:07:08.310> to<00:07:08.970> sing<00:07:09.210> in<00:07:09.720> a<00:07:09.810> way<00:07:09.960> so<00:07:10.290> every

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
glass like to sing in a way so every

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.040 
glass like to sing in a way so every
physical<00:07:11.370> property<00:07:11.790> has<00:07:12.060> its<00:07:12.690> called<00:07:12.960> the

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
physical property has its called the

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.830 
physical property has its called the
resonance<00:07:13.320> frequency<00:07:14.010> so<00:07:14.330> every<00:07:15.330> part<00:07:15.660> every

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
resonance frequency so every part every

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.580 
resonance frequency so every part every
physical<00:07:16.410> entity<00:07:17.070> has<00:07:17.220> a<00:07:17.360> a<00:07:18.360> note<00:07:18.900> you'd<00:07:19.350> say

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:19.590 
physical entity has a a note you'd say

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.640 
physical entity has a a note you'd say
that<00:07:19.620> would<00:07:20.400> make<00:07:20.430> it<00:07:20.790> start<00:07:21.060> to<00:07:21.330> be<00:07:22.170> excited

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
that would make it start to be excited

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.050 
that would make it start to be excited
or<00:07:22.740> resonate<00:07:23.160> you<00:07:23.310> know<00:07:23.400> and<00:07:23.580> we<00:07:23.670> call<00:07:23.880> that

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
or resonate you know and we call that

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.990 
or resonate you know and we call that
that's<00:07:24.210> the<00:07:24.510> singing<00:07:25.500> note<00:07:25.710> so<00:07:25.980> for<00:07:26.640> each<00:07:26.730> pane

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
that's the singing note so for each pane

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.090 
that's the singing note so for each pane
of<00:07:27.120> glass<00:07:27.150> we<00:07:27.480> wanted<00:07:27.720> to<00:07:27.810> use<00:07:28.050> we<00:07:28.260> had<00:07:28.440> to<00:07:28.680> find

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:29.100 
of glass we wanted to use we had to find

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.210 
of glass we wanted to use we had to find
the<00:07:29.700> note<00:07:29.940> for<00:07:30.930> which<00:07:31.080> it<00:07:31.260> wanted<00:07:31.590> to<00:07:31.620> sing<00:07:31.950> and

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 
the note for which it wanted to sing and

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.230 
the note for which it wanted to sing and
then<00:07:32.430> I<00:07:32.460> used<00:07:33.440> those<00:07:34.440> to<00:07:34.800> sort<00:07:35.130> of<00:07:35.160> guide<00:07:35.790> the

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 
then I used those to sort of guide the

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:44.530 
then I used those to sort of guide the
the<00:07:36.540> composition<00:07:38.150> sounds<00:07:39.150> pretty<00:07:39.330> complex

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.540 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.790 

just<00:07:45.540> how<00:07:45.750> do<00:07:46.110> you<00:07:46.200> know<00:07:46.320> about<00:07:46.440> it<00:07:46.620> so<00:07:46.740> you

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 
just how do you know about it so you

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.460 
just how do you know about it so you
kind<00:07:47.400> of<00:07:47.490> straight<00:07:48.390> or<00:07:48.540> how<00:07:48.690> did<00:07:48.870> you<00:07:48.960> find<00:07:49.230> out

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:49.470 
kind of straight or how did you find out

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.070 
kind of straight or how did you find out
the<00:07:49.620> musical<00:07:50.130> tone<00:07:50.370> or<00:07:50.640> they<00:07:50.820> have<00:07:51.720> a<00:07:51.780> piece<00:07:51.960> of

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 
the musical tone or they have a piece of

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.290 
the musical tone or they have a piece of
glass<00:07:52.140> yeah<00:07:52.800> so<00:07:53.460> it's<00:07:53.610> actually<00:07:53.760> very<00:07:54.060> simple

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 
glass yeah so it's actually very simple

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.060 
glass yeah so it's actually very simple
so<00:07:54.570> if<00:07:54.930> you<00:07:56.540> let's<00:07:57.540> see<00:07:57.750> if<00:07:58.320> you<00:07:58.530> see<00:07:58.710> the<00:07:58.890> black

00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.070 
so if you let's see if you see the black

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.300 
so if you let's see if you see the black
box

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.310 
box

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.510 
box
stuck<00:08:01.240> on<00:08:01.360> the<00:08:01.420> glass<00:08:01.660> oh<00:08:01.900> yeah<00:08:02.170> yeah<00:08:02.520> well

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 
stuck on the glass oh yeah yeah well

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.040 
stuck on the glass oh yeah yeah well
that's<00:08:03.670> a<00:08:03.760> device<00:08:04.030> called<00:08:04.330> an<00:08:04.600> exciter

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.050 
that's a device called an exciter

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.170 
that's a device called an exciter
actually<00:08:05.800> and<00:08:06.070> an<00:08:06.220> exciter<00:08:06.580> is<00:08:06.700> simply<00:08:07.150> a

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:07.180 
actually and an exciter is simply a

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.490 
actually and an exciter is simply a
speaker<00:08:07.750> now<00:08:08.620> normal<00:08:09.040> speakers
