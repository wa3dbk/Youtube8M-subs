pretty much a different type of clip I
have<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:18.350> instead<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.409> going<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> usual

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
have it instead of going up like a usual

lego<00:01:21.600> gut<00:01:21.869> does<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.290> kind<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.590> made<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> just

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
lego gut does I kind of made it just

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.010 
lego gut does I kind of made it just
like<00:01:23.810> this<00:01:24.810> big<00:01:25.110> old<00:01:25.320> brick<00:01:26.040> line<00:01:26.869> then<00:01:27.869> put

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
like this big old brick line then put

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770 
like this big old brick line then put
the<00:01:28.110> bullet<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.640> way<00:01:29.850> it's

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the bullet right here and that way it's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.300 
the bullet right here and that way it's
easier<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.320> slides<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.799> better<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
easier and it slides up better but it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.380 
easier and it slides up better but it
also<00:01:34.520> tightens<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.180> pretty

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
also tightens in there so that's pretty

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.910 
also tightens in there so that's pretty
cool<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:37.100> have<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> handguard<00:01:38.850> right<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.420> i

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
cool I have the handguard right here i

like<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> safety<00:01:56.219> here<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:58.549> somewhat<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
like a safety here but somewhat like the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.700 
like a safety here but somewhat like the
state<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.299> right<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.750> underneath<00:02:01.350> here

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
state of like right here underneath here

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.920 
state of like right here underneath here
something<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.310> i<00:02:02.340> didn't<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:03.000> go

something like that i didn't really go

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.569 
something like that i didn't really go
into<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.229> safety<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.829> stuff<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.280> it

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
into the safety and stuff because it

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.730 
into the safety and stuff because it
didn't<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.420> wasn't<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.140> special<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.649> the
