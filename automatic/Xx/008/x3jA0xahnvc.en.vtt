mean<00:00:18.000> we're<00:00:18.119> at<00:00:18.210> CES<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.900> electronics<00:00:19.500> show

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
mean we're at CES the electronics show

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.019 
mean we're at CES the electronics show
what's<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.100> what's<00:00:20.250> electronic<00:00:20.760> about<00:00:20.910> this

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
what's up what's electronic about this

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.120 
what's up what's electronic about this
basketball<00:00:21.420> okay<00:00:22.140> what<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.710> inside<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
basketball okay what we have inside the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.560 
basketball okay what we have inside the
basketball<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.060> sensors<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.510> are

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
basketball is we have sensors that are

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.450 
basketball is we have sensors that are
embedded<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.949> basketball

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
embedded and that basketball

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.000 
embedded and that basketball
communicates<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.599> your<00:00:27.810> smart<00:00:28.080> device<00:00:28.410> via

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
communicates with your smart device via

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.460 
communicates with your smart device via
bluetooth<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.539> ball<00:00:30.779> will<00:00:31.019> actually

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
bluetooth so this ball will actually

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.900 
bluetooth so this ball will actually
track<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> measure<00:00:32.040> everything<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.820> at

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
track and measure everything you do at

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.150 
track and measure everything you do at
the<00:00:33.030> basketball<00:00:33.480> from<00:00:34.110> Shaw<00:00:34.350> dark<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.920> shot

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the basketball from Shaw dark the shot

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.060 
the basketball from Shaw dark the shot
spin<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:36.059> how<00:00:36.210> fast<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.809> shoot<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> also<00:00:37.829> can

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
spin to how fast you shoot it also can

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.650 
spin to how fast you shoot it also can
measure<00:00:38.190> your<00:00:38.340> ball<00:00:38.670> handling<00:00:38.700> how<00:00:39.510> many

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
measure your ball handling how many

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.360 
measure your ball handling how many
dribbles<00:00:39.870> you've<00:00:40.170> taken<00:00:40.379> how<00:00:40.649> fast<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.190> drill

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
dribbles you've taken how fast you drill

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.100 
dribbles you've taken how fast you drill
how<00:00:41.520> controlled<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.090> drove<00:00:42.270> how<00:00:42.420> control<00:00:42.840> or

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
how controlled you drove how control or

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.830 
how controlled you drove how control or
how<00:00:43.800> consistent<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.399> are<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.300> ball<00:00:45.570> will

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
how consistent you are so this ball will

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.090 
how consistent you are so this ball will
track<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.289> measure<00:00:46.379> everything<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:46.980> with

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
track and measure everything you do with

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.500 
track and measure everything you do with
the<00:00:47.190> basketball<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.700> communicate<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.360> back

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510

complete drills and it's through

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
complete drills and it's through
leveling<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.720> i<00:01:27.810> would<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> complete<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
leveling so i would have to complete a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
leveling so i would have to complete a
drill<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.040> order<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.640> move<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.630> i

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
drill in order for it to move on so if i

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.990 
drill in order for it to move on so if i
wanted<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> use<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> play<00:01:31.500> ground<00:01:31.740> level<00:01:32.130> i<00:01:32.310> can

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
see that this vault communicates right

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:01.400 
see that this vault communicates right
with<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:50.380> app<00:01:53.310> actually<00:01:54.310> mumble<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.460> go

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.810 

so<00:02:02.410> it's<00:02:02.530> counting<00:02:02.830> all<00:02:03.040> my<00:02:03.250> dribbles<00:02:03.640> and

so it's counting all my dribbles and

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.430 
so it's counting all my dribbles and
it's<00:02:04.210> my<00:02:04.330> consistency<00:02:04.900> score<00:02:05.290> right<00:02:05.410> here

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
it's my consistency score right here

this is my control right there I gotta
have<00:02:08.170> an<00:02:08.259> opener<00:02:08.590> certain<00:02:08.920> standard<00:02:09.280> for<00:02:09.460> to

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
have an opener certain standard for to

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.280 
have an opener certain standard for to
move<00:02:09.790> on<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.630> can<00:02:10.780> hear<00:02:10.930> that<00:02:11.140> the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
move on and you can hear that the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.480 
move on and you can hear that the
application<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.580> communicating<00:02:13.300> with<00:02:13.420> me<00:02:17.490> so

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
application is communicating with me so

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.920 
application is communicating with me so
you<00:02:18.520> can<00:02:18.670> see<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:18.850> i<00:02:19.000> pass<00:02:19.300> i<00:02:19.540> had<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.780> get

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
you can see that i pass i had to get

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.780 
you can see that i pass i had to get
over<00:02:19.960> 60<00:02:20.440> gerbils<00:02:20.830> with<00:02:21.400> eighty<00:02:21.610> percent

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
over 60 gerbils with eighty percent

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.760 
over 60 gerbils with eighty percent
control<00:02:22.330> i<00:02:22.360> got<00:02:22.570> 111<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.350> eighty-seven

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
control i got 111 and eighty-seven

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.500 
control i got 111 and eighty-seven
percent<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:24.490> now<00:02:24.640> i<00:02:24.670> can<00:02:24.790> move<00:02:25.060> on<00:02:25.210> to<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.480> next

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
percent so now i can move on to the next

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.990 
percent so now i can move on to the next
drill<00:02:25.960> I<00:02:26.170> just<00:02:26.650> hit<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.770> next<00:02:27.040> drill<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.760> I
