some risks with our traditional

some risks with our traditional

finally in that backpack by far and away

finally in that backpack by far and away
his<00:00:45.710> most<00:00:45.920> important<00:00:46.460> offensive<00:00:47.390> tool<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.839> is

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
his most important offensive tool it is

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.020 
his most important offensive tool it is
a<00:00:48.079> completely<00:00:48.739> unique<00:00:48.829> mechanic<00:00:49.579> it<00:00:49.760> has<00:00:49.999> a

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
a completely unique mechanic it has a

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.180 
a completely unique mechanic it has a
base<00:00:50.420> energy<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:52.039> you'll

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
base energy that it that you'll

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.590 
base energy that it that you'll
accumulate<00:00:52.519> just<00:00:52.820> by<00:00:52.909> landing<00:00:53.179> this<00:00:53.210> attack

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
accumulate just by landing this attack

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.660 
accumulate just by landing this attack
and<00:00:53.870> then<00:00:54.170> there's<00:00:54.379> an<00:00:54.530> additional<00:00:54.739> AP<00:00:55.280> bonus

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
and then there's an additional AP bonus

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.489 
and then there's an additional AP bonus
that<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:55.969> get<00:00:56.210> based<00:00:56.719> on<00:00:56.899> how<00:00:57.079> much<00:00:57.260> energy

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
that you get based on how much energy

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.840 
that you get based on how much energy
you<00:00:57.710> steal<00:00:58.069> from<00:00:58.219> your<00:00:58.339> player<00:00:58.550> but<00:00:58.730> it's

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
you steal from your player but it's

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.130 
you steal from your player but it's
interesting<00:00:58.999> too<00:00:59.300> because<00:00:59.329> he's<00:00:59.629> balanced

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
interesting too because he's balanced

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.450 
interesting too because he's balanced
he's<00:01:00.350> got<00:01:00.499> some<00:01:00.530> interesting<00:01:00.800> balance<00:01:01.129> move

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
he's got some interesting balance move

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.040 
he's got some interesting balance move
so<00:01:01.640> let's<00:01:02.239> talk<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.420> little<00:01:02.510> bit<00:01:02.749> about<00:01:02.899> that

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
so let's talk a little bit about that

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.329 
so let's talk a little bit about that
let's<00:01:03.229> talk<00:01:03.409> about<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:03.769> fact<00:01:03.949> that<00:01:03.979> he<00:01:04.070> can't

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
let's talk about the fact that he can't

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.100 
let's talk about the fact that he can't
block<00:01:04.610> keeping<00:01:05.030> track<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.269> Sly<00:01:05.570> Cooper<00:01:05.600> at<00:01:05.990> all

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
block keeping track of Sly Cooper at all

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.469 
block keeping track of Sly Cooper at all
times<00:01:06.350> can<00:01:06.620> be<00:01:06.770> difficult<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.430> while<00:01:07.970> he<00:01:08.150> can't

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
times can be difficult so while he can't

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.540 
times can be difficult so while he can't
completely<00:01:09.140> negate<00:01:09.680> your<00:01:09.710> attack<00:01:09.979> by

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
completely negate your attack by

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.490 
completely negate your attack by
blocking<00:01:10.909> he<00:01:11.630> can<00:01:11.840> sort<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.229> be<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.440> a

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
blocking he can sort of be in a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.570 
blocking he can sort of be in a
situation<00:01:12.650> where<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.040> never<00:01:13.130> feel<00:01:13.340> like<00:01:13.490> you

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
situation where you never feel like you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.710 
situation where you never feel like you
have<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.729> attack<00:01:13.880> him<00:01:14.090> in<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.210> first<00:01:14.330> place<00:01:14.450> by

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
have to attack him in the first place by

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.270 
have to attack him in the first place by
simply<00:01:14.990> being<00:01:15.170> abysm<00:01:15.530> another<00:01:15.979> move<00:01:16.159> I

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
simply being abysm another move I

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.920 
simply being abysm another move I
thought<00:01:16.490> was<00:01:16.640> great<00:01:16.820> was<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.450> dynamite

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
thought was great was the the dynamite

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.480 
thought was great was the the dynamite
bucket<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:18.500> can<00:01:18.650> jump<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:19.040> jump<00:01:19.190> into

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
bucket that you can jump it jump into

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.670 
bucket that you can jump it jump into
sneaking<00:01:19.940> clothes<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.810> detonate<00:01:21.380> that's<00:01:21.590> a

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
sneaking clothes and a detonate that's a

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.410 
sneaking clothes and a detonate that's a
great<00:01:22.040> crowd<00:01:22.280> control<00:01:22.730> move<00:01:22.880> again<00:01:23.180> it's<00:01:23.330> not

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
great crowd control move again it's not

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.550 
great crowd control move again it's not
a<00:01:23.450> character<00:01:23.870> you're<00:01:23.990> going<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.170> want<00:01:24.320> in<00:01:24.440> the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
a character you're going to want in the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.380 
a character you're going to want in the
thick<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.800> combat<00:01:25.400> but<00:01:25.850> when<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.120> need<00:01:26.360> to

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
thick of combat but when you need to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.970 
thick of combat but when you need to
that's<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:26.870> great<00:01:27.110> go<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.320> another<00:01:27.680> really

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
that's a great go to another really

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.800 
that's a great go to another really
really<00:01:28.160> important<00:01:28.490> Rufus<00:01:28.730> like<00:01:28.850> Cooper<00:01:29.180> is

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
really important Rufus like Cooper is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.600 
really important Rufus like Cooper is
the<00:01:30.020> alarm<00:01:30.260> clock<00:01:30.380> he<00:01:30.710> can<00:01:30.890> quickly<00:01:31.130> stun<00:01:31.520> an

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
the alarm clock he can quickly stun an

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.040 
the alarm clock he can quickly stun an
opponent<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.180> get<00:01:32.360> them<00:01:32.510> caught<00:01:32.720> in<00:01:32.840> some<00:01:32.990> of

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
opponent and get them caught in some of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.340 
opponent and get them caught in some of
the<00:01:33.110> sonic<00:01:33.290> waves

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.200 

but<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.980> is<00:01:41.370> you<00:01:41.760> can<00:01:41.790> build<00:01:42.120> up

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
but what you can do is you can build up

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.520 
but what you can do is you can build up
to<00:01:42.330> those<00:01:42.450> supers<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.470> all

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to those supers and that's what it's all

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
to those supers and that's what it's all
about<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.920> PlayStation<00:01:44.400> all<00:01:44.550> sorts<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.060> tell

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
about and PlayStation all sorts so tell

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.670 
about and PlayStation all sorts so tell
