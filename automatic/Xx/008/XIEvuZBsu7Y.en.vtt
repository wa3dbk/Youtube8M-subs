liter<00:01:40.770> engine<00:01:41.070> from<00:01:41.310> General<00:01:41.700> Motors<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
liter engine from General Motors is is

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.830 
liter engine from General Motors is is
it<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.579> cracker<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.060> really<00:01:45.540> really

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it is a cracker and it's really really

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.760 
it is a cracker and it's really really
powerful<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:47.340> all<00:01:47.490> applications<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.560> it's<00:01:49.560> my

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
powerful in all applications so it's my

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.740 
powerful in all applications so it's my
strong<00:01:50.100> hunch<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.670> engine<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.210> going

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
strong hunch that this engine is going

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.130 
strong hunch that this engine is going
into<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.409> Corvette<00:01:53.009> very<00:01:53.340> soon<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:55.020> know

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
into the Corvette very soon but you know

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.260 
into the Corvette very soon but you know
that's<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.399> speculation<00:01:56.759> at<00:01:57.240> this

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that's that's just speculation at this

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.319 
that's that's just speculation at this
point<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> CTS<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.340> CTS<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.939> course<00:02:00.149> for

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
point but the CTS the CTS of course for

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.590 
point but the CTS the CTS of course for
2014<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.500> gorgeous<00:02:02.009> car<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.460> drove<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> few

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
was loaded so it was the 2-liter but it

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.199 
was loaded so it was the 2-liter but it
was<00:02:14.349> about<00:02:14.500> 62<00:02:14.920> grand<00:02:15.280> as<00:02:15.519> equipped<00:02:15.819> with<00:02:16.030> it

it<00:03:10.840> has<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.019> little<00:03:11.170> bit<00:03:11.349> more<00:03:11.790> definition<00:03:12.790> in

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
it has a little bit more definition in

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.509 
it has a little bit more definition in
these<00:03:13.269> tailpipes<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.989> believe<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.980> then<00:03:15.340> just

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
these tailpipes I believe and then just

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.740 
these tailpipes I believe and then just
a<00:03:15.579> little<00:03:15.670> bit<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.000> lower<00:03:16.209> ride<00:03:16.450> height<00:03:16.480> and

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
a little bit of a lower ride height and

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.860 
a little bit of a lower ride height and
of<00:03:17.019> course<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:18.430> variety<00:03:19.389> of<00:03:19.420> optimized

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
of course a variety of optimized

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.680 
of course a variety of optimized
tractions<00:03:20.350> chassis<00:03:21.310> settings<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.329> make<00:03:22.480> it

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
tractions chassis settings to to make it

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.460 
tractions chassis settings to to make it
a<00:03:23.650> really<00:03:24.400> viable<00:03:24.579> competitor<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.359> the<00:03:26.019> BMW

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
a really viable competitor to the BMW

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.059 
a really viable competitor to the BMW
5-series<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:28.269> one<00:03:28.420> looks<00:03:28.600> like<00:03:28.690> it's

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
5-series so this one looks like it's

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.500 
5-series so this one looks like it's
it's<00:03:30.069> all<00:03:30.190> locked<00:03:30.400> up<00:03:30.670> so<00:03:30.970> alright<00:03:31.420> well

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
it's all locked up so alright well

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.280 
it's all locked up so alright well
