00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:07.750
 ninja fucking aid in 1988 that 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.250
 revolutionized what we knew until 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.049
 then in the 8-bit system of 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.580
 nintendo when creating the first game with 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.860
 have strong tens to count the 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.750
 plot thematically 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.550
 but that everything would have been sweet potatoes and 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.189
 the gameplay the music and the design the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.710
 levels for a piece of furniture but everything 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.810
 opposite ninja gaiden tests in a 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.439
 6-0 game the attention full of challenges 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.419
 challenges and still more remains the difficulty 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.160
 that is delivered is well recognized all 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.930
 the gamers since it differentiates 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.430
 pendejas critics lacking in difficulty 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.800
 that any veteran can control himself 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.360
 three and a half hours you put in original 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.620
 have to have Gaul see if even the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.090
 first or second or third since 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.660
 he had a month-old putt 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.660
 i 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.760
 but although that sound remained recorded 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.620
 in the minds of all true 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.449
 hardcore gamer of the time by those who 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.040
 They lost just could not stop 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.719
 control the rioja job uses in your 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.150
 search to find the killer of his 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.799
 father like all good ninja I always believe 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.330
 he has his masks on to point 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.610
 turned on which is absolutely 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.610
 useless because everyone knows who he is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.980
 but so his suit all because he arrived 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.200
 that a great respect be respected in America 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.940
 weapons arsenal at your disposal as 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.160
 the dragon sword ninja stars 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.440
 I put brand new jury that the boomerang 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.760
 wheels of fire a sharp mother who for 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.830
 some reason you just attack by throwing yourself 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.410
 In the air there was a clock in 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.410
 the time with clear enemies 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.840
 obviously the malandros in turns do not 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.640
 they will make the victory hero easy 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.020
 since they were in heaps and the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.480
 juggling popping up in accounts of 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.220
 more than one girls to take their place 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.590
 I had done with boxing black knives 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.930
 time with hooded clubs 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.360
 Chinese mercenary machetes miles with 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.070
 katanas large white recipients with 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.380
 bazocas rare times with head of 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.820
 halloween pumpkin but my jet paq and 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.070
 until the very same James Jones 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.350
 Friday the 13th but they are not human beings 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.930
 they wanted to kill you since dogs 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.840
 hawks bats jaguars and pigeons 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.860
 also the also very useful and removed 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.180
 I have clear that there were also animals 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.280
 that having a flight providing 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.290
 weapons points and ammunition as 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.330
 fireflies hummingbirds and tarantulas 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.430
 coculina as chingados is key so much 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.730
 for race inside and a rhythm no 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.730
 video 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.599
 but not all the time the game was 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.010
 in enemy attacks since the design 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.659
 of the levels of forced to plan 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.090
 movement strategy at the time of 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.099
 run jump and climb because if you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.409
 bandages to the brave most likely 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.060
 it would end up in the hole and not only that 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.950
 but each and every one of the bosses 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.989
 they needed their 20s when to be 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.760
 eliminated since reaching them as a jump 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.540
 with a direct frontal attack only 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.540
 they would end up typing 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.050
 and do the ninja 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.730
 Jaime the game that divided the fields 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.750
 gamer of casual players for his 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.550
 fast gameplay 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.890
 welcome jumps today with environments 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.690
 enemies and the most bastard bosses in the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.860
 history of video games and not only 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.480
 by the fact that he will be lieutenant 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.400
 super duper our party them of pretty 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.290
 so that they can hurt, but when they do not 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.670
 you did against one of them they returned you 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.670
 at the beginning it receives 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.980
 and telling me the star level art 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.810
 Expert already knows that you want to throw 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.370
 control of despair 220 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.050
 first programmers did that if 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.110
 we lost the final boss at level 2 and 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.360
 4 returned almaguer boxing level 61 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.180
 and without losses against the second boss 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.430
 final they also returned you to level 6 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.900
 shifts you do not want from local by gamer 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.280
 persevering that any 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.170
 game and achieved mention to the first and 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.110
 second that this end followed and you go 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.390
 against the last boss with aliens 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.860
 demoniac and increased game by the nape 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.860
 and if you do not do it against him 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.580
 you had to start over from 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.580
 the 6 1 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.450
 why and more he called me 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.800
 hayden relax so if you boast of 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.240
 that all the mom's games do not even 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.720
 there is no challenge that you have been unable to 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.400
 overcome 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.210
 terre because while the game by the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.930
 that the term meshaal was born called me and 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.930
 I gamer
