here where I live at called zombie
Runner<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.590> got<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.130> these<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.670> got

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
Runner and I got one of these I got

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.050 
Runner and I got one of these I got
these<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.330> $73<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.470> think<00:01:22.710> which<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.759> sale

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
these for $73 I think which was on sale

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.590 
these for $73 I think which was on sale
because<00:01:24.780> roughly<00:01:25.200> they're<00:01:25.350> about<00:01:25.560> $80<00:01:26.159> $90<00:01:26.729> so

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
because roughly they're about $80 $90 so

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.140 
because roughly they're about $80 $90 so
I've<00:01:28.200> got<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:28.920> enough<00:01:29.369> where<00:01:29.610> I'm<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:30.030> my

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
I've got these enough where I'm for my

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.359 
I've got these enough where I'm for my
squad<00:01:30.509> Daedalus<00:01:31.140> military<00:01:31.829> press<00:01:32.100> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
squad Daedalus military press and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.760 
squad Daedalus military press and
throughout<00:01:33.240> basically<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.500> low

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
throughout basically now it's really low

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.990 
throughout basically now it's really low
to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> ground<00:01:35.520> esse<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.540> very<00:01:36.750> minimal<00:01:36.979> so

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
to the ground esse is very minimal so

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.090 
to the ground esse is very minimal so
well<00:01:39.000> viable<00:01:39.509> well<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.380> aiming<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
well viable well I was aiming to be is

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.060 
well viable well I was aiming to be is
basically<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.899> run<00:01:43.140> barefoot

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
basically like so that you run barefoot

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.620 
basically like so that you run barefoot
it<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.340> more<00:01:44.460> natural<00:01:44.670> apparently<00:01:45.540> that's

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
it it's more natural apparently that's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.760 
it it's more natural apparently that's
what<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:45.869> say<00:01:46.079> because<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.409> struck<00:01:46.649> with

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
what they say because you struck with

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.520 
what they say because you struck with
your<00:01:46.860> forefoot<00:01:47.310> instead<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> heel<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.200> all

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
your forefoot instead of the heel so all

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.770 
your forefoot instead of the heel so all
of<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.280> straight

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
of this is straight
