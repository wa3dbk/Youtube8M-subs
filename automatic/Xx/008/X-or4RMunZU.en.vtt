00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
little bit about your expansion and then

first year you need to open it to see if
it<00:00:39.899> will<00:00:40.370> many<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.579> them<00:00:41.730> are<00:00:42.410> stuck<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.610> in

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
it will many of them are stuck so in

order to keep that from getting stuck
you<00:00:47.340> need<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> treat<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.149> Jay<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.660> would

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
you need to treat it and Jay what would

you need to treat it and Jay what would
you<00:00:48.930> treat<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.730> we<00:00:50.730> used<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.120> solution

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
you treat it with we used the solution

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.750 
you treat it with we used the solution
on<00:00:51.780> ours<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:52.739> time<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.070> went<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.579> open

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
on ours the first time we went to open

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.930 
on ours the first time we went to open
it<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.449> hardly<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.469> open<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.640> sprayed

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
it we hardly get it open so we sprayed

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.029 
it we hardly get it open so we sprayed
the<00:00:57.120> solution<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.870> around<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.530> rubber

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the solution all around the rubber

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.729 
the solution all around the rubber
molding<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.109> comes<00:01:01.350> open

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
molding on it and now it comes open

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.119 
molding on it and now it comes open
easily<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.870> want<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.619> open<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
easily so what we want to do is open it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.609 
easily so what we want to do is open it
and<00:01:05.220> Janes<00:01:05.549> gonna<00:01:05.790> open<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.360> show<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.750> how

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and Janes gonna open it and show you how

would<00:01:59.250> think<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.670> weapon<00:01:59.969> well<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.750> not

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
would think it's a weapon well it's not

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.200 
would think it's a weapon well it's not
a<00:02:00.960> weapon<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> keep<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.759> window

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
a weapon it's just to keep the window

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.029 
a weapon it's just to keep the window
open

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.680 

because<00:02:09.039> with<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.280> window<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.700> weighs<00:02:09.970> even

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
because with a window that weighs even

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.770 
because with a window that weighs even
five<00:02:10.989> pounds<00:02:11.709> trying<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.790> keep<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.120> off<00:02:13.270> of<00:02:13.510> you

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
five pounds trying to keep it off of you

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.430 
five pounds trying to keep it off of you
while<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.260> get<00:02:14.500> out<00:02:14.709> can<00:02:15.550> really<00:02:15.849> be<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> chore

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
while you get out can really be a chore

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.110 
while you get out can really be a chore
now<00:02:17.440> when<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.099> look<00:02:18.310> at<00:02:18.459> this<00:02:18.610> or<00:02:18.880> look<00:02:19.030> at

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
now when you look at this or look at

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.790 
now when you look at this or look at
your<00:02:19.330> window<00:02:19.480> it's<00:02:19.840> got<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.050> very<00:02:20.290> sharp<00:02:20.530> edge

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
your window it's got a very sharp edge

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.509 
your window it's got a very sharp edge
right<00:02:21.099> here

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
right here

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.250 
right here
now<00:02:22.180> if<00:02:22.300> you're<00:02:22.420> trying<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.720> go<00:02:22.840> out<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.019> this

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
now if you're trying to go out of this

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.509 
now if you're trying to go out of this
thing<00:02:23.530> now<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.739> lot<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.920> people<00:02:24.040> say<00:02:24.340> they're

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
thing now a lot of people say they're

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.100 
thing now a lot of people say they're
going<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.760> go<00:02:24.910> out<00:02:25.060> headfirst<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.930> they're

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
going to go out headfirst and they're

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.290 
going to go out headfirst and they're
gonna<00:02:26.200> do<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.890> none<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.370> works<00:02:27.700> you

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
gonna do this and none of that works you

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.780 
gonna do this and none of that works you
go<00:02:28.420> out<00:02:28.599> belly<00:02:28.959> down<00:02:29.290> foot<00:02:30.069> first

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
go out belly down foot first

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.690 
go out belly down foot first
but<00:02:31.390> with<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.690> sharp<00:02:32.019> edge<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:33.010> really

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
but with this sharp edge it is really

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.750 
but with this sharp edge it is really
gonna<00:02:33.910> hurt<00:02:34.209> so<00:02:35.050> our<00:02:35.560> suggestion<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.489> you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
gonna hurt so our suggestion is that you

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.539 
gonna hurt so our suggestion is that you
use<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.450> blanket<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:39.010> will<00:02:39.160> throw<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
use a blanket and you will throw the

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.080 
use a blanket and you will throw the
blanket<00:02:39.730> out<00:02:40.060> end<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:41.650> end<00:02:41.980> because<00:02:42.880> that's

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
blanket out end to end because that's

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.509 
blanket out end to end because that's
the<00:02:43.239> long<00:02:43.390> axis<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.170> especially<00:02:45.040> at<00:02:45.310> night

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
the long axis and especially at night

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.039 
the long axis and especially at night
because<00:02:46.060> we<00:02:46.209> don't<00:02:46.390> know<00:02:46.450> how<00:02:46.569> you're<00:02:46.750> dressed

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
because we don't know how you're dressed

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.979 
because we don't know how you're dressed
you<00:02:47.890> can<00:02:48.069> use<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.580> then<00:02:48.640> when<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.480> get<00:02:49.720> out

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
you can use that then when you get out

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.720 
you can use that then when you get out
to<00:02:50.349> wrap<00:02:51.220> up<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.930> Jane<00:02:53.230> will<00:02:53.530> go<00:02:53.890> out<00:02:54.069> foot

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
to wrap up it so Jane will go out foot

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:03.710 
to wrap up it so Jane will go out foot
first<00:02:55.380> belly<00:02:56.380> down

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.270 

one<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.500> things<00:03:04.710> you<00:03:04.830> want<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.100> take<00:03:05.250> a

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
one of the things you want to take a

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.450 
one of the things you want to take a
look<00:03:05.550> at<00:03:05.760> as<00:03:06.030> you're<00:03:06.270> setting<00:03:06.630> up<00:03:06.750> your<00:03:06.780> escape

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
look at as you're setting up your escape

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.090 
look at as you're setting up your escape
plan<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:08.790> your<00:03:09.270> practice<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:10.200> how<00:03:10.470> high<00:03:10.740> is

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
plan and your practice is how high is

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.590 
plan and your practice is how high is
the<00:03:11.340> edge<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.850> winter<00:03:12.150> or<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.240> bottom

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
the edge of the winter or the bottom

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.060 
the edge of the winter or the bottom
part<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.930> wet<00:03:13.080> into<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.440> ground

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
part of the wet into the ground

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.970 
part of the wet into the ground
it's<00:03:14.700> roughly<00:03:15.060> 8<00:03:15.390> feet<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.590> when<00:03:16.740> you're<00:03:16.860> going

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
it's roughly 8 feet so when you're going

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.970 
it's roughly 8 feet so when you're going
to<00:03:17.040> practice<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.790> suggest<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.960> you<00:03:19.170> go<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:19.830> an

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
to practice I suggest that you go to an

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.520 
to practice I suggest that you go to an
RV<00:03:20.280> park<00:03:20.310> or<00:03:20.790> wherever<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.780> has<00:03:22.020> a<00:03:22.050> picnic
