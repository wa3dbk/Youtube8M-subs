00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.760 
cuts out so you don't hear anything and
while<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.299> would<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> good<00:02:04.049> feature<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
while that would be a good feature if it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.490 
while that would be a good feature if it
worked<00:02:05.040> properly<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:06.600> actually<00:02:07.079> takes<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
worked properly it actually takes a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.190 
worked properly it actually takes a
while<00:02:07.740> for<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:08.849> you've<00:02:09.030> switched<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
while for is so if you've switched a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.840 
while for is so if you've switched a
song<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.590> example

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
song for example

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.700 
song for example
we'll<00:02:12.030> cut<00:02:12.270> out<00:02:12.420> during<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.110> change<00:02:13.470> between

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
we'll cut out during the change between

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.130 
we'll cut out during the change between
the<00:02:13.890> two<00:02:14.040> songs<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.490> usually<00:02:14.790> cuts<00:02:15.060> out<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.630> few

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
the two songs and usually cuts out a few

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.900 
the two songs and usually cuts out a few
seconds<00:02:16.530> into<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.010> next<00:02:17.280> song<00:02:17.490> meaning<00:02:17.820> you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
seconds into the next song meaning you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.030 
seconds into the next song meaning you
miss<00:02:18.120> out<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> bit<00:02:18.600> also<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.860> too

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
miss out a bit also if you have it too

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.090 
miss out a bit also if you have it too
quiet<00:02:20.460> then<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.480> keeps<00:02:21.950> thinking<00:02:22.950> that

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
quiet then it keeps thinking that

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.860 
quiet then it keeps thinking that
there's<00:02:23.310> nothing<00:02:23.670> playing<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.420> cuts<00:02:24.660> out

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
there's nothing playing and it cuts out

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.070 
there's nothing playing and it cuts out
just<00:02:25.230> halfway<00:02:25.440> through<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.740> song<00:02:26.040> which<00:02:26.250> is

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
just halfway through a song which is

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.180 
just halfway through a song which is
quite<00:02:28.080> poor<00:02:28.320> actually<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> was<00:02:29.010> very

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
quite poor actually I was very

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.950 
quite poor actually I was very
disappointed<00:02:29.490> about<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.300> because<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.690> other

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
disappointed about that because of other

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.960 
disappointed about that because of other
than<00:02:31.200> other<00:02:31.530> than<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.160> issue<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.640> actually

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
than other than that issue it's actually

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.790 
than other than that issue it's actually
quite<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.210> decent<00:02:33.450> speaker<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.680> called

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
quite a decent speaker it's called

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.540 
quite a decent speaker it's called
decent<00:02:35.190> sound<00:02:35.460> good<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.240> good<00:02:36.750> volume<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.550> know

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
decent sound good a good volume but know

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.880 
decent sound good a good volume but know
that<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:39.300> connection<00:02:39.780> issue<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.350> really<00:02:40.710> a

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
that that connection issue is really a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.800 
that that connection issue is really a
problem<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.460> that<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.820> definitely<00:02:41.940> only<00:02:42.660> with

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
problem and that is definitely only with

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.450 
problem and that is definitely only with
the<00:02:43.020> Bluetooth<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:43.620> you're<00:02:43.770> using<00:02:43.920> an<00:02:44.190> aux

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
the Bluetooth if you're using an aux

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.320 
the Bluetooth if you're using an aux
connection<00:02:45.300> then<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:46.020> absolutely<00:02:46.500> fine<00:02:46.710> but

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
connection then it's absolutely fine but

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.790 
connection then it's absolutely fine but
really<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.540> does<00:02:48.750> let<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.110> down<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.650> it

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
really that does let it down that it

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.250 
really that does let it down that it
keeps<00:02:50.370> cutting<00:02:50.850> out<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.300> music<00:02:51.600> halfway

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
keeps cutting out the music halfway

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.020 
keeps cutting out the music halfway
through<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> song<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.490> because<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:53.880> gone<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
through a song just because it's gone a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.660 
through a song just because it's gone a
bit<00:02:54.090> quieter<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:54.990> if<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.920> do<00:02:56.100> want<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.340> buy<00:02:56.490> one

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
bit quieter so if you do want to buy one

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.730 
bit quieter so if you do want to buy one
of<00:02:56.700> these<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:56.910> would<00:02:57.330> recommend<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.990> but<00:02:58.230> I

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
of these I would recommend it but I

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.280 
of these I would recommend it but I
wouldn't<00:02:59.460> use<00:02:59.490> it<00:02:59.700> as<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.390> day-to-day<00:03:00.630> basis

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
wouldn't use it as on a day-to-day basis

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.110 
wouldn't use it as on a day-to-day basis
as<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.500> main<00:03:01.740> speaker<00:03:02.160> because<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.550> some<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.060> the
