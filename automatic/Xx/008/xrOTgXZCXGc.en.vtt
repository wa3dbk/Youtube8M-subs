00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the only silver lining to this is that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090 
the only silver lining to this is that
it's<00:01:45.899> brothers<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.500> arms<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.770> doesn't<00:01:46.979> really

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
it's brothers and arms I doesn't really

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.170 
it's brothers and arms I doesn't really
get<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> whole<00:01:47.399> lot<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.549> views<00:01:47.759> anyway<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.090> just

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
get a whole lot of views anyway I just

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.580 
get a whole lot of views anyway I just
want<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> play<00:01:48.659> through<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.930> again<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.290> still

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
want to play through it again but still

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.630 
want to play through it again but still
that<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.729> mad<00:01:51.030> about<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:52.640> because

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
that I'm really mad about that because

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.039 
that I'm really mad about that because
essentially<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.299> only<00:01:54.479> people<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.780> got<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
essentially the only people that got to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.060 
essentially the only people that got to
see<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.290> were<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> people<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.829> were<00:01:55.920> their

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
see it were the people that were their

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.560 
see it were the people that were their
lives<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.549> feel<00:01:56.729> special<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> were<00:01:57.360> there

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
lives so feel special if you were there

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.440 
lives so feel special if you were there
otherwise<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.860> lost<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> huge<00:02:00.090> chunk

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
otherwise I just lost like a huge chunk

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.999 
otherwise I just lost like a huge chunk
of<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> game<00:02:01.549> that<00:02:02.549> sucks<00:02:02.909> yeah<00:02:03.659> also<00:02:04.500> low

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
of the game that sucks yeah also low

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
of the game that sucks yeah also low
sensitivities<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:06.030> game<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.479> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
sensitivities in this game I have a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.830 
sensitivities in this game I have a
problem<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.380> aiming<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.390> too<00:02:09.599> low

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
problem with the aiming to is too low

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.589 
problem with the aiming to is too low
for<00:02:09.869> sensitivity<00:02:10.470> three<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:10.950> too<00:02:11.129> fast<00:02:11.599> there

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
for sensitivity three is too fast there

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.790 
for sensitivity three is too fast there
needs<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.870> be<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.989> few<00:02:13.260> more<00:02:13.410> option

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
needs to be a few more option

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.620 
needs to be a few more option
I<00:02:13.860> think<00:02:14.700> black<00:02:14.850> ops<00:02:15.000> 2<00:02:15.150> got<00:02:15.300> this<00:02:15.420> down<00:02:15.570> a

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
I think black ops 2 got this down a

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.890 
I think black ops 2 got this down a
little<00:02:15.720> bit<00:02:15.960> better<00:02:16.640> via<00:02:17.640> black<00:02:17.850> ops<00:02:18.000> 3<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:18.630> at

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
little bit better via black ops 3 so at

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.240 
little bit better via black ops 3 so at
first<00:02:18.960> I<00:02:19.350> was<00:02:19.470> kind<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.710> just<00:02:19.890> not

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
first I was kind of just not

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.950 
first I was kind of just not
disappointed<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.880> was<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> little<00:02:21.300> concerned

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
disappointed I was a little concerned

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.300 
disappointed I was a little concerned
because<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.830> know<00:02:22.920> they're<00:02:23.070> bringing<00:02:23.280> back

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
because you know they're bringing back

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.770 
because you know they're bringing back
all<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.700> movement<00:02:24.030> options<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.510> advanced

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
all the movement options that advanced

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.410 
all the movement options that advanced
warfare<00:02:25.170> had<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.820> see<00:02:26.940> me<00:02:27.060> try<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.270> turn

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
warfare had and you see me try to turn

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.120 
warfare had and you see me try to turn
it<00:02:27.480> up<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.720> three<00:02:27.960> in<00:02:28.170> my<00:02:28.200> aim<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.680> all<00:02:28.830> over<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
it up to three in my aim is all over the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.830 
it up to three in my aim is all over the
place<00:02:29.280> but<00:02:30.030> at<00:02:30.210> first<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.480> was<00:02:30.630> concerned

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
place but at first I was concerned

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.940 
place but at first I was concerned
because<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.110> didn't<00:02:31.320> really<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.680> advanced

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
because I didn't really like advanced

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.550 
because I didn't really like advanced
warfare<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.520> thought<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.790> was<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:34.140> was<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.440> much

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
warfare I thought it was it was so much

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.290 
warfare I thought it was it was so much
of<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.710> clusterfuck<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:36.030> all<00:02:36.180> it

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
of a clusterfuck but that's all it

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.430 
of a clusterfuck but that's all it
really<00:02:36.450> felt<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:36.810> people<00:02:37.050> were<00:02:37.200> just

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
really felt like people were just

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.350 
really felt like people were just
boosting<00:02:37.860> all<00:02:37.980> over<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.340> place<00:02:38.580> if<00:02:39.120> there

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
boosting all over the place if there

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.850 
boosting all over the place if there
were<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:39.720> many<00:02:39.810> different<00:02:40.080> ways<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.380> get<00:02:40.650> into

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
were so many different ways to get into

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.500 
were so many different ways to get into
rooms<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.700> didn't<00:02:42.030> feel<00:02:42.150> like<00:02:42.210> there<00:02:42.450> was

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
rooms it didn't feel like there was

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.690 
rooms it didn't feel like there was
really<00:02:42.810> much<00:02:43.170> skill<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.250> boy<00:02:44.310> didn't<00:02:44.580> feel

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
really much skill and boy didn't feel

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.220 
really much skill and boy didn't feel
like<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.880> could<00:02:44.910> really<00:02:45.240> get<00:02:45.390> good<00:02:45.720> at<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:45.960> just

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
like I could really get good at it just

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.170 
like I could really get good at it just
because<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.500> was<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.830> much<00:02:47.180> clusterfuck

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
because it was so much clusterfuck

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.300 
because it was so much clusterfuck
happening<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.650> when<00:02:49.830> they<00:02:49.950> brought<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.250> back

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
happening so when they brought this back

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.460 
happening so when they brought this back
I<00:02:50.790> was<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> little<00:02:51.300> concerned<00:02:51.450> until<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.200> really

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
I was a little concerned until I really

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.350 
I was a little concerned until I really
saw<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.650> gameplay<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.580> gameplay<00:02:53.940> they

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
saw the gameplay and the gameplay they

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.930 
saw the gameplay and the gameplay they
seem<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.600> have<00:02:54.720> toned<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:55.260> town<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.800> lot<00:02:56.160> you

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
seem to have toned this town a lot you

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.560 
seem to have toned this town a lot you
can<00:02:57.240> kind<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.350> weird<00:02:58.560> jetpack<00:02:59.040> thing

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
can kind of do that weird jetpack thing

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.970 
can kind of do that weird jetpack thing
but<00:03:00.570> it's<00:03:00.720> slower<00:03:00.960> in<00:03:01.140> advanced<00:03:01.470> warfare<00:03:01.830> when

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
but it's slower in advanced warfare when

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.920 
but it's slower in advanced warfare when
you<00:03:02.010> hit<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.400> button<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:03.030> use<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.540> jetpack

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
you hit that button to use the jetpack

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.180 
you hit that button to use the jetpack
thingamajigger<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.590> don't<00:03:04.800> remember<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.100> name

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
thingamajigger I don't remember the name

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.430 
thingamajigger I don't remember the name
of<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.460> you<00:03:06.270> pretty<00:03:06.450> much<00:03:06.570> instantly<00:03:07.170> boost

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
of it you pretty much instantly boost

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.070 
of it you pretty much instantly boost

was fun black ops 1 was really fun black
ops<00:03:27.450> 2<00:03:27.630> was<00:03:27.920> pretty<00:03:28.920> much<00:03:29.040> changed<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.760> way

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
ops 2 was pretty much changed the way

the<00:03:30.150> alert<00:03:30.390> systems<00:03:30.840> work<00:03:31.050> in<00:03:31.200> all<00:03:31.320> this<00:03:31.470> I

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
the alert systems work in all this I

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.680 
the alert systems work in all this I
mean<00:03:32.520> at<00:03:32.670> this<00:03:32.850> point<00:03:32.940> treyarch<00:03:33.570> is

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
mean at this point treyarch is

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.690 
mean at this point treyarch is
definitely<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.260> better<00:03:34.560> company<00:03:35.400> out<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.550> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
definitely the better company out of the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.650

two out of the three i should say i mean
i<00:03:39.750> think<00:03:39.810> pretty<00:03:40.110> much<00:03:40.260> everyone<00:03:40.590> would<00:03:40.739> be

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
i think pretty much everyone would be

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.830 
i think pretty much everyone would be
confident<00:03:41.190> saying<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.520> now<00:03:41.670> i<00:03:41.880> don't

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840

far I figured I'd lined that shut up
shut<00:03:53.250> up<00:03:53.580> shut<00:03:53.880> up<00:03:54.239> whatever<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.140> works<00:03:55.320> too

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
shut up shut up whatever that works too

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.590 
shut up shut up whatever that works too
about<00:03:56.610> as<00:03:56.700> well<00:03:56.790> guarantee<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.300> might<00:03:57.420> die

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
about as well guarantee it I might die

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.030 
about as well guarantee it I might die
