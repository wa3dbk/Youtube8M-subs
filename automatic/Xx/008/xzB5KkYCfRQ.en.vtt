very welcome please put your glasses
back<00:00:10.309> on<00:00:11.590> in<00:00:12.590> fact<00:00:12.830> I'm<00:00:13.219> going<00:00:13.280> to<00:00:13.519> be<00:00:13.639> in<00:00:13.670> 3d<00:00:14.139> so

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
back on in fact I'm going to be in 3d so

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.210 
back on in fact I'm going to be in 3d so
look<00:00:15.589> at<00:00:15.710> the<00:00:15.799> monitor<00:00:16.219> not<00:00:17.000> me

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.019 

now<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> had<00:00:21.240> before<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.750> start<00:00:22.789> we<00:00:23.789> should

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
now I had before we start we should

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.259 
now I had before we start we should
calibrate<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:25.169> instrument<00:00:25.820> so<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.240> that

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
calibrate the instrument so that so that

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.650 
calibrate the instrument so that so that
it<00:00:27.449> works<00:00:27.630> partner<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> could<00:00:29.520> ask<00:00:29.669> us

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
it works partner and so I could ask us

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.069 
it works partner and so I could ask us
to<00:00:30.960> bring<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.680> the<00:00:32.340> electronic<00:00:33.329> calibration

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
to bring on the electronic calibration

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.270 
to bring on the electronic calibration
system<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.649> could<00:00:34.769> just<00:00:34.800> look<00:00:35.040> at<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
system if you could just look at the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.090 
system if you could just look at the
holes<00:00:35.519> I<00:00:36.140> know<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.620> cheap<00:00:37.890> trick<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:40.890> it

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
holes I know this is a cheap trick is it

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.639 
holes I know this is a cheap trick is it
working<00:00:41.400> for<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:48.170> thank<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.290> very<00:00:49.470> much<00:00:49.620> for

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
working for you thank you very much for

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.000 
working for you thank you very much for
that<00:00:49.890> calibration<00:00:50.339> I'm<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.510> I'm<00:00:51.839> idea<00:00:52.379> grow

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that calibration I'm like I'm idea grow

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.380 
that calibration I'm like I'm idea grow
up<00:00:53.040> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.339> sixties<00:00:53.790> I<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.839> born<00:00:55.650> to<00:00:55.739> 60
