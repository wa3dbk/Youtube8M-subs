00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.399
 I have my dear spectator again 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.740
 name is still jan gustafsson and 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.049
 I'm still blatantly talkative 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.759
 busy or lover lightning capable 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.610
 chatter is actually always in the 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.760
 active vocabulary for this purpose 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.949
 I am now in the jazz 24 place where 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.289
 I was told that already a lot 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.990
 dangerous opponent is waiting for me 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.720
 none other than our video author 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.960
 Maximilian Meinhardt is the one I think 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.740
 who hides behind this 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.830
 pseudonym asterix i lon and there he has 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.630
 already made a move 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.470
 we have to go green for that now 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.510
 We'll leave him a bit 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.940
 Wait the clock is only starting when 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.680
 I made a move I think 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.330
 I am e5 wm the good old days 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.820
 springer after 26 defend my farmers 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.500
 he plays the d-4d scottish package i 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.400
 also believe in this topic on the video 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.620
 series 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.750
 Of course not a very good opening 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.820
 I must confess I have his series 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.850
 he has not yet studied five of the seven 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.729
 far as I know there with two springer t5 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.609
 c4 is every deduction after which the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.439
 Chairman divorced ghost runner a6 or 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.289
 springer b6 plays second runner 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.079
 a6 played springer b6 lately 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.710
 popular times what the colleague 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.899
 here in contrast has b3 also on 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.020
 a main g6 runner is seen 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:36.530
 always my recipe f4 and here the six 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.259
 At the time my innovation was in one 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.609
 partie against everton soft 34 times already 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.710
 played in tournament games 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.569
 mostly forget the theory is very 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.130
 complicated but i believe that it does 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.069
 actually a good position for 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.609
 black will runner a3 is not me 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.509
 known 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:55.819
 I do not really want to go with you right now 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.740
 make fun of the series of videos 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.380
 desk of a valued author 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.819
 but perhaps because he has his own 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.990
 also study a bit 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.459
 because I have the impression that I am 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.280
 already completely upset 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.990
 maybe jumper will experience 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.590
 Of course, deceiving may seem like me 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.770
 do not believe it 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.290
 for effect d6 I could, for example lady 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.379
 beats gc 2 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.390
 he entangled two lives g7 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.879
 play and also his tower in the corner 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.709
 easy problems would have and otherwise 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.099
 I do not really see what he's doing 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.200
 can 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.510
 He also writes bitterly in chat 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.819
 and give up so take a look 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.680
 series of videos to the scottish partie of 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.420
 you learn this maximilian mainhardter 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.980
 tricks and much more 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.230
 maybe also how to do this variant 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.909
 plays well we see each other 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.200
 next video if we decide 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.269
 to publish these 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.170
 thanks for the attention and the 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.170
 six a good move
