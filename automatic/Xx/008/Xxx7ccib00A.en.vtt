00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 clear your mind fly without destinies 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.970
 nothing stops you choose yourself if not you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.490
 you choose the steps to walk the road you know what 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.170
 that I am and what I dominate and see more hello 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.700
 such guys in this video I will 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.320
 teach another of the combinations of 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.260
 colors that I like the most for 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.699
 cars here in gta 5 I already know that what 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.380
 I do in the environment because for my taste 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.060
 is the most customizable car and that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.369
 better is once you get several 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.439
 different colors and once we have 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.689
 caught the car we want to paint that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.250
 We want to disguise it so to speak 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.349
 we'll do is go to losantos custom 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.860
 and put the main color of color 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.540
 primary we will put a metallic blue 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.640
 once we put the blue blue has 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.260
 to be the one that we like the most to my liking 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.850
 the darker the prettier the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.100
 combination of colors but for tastes 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.480
 the colors and the grace of this of the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.370
 colors so we can each give you 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.140
 that little personalized touch so that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.510
 Each car is unique and different from the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.309
 other or at least the most unique 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.949
 we can get that is what we most 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.289
 would like everyone to have exclusive cars 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.870
 unique cars where these are ways of 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.160
 leave them a little more exclusive a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.960
 little bit more unique and that are 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.180
 combinations that everyone does not carry 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.770
 once we have put the blue 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.510
 in what we will have to do will be 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.580
 put pearl yellow 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.320
 races once we have it on 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.180
 I could give you an account that is a 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.770
 color that does not change just a little bit that 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.800
 makes the car change a lot of 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.810
 aspect and gives a very very cool touch 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.760
 the car is very nice then 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.860
 simply putting a red of 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.619
 secondary we'll get the car 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.210
 is absolutely spectacular so 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.310

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.290

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.979
 to make a pig and even the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.240

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.280
 mine and look at yours throwing for mine 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.080
 waiting for the future will be the wisest thing to do 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.180
 I feel I intuit the step of envy and 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.250
 rivalry however much you lose I'm not going to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.780
 win for that and avoid trying to push me away 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.450
 his breath in my face is going to poison me 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.430
