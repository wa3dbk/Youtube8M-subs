00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and this one is called CPU speed

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.310 
and this one is called CPU speed
accelerator<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:13.670> honestly<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:15.000> mean<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.450> say<00:00:15.750> in

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
accelerator and honestly I mean I say in

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.710 
accelerator and honestly I mean I say in
almost<00:00:16.500> every<00:00:17.010> single<00:00:17.130> app<00:00:17.310> review<00:00:17.720> another

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
almost every single app review another

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.410 
almost every single app review another
amazing<00:00:19.439> application<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.119> found

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
amazing application that can be found

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.070 
amazing application that can be found
for<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.109> Macintosh<00:00:22.800> right<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.869> what<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.960> does

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
for the Macintosh right so what it does

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019 
for the Macintosh right so what it does
is<00:00:25.380> simply<00:00:26.010> what<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> name<00:00:26.430> says<00:00:27.000> it

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
is simply what the name says it

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.410 
is simply what the name says it
accelerates<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.349> speed<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.980> your<00:00:29.010> CPU<00:00:29.429> now

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
accelerates the speed of your CPU now

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.730 
accelerates the speed of your CPU now
you<00:00:30.480> must<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.900> thinking<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.470> another

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
you must be thinking this is another

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.490 
you must be thinking this is another
kind<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:33.000> know<00:00:33.120> cleaning<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.809> utilities

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
kind of you know cleaning up utilities

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.130 
kind of you know cleaning up utilities
like<00:00:34.620> CleanMyMac<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.660> some<00:00:36.660> other<00:00:36.870> kind<00:00:37.050> of

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
like CleanMyMac or some other kind of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.709 
like CleanMyMac or some other kind of
fake<00:00:37.950> application<00:00:38.820> doesn't<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.420> anything

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
fake application doesn't do anything

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.530 
fake application doesn't do anything
well<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.850> there<00:00:41.850> are<00:00:41.969> many<00:00:42.239> many

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
well you know what there are many many

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.139 
well you know what there are many many
people<00:00:42.690> around<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.290> world<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:44.489> proven

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
people around the world that have proven

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.170 
people around the world that have proven
the<00:00:45.660> difference<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.590> difference<00:00:47.000> that<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the difference the difference that it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.900 
the difference the difference that it
gives<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:48.899> CPU<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.610> honestly<00:00:50.610> when

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
gives you to your CPU and honestly when

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.450 
gives you to your CPU and honestly when
I<00:00:50.940> try<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.750> actually<00:00:52.110> increased<00:00:52.800> my

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
I try this it actually increased my

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.939 
I try this it actually increased my
speed<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.090> my<00:00:54.180> performance<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.960> my<00:00:55.079> Mac<00:00:55.289> by

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
speed and my performance of my Mac by

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.189 
speed and my performance of my Mac by
around<00:00:56.640> 20<00:00:57.000> percent<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.480> would<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.079> agree

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
around 20 percent I would have to agree

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.770 
around 20 percent I would have to agree
with<00:00:58.649> everyone<00:00:58.890> else<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> it's<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.390> completely

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
with everyone else and it's a completely

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.869 
with everyone else and it's a completely
background<00:01:01.379> application<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> only<00:01:02.430> runs<00:01:02.609> in

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
background application it only runs in

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.149 
background application it only runs in
your<00:01:03.090> menu<00:01:03.270> bar<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.690> again<00:01:04.559> very<00:01:04.890> lightweight

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
your menu bar and again very lightweight

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.580 
your menu bar and again very lightweight
very<00:01:05.610> small<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.080> powerful

other applications running in the
background<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.590> yeah<00:02:31.709> I'm<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> Safari

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
background so so yeah I'm in a Safari

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.199 
background so so yeah I'm in a Safari
and<00:02:33.450> Firefox<00:02:33.920> at<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:34.980> same<00:02:35.130> time<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.610> CPU<00:02:35.940> is

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
and Firefox at the same time the CPU is

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.540 
and Firefox at the same time the CPU is
giving<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:36.900> Firefox<00:02:37.319> more<00:02:37.560> attention<00:02:37.980> than<00:02:38.400> to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
giving in Firefox more attention than to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.550 
giving in Firefox more attention than to
Safari<00:02:38.910> if<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.180> switch<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.420> Safari<00:02:39.930> now<00:02:40.350> let's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560
