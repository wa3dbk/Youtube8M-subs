00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.690
 such I am triforce and here we have a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.840
 Video test with samsung galaxy 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:10.740
 out 3 recording quality 4k that's 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.929
 equal to 4 times full hd maybe in 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.389
 youtube does not appreciate very much a quality anymore 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.880
 that compresses it but then of a chance 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.710
 and prods and quality option 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.519
 original maybe on other computers 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.160
 do not support it because of the codecs but 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.390
 well let's do the test this no longer 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.529
 is updated here to kit kat 44.2 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.410
 basically I want to see if there are improvements or 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.120
 deterioration in video and audio quality 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.880
 so you are going to tell me how it is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.710
 see how you hear that such focuses 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.710
 treat the established stabilization 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.910
 the colors 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.480
 they happen from six in the afternoon 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.829
 then almost there is no sun here in the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.250
 Mexico City we are in the middle 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.250
 central 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.059
 I'm going to make a small zoom to see 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.610
 how are they doing it 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.979
 the experience is 1 and also go to 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.899
 record here to this area when zooming in 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.939
 mesh is everything is pixelated practically 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:17.110
 from all the detail we will see that 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.110
 We are basically 3 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.190
 how can you see keep retaining the 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.880
 detail when you have after him no 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.880
 it looks very good 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.780
 to the tables of tomorrow 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.470
 it still looks pretty pretty good 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.250
 very roughly in a test of 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.980
 video a video test and recording with the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.260
 galaxy 3 actually four capos then what 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.720
 can see the game h of qualities 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.110
 inferiors and you will continue to see very 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.110
 very well 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.840
 the studio teams was paying for 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.500
 medical gates and see you until the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.500
 next
