also have coaches with the Bucks so
that's<00:01:40.200> part<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> reason<00:01:40.710> why<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.040> so

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that's part of the reason why this is so

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.859 
that's part of the reason why this is so
fun<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> coaches<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.360> don't<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
fun is the coaches really don't have to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.469 
fun is the coaches really don't have to
move<00:01:43.049> too<00:01:43.950> much<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.579> they<00:01:44.939> still<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.360> mess

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
move too much but they still get to mess

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.120 
move too much but they still get to mess
around<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.720> pucks<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.229> bit<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.979> what

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130

to<00:04:19.760> watch<00:04:19.970> out<00:04:20.239> for<00:04:20.269> is<00:04:21.580> first<00:04:22.580> of<00:04:22.730> all<00:04:22.820> just

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
to watch out for is first of all just

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.940 
to watch out for is first of all just
insist<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.200> players<00:04:24.410> can't<00:04:24.740> leave

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
insist that the players can't leave

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.640 
insist that the players can't leave
until<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:25.430> shots<00:04:25.639> taken<00:04:26.060> if<00:04:26.210> they<00:04:26.660> start<00:04:26.960> you

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
until that shots taken if they start you

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.590 
until that shots taken if they start you
know<00:04:27.710> leaving<00:04:28.040> too<00:04:28.280> early<00:04:28.580> then<00:04:28.730> you<00:04:29.060> know<00:04:29.480> the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
know leaving too early then you know the

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.090 
know leaving too early then you know the
drill<00:04:29.750> doesn't<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.410> doesn't<00:04:30.680> have<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.889> same

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
drill doesn't it doesn't have the same

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.730 
drill doesn't it doesn't have the same
the<00:04:32.090> same<00:04:32.270> feel<00:04:32.510> because<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:33.110> player<00:04:33.320> picking

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
the same feel because the player picking

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.020 
the same feel because the player picking
up<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.919> past<00:04:34.130> is<00:04:34.310> going<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.520> be<00:04:34.580> so<00:04:34.760> far<00:04:34.910> ahead

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
up the past is going to be so far ahead

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.300 
up the past is going to be so far ahead
of<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.210> play<00:04:35.419> that<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:36.500> motivation<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.070> catch

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
of the play that the motivation to catch

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.070 
of the play that the motivation to catch
them<00:04:37.460> isn't<00:04:37.669> there<00:04:37.820> one<00:04:38.419> thing<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.660> like<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.840> do

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
them isn't there one thing I like to do

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.050 
them isn't there one thing I like to do
is<00:04:39.320> tell<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.590> guys<00:04:39.740> if<00:04:39.979> you<00:04:40.310> catch<00:04:40.580> up<00:04:40.820> to<00:04:40.970> your

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
is tell the guys if you catch up to your

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.330 
is tell the guys if you catch up to your
guy<00:04:41.270> take<00:04:42.229> the<00:04:42.260> puck<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.800> then<00:04:42.889> you<00:04:43.070> can<00:04:43.250> take

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
guy take the puck and then you can take

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.930 
guy take the puck and then you can take
the<00:04:43.460> shot

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
the shot

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.790 
the shot
so<00:04:44.360> potentially<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.110> can<00:04:45.229> get<00:04:45.380> two<00:04:45.560> shots

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
so potentially you can get two shots

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.620 
so potentially you can get two shots
sometimes<00:04:46.220> that's<00:04:46.400> motivating<00:04:46.850> for<00:04:47.030> for<00:04:47.570> the

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
sometimes that's motivating for for the

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.840 
sometimes that's motivating for for the
players<00:04:47.979> but<00:04:48.979> at<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.280> end<00:04:49.400> of<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.520> day<00:04:49.669> it's

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
players but at the end of the day it's

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.550 
players but at the end of the day it's
it's<00:04:50.090> a<00:04:50.300> pretty<00:04:50.479> good<00:04:50.660> drill<00:04:50.810> because<00:04:50.900> you're

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
it's a pretty good drill because you're

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.890 
it's a pretty good drill because you're
being<00:04:51.740> chased<00:04:51.979> on<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.340> way<00:04:52.430> down<00:04:52.610> so<00:04:52.910> it's<00:04:53.810> a
