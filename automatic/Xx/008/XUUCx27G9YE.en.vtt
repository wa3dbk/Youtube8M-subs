in going to Disney I realized something

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.750 
in going to Disney I realized something
that<00:06:20.080> I<00:06:20.110> just<00:06:20.230> can't<00:06:20.710> go<00:06:21.010> without<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.610> it's

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
that I just can't go without and it's

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.850

vitamins<00:06:22.420> I<00:06:22.690> don't<00:06:22.900> know<00:06:22.990> why<00:06:23.230> I'm<00:06:23.560> such<00:06:23.830> a

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
vitamins I don't know why I'm such a

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.130 
vitamins I don't know why I'm such a
rebel<00:06:24.250> but<00:06:24.550> I've<00:06:24.670> always<00:06:24.970> wanted<00:06:25.150> to<00:06:25.660> just<00:06:25.840> not

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
rebel but I've always wanted to just not

rebel but I've always wanted to just not
take<00:06:26.680> vitamins<00:06:26.920> and<00:06:27.550> I<00:06:27.730> think<00:06:27.940> it<00:06:28.000> started

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
take vitamins and I think it started

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.270 
take vitamins and I think it started
because<00:06:28.780> I'm<00:06:29.110> just<00:06:29.350> really<00:06:29.800> bad<00:06:29.980> at

because I'm just really bad at
swallowing<00:06:30.730> pills<00:06:31.060> and<00:06:31.570> so<00:06:31.930> it<00:06:32.260> makes<00:06:32.560> me<00:06:32.830> gag

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
swallowing pills and so it makes me gag

swallowing pills and so it makes me gag
even<00:06:33.460> the<00:06:33.580> thought<00:06:33.820> of<00:06:33.850> it<00:06:34.150> so<00:06:34.480> so<00:06:34.990> I've<00:06:35.110> just

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
even the thought of it so so I've just

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.050
