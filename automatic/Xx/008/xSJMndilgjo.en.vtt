00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.590
 as much as stars shine in the sky 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.590

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.190
 our brain burned and not like 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.190
 a virus 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.570

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.350
 like a chocolate bar is not so 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.940
 Worth a lot like a chocolate bar 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:47.209
 chocolate bar costs one euro 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:49.850
 this amount of money more because again it 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.700
 must be crass and the controls the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.850
 question with meets you the question concerns 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.190
 actually not audi and where have 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:05.330

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:08.709
 by robbies mother beat match 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.709
 counting kommune into the cinema 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.380
 to 8 the rear place 1 in the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.510
 kinocharts course pace on one 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:28.050
 made 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:32.100
 but here in the list which bvg you 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:41.880
 But you have that I would not have 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:44.910
 promoted as stayed wanted here so 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.650
 The picture has grown under pressure here 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.600
 have grown 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:55.530
 no question at minute 216 know 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:58.170
 it is not what you think who is good 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.209
 there the person does not want us 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.440
 but that's what I can reveal 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.910
 it is someone from the team betrayed 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.519
 usually does not look so relaxed and 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.750
 combines 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.970
 I will not betray you now 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.590
 that would be unfair to colors 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.199
 that would not be so good for finding some new ones 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.630
 why does the milk instead of sparkling wine 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.540
 or other milchbubi really wanted 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.360
 that I get drunk 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.430
 yes, I'm proud of that, no one 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.260
 Alcohol drinks yes that I prefer milk 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.169
 or something instead of drinking beer 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.139
 and sparkling wine and the whole 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.250
 shit it was one on her penner though 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.180
 no million milk cows are you 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.530
 really jumped off the roof 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.039
 nonsense of course does not want 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.430
 to jump from the roof committed 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:52.199
 one-time intern Katharina has 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.150
 nobody would stand a stunt double 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.970
 do not use highly professional either 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.680
 daily, therefore , not only halfway through 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.850
 is not often experienced already 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.070
 but still with certain limitations 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.690
 yes the growth again with the
