00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.190
 when two metal plates meet you have things like that next to you 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.680
 pictures also need some other things as first of course one 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.959
 soldering iron 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.039
 and so fat in it 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.939
 but also area 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.939
 and a clamp for holding the place 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.339
 first prepare your pictures 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.039
 take care of this the bottom picture so sign it off you 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.480
 know exactly where the top places should go 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.540
 because then a poem 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.270
 and they are the top places for it 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.270
 plan it firmly with him clamp 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.200
 this way you prevent it from shifting from the top place during the 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.570
 to sort 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.690
 2 now the picture with this plan and the weight 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.940
 at the bottom 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 marked on the line again 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.950
 now you can start sorting 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.870
 with a warm sun to be found so quickly meanwhile two places are entering 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.880
 iron and smooth every time 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.110
 because a bumpy thick connection in worse than a thin plate 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 link 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.580
 do the smoothing out by bringing the soldering irons each through and have 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.580
 you need a little extra time you can do it this way 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.770
 but make sure that you struggle with ease that is the most important thing 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.570
 you can see here that this piece is not good and this piece is already 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.210
 of course the ones should come to look like this 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.060
 you can also see that the child has completely landed 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.370
 this means that it is still warm 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.510
 but not where one places in the intermediate position 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.410
 nevertheless the magic word 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.410
 when the dow is, you can pick up the little one 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.910
 and there the pictures put it together 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.699
 good luck 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:17.189
 and of course always saw to it that you neatly tidy everything when you're done
