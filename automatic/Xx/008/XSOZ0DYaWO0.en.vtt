okay<00:00:02.920> so<00:00:02.980> here<00:00:03.610> we<00:00:03.639> are<00:00:03.730> in<00:00:04.029> Lightwave<00:00:04.540> now<00:00:04.779> and

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
okay so here we are in Lightwave now and

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.110 
okay so here we are in Lightwave now and
basically<00:00:06.250> I'm<00:00:06.700> just<00:00:06.850> going<00:00:06.970> to<00:00:07.000> demonstrate

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 
basically I'm just going to demonstrate

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.119 
basically I'm just going to demonstrate
this<00:00:07.600> with<00:00:07.660> a<00:00:08.260> mesh<00:00:08.680> that<00:00:08.710> I've<00:00:08.950> created

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.129 
this with a mesh that I've created

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.709 
this with a mesh that I've created
before<00:00:09.490> this<00:00:09.610> is<00:00:09.730> a<00:00:09.760> sort<00:00:10.030> base<00:00:10.240> head<00:00:10.510> that<00:00:10.660> I

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
before this is a sort base head that I

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.449 
before this is a sort base head that I
use<00:00:10.869> for<00:00:11.049> a<00:00:11.080> lot<00:00:11.199> of<00:00:11.230> stuff<00:00:11.469> it's<00:00:11.949> not<00:00:12.070> perfect

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
use for a lot of stuff it's not perfect

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:13.769 
use for a lot of stuff it's not perfect
by<00:00:12.549> any<00:00:12.580> stretch<00:00:12.760> of<00:00:12.969> the<00:00:13.119> imagination<00:00:13.209> then

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:13.779 
by any stretch of the imagination then

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.980 
by any stretch of the imagination then
it's<00:00:13.930> it's<00:00:14.469> available<00:00:14.650> with<00:00:15.010> this<00:00:15.160> tutorial

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
it's it's available with this tutorial

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.030 
it's it's available with this tutorial
so<00:00:16.990> they<00:00:17.170> you<00:00:17.230> can<00:00:17.320> see<00:00:17.440> I've<00:00:17.529> just<00:00:17.560> already

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
so they you can see I've just already

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.470 
so they you can see I've just already
loaded<00:00:18.400> in<00:00:18.490> the<00:00:18.580> front<00:00:18.820> and<00:00:19.060> slowed<00:00:19.300> in<00:00:19.420> the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
loaded in the front and slowed in the

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.220 
loaded in the front and slowed in the
other<00:00:19.600> two<00:00:19.780> images<00:00:21.240> okay<00:00:22.240> so<00:00:22.300> I<00:00:22.630> will<00:00:22.930> just<00:00:23.050> a

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
other two images okay so I will just a

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.310 
other two images okay so I will just a
vote<00:00:23.860> in<00:00:24.040> all<00:00:24.310> three<00:00:24.520> of<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.640> images<00:00:24.970> there

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
vote in all three of the images there

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.500 
vote in all three of the images there
front<00:00:26.320> side<00:00:26.530> and<00:00:26.650> back<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.970> what<00:00:28.330> we're<00:00:28.420> gonna

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
front side and back and what we're gonna

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.500 
front side and back and what we're gonna
do<00:00:28.690> here<00:00:28.840> now<00:00:29.050> set<00:00:29.289> up<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.860> backgrounds

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
do here now set up the the backgrounds

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.850 
do here now set up the the backgrounds
so<00:00:31.510> we<00:00:31.600> can<00:00:31.720> use<00:00:31.840> them<00:00:31.960> as<00:00:32.140> modeling<00:00:32.439> reference

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
so we can use them as modeling reference

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.800 
so we can use them as modeling reference
and<00:00:33.070> stretch<00:00:33.850> this<00:00:34.000> mesh<00:00:34.239> to<00:00:34.420> kind<00:00:34.570> of<00:00:34.660> fit

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
and stretch this mesh to kind of fit

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.390 
and stretch this mesh to kind of fit
what<00:00:35.560> we<00:00:35.650> want<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.860> do<00:00:35.950> is<00:00:36.040> look<00:00:36.190> at<00:00:36.310> these

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
what we want to do is look at these

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.800 
what we want to do is look at these
dimensions<00:00:36.880> here<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.150> actual<00:00:37.390> size<00:00:37.600> of<00:00:37.750> the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
dimensions here the actual size of the

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.080 
dimensions here the actual size of the
image<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:39.160> we're<00:00:39.280> going<00:00:39.310> to<00:00:39.460> basically<00:00:39.610> draw

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
image and we're going to basically draw

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.639 
image and we're going to basically draw
some<00:00:40.270> boxes<00:00:40.720> and<00:00:40.750> these<00:00:40.960> boxes<00:00:41.350> are<00:00:41.470> going<00:00:41.560> to

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
some boxes and these boxes are going to

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.710 
some boxes and these boxes are going to
be<00:00:41.770> our<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.280> used<00:00:42.910> to<00:00:43.000> define<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.329> actual

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
be our and used to define the actual

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.050 
be our and used to define the actual
size<00:00:43.989> of<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.770> background<00:00:45.160> image<00:00:45.399> so

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
size of the the background image so

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.580 
size of the the background image so
we're<00:00:46.180> going<00:00:46.270> to<00:00:46.329> be<00:00:46.450> we're<00:00:46.989> going<00:00:47.079> to<00:00:47.230> type<00:00:47.380> in

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
we're going to be we're going to type in

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.040 
we're going to be we're going to type in
the<00:00:47.770> dimensions<00:00:48.550> of<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.450> actual<00:00:49.720> pixel

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
the dimensions of the the actual pixel

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.750 
the dimensions of the the actual pixel
size<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.530> image<00:00:50.739> here<00:00:50.950> into<00:00:51.340> their<00:00:51.489> width

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
size of the image here into their width

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.970 
size of the image here into their width
and<00:00:51.970> height<00:00:52.149> of<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.540> front<00:00:52.750> so<00:00:53.559> we<00:00:53.649> know<00:00:53.800> that

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
and height of the front so we know that

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.490 
and height of the front so we know that
this<00:00:54.070> box<00:00:54.309> is<00:00:54.550> exactly<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.210> same<00:00:55.390> size<00:00:55.660> as<00:00:56.050> or

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
this box is exactly the same size as or

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.750 
this box is exactly the same size as or
same<00:00:56.739> dimensions<00:00:57.309> as<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:59.200> actual

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
same dimensions as the the actual

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.520 
same dimensions as the the actual
reference<00:01:00.760> image<00:01:01.090> and<00:01:01.930> now<00:01:02.020> there<00:01:02.200> we<00:01:02.290> have<00:01:02.410> it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
reference image and now there we have it

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.750 
reference image and now there we have it
and<00:01:02.649> it's<00:01:02.770> a<00:01:02.829> bit<00:01:02.980> large<00:01:03.190> at<00:01:03.340> the<00:01:03.399> moment<00:01:03.670> but

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
and it's a bit large at the moment but

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.310 
and it's a bit large at the moment but
we'll<00:01:03.910> fix<00:01:04.089> that<00:01:04.210> in<00:01:04.329> a<00:01:04.390> second<00:01:04.719> don't<00:01:04.960> worry<00:01:05.110> I

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
we'll fix that in a second don't worry I

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.080 
we'll fix that in a second don't worry I
know<00:01:05.890> we'll<00:01:06.069> just<00:01:06.100> give<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:06.639> surface<00:01:06.939> name

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
know we'll just give that surface name

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.559 
know we'll just give that surface name
we'll<00:01:07.209> just<00:01:07.329> call<00:01:07.479> it<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.659> base<00:01:08.590> head<00:01:08.859> front<00:01:09.569> and

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:10.569 
we'll just call it a base head front and

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:14.219 
we'll just call it a base head front and
okay<00:01:11.399> and<00:01:12.399> now<00:01:12.520> we'll<00:01:12.639> just<00:01:12.670> create<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.090> box<00:01:14.020> for

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
okay and now we'll just create a box for

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.660 
okay and now we'll just create a box for
the<00:01:14.289> side<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.950> you'll<00:01:15.130> see<00:01:15.249> why<00:01:15.369> I'm<00:01:15.459> doing

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
the side and you'll see why I'm doing

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.929 
the side and you'll see why I'm doing
this<00:01:15.789> in<00:01:15.939> a<00:01:15.999> moment<00:01:16.149> it's<00:01:16.420> very<00:01:16.479> very<00:01:16.780> handy<00:01:17.109> I

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
this in a moment it's very very handy I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.359 
this in a moment it's very very handy I
know<00:01:18.939> just<00:01:19.119> exactly<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.539> same<00:01:19.719> process

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
know just exactly the same process

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.569 
know just exactly the same process
create<00:01:21.369> box<00:01:21.579> the<00:01:22.569> side<00:01:23.159> left<00:01:24.159> hand<00:01:24.279> side

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
create box the side left hand side

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.300 
create box the side left hand side
darkness<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:26.049> then<00:01:26.319> just<00:01:26.560> again<00:01:26.829> there<00:01:27.189> at

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
darkness and then just again there at

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.529 
darkness and then just again there at
the<00:01:27.459> pixel<00:01:27.880> size<00:01:27.909> I<00:01:28.060> mean<00:01:28.270> we<00:01:28.389> know<00:01:28.509> it's

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
the pixel size I mean we know it's

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.149 
the pixel size I mean we know it's
exactly<00:01:28.929> the<00:01:29.049> same<00:01:29.200> as<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.350> last<00:01:29.499> one<00:01:29.649> so<00:01:30.009> we

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
exactly the same as the last one so we

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.319 
exactly the same as the last one so we
want<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.369> take<00:01:30.490> these<00:01:30.609> into<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.969> height<00:01:31.179> and

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
want to take these into the height and

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.069 
want to take these into the height and
the<00:01:31.389> depth<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:31.840> time<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.759> just<00:01:34.060> copy<00:01:34.840> those

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
the depth this time so just copy those

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.690 
the depth this time so just copy those
dimensions<00:01:35.499> in<00:01:35.649> there<00:01:35.859> obviously<00:01:36.340> don't<00:01:36.520> need

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
dimensions in there obviously don't need

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.359 
dimensions in there obviously don't need
a<00:01:36.729> millimeter<00:01:37.179> so<00:01:37.420> it's<00:01:37.569> not<00:01:37.689> gigantic

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
a millimeter so it's not gigantic

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.949 
a millimeter so it's not gigantic
and<00:01:39.369> it's<00:01:40.029> tuck<00:01:40.479> them<00:01:40.599> in<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.689> wrong<00:01:40.810> way

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
and it's tuck them in the wrong way

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.800 
and it's tuck them in the wrong way
around<00:01:41.049> sorry<00:01:41.499> I<00:01:41.799> should<00:01:42.219> swap<00:01:43.209> the<00:01:43.420> air<00:01:43.539> depth

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
around sorry I should swap the air depth

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.970 
around sorry I should swap the air depth
with<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.139> height<00:01:44.319> there

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.320 

then<00:01:47.980> you'll<00:01:48.130> just<00:01:48.400> see<00:01:48.760> him<00:01:48.910> how<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:49.240> is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
then you'll just see him how this is

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.350 
then you'll just see him how this is
gonna<00:01:49.420> work<00:01:50.460> okay<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:51.820> now<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:52.000> can<00:01:52.120> see<00:01:52.240> we've

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
gonna work okay so now you can see we've

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.680 
gonna work okay so now you can see we've
got<00:01:52.390> two<00:01:53.050> boxes<00:01:53.440> now<00:01:53.620> and<00:01:54.400> both<00:01:55.090> exactly<00:01:55.480> the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
got two boxes now and both exactly the

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.080 
got two boxes now and both exactly the
same<00:01:55.870> dimensions<00:01:56.290> as<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.920> two<00:01:57.730> reference

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
same dimensions as the two reference

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.240 
same dimensions as the two reference
image<00:01:58.270> images<00:01:59.140> for<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.800> front<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:00.190> the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
image images for the the front and the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.170 
image images for the the front and the
side<00:02:00.660> so<00:02:01.660> we'll<00:02:01.750> just<00:02:01.930> call<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.430> side<00:02:03.430> and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
side so we'll just call that side and

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.790 
side so we'll just call that side and
that<00:02:04.420> now<00:02:04.570> what<00:02:04.690> we<00:02:04.720> want<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:04.990> do<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.320> uv-map

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
that now what we want to do is uv-map

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.700 
that now what we want to do is uv-map
both<00:02:06.250> these<00:02:06.400> boxes<00:02:06.640> so<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:08.080> will<00:02:08.380> start<00:02:08.560> with

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
both these boxes so I will start with

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.780 
both these boxes so I will start with
the<00:02:08.770> front<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.250> we'll<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.180> go<00:02:10.330> -<00:02:10.390> oh<00:02:11.790> sorry

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
the front and we'll just go - oh sorry

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.430 
the front and we'll just go - oh sorry
actually<00:02:13.150> no<00:02:13.270> first<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.570> all<00:02:13.690> I'll<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:13.900> set

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
actually no first of all I'll just set

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.070 
actually no first of all I'll just set
them<00:02:14.560> will<00:02:14.890> Center<00:02:15.220> them<00:02:15.340> using<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.880> f3<00:02:16.150> it's

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
them will Center them using the f3 it's

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.390 
them will Center them using the f3 it's
just<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.320> center<00:02:17.740> object<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.450> there<00:02:19.750> yeah<00:02:19.930> right

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
just a center object so there yeah right

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.770 
just a center object so there yeah right
now<00:02:21.400> will<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:21.790> will<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.330> beam<00:02:22.510> up<00:02:22.660> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
now will there will you beam up the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.650 
now will there will you beam up the
front<00:02:22.900> one<00:02:23.110> first<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.620> make<00:02:23.740> UV<00:02:24.510> we'll<00:02:25.510> just

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
front one first to make UV we'll just

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.330 
front one first to make UV we'll just
call<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.370> face<00:02:27.370> front<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:29.320> along<00:02:29.920> these<00:02:30.130> that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
call it face front and along these that

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.360 
call it face front and along these that
access<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.760> create<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:33.010> then<00:02:33.130> if<00:02:33.250> we<00:02:33.340> just

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
access and create and then if we just

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.100 
access and create and then if we just
look<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.700> new<00:02:33.820> V<00:02:34.090> texture<00:02:34.480> panel<00:02:34.630> here<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.900> can

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
look a new V texture panel here you can

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.560 
look a new V texture panel here you can
see<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.440> texture<00:02:36.130> there<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.300> again

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
see the texture there and just again

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.900 
see the texture there and just again
exactly<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.140> same<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.560> side<00:02:38.740> image<00:02:39.040> make

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
exactly the same to the side image make

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.570 
exactly the same to the side image make
you<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.860> face<00:02:41.860> side

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.650 

x-axis<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.600> time<00:02:46.810> obviously<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.440> create

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
x-axis this time obviously and create

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.030 
x-axis this time obviously and create
now<00:02:49.660> want<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:49.960> do<00:02:50.080> is<00:02:50.230> go<00:02:50.380> into<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:50.710> after

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
now want to do is go into this after

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.620 
now want to do is go into this after
senator<00:02:51.310> just<00:02:51.640> ignore<00:02:51.910> these<00:02:52.030> other<00:02:52.240> surfaces

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
senator just ignore these other surfaces

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.350 
senator just ignore these other surfaces
in<00:02:52.810> here<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.490> another<00:02:54.490> model<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:54.880> had<00:02:55.090> open

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
in here and another model that had open

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.050 
in here and another model that had open
earlier<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:56.290> I'll<00:02:56.440> just<00:02:56.650> select<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.340> face

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
earlier and I'll just select the face

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.420 
earlier and I'll just select the face
front<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:59.010> UV<00:03:00.010> map<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.660> like<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.280> week<00:03:03.280> right

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
front and UV map so like the week right

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.000 
front and UV map so like the week right
in<00:03:03.490> their<00:03:03.790> face<00:03:04.030> front<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.780> then<00:03:05.530> then<00:03:05.740> just

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
in their face front and then then just

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.980 
in their face front and then then just
select<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.580> image<00:03:06.850> which<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.300> our<00:03:07.450> face<00:03:07.720> front

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
select the image which is our face front

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.520 
select the image which is our face front
as<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.260> PSD<00:03:08.710> I<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:10.120> you'll<00:03:10.330> see<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.690> pop<00:03:11.380> up

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
as the PSD I know you'll see that pop up

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.620 
as the PSD I know you'll see that pop up
now<00:03:11.740> on<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:11.950> M<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:13.180> I've<00:03:13.270> got<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.450> wrong<00:03:13.570> one

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
now on the M so I've got the wrong one

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.960 
now on the M so I've got the wrong one
selected<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:15.010> pop<00:03:15.220> up<00:03:15.340> on<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.550> face<00:03:15.700> front

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
selected that pop up on the face front

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.600 
selected that pop up on the face front
reference<00:03:16.420> box<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:16.840> we've<00:03:16.960> made<00:03:17.140> there<00:03:17.610> okay

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
reference box that we've made there okay

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.010 
reference box that we've made there okay
so<00:03:18.670> we<00:03:18.790> know<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:18.940> those<00:03:19.150> pixel<00:03:19.600> dimensions

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
so we know that those pixel dimensions

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.800 
so we know that those pixel dimensions
are<00:03:20.170> identical<00:03:20.740> to<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.130> image<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:22.120> I

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
are identical to that of the image and I

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.270 
are identical to that of the image and I
just<00:03:22.990> do<00:03:23.080> exactly<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.650> same<00:03:23.680> thing<00:03:24.040> for<00:03:24.190> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
just do exactly the same thing for the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.950 
just do exactly the same thing for the
side<00:03:25.980> UV<00:03:26.980> map

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.290 

face<00:03:30.590> side<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.960> face<00:03:32.960> side<00:03:33.230> again<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:34.300> then

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
face side and face side again and then

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.550 
face side and face side again and then
if<00:03:35.390> we<00:03:35.480> just<00:03:35.600> look<00:03:35.750> at<00:03:35.840> those<00:03:35.990> you<00:03:36.110> can<00:03:36.410> see

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
if we just look at those you can see

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.190 
if we just look at those you can see
there<00:03:36.740> that<00:03:36.770> that's<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.840> it's<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:39.050> right

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
there that that's a it's the right

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.860 
there that that's a it's the right
dimensions<00:03:39.760> now<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:41.120> might<00:03:41.300> be<00:03:41.450> handy<00:03:41.570> just<00:03:41.750> to

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
dimensions now it might be handy just to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.150 
dimensions now it might be handy just to
make<00:03:41.960> this<00:03:42.050> double-sided<00:03:42.500> just<00:03:42.800> because<00:03:43.040> when

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
make this double-sided just because when

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.050 
make this double-sided just because when
you're<00:03:43.280> flipping<00:03:43.430> them<00:03:43.670> around<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:44.000> stuff

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
you're flipping them around and stuff

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.570 
you're flipping them around and stuff
it's<00:03:44.300> easier<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.690> see<00:03:44.810> them<00:03:44.960> from<00:03:45.110> both<00:03:45.260> sides

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
it's easier to see them from both sides

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.800 
it's easier to see them from both sides
so<00:03:46.580> to<00:03:46.730> switch<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.300> in<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.510> surface

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
so to switch that on in the surface

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.370 
so to switch that on in the surface
panel<00:03:47.990> layer<00:03:48.640> okay<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:50.630> that's<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.960> basic

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
panel layer okay so that's the basic

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.650 
panel layer okay so that's the basic
setup<00:03:51.500> using<00:03:51.980> geometry<00:03:52.190> for<00:03:52.670> our<00:03:53.360> reference

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
setup using geometry for our reference

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.810 
setup using geometry for our reference
now<00:03:53.810> what<00:03:54.440> we<00:03:54.560> want<00:03:54.710> to<00:03:54.800> do<00:03:54.920> is<00:03:55.130> apply<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.610> as

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
now what we want to do is apply that as

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.910 
now what we want to do is apply that as
background<00:03:56.120> images<00:03:56.600> in<00:03:56.780> light<00:03:56.960> wave<00:03:57.170> but<00:03:57.830> we

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
background images in light wave but we

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.800 
background images in light wave but we
want<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.160> match<00:03:58.520> this<00:03:58.700> geometry<00:03:58.910> roughly<00:03:59.600> to

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
want to match this geometry roughly to

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.780 
want to match this geometry roughly to
the<00:03:59.870> same<00:04:00.110> size<00:04:00.350> as<00:04:00.710> the<00:04:00.950> face<00:04:01.160> or<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.460> base

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
the same size as the face or the base

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.850 
the same size as the face or the base
mesh<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:02.210> we're<00:04:02.330> going<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.510> be<00:04:02.600> using<00:04:02.960> so

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
mesh that we're going to be using so

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.190 
mesh that we're going to be using so
what<00:04:04.040> we'll<00:04:04.190> do<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.670> we'll<00:04:04.940> just<00:04:05.150> them<00:04:05.360> to

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
what we'll do is we'll just them to

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.720 
what we'll do is we'll just them to
select<00:04:06.380> both<00:04:06.860> of<00:04:06.920> those<00:04:07.130> just<00:04:07.460> drag<00:04:07.700> that

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
select both of those just drag that

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.280 
select both of those just drag that
object<00:04:08.180> back<00:04:08.360> a<00:04:08.390> bit<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.870> can<00:04:08.930> see<00:04:09.020> there

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
object back a bit and you can see there

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.420 
object back a bit and you can see there
in<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.410> bottom<00:04:09.650> left<00:04:09.860> view<00:04:10.070> that<00:04:10.220> we've<00:04:10.310> now

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
in the bottom left view that we've now

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.280 
in the bottom left view that we've now
got<00:04:10.640> that<00:04:10.760> in<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:10.970> background<00:04:11.390> it's<00:04:11.930> not<00:04:12.110> yet

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
got that in the background it's not yet

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.170 
got that in the background it's not yet
a<00:04:12.470> background<00:04:13.340> reference<00:04:13.640> image<00:04:13.880> it's<00:04:14.030> still

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
a background reference image it's still

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.060 
a background reference image it's still
geometry<00:04:14.660> so<00:04:14.780> we<00:04:14.870> can<00:04:14.990> scale<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.290> very<00:04:15.860> very

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
geometry so we can scale it very very

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.280 
geometry so we can scale it very very
easily<00:04:16.330> and<00:04:17.330> I<00:04:17.420> what<00:04:17.570> we're<00:04:17.660> gonna<00:04:17.750> do<00:04:17.930> here<00:04:18.170> is

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
easily and I what we're gonna do here is

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.590 
easily and I what we're gonna do here is
just<00:04:18.320> sort<00:04:18.800> of<00:04:19.000> scale<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.090> box<00:04:20.270> around<00:04:20.420> and

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
just sort of scale the box around and

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.180 
just sort of scale the box around and
try<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:20.870> match<00:04:20.960> up<00:04:21.080> some<00:04:21.650> of<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.800> features<00:04:22.160> to

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
try and match up some of the features to

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.560 
try and match up some of the features to
the<00:04:22.460> features<00:04:22.760> on<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:22.940> mesh<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.360> mean

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
the features on the mesh I mean

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.670 
the features on the mesh I mean
obviously<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.930> mesh<00:04:24.080> looks<00:04:24.350> nothing<00:04:24.530> like

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
obviously the mesh looks nothing like

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.680 
obviously the mesh looks nothing like
the<00:04:24.830> sky<00:04:25.100> but<00:04:25.370> it's<00:04:26.000> always<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.210> good<00:04:26.360> starting

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
the sky but it's always a good starting

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.200 
the sky but it's always a good starting
point<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.140> have<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.670> eyes<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:29.150> the

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
point to have the and the eyes and the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.850 
point to have the and the eyes and the
mouth<00:04:29.330> in<00:04:29.600> roughly<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.080> right<00:04:30.170> position<00:04:30.650> you

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
mouth in roughly the right position you

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.880 
mouth in roughly the right position you
know<00:04:30.980> just<00:04:31.160> makes<00:04:31.310> things<00:04:31.520> easier<00:04:32.500> so<00:04:33.500> what's

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
know just makes things easier so what's

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.800 
know just makes things easier so what's
a<00:04:33.950> scaler<00:04:34.580> around<00:04:34.940> there<00:04:35.180> try<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:35.600> sort<00:04:35.780> of

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
a scaler around there try and sort of

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.380 
a scaler around there try and sort of
roughly<00:04:36.200> position<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:37.010> lips<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.360> nose

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
roughly position the lips and the nose

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.740 
roughly position the lips and the nose
and<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.960> eyes<00:04:40.480> okay

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
and the eyes okay

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.360 
and the eyes okay
sorry<00:04:42.290> just<00:04:42.440> excuse<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.830> framerate<00:04:43.070> on<00:04:43.310> my

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
sorry just excuse the framerate on my

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.680 
sorry just excuse the framerate on my
computer<00:04:43.760> here<00:04:43.940> it's<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.180> it's<00:04:44.360> not

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
computer here it's a it's not

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.730 
computer here it's a it's not
particularly<00:04:45.020> great

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.200 

all<00:04:48.130> right

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.610 

we'll<00:04:52.660> just<00:04:52.810> move<00:04:52.900> this<00:04:53.080> back<00:04:53.230> a<00:04:53.290> little<00:04:53.380> bit

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
we'll just move this back a little bit

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.840 
we'll just move this back a little bit
so<00:04:53.770> just<00:04:53.800> so<00:04:54.010> we<00:04:54.100> can<00:04:54.190> see<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.340> bit<00:04:54.550> more<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.730> the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
so just so we can see a bit more of the

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.190 
so just so we can see a bit more of the
shape<00:04:55.060> of<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.210> head<00:04:55.420> cuz<00:04:55.690> at<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.870> minute<00:04:56.080> it's

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
shape of the head cuz at the minute it's

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.510 
shape of the head cuz at the minute it's
intersecting<00:04:56.740> halfway<00:04:57.040> through<00:04:57.220> at<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.370> head

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
intersecting halfway through at the head

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.310 
intersecting halfway through at the head
which<00:04:58.060> is<00:04:58.210> handy<00:04:58.510> because<00:04:58.540> you<00:04:58.810> can<00:04:58.960> only<00:04:59.140> see

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
which is handy because you can only see

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.440 
which is handy because you can only see
the<00:04:59.410> front<00:04:59.530> but<00:04:59.980> I'd<00:05:00.850> like<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.120> see<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.270> bit<00:05:01.420> more

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
the front but I'd like to see a bit more

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.370 
the front but I'd like to see a bit more
of<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.720> back<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.080> head<00:05:03.870> just<00:05:04.870> scaling<00:05:05.140> it

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
of the back of the head just scaling it

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.700 
of the back of the head just scaling it
around<00:05:06.280> there<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:07.080> mean<00:05:08.080> this<00:05:08.170> isn't<00:05:08.350> like<00:05:08.470> I

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
around there I mean this isn't like I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.200 
around there I mean this isn't like I
said<00:05:08.860> it's<00:05:09.010> never<00:05:09.100> going<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.370> match<00:05:09.550> perfectly

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.640 

but<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.750> closer<00:05:12.960> we<00:05:13.139> can<00:05:13.229> get<00:05:13.380> it<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.620> better

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
but the closer we can get it the better

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.189 
but the closer we can get it the better
and<00:05:14.610> again<00:05:14.729> once<00:05:15.330> we've<00:05:15.479> got<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:15.660> front<00:05:15.810> set

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
and again once we've got the front set

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.050 
and again once we've got the front set
up<00:05:16.320> we<00:05:16.740> want<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.310> do<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.520> same<00:05:17.639> with<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:17.880> side

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
up we want to do the same with the side

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.570 
up we want to do the same with the side
and<00:05:18.960> with<00:05:19.530> this<00:05:19.650> we<00:05:19.830> only<00:05:19.949> want<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.190> move<00:05:20.370> this

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
and with this we only want to move this

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.460 
and with this we only want to move this
along<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.830> sort<00:05:22.830> of<00:05:22.889> x<00:05:23.009> axis<00:05:23.690> so<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:25.139> doesn't

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
along the sort of x axis so it doesn't

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.960 
along the sort of x axis so it doesn't
you<00:05:25.740> know<00:05:25.860> if<00:05:26.070> we<00:05:26.160> move<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.400> up<00:05:26.460> or<00:05:26.580> down<00:05:26.639> we're

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
you know if we move it up or down we're

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.439 
you know if we move it up or down we're
gonna<00:05:27.030> ruin<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:28.639> alignment<00:05:29.639> completely<00:05:30.210> so

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
gonna ruin the alignment completely so

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.120 
gonna ruin the alignment completely so
oops<00:05:33.449> up<00:05:34.199> there<00:05:34.410> by<00:05:34.560> accident

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
oops up there by accident

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.740 
oops up there by accident
I<00:05:36.500> can't<00:05:37.500> excuse<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.949> framerate<00:05:38.190> I'm<00:05:38.490> sorry

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.670 

okay<00:05:42.750> so<00:05:42.840> there<00:05:43.050> we<00:05:43.110> go<00:05:43.139> I<00:05:43.229> mean<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:43.440> can<00:05:43.560> see

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
okay so there we go I mean you can see

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.870 
okay so there we go I mean you can see
the<00:05:43.770> errors<00:05:44.009> in<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.100> wrong<00:05:44.280> position<00:05:44.430> but<00:05:44.759> all

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
the errors in the wrong position but all

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.400 
the errors in the wrong position but all
we're<00:05:45.030> really<00:05:45.300> worried<00:05:45.960> about<00:05:46.020> at<00:05:46.199> this<00:05:46.320> point

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
we're really worried about at this point

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.620 
we're really worried about at this point
is<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.830> sort<00:05:47.039> of<00:05:47.070> the<00:05:47.400> nose<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:48.150> lips<00:05:48.300> the

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
is the sort of the nose the lips the

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.270 
is the sort of the nose the lips the
front<00:05:48.840> of<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.020> head<00:05:49.229> and<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.710> chin<00:05:49.919> really

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
front of the head and the chin really

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.550 
front of the head and the chin really
and<00:05:50.430> that's<00:05:50.580> almost<00:05:51.330> correct<00:05:51.570> it's<00:05:51.930> not<00:05:51.990> right

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
and that's almost correct it's not right

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.749 
and that's almost correct it's not right
by<00:05:52.740> any<00:05:52.889> stretch<00:05:53.009> of<00:05:53.099> the<00:05:53.190> imagination<00:05:53.250> but

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
by any stretch of the imagination but

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.060 
by any stretch of the imagination but
it's<00:05:53.910> getting<00:05:54.150> there

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
it's getting there

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.790 
it's getting there
okay<00:05:56.070> now<00:05:56.610> what<00:05:56.759> we<00:05:56.849> want<00:05:57.030> to<00:05:57.060> do<00:05:57.210> is<00:05:57.900> we<00:05:58.650> want

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
okay now what we want to do is we want

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.379 
okay now what we want to do is we want
to<00:05:58.830> set<00:05:58.949> these<00:05:59.099> as<00:05:59.280> background<00:05:59.669> images<00:06:00.030> so

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
to set these as background images so

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.020 
to set these as background images so
that<00:06:00.599> they<00:06:00.960> can't<00:06:01.169> be<00:06:01.229> moved<00:06:01.470> and<00:06:01.650> it<00:06:01.880> so<00:06:02.880> we'll

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
that they can't be moved and it so we'll

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.360 
that they can't be moved and it so we'll
just<00:06:03.060> go<00:06:03.270> to<00:06:03.330> background<00:06:03.660> we'll<00:06:04.650> select<00:06:05.220> the

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
just go to background we'll select the

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.920 
just go to background we'll select the
bottom<00:06:05.520> left<00:06:05.820> panel<00:06:06.210> which<00:06:06.479> is<00:06:06.599> our<00:06:06.720> front

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
bottom left panel which is our front

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.189 
bottom left panel which is our front
select<00:06:07.500> face<00:06:07.680> front<00:06:08.000> we'll<00:06:09.000> turn<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.570> image

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
select face front we'll turn the image

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.080 
select face front we'll turn the image
resolution<00:06:10.440> up<00:06:10.860> and<00:06:11.070> we'll<00:06:11.550> hit<00:06:11.639> automatic

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
resolution up and we'll hit automatic

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.360 
resolution up and we'll hit automatic
sizing<00:06:12.560> and<00:06:13.560> I'll<00:06:13.919> just<00:06:14.039> show<00:06:14.130> you<00:06:14.220> what<00:06:14.310> this

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
sizing and I'll just show you what this

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.129 
sizing and I'll just show you what this
does<00:06:14.580> here<00:06:14.759> if<00:06:14.849> I<00:06:14.910> stick<00:06:15.180> this<00:06:15.300> on<00:06:15.509> wireframe

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
does here if I stick this on wireframe

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.550 
does here if I stick this on wireframe
mode<00:06:17.510> you<00:06:18.510> see<00:06:18.690> that<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:19.080> box<00:06:19.260> that<00:06:19.380> we've

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
mode you see that the box that we've

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.430 
mode you see that the box that we've
made<00:06:19.710> there<00:06:20.060> automatic<00:06:21.060> sizing<00:06:21.240> and<00:06:21.960> they<00:06:22.289> go

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
made there automatic sizing and they go

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.500 
made there automatic sizing and they go
that<00:06:22.560> matches<00:06:22.860> exactly<00:06:22.889> the<00:06:23.580> box<00:06:24.270> that<00:06:24.389> we've

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
that matches exactly the box that we've

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.820 
that matches exactly the box that we've
made<00:06:24.690> but<00:06:24.870> this<00:06:24.960> isn't<00:06:25.110> geometry<00:06:25.590> anymore

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
made but this isn't geometry anymore

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.810 
made but this isn't geometry anymore
this<00:06:25.949> is<00:06:26.070> just<00:06:26.250> a<00:06:26.310> natural<00:06:26.430> background

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
this is just a natural background

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.469 
this is just a natural background
reference<00:06:27.360> image<00:06:28.849> all<00:06:29.849> right<00:06:30.000> then<00:06:30.240> again

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
reference image all right then again

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:31.670 
reference image all right then again
we'll<00:06:30.630> do<00:06:30.750> exactly<00:06:30.870> the<00:06:31.199> same<00:06:31.229> with<00:06:31.440> the<00:06:31.530> side

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
we'll do exactly the same with the side

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.469 
we'll do exactly the same with the side
bottom<00:06:32.010> right<00:06:32.310> panel<00:06:32.550> and<00:06:35.270> just<00:06:36.270> so<00:06:36.449> that

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
bottom right panel and just so that

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.269 
bottom right panel and just so that
that's<00:06:37.110> that

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:40.279 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:43.570 

okay

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.210 

right<00:06:44.210> now<00:06:44.360> what<00:06:44.509> we'll<00:06:44.629> just<00:06:44.780> do<00:06:44.900> just<00:06:45.289> so<00:06:45.680> if

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
right now what we'll just do just so if

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.740 
right now what we'll just do just so if
there's<00:06:46.430> ever<00:06:46.550> you<00:06:47.000> know<00:06:47.090> crashes<00:06:47.659> or

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
there's ever you know crashes or

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.850 
there's ever you know crashes or
whatever<00:06:47.960> we'll<00:06:48.110> just<00:06:48.289> say<00:06:48.409> that<00:06:48.439> all<00:06:48.770> these

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
whatever we'll just say that all these

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.050 
whatever we'll just say that all these
backgrounds<00:06:49.310> it's<00:06:49.430> always<00:06:49.580> a<00:06:49.610> good<00:06:49.699> idea<00:06:49.759> to

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
backgrounds it's always a good idea to

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.850 
backgrounds it's always a good idea to
do<00:06:50.180> this<00:06:50.330> because<00:06:50.659> every<00:06:50.840> time<00:06:50.930> you<00:06:51.050> load<00:06:51.229> the

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
do this because every time you load the

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.140 
do this because every time you load the
scene<00:06:52.099> it's<00:06:52.280> not<00:06:52.430> going<00:06:52.550> to<00:06:52.610> remember<00:06:52.819> these

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
scene it's not going to remember these

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.420 
scene it's not going to remember these
backgrounds<00:06:53.689> instead<00:06:54.620> a<00:06:54.800> bug<00:06:55.099> with<00:06:55.280> light

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
backgrounds instead a bug with light

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.089 
backgrounds instead a bug with light
waves<00:06:55.639> I<00:06:55.789> guess<00:06:56.050> but<00:06:57.050> I<00:06:57.080> saving<00:06:57.680> them<00:06:57.919> means

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:58.099 
waves I guess but I saving them means

00:06:58.099 --> 00:06:59.589 
waves I guess but I saving them means
you<00:06:58.189> can<00:06:58.310> always<00:06:58.490> load<00:06:58.639> them<00:06:58.789> back<00:06:58.939> in<00:06:59.120> at<00:06:59.479> any

00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 
you can always load them back in at any

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.170 
you can always load them back in at any
point<00:07:00.580> okay<00:07:01.580> so<00:07:01.639> there<00:07:01.909> we<00:07:02.000> have<00:07:02.150> the

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
point okay so there we have the

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.059 
point okay so there we have the
background<00:07:02.780> setup<00:07:03.259> and<00:07:03.469> the<00:07:03.590> geometry<00:07:03.770> in

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:04.069 
background setup and the geometry in

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:07.179 
background setup and the geometry in
place<00:07:04.250> in<00:07:05.060> the<00:07:05.389> part<00:07:05.689> to<00:07:05.810> this<00:07:06.099> chapter<00:07:07.099> we're

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:07.189 
place in the part to this chapter we're
