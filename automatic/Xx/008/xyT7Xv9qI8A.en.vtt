00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.580 
hi everyone Cynthia who here I just

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.080 
hi everyone Cynthia who here I just
wanted<00:00:09.850> to<00:00:09.880> share<00:00:10.180> a<00:00:10.240> shudder

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
wanted to share a shudder

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.480 
wanted to share a shudder
and<00:00:12.210> all<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:12.990> did<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.350> the<00:00:13.740> shape<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.280> is

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
and all I did for the shape of this is

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.490 
and all I did for the shape of this is
use<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> tim<00:00:15.030> holtz<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.510> the<00:00:15.660> edge<00:00:15.780> die<00:00:16.110> for<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
use a tim holtz on the edge die for the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.130 
use a tim holtz on the edge die for the
top<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.010> then<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:18.090> everything<00:00:18.720> else<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.050> was

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
top and then just everything else it was

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.440 
top and then just everything else it was
just<00:00:19.200> a<00:00:19.410> rectangle<00:00:19.950> so<00:00:20.520> really<00:00:20.850> easy<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.420> make

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
just a rectangle so really easy to make

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.609 
just a rectangle so really easy to make
this<00:00:21.779> shape<00:00:22.050> um<00:00:23.570> this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> corsage<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.590> I

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
this shape um this is a corsage that I

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.140 
this shape um this is a corsage that I
made<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.520> put<00:00:26.700> it<00:00:26.790> right<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
made and I just put it right on the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.430 
made and I just put it right on the
front<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.869> thought<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.080> was<00:00:28.199> beautiful

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
front so I just thought it was beautiful

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.060 
front so I just thought it was beautiful
and<00:00:29.210> was<00:00:30.210> exactly<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> front<00:00:31.619> needed

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
and was exactly what the front needed

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
and was exactly what the front needed
and<00:00:32.629> so<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:34.140> shutter<00:00:35.120> this<00:00:36.120> opens<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.780> this

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
and so the shutter this opens like this

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.570 
and so the shutter this opens like this
because<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.650> a<00:00:37.770> shudder<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.280> they're<00:00:38.400> so<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
because it's a shudder and they're so I

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.350 
because it's a shudder and they're so I
think<00:00:38.640> three<00:00:39.270> sets<00:00:39.720> or<00:00:39.989> four<00:00:40.260> sets<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.430> it's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
think three sets or four sets so it's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.260 
think three sets or four sets so it's
called<00:00:42.629> always<00:00:43.019> remember<00:00:43.769> and<00:00:44.130> then<00:00:44.970> I<00:00:45.000> put<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
called always remember and then I put a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.870 
called always remember and then I put a
bunch<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.720> female<00:00:45.960> roses<00:00:46.559> um<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> my

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
bunch of my female roses um that I my

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.670 
bunch of my female roses um that I my
handmade<00:00:48.270> roses<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.899> made<00:00:49.079> out<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.320> fimo

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
handmade roses that I made out of fimo

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.410 
handmade roses that I made out of fimo
dough<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.329> though<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.750> sides<00:00:52.230> there<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
dough on though on the sides there and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.200 
dough on though on the sides there and
so<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> opens<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:56.219> there

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
so here it opens like this and there

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.600 
so here it opens like this and there
spots<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.809> journaling<00:00:58.320> or<00:00:58.440> photos<00:00:58.950> and<00:00:59.399> then

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
spots for journaling or photos and then

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.820 
spots for journaling or photos and then
this<00:00:59.940> tag<00:01:00.899> pulls<00:01:01.290> out<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.840> then<00:01:03.840> um<00:01:04.259> well

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this tag pulls out and then um well

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.380 
this tag pulls out and then um well
that's<00:01:05.100> really<00:01:05.309> thick<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:06.000> been<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> while

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that's really thick it's been a while

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.969 
that's really thick it's been a while
since<00:01:06.660> I've<00:01:06.869> looked<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.259> I<00:01:07.619> made<00:01:07.800> it<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
since I've looked at this I made it a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.330 
since I've looked at this I made it a
while<00:01:08.160> ago<00:01:08.190> so<00:01:08.899> I'm<00:01:09.899> kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.289> seeing<00:01:11.039> what<00:01:11.310> I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and then let's see it opens like this i

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.139 
and then let's see it opens like this i
want<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.069> use<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.310> pre-<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.850> garden<00:01:22.100> a

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
collection for this I love that

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
collection for this I love that
collection<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> opens<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.599> this<00:01:27.660> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
collection so it opens like this and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.080 
collection so it opens like this and
then<00:01:28.590> here's<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.979> place<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> photo<00:01:29.789> or<00:01:29.940> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
can just be left like that and then I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.580 
can just be left like that and then I
just<00:01:32.880> used<00:01:33.209> the<00:01:33.479> paper<00:01:33.750> collection<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.440> use

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
just used the paper collection and use

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.730 
just used the paper collection and use
some<00:01:34.890> punch<00:01:35.789> around<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.060> pages<00:01:36.690> punches<00:01:37.619> from

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
some punch around the pages punches from

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.469 
some punch around the pages punches from
Martha<00:01:38.069> Stewart<00:01:38.099> and<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:38.789> there's<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.209> one

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
Martha Stewart and so there's that one

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.770 
Martha Stewart and so there's that one
and<00:01:39.959> then<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.830> bottom<00:01:41.190> opens<00:01:41.789> to<00:01:42.979> like<00:01:43.979> this

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
and then the bottom opens to like this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.020 
and then the bottom opens to like this
so<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.959> full<00:01:46.200> 12<00:01:46.560> by<00:01:46.740> 12<00:01:47.009> all<00:01:47.550> I<00:01:47.729> did<00:01:47.880> was

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
so it's a full 12 by 12 all I did was

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.309 
so it's a full 12 by 12 all I did was
score<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:49.280> every<00:01:50.280> four<00:01:50.849> inches<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.990> way<00:01:52.050> so

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
score it every four inches this way so

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.770 
score it every four inches this way so
at<00:01:52.890> four<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.819> eight<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.240> then<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.450> scored

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
at four and at eight and then I scored

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.589 
at four and at eight and then I scored
it<00:01:54.869> at<00:01:54.989> six<00:01:55.289> cut<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.429> here<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.940> then<00:01:57.239> it<00:01:57.420> just

00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:57.599 
it at six cut it here and then it just

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.309 
it at six cut it here and then it just
folds<00:01:57.959> up<00:01:58.289> like<00:01:58.319> this<00:01:59.090> like<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:01.020> then

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
folds up like this like this and then

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.550 
folds up like this like this and then
folds<00:02:01.890> right<00:02:02.039> down<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.869> then<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> photo<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.440> go

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
folds right down and then a photo can go

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.919 
folds right down and then a photo can go
in<00:02:04.679> there<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.130> use<00:02:05.970> some<00:02:06.179> Lindy<00:02:06.450> stamp<00:02:06.690> gang

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
in there I use some Lindy stamp gang

painted and I just wove some ribbon

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.519

through<00:06:20.960> to<00:06:21.349> make<00:06:21.500> it<00:06:21.680> look<00:06:21.860> really<00:06:22.360> waste

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
through to make it look really waste

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:28.409 
through to make it look really waste
kind<00:06:24.529> of<00:06:24.620> fancy<00:06:24.800> so<00:06:25.759> that<00:06:25.940> closes<00:06:26.509> and<00:06:26.990> then

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
kind of fancy so that closes and then

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.749 
kind of fancy so that closes and then
this<00:06:29.419> is<00:06:29.659> how<00:06:29.930> the<00:06:29.990> book<00:06:30.469> closes<00:06:30.770> so<00:06:31.370> very

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
this is how the book closes so very

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:37.240 
this is how the book closes so very
simple<00:06:32.360> I<00:06:32.750> bound<00:06:33.590> it<00:06:33.770> with<00:06:33.949> lace<00:06:36.009> the<00:06:37.009> lace<00:06:37.219> is

simple I bound it with lace the lace is

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.700 
simple I bound it with lace the lace is
really<00:06:37.819> really<00:06:38.090> strong<00:06:38.509> so<00:06:38.539> it's<00:06:39.380> going<00:06:39.620> to

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
really really strong so it's going to

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.620 
really really strong so it's going to
you<00:06:40.099> know<00:06:40.250> help<00:06:40.639> when<00:06:41.029> you're<00:06:41.180> opening<00:06:41.509> and

so I use lace on these ones as well and

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.400
