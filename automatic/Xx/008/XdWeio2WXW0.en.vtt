00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.289 
get into the box so it's kind of hard it
gets<00:01:41.070> really<00:01:41.430> difficult<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> later

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
gets really difficult at the later

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.880 
gets really difficult at the later
rounds<00:01:42.509> planning<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.079> easy<00:01:43.290> right<00:01:43.530> now<00:01:43.560> just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
rounds planning on easy right now just

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
rounds planning on easy right now just
to<00:01:44.159> make<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:44.909> easier<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.329> make<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> video

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
to make it much easier to make the video

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.740 
to make it much easier to make the video
it's<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.560> want<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> bring<00:01:47.040> this

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
it's just because I want to bring this

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.690 
it's just because I want to bring this
tutorial<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.680> gets<00:01:49.799> pretty<00:01:49.950> hard<00:01:50.280> at

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
tutorial because it gets pretty hard at

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.249 
tutorial because it gets pretty hard at
the<00:01:50.850> later<00:01:51.090> rounds<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> don't<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.079> like

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the later rounds if you don't have like

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.530 
the later rounds if you don't have like

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
definitely need to be thinking and just

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
definitely need to be thinking and just
getting<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:58.110> bunch<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.799> good<00:01:58.950> stuff<00:01:58.979> because

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
getting a bunch of good stuff because

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.310 
getting a bunch of good stuff because

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you're running around in this mud and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.560 
you're running around in this mud and
it's<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.040> death<00:02:02.310> trap<00:02:02.340> trying<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.149> kills<00:02:03.360> by

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it's a death trap trying to get kills by

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.649 
it's a death trap trying to get kills by
these<00:02:03.780> soul<00:02:04.140> boxes<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.939> need<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.149> try<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
these soul boxes so you need to try and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.990 
these soul boxes so you need to try and
get<00:02:06.810> some<00:02:07.020> good<00:02:07.170> guns<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.740> plan<00:02:08.489> easy<00:02:08.789> or

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
get some good guns or plan easy or

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.309 
get some good guns or plan easy or
something<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.720> it's

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
something like that because it's

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.020 
something like that because it's
actually<00:02:10.739> pretty<00:02:10.890> hard<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.370> get<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> bunch<00:02:11.879> of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
actually pretty hard to get a bunch of

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.700 
actually pretty hard to get a bunch of
kills<00:02:12.239> by<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.480> soul<00:02:12.750> boxes

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
kills by the soul boxes

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.560 
kills by the soul boxes
and<00:02:13.800> once<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.280> filled<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.910> soul<00:02:15.090> boxes

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
and once you have filled the soul boxes

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.200 
and once you have filled the soul boxes
you'll<00:02:16.230> see<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.980> old<00:02:17.220> box<00:02:17.430> actually

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
you'll see that this old box actually

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.940 
you'll see that this old box actually
just<00:02:18.420> disappears<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.110> goes<00:02:19.170> into<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> ground

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
just disappears and goes into the ground

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.610 
just disappears and goes into the ground
so<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.790> will<00:02:20.850> no<00:02:21.000> longer<00:02:21.030> be<00:02:21.540> there<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.990> you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
so it will no longer be there and you

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.100 
so it will no longer be there and you
can<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.640> complete<00:02:24.060> all<00:02:24.270> four<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.600> these<00:02:24.750> and
