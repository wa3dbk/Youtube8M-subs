the<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:01.050> was<00:01:01.320> figuring<00:01:01.680> out<00:01:01.770> how<00:01:02.010> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the first was figuring out how to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.340 
the first was figuring out how to

capture more energy from the fuel to do

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350 
capture more energy from the fuel to do
that<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:05.010> needed<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> raise<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.610> compression

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
that we needed to raise the compression

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.899 
that we needed to raise the compression
ratio<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:07.140> placing<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.650> dome<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.220> each<00:01:08.400> piston

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
ratio by placing a dome on each piston

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.580 
ratio by placing a dome on each piston
because<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.600> more<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.930> squeeze<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.470> air

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
because the more you squeeze the air

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.500 
because the more you squeeze the air
fuel<00:01:10.890> mixture<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.610> more<00:01:11.790> energy<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> get

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
fuel mixture the more energy you get

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.179 
fuel mixture the more energy you get
from<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> combustion<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> high

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
from the combustion but a high

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.679 
from the combustion but a high
compression<00:01:14.400> ratio<00:01:14.729> usually<00:01:15.479> ends<00:01:15.659> up

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
compression ratio usually ends up

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
compression ratio usually ends up
causing<00:01:15.960> knock<00:01:16.320> which<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.799> when<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.979> air<00:01:17.130> fuel

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
causing knock which is when the air fuel

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.429 
causing knock which is when the air fuel
mixture<00:01:17.520> ignites<00:01:18.240> too<00:01:18.540> soon<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.290> it's

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
mixture ignites too soon because it's

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.109 
mixture ignites too soon because it's
too<00:01:19.650> hot<00:01:19.920> inside<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.430> chain

too hot inside the chain

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.450

so<00:01:22.689> we<00:01:22.750> have<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:22.929> cool<00:01:23.140> things<00:01:23.439> off<00:01:23.619> using<00:01:24.310> some

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
so we have to cool things off using some
