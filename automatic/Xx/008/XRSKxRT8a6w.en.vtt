00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
on from that game but it's pretty hard

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.120

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
and that's what we can ask for really

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
coming in it was going to be a

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.120 
coming in it was going to be a
challenging<00:02:22.959> game<00:02:23.020> playing<00:02:23.470> against<00:02:23.680> PMG

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
challenging game playing against PMG

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
think especially in terms of plane as a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.960 
think especially in terms of plane as a
unit<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:49.930> defending<00:02:50.530> as<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.680> unit<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.190> just

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970
