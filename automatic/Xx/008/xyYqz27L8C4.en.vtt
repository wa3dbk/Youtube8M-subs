 because they will be closed 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.810
 after which he takes a pair of scissors e 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.810
 cut up to pence 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.910
 giulio all the pen is invited and of the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.910
 exact life circumference 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.619
 and voila you got the pattern 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.619
 of the column half wheel without doing 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.600
 too many calculations and without going to the eye 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.670
 now positioned on the fabric put the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.030
 double center forward and get ready for 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.619
 the tracing of the pattern on the fabric 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.530
 lock the fabric with pins or with 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.900
 of the countries so that the edge does not slip 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.150
 of the skirt will be 2 cm and sewn with 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.110
 invisible point or machine below 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.330
 points used a video of 100 or 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.099
 transparent nylon can not be made 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.140
 otherwise because the points must be 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.500
 invisible and the skirt must have a hem 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.569
 soft and fluid also recalls that in 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.370
 this model is the fundamental angle 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.709
 rectum that is formed by bending the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.870
 double fabric on which it will position 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.760
 the pattern then when you go to 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.560
 always buy the tin.it fabric 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.269
 abounded and quantities for a 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.329
 buy insufficient fabric for the 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.400
 model you want to sew check that i 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.230
 two catheti that make up the right angle 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.739
 to me I have the same length and the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.269
 halyard paper pattern if you need things of 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.130
 leave an inch at the waist for 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.440
 the hem and also to mark the position 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.000
 of the back zip that will be 12 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.920
 centimeters 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.100
 now then proceed with the tracing of the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.959
 pattern on the fabric is not a hand 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.030
 very firm and trace the edges 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.920
 no problem I take the centimeter and 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.630
 marks the fabric as fanfani and luisa 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.630
 absolutely can not be wrong 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.490
 et voila the skirt is ready to be
