00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Russia finally withdrawn from the agreement on 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 conventional armed forces in Europe 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.740
 remember this agreement is signed and 25 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.750
 years ago it became actually not 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.280
 implemented after the collapse of the USSR and 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.259
 approximations to the borders of Russia 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.210
 true Moscow offered to the west 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.699
 modify the contract however understanding 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.529
 not met now in western capitals 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.460
 say they are disappointed with the decision 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.560
 russia or dad will continue russia closed 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.449
 another communication channel with the west 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.429
 was security issues russia 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.410
 is committed to undermining trust 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.660
 to make the west nervous again and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 bring it out of balance in 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.290
 such hysterics went foreign 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.210
 journalists and commentators learning about 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 what is the russian federation of today 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 day completely and irrevocably out of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.539
 Conventional Armed Forces Treaty 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.879
 Europe, however, is a surprise 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.860
 became just for them back in 2007 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.820
 Moscow imposed a moratorium on her 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.440
 participation in yes all 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.420
 an exception was made only for 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.870
 joint advisory meetings 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 groups still account whether to use 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.339
 SCG joint advisory group in 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.340
 as a platform for dialogue 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.200
 maybe even talks and those 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.830
 expectations were not met by sands 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.729
 It turned out not destiny finally 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.729
 really quite often 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.670
 meeting is reduced to that and remove 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.790
 opens meeting reads the agenda 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.630
 the day after which the meeting ends 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.659
 Well, for this you need to pay extra 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.909
 money for the service in the name of what 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.079
 incomprehensible document was signed in 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.820
 ninety year between two 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.280
 opposing military 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.110
 alliances where 16 countries were included and 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.240
 Warsaw Member States 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.340
 the contract is included the ussr after the collapse 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.710
 Union of Russia and part of the former republics 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.720
 signed ext agreement georgia and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.759
 Azerbaijan has not ratified it 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.020
 Lithuania Latvia and Estonia refused at all 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.119
 join yes all 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.560
 and then also joined nato it gave 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.659
 organizations able to accommodate 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.520
 armament on the northwest border 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.619
 Russia also joined the alliance 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.000
 other Warsaw Pact countries so 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.590
 balance forehead on 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.780
 dinner and the document became simply not 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.820
 viable due to the expansion of nato 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.130
 east agreement was developed 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.870
 adaptation of the contract to new realities but 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.210
 the west did not rush it 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.310
 Therefore, Russia was forced to lead seven 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.980
 years ago a moratorium on their participation in yes 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:28.290
 all too long nato fooled us 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.200
 insert our armed forces and yet 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.670
 more precisely our Russian security on 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.470
 European continent in advance 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.739
 unprofitable for our abilities 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.550
 provisions and now the Ukrainian crisis and 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.800
 nato pumps European grouping 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.989
 grouping their weapons we will lose 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.530
 became i claims the us voiced on 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.110
 today's press conference 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.880
 representatives of the Russian mid is that 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.709
 placement of NATO troops on close 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.600
 dye and thorium is presented as their 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.550
 rotation or for example reluctance 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.570
 Americans who themselves initiate 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.640
 holding a nuclear summit 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.989

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.550
 infected ga thief about comprehensive 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.440
 nuclear test ban 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.880
 or a violation of the states of the treaty 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.560
 nuclear nonproliferation 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.250
 conducting joint nuclear missions so 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.230
 called 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:22.739
 not player sharing this is essentially doing 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.950
 training of military pilots from 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.630
 non-nuclear member countries of the alliance 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.700
 learning their skills the use of nuclear 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.200
 weapons answer the Ukrainian question 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.480
 journalist about the possibility of accommodation 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.519
 nuclear weapons in the Crimea in the world reported 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.530
 that such plans department nothing 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.600
 known but at the same time noted Moscow 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.220
 has the right to place it on his 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.590
 territory without asking 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.370
