00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.910
 we continue with our 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:21.070
 the four now for software that 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.369
 accompanying is samsung included in is four 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.860
 already the latest version of android or 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.700
 we have the free day here in version 4.2 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.370
 point 2 and we also have the right 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.810
 here the new all judges of all 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.900
 features and news that 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.550
 Samsung created for this smartphone as 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.480
 we are here with a screen in the group and that 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.520
 we may be surprised at the start of a 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.000
 little because in fact the 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.540
 details below that we have for example 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.330
 in galaxy s 13 allows to allow 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.220
 start up some applications quickly 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.070
 however they are present only 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.380
 a bit hidden because we use here 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.310
 in this zone to the right we then have 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.229
 access here 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.210
 is a series of applications that we can 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.770
 to face very fast 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.770
 how can you see 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.590
 that is, just pass through the right 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.799
 here we have a series of applications 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.119
 that they transmit to us is this he was 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.070
 quite fast 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.179
 for if we think we can still 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.200
 here define several widgets you can see 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.189
 here that allows us to have a 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.859
 information series 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.179
 here, however, never has an example 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:39.030
 music player 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.119
 the client controls music in two 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.740
 block the proforma itself 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.679
 this message will stay a period can 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:53.409
 be being that we also have to 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.889
 define a message as well as the color 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.069
 of the text or font type 

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:03.069
 available here also the screen fell 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:08.860
 to unlock another enough way is the 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:12.970
 health and has a very interesting effect 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.180
 work on the chances that accompany the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.569
 galaxy s 4 makes it together with the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.459
 android 4.2.3 be all very much 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.220
 fluid and very fast 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.590
 as you can see here they Applications 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.840
 here we have the main screens that are 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.170
 customizable as you would expect 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.450
 the android that operation is that 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.340
 trio we're used to it and that's all 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.040
 very very fast 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.860
 the notifications bar is as high as 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.739
 enriched and we have access here 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.110
 to a series of quick definitions that 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.220
 can also be the leagues and mode greece 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:58.900
 and so his very quickly and 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:04.360
 we have lessons from being 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.090
 separated by time and themes 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.500
 actions a goal accounts and here the most 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.620
 for access to the rest of the missions 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.530
 It is to avoid having an emissions list too 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.299
 very large very vertical being that 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.079
 so he managed to show things and 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.269
 them faster and logic to 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.760
 have access for example to the overflow of 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.069
 tasks 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.650
 we arrived here in hospital 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.930
 and we have access here to all 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.299
 open applications where the ps 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.220
 delete and annoying effectively enough 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.880
 use proven 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.000
 it's all very simple really to 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.049
 some newspaper, for example, we have 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:57.579
 coffee aquino so tact of the left and boy 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:04:00.639
 the newspaper is ripped apart in a 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:08.380
 series of novelties however how 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:09.910
 oo blocked the 200 trial when you 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.849
 realizes that we are coming to the end of 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.419
 a web page with these problems 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.790
 automatically 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:19.530
 we have here another thing that is the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.970
 window that allows you to have 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.620
 several applications on and both 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.720
 applications open simultaneously 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.810
 context a demo video appears 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.849
 here this not being in chemical text 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.360
 which for example we can open because the 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.360
 browser 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.350
 opening here the browser that later 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:45.490
 playing from this side to a window 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.010
 for example, drag against 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.380
 the application as in the cases of the 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.520
 define a space that we want each 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.980
 an 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:59.230
 the cuca we have here to see the photos that we have 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.850
 in the gallery and continue to see our 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:06.490
 site up here and as a first 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:12.900
 All is well to work 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.900
 fairly fluid and
