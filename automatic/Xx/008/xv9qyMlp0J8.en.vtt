00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.720
 Hello guys 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.809
 in this class and run some exercises 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.800
 to be carried out so that people 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.990
 can develop a better shape in the 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.570
 left hand 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.050
 are simple and easy to use exercises 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.560
 executed but giving one is a great 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.619
 technical advance for people 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.500
 then the first exercise that people 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.980
 you have to think first is in our 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.450
 hand shape, as I already said in the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.460
 others in the other class put the position 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.149
 natural hand 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:53.500
 put the flap supported on this mark here 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:01:00.300
 and leave your fingers curved and relaxed 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:06.780
 So we put our hand in this position. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:12.100
 with straight and relaxed thumb and fingers 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.840
 donkeys and everyone standing on the rope 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.510
 so have a great workout 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.110
 interesting to put here in the 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:27.820
 first position each finger on a rope 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.720

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:41.729
 and then we tighten 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:49.180
 We'll come back and squeeze again. 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:52.250
 We'll come and push back and 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.050
 press again 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:01.730
 seen from another branch 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:16.380
 Hurry up and come back here. 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.410
 tightening and back holding some other 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:27.020
 exercise that we can do this q 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:27.020
 Put your thumb up and squeeze the wheels. 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.100

 this exercise is very good for 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.370
 work this our at our angle 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.400
 this way we do not need to touch 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:02.730
 the violin tightening the strings with much 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:06.870
 force but we need to dosage do not dosage 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.540
 this force knowing how to use this force and 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.110
 maintain the flexibility that is content 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.610
 of the courses and also by the touch 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.780
 identify which position is in the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:26.340
 fingertip where the strings 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:29.610
 they are an exercise another exercise 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.200
 for the change of rope nor can we 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:37.410
 do is keep for example puts everyone 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.600
 the fingers on the rope half always remembering 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.490
 that this finger here the finger one it enters 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.480

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.510
 in this position not so and not even 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.500
 as if he were standing on the rope that 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.190
 balancing on rope 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.180
 Then with the gift of Aquino this rope 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.670
 people change lanes with a rope alone 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.210
 using only the elbow 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.250
 only the ground then this is a 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:14.180

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.280
 small exercise we are 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:37.590
 working our consciousness from where 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.360
 the ropes are not 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.010
