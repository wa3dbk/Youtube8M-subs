00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
then you have the controller itself it's

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.670 
then you have the controller itself it's
this<00:01:50.729> sort<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> red<00:01:51.390> kind<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.140> controller<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
this sort of red kind of controller and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.200 
this sort of red kind of controller and
as<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.920> guys<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.579> scratched<00:01:53.939> up

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
as you guys can see it's scratched up

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.179 
as you guys can see it's scratched up
beat<00:01:55.049> up<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.350> looks<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:55.920> been<00:01:56.070> through

and I'll show you guys what the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.999 
and I'll show you guys what the
controller<00:02:06.270> actually<00:02:06.540> looks<00:02:07.049> like<00:02:07.229> outside

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
controller actually looks like outside

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.499 
controller actually looks like outside
of<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> box<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.879> only<00:02:09.090> problem<00:02:09.420> with

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
of the box now the only problem with

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.600 
of the box now the only problem with
these<00:02:09.599> boxes<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.530> really<00:02:10.860> don't<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.220> is

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
that to the side here is the controller

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.460 
that to the side here is the controller
inside<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:50.730> full<00:02:51.030> glory<00:02:51.360> now<00:02:52.110> here's

here and then you sort of just lift this

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.390 
here and then you sort of just lift this
through<00:02:58.710> the<00:03:00.530> packaging<00:03:01.530> for<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.890> controller

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
through the packaging for the controller

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.700 
through the packaging for the controller
which<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.300> lot<00:03:03.600> harder<00:03:03.900> than<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.170> looks<00:03:04.530> guys

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710
