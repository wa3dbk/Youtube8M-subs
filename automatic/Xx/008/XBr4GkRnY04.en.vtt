00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.110
 It was a time when the universe was expanding so rapidly that its parts were diverging 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.820
 Some of them faster than the speed of light itself. This time we live now many people are dazzling 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.189
 From the fact that during the expansion of the universe immediately after its emergence 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.480
 This expansion was faster than the speed of light and although this is true however 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.370
 This impression suggests that the universe does not usually do this, but it does, for example, if it is taken 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.079
 Two points in being sufficiently far apart are always going away 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.750
 From each other faster than the speed of light. This is simply the result of the space between them 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.329
 So our universe is expanding as it has always been faster than the speed of light 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.679
 But this does not disprove Einstein's special theory of relativity that says nothing should 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.989
 To move faster than light? In fact no, the relativity says that nothing in space can 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.670
 To move faster than light but this does not prevent space itself from widening as it pleases 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.360
 The Hubble telescope was observed in the late 1920s of the night sky 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.430
 Is what led us to see the expansion of our universe and the farther we see it in space the more we notice 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:29.399
 The objects are moving away from us faster so imagine a point far from us so that rate 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.860
 The speed of their spacing from the Earth is equal to the speed of light if you can think carefully 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.240
 It is located on the same distance from each direction so you'll find it to be a circle which is what we call it 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.360
 "Hubble Circle" Everything outside this circle is moving away from us more quickly 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.180
 From the speed of light logic here we will likely never be able to see the light 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.770
 Of these objects because of the speed away from us but in fact this 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.759
 It is not true to understand how this could be true Imagine a galaxy outside 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.039
 The Hubble circle moves away from us more quickly than the light so it's in an area at the tip of space 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.190
 From our perspective, so any light coming out of our direction will actually be moving 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.230
 Far from us over time, of course, this talk is not promising but the result of acceleration 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.319
 The breadth of space will find Hubble's circle really growing and if it grows bigger 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.250
 From the light that moves away from us, we will find at some point that this light will move 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.860
 From outside the circle into it and thus can begin to move 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.700
 So we can see it and thus see this distant galaxy that 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.099
 Of course it will be beyond Hubble's circle but we can see its light and know it exists 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:00.470
 That 's great. In fact, all the photons that we get from now 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.989
 The first 5 billion years of the universe's age came out of areas in space 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.940
 She was traveling at that time faster than the light and the bodies were 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.250
 Which I sent and will still be moving away from us more quickly than the speed of light 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.390
 But its light had entered the Hubble circle and had enough time 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.060
 So we see it so the visible Falcon is larger than the Hubble circle 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.780
 In fact it is limited by the so-called "particle horizon" and it is built on quantity 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.739
 The time that light has been on our way since the beginning of time is Maysoi 13.8 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.580
 Billion years as far as we know and since the universe was and is still expanding 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.680
 As this expansion is growing faster, crime is far more than 13.8 billion light-years away 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.519
 What I mean is that the visible universe diameter is greater than 46 billion light-years 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:08.400
 It is about 93 billion light-years away, a huge amount of objects that we can 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.659
 To see it 13.8 billion years ago all this size and everything outside it 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.510
 We can not see it squeezed in a tiny tiny spot we can 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:28.610
 We call it "uniqueness" but this was to be true if the universe were infinite 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:36.700
 But if the universe is infinite - and in fact it seems - why is it always? 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.940
 So the Great Fire would have happened everywhere but if the universe had always been 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.130
 Infinite where to expand? In fact the universe does not need to be stretched to anything 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.050
 I mean that he can expand to what he is because he is infinite, he will never end 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:06.580
 This episode of Veritasium was supported by audible.com, a leading audio book site 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.510
 Contains over 150000 titles in all subjects of fiction, non fiction and periodicals as well 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.550
 This week I want to recommend you to the book "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" which is my favorite book 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.890
 It is a classics in science. People always ask me about the number 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.750
 42 on the channel logo and answer because it is the answer to the absolute question 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.350
 About life and the universe and everything so if you have not read this book you should 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.110
 If you have not yet downloaded the book, you can go to audible.com/veritasium 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.860
 Or you can get any book of your choice for a month as a free trial so I would like to thank 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.400
