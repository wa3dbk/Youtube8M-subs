00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.050
 approximately the same size as the

 but if you look closely, it looks like 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.130
 muddy color which is because everything 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.550
 the planet is wrapped in clouds the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.900
 that the geographical features in Venus 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.240
 they regularly change Mars and Jupiter to 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.460
 Mars is called the red planet because 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.400
 to the amount of iron oxide there is 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.190
 on its surface it is smaller than the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.680

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.530

 its beautiful blue green color and 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.040
 probably due to a
