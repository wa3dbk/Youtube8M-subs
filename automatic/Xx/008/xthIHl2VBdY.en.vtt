00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.750
 and good 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.850
 now how about play friends today 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.309
 I'm going to teach the teamviewer app 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.080
 on android iphone and ipad 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.270
 some you will already know but for the one 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.099
 do not know it has figure is a program 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.190
 that allows us to connect remotely 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.590
 to another team 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.290
 thanks to an associated idea 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.510
 a password to start we'll have 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.000
 to download teamviewer in our 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.870
 page of my gober dotcom i already what 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.910
 I have installed as you can see 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.670
 Here I am going to leave a message that later 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.489
 we see that he puts hi upl friends today of 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.530
 and once we open we will generate 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.180
 our and our password the leader 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.920
 will never change the free one is already 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.710
 associated in your computer the password 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.350
 we see next that it has a kind of 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.659
 arrow a refresh with which if we want 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.220
 change passwords now we will change myself 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.050
 When I finish the tutorial I will do it for 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.210
 that you can not see several of my files 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.640
 as we see here we have two options the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.369
 remote control and transfer 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.200
 of files well if we connect 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.720
 from one computer to another we will have to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.630
 have the application installed on both 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.430
 computers and if we connect from ipad 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.350
 iphone or android in this case a lot 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.640
 Connecting from iPad we will have to 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.050
 download an application I leave the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.850
 description and something more important than 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.800
 It will be our and our partner's 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.580
 we've seen before on the computer and the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.840
 password 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.720
 it is important to have the application 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.300
 open on the pc and on the pc of let's say 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.210
 that a screen will appear where 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.539
 you will see that they are acting in our 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.910
 team from teamviewer as we see I'm 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.790
 within the team can do any 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.260
 thing 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.060
 anything that a 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.420
 computer unless it is required 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.720
 of tremendous graphics like a game 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.220
 or something but we can do for example 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.800
 console tasks or any other type 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.840
 of tasks 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.380
 a very important thing we must also 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.140
 create us before connecting from ipad 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.620
 iphone android an account in time 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.620
 equal dotcom 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.700
 and it will take a couple of minutes in 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.980
 create them we will achieve them and we will leave 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.769
 to introduce our and associate's 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.900
 of the computer and the computer password 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.959
 where we want to connect this is the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.939
 version of them and now below 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.280
 I'm not going to show you the version of 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:32.099
 android we are right now in the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.719
 browser and as we see is exactly 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.370
 as if we were in the 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.590
 computer from the computer we will see 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.439
 everything they were doing with 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.469
 teamviewer as we see here on my channel and 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:46.439
 nothing now I'm going to show you the file 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:49.079
 who believes before deploy friends of 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.699
 we will have down at the bottom a 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.329
 adjustment bar where we can 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:58.199
 modify several aspects and take out 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:00.420
 even the keyboard and well here we are going to 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.700
 leave it for uncles 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.460
 and then we will see how it would be 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.990
 the same process but on android 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.260
 as you see here it is not recorded 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.570
 directly from the android mobile 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.790
 I've recorded it from behind and as we see 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.750
 here the laptop and the mobile are 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.880
 introducing the same as before 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.510
 leader and the password and let's see how 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.510
 we are going to connect 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.500
 with a is very similar to 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.920
 to the ipad process and here we will have 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.390
 our mouse we can do the same if 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.459
 you have no mobile with the screen a 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.680
 little bit can be a little 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.510
 uncomfortable but if you manage with a 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.230
 tablet or with a mobile phone that has many 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:51.420
 inches you handle perfectly now 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.420
 let's open the browser 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.490
 as we always see on the computer is going 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:01.970
 to show what he is doing 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.420
 the device with teamviewer 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.970
 and let's write here with the keyboard 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.210
 the address of my channel to which you 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.830
 I invite you to subscribe jce and although 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.770
 what I am doing is show you the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.019
 browser would not be logical to do 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.170
 this with you since we could use it 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.630
 for other kinds of things or matters that a 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.890
 the best thing we have to do a task in 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.810
 the computer that we have in the 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.360
 work at school we can leave 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.640
 turned on teamviewer and then connect 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.409
 with the computer and good in summary is 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.419
 a pretty useful program 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.789
 It's free as long as we do not use it in 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.099
 a company or in an entity but also 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.169
 also offers us this tool that 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:46.529
 It allows us to transfer files to us 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:50.279
 from our remote computer to 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:52.409
 our android devices or ios in 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:56.330
 this case we will go files as we have 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:59.210
 down there and we have to configure the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.849
 team with teamviewer before let's say that 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.650
 was remote control or transfer of 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.139
 file we will select the tab of 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.939
 transfer files and as we see here in 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.669
 this case on the ipad 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:13.159
 I'm accessing a folder where 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:17.539
 I have many documents and I'm going to 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:19.789
 transfer me a file to my ipad and 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.529
 I will also open it directly in 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:25.199
 the ebook 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.719
 here ends the tutorial I hope that you 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.759
 have liked it if you have any doubt what 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.589
 can you ask if you liked it 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.019
 you can give to like you will help me enough 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:38.239
 If you want to subscribe to the channel 

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:38.239
 welcome to another
