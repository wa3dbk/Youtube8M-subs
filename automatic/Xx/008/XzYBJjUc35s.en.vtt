00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
know when this is going to happen guys

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.100 
know when this is going to happen guys
because<00:02:36.730> mellow<00:02:37.090> Valley<00:02:37.360> didn't<00:02:37.660> state<00:02:37.960> if

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
because mellow Valley didn't state if

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.300 
because mellow Valley didn't state if
this<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.350> going<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.680> happen<00:02:38.800> in<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.130> third

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
this is going to happen in the third

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.690 
this is going to happen in the third
episode<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:40.060> which<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.200> really<00:02:41.770> doubt<00:02:42.310> it's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
episode and which I really doubt it's

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.340 
episode and which I really doubt it's
going<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.180> be<00:02:43.300> in<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.510> third<00:02:43.690> episode<00:02:43.870> guys

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
going to be in the third episode guys

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.220 
going to be in the third episode guys
because<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:46.350> think<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:49.330> order<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:49.690> to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
because I think that in order for to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.070 
because I think that in order for to
introduce<00:02:50.740> both<00:02:50.980> Goku<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.760> Vegeta<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.660> eggs

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
introduce both Goku and Vegeta and eggs

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.770 
introduce both Goku and Vegeta and eggs
ear<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.530> have<00:02:53.710> them<00:02:53.890> fuse<00:02:54.280> they<00:02:55.090> need<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.510> set

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
ear and have them fuse they need to set

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.110 
ear and have them fuse they need to set
the<00:02:55.960> ground<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.860> know<00:02:56.980> they<00:02:57.580> need<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.790> prepare

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
the ground you know they need to prepare

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.640 
the ground you know they need to prepare
this<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.630> happen<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.140> this<00:02:59.290> has<00:02:59.440> not<00:02:59.620> been

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
this to happen and this has not been

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.350 
this to happen and this has not been
prepared<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.640> third<00:03:00.820> episode<00:03:01.240> is

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
prepared I think the third episode is

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.140 
prepared I think the third episode is
still<00:03:01.540> going<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.840> be<00:03:01.960> about<00:03:02.640> Goten<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.850> like

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
still going to be about Goten and like

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.210 
still going to be about Goten and like
trunks<00:03:04.630> fusing<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.290> battle<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.710> Saiyans<00:03:06.100> and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
trunks fusing to battle the Saiyans and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.480 
trunks fusing to battle the Saiyans and
maybe<00:03:06.430> go<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.240> I<00:03:08.230> think<00:03:08.920> that's<00:03:09.130> about<00:03:09.430> it

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
maybe go on and I think that's about it

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.450 
maybe go on and I think that's about it
and<00:03:09.790> maybe<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.420> broli<00:03:10.960> but<00:03:11.860> we're<00:03:12.160> not<00:03:12.280> going

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
and maybe of broli but we're not going

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.610
