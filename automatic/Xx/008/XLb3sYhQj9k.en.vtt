00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.830 
I do try and think before I say things
but<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.870> mean<00:00:49.500> doesn't<00:00:50.010> always<00:00:50.280> work<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.840> I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
but I mean doesn't always work but I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.990 
but I mean doesn't always work but I
don't<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:52.410> think<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.829> intelligent<00:00:53.789> or

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
don't really think that intelligent or

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.369 
don't really think that intelligent or
smart<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.660> necessarily<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.260> good<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
smart is necessarily a good way to

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.290 
smart is necessarily a good way to

describe the house of ravenclaw as a
whole<00:01:00.629> um<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.340> definitely<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
whole um I think that's definitely a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.240 
whole um I think that's definitely a
value<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.629> Ravenclaw's<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.100> they

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
value that Ravenclaw's have is that they

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.149 
value that Ravenclaw's have is that they
do<00:01:05.309> value<00:01:05.939> intelligence<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.930> knowledge<00:01:07.159> but

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
do value intelligence and knowledge but

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.480 
do value intelligence and knowledge but
i<00:01:09.710> don't<00:01:10.710> i<00:01:10.830> don't<00:01:10.890> think<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.310> really

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
i don't i don't think it's really

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.280 
i don't i don't think it's really
necessarily<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.030> good<00:01:12.180> district<00:01:12.540> descriptive

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
