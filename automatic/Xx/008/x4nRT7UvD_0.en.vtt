you've got an open water stream coming

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.960 
you've got an open water stream coming
up<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.069> you're<00:00:08.160> not<00:00:08.309> quite<00:00:08.460> sure<00:00:08.580> how<00:00:08.910> to

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
up and you're not quite sure how to

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.640 
up and you're not quite sure how to
train<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.480> there's<00:00:10.019> three<00:00:10.260> types<00:00:10.500> of

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
train for it there's three types of

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.530 
train for it there's three types of
training<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.099> like<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.460> do<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.120> first<00:00:12.360> one

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
training that I like to do the first one

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.850 
training that I like to do the first one
is<00:00:12.660> aerobic<00:00:12.929> training<00:00:13.259> where<00:00:13.679> you're<00:00:13.769> working

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
is aerobic training where you're working

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.580 
is aerobic training where you're working
at<00:00:14.160> 65<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:15.179> 85<00:00:15.450> percent<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:15.990> your<00:00:16.139> maximum

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
at 65 to 85 percent of your maximum

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.260 
at 65 to 85 percent of your maximum
heart<00:00:16.770> rate<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.730> builds<00:00:18.000> up<00:00:18.119> your

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
heart rate and that builds up your

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.939 
heart rate and that builds up your
aerobic<00:00:18.660> based<00:00:18.869> fitness<00:00:19.260> which<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
aerobic based fitness which is like the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.460 
aerobic based fitness which is like the
foundation<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.730> your<00:00:21.180> endurance<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.720> me<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
foundation of your endurance for me the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.109 
foundation of your endurance for me the
second<00:00:22.800> one<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.279> anaerobic<00:00:23.939> training

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
second one in is anaerobic training

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.660 
second one in is anaerobic training
where<00:00:24.750> you're<00:00:24.869> working<00:00:25.140> at<00:00:25.230> 85%<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.189> more<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
where you're working at 85% or more of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.670 
where you're working at 85% or more of
your<00:00:26.880> maximum<00:00:27.240> heart<00:00:27.390> rate<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.410> is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
your maximum heart rate and that is

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.320 
your maximum heart rate and that is
where<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.070> start<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.550> produce<00:00:29.730> lactate

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
where you start to produce lactate

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.849 
where you start to produce lactate
during<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> set<00:00:31.199> where<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.410> start<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> get

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
during the set where you start to get

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.410 
during the set where you start to get
fatigued<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.579> your<00:00:32.700> muscles<00:00:33.000> get<00:00:33.149> heavier

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
fatigued and your muscles get heavier

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.170 
fatigued and your muscles get heavier
and<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.110> type<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.440> training<00:00:34.940> gets<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and that type of training gets you the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.900 
and that type of training gets you the
train<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.899> remove<00:00:37.469> lactic<00:00:37.829> acid<00:00:38.219> while<00:00:38.700> you're

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
train to remove lactic acid while you're

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.670 
train to remove lactic acid while you're
swimming<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.480> allows<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> swim<00:00:40.200> faster

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
swimming so it allows you to swim faster

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.799 
swimming so it allows you to swim faster
for<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> longer<00:00:41.280> period<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.640> time<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.600> third

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
for a longer period of time the third

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.290 
for a longer period of time the third
type<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> set<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> speed<00:00:44.100> set<00:00:44.399> will<00:00:45.090> usually

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
type of set is a speed set will usually

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
type of set is a speed set will usually
go<00:00:45.690> some<00:00:46.110> aerobic<00:00:46.500> swimming<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.070> some<00:00:47.340> slower

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
go some aerobic swimming so some slower

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
go some aerobic swimming so some slower
paced<00:00:47.910> swimming<00:00:48.270> followed<00:00:48.960> by<00:00:49.140> some<00:00:49.440> fast

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
paced swimming followed by some fast

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.010 
paced swimming followed by some fast
sprinting<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.789> that's<00:00:50.969> good<00:00:51.180> before<00:00:51.329> training

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
sprinting so that's good before training

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.529 
sprinting so that's good before training
up<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.370> go<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.640> pack<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.239> need<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
up to go with the pack if you need to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
up to go with the pack if you need to
cut<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.079> need<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.440> go<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.190> them<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
cut if you need to go with them or to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.029 
cut if you need to go with them or to
overtake<00:00:57.600> someone<00:00:58.020> or<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.530> go<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
overtake someone or to go with a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.689 
overtake someone or to go with a
breakaway

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
breakaway

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.849 
breakaway
so<00:01:00.149> that's<00:01:00.629> good<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:00.899> using<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.500> for

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
so that's good for using that for

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.290 
so that's good for using that for
training<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.280> speed<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.879> sometimes

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
training the speed that you sometimes

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600 
training the speed that you sometimes
need<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.719> an<00:01:03.840> open<00:01:04.110> water<00:01:04.260> swim<00:01:04.530> an<00:01:04.739> example

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
need in an open water swim an example

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.149 
need in an open water swim an example
set<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.060> speed<00:01:06.299> set<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.780> 150<00:01:07.290> aerobic

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
set of a speed set would be 150 aerobic

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.280 
set of a speed set would be 150 aerobic
pace<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.610> me<00:01:08.640> take<00:01:09.299> ten<00:01:09.510> seconds<00:01:09.900> rest<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.200> the

don't want to have to think about

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.120 
don't want to have to think about
writing<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.080> own<00:01:16.200> sets<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.650> cover<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:16.979> those

three<00:01:17.460> types<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.939> training<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.439> get

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
three types of training then you can get

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.620 
three types of training then you can get
