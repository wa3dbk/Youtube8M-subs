00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.140
 so far we have shown more nurseries of 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.740
 open field because they are the most common 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.600
 all over Brazil and cheaper but you 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.500
 can produce seedlings in 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.960
 closed 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.250
 the greenhouses both seedlings of greenery 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.200
 how much seedlings 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.720
 see this is a structure of propagation 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 and training of seedlings technically well 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.180
 been set up in CordeirÃ³polis are 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.850
 Paulo and belongs to the center of 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.769
 citricultura sylvio moreira 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.739
 in these environments the control 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.580
 plant is very well facilitated 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.580
 such as cultural dealings 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.930
 observe and control system for 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.269
 enter the greenhouse cultivation area 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.640
 a kind of anti- lime room on the floor 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.690
 used as a disinfectant for soles 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.390
 of the shoes 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.080
 thus avoiding contamination to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.080
 inside the greenhouse 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.470
 It's good to remember greenhouses and nurseries 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.810
 place for visitors and curious 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.149
 here are the means for the production of the door 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.570
 graft is made directly tubes 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.700
 mounted on tray trays are those 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.020
 small tubes suitable for use in 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.240
 stoves and filled with substrate the door 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.939
 graft is subsequently transplanted 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.549
 for these larger tubes where the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.369
 its development until the moment of 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:47.850
 had to look at the graft 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.640
 already grafted horses and see that the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.179
 is living green and therefore 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.259
 developing here a ready seedling 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.259
 for planting in the field 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.530
 it is certain that for planting purposes to take 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.140
 the necessary field care 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.420
 in this environment with you to the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.930
 germination and seedling formation 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.330
 there is another space where also controlled 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.000
 if butterflies are grown 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.000
 hence the gemstones for grafting
