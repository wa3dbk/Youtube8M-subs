00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.600
 hi mikÃ¨ of the hub at least this the 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.280
 our channel today we're going to make 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.080
 the crown pizza 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.770
 let's see how we do go to 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:21.660
 select a side row not too much 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:26.130
 low weaving the shorter part 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 I select a lock of hair 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.340
 I divide the foolish m and begins the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.060
 bracelet 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:42.880
 starting from the low one bringing it 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.880
 upwards and intertwining with c 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.420
 initially it is like the French braid 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.420
 walk 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.920
 but it came to a quarter of the party 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 and from here it simply continues inter 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 cial 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.320
 a man broke down 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.340
 always try to get the most 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.520
 possible with the plot so as not to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.050
 then being able to leave I don't know what in the final 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.740
 because he wants to go we will insert 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:51.300
 inside the greece we will now go to 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.830
 create a small circle by fixing the arrow 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.160
 here on the right side we are with one 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.160
 clothespin 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:08.140
 and the part that remains we go to 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.880
 hide below 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.620
 if you see that the track is a little slow 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.500
 you can always recover with one 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.010
 wifey and pull up the braid 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.480
 finished you can cole wanting to give a little 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.300
 of volume here is to create a blur in the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.900
 part below this is a very braid 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.150
 pretty, very fresh summer youth 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.920
 you can simply use it even for a 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.610
 afternoon with friends take a 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.780
 ice cream can also come out with its own 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.270
 boyfriend the arrow ended ours 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.870
 braid determined but if you liked it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.920
