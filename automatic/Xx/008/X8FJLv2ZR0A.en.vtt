00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.580
 zaouahri back or the brief let's talk all 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.150
 first of this monument that is joe 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.430
 bonaventure 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.750
 it's a work hirohiko araki cear 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.460
 mangas and more popular in Japan 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.110
 to such an extent that he broke down the culture 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.420
 Japanese multilevel in time 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.100
 but dude you have references to hot 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.520
 hot in a lot of video games by 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.080
 example 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.699
 street fighter cai is inspired by 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.230
 stribe character from part 2 of 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.180
 manga if you want to see the influx of 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.610
 thing you have references a kino shock 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.259
 soma 1 world q if yes it's my guy 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.710
 there's that blizzard is well and truly 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.780
 cooked 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.430
 if I play is loved by his fans it's 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.530
 surely thanks to his particular spirit 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.960
 with these jo break or his offbeat universe 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.860
 his characters ultra charismatic his 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.990
 musical references 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.390
 these strategic fights and especially 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.040
 thanks to its what do for it's true what 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.420
 it's one of the only manga where the hero 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.009
 any fate that will come out the technique 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.119
 ancestral family and where you 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.250
 you're waiting for something that will tear everything up 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.350
 even worse than the soap opera punch and 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.350
 it's effect it's the leak 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.850
 allison but briefly i advise you julia 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.350
 this masterpiece 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.610
 this is not done because I pray thee a 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.020
 immediately I will rob you of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.850
 part of a narrow and probably good 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.020
 more but good with my corrupted mind 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.970
 by device when i think of john 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.970
 hollis adventure I think about that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.129
 but before we talk about the same, we're going to 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.830
 first talked about jo because the knowledge 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.239
 hugo is the power of jo jo it's the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.980
 care to embody if I had to look 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.810
 charisma in the dictionary there would have 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.849
 a picture of diot it's cool that this 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.200
 either in the manga at night or in 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.510
 video games on the other hand in the water 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.620
 did he really look like anything diot 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.209
 it's the guy who will take all that 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.420
 you own it will really rot you 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.459
 life 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.720
 he will hit your dog and then kill him 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.400
 then eat it no I laugh 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.620
 the ag to be cooked it is eight to ten 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.760
 anyway besides the image of doing 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.840
 the first part will always make me laugh 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.319
 because you see all the characters 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.640
 important and even the dog kind but 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.140
 kind the dog is important in 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.319
 the story and for all fans of na 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.900
 li 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.780
 you have to be two sachets that has 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.790
 embodied yeah I know it's a bit of a 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.500
 joke at the sonic boom blondieau south 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.730
 and humble in front of all your friends when 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.769
 you think you're kissing is your girlfriend 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.019
 for the first time and no it was 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.860
 him diot and in addition there are powers 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.780
 immortal vampire a hair and kind of 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.519
 any frost squarely you will not kill 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.780
 Airline iron with eyes you have 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.230
 never thought a vampire could do 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.230
 that 1 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.270
 and there you ask yourself union and the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.440
 reports to rudo aboy and that I do not 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.630
 I will not quote among all these tours 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.490
 hachey good I already begged that 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.960
 install the stones apart from the 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.430
 squatters that is the 3d practice of 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.290
 world the stelae plunged psychic 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.790
 the young person fighting spirit and in 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.310
 function of people the power changes 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.670
 is beaten it's kouadio he has a whore 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.740
 stadium 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.720
 I tell you that God has already dropped 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.900
 with the powers of vampires so his 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.610
 stone will not be too much and banon already 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.960
 his stand and top at war or water this 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.520
 which means this world 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.740
 damn it's really the class of 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.450
 sick he is fast and after a 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.840
 scramble and especially he did it by taking 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.840
 five seconds 5 fu king seconds 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.580
 but in short the same is based on judo 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.320
 late as they are at the most 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.930
 known is where laughing alcohol 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.730
 sawa the back throws earplugs in 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.590
 hanging you crash with a roller 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.730
 compressor and then they hit the 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.560
 scroll compressor buyers who 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:11.610
 explains I have never seen a purchase of 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:13.320
 life at this bridge the week started at 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.120
 japan it's on the japanese web that's 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.620
 many fans have done animations or 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.630
 videos to pay tribute to the cheek 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.270

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.650
 stikeman who called muda it's thanks to 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.750
 this animation that the mmm started 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.030
 the animation was created by a mythical 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.800
 this Japanese time to 1234 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.180

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.930
 when does she appeared but 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.910

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.390
 himself who introduced him to the rest of the 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.610
