00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.269
 Good day and sometimes it 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.830
 today i will tell you how to use 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.080
 m seidi program 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.060
 today I will touch only the very basics 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.650
 because the program is very extensive and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.590
 opens us a huge amount 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.300
 Opportunity principle m sits serves to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.019
 to work remotely with the world 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.420
 Einkrad to very quickly and set 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.300
 a huge number of blocks such as 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.840
 let's say a big wall is a big sphere or 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.850
 huge pyramid so let's start what we 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.610
 we see when sitting open we see 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 here is a black window and yellow 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.640
 inscriptions here we have extremely world 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.300
 create a new world of forms load the world 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.120
 experienced him open level here with us 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.160
 There are all sorts of information settings about them 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.500
 cindy 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.609
 next we have the name of all worlds 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.930
 which we already opened I already 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:08.010
 specially left here a few to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.840
 clearly it was so push olp nl you 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.550
 throws a session into the folder at least 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.050
 should and if I then you 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.470
 these windows 7 users your name 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.470
 user appdata roaming. maykravt 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.930
 Union and continue to choose the world that you 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.450
 need let's say i want to open this one 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.510
 here is the world i open the folder with this world 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.260
 I select a file . dates and press open as 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.710
 see i appear in this world which i 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.050
 and wanted here I have a ship with 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.000
 which I wanted to work in principle 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.190
 people now the world will not boot 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.640
 surprised by the shadow of the ship and here and with 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.860
 amkar 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.380
 Well, more precisely, it is the ruins of the ship and so we 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.210
 select a particular region not 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.950
 so big and further we can it 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.870
 expand 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.990
 fly you all go basically very 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.310
 but just for a start unusually to 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.860
 work quietly you will have a little bit 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.350
 I 'll just tell you to practice 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.640
 how to manage in principle the management 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.620
 same as everywhere 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.930
 and left and right w forward c back cue 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.610
 us soars by clicking on the big we 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.400
 took off and put besides schizoid 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.959
 drop down if we pin right 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.940
 button then we can calmly like 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.019
 rotate and so here i highlight 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.720
 specific region 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.709
 to expand it I bring to the bottom 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.890
 part spend down lay on the side 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.560
 parts this all expands and so here 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.090
 I selected the ship let's get started 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.230
 here we open as soon as we 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.120
 we start to allocate with us here 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.370
 A menu opens in candies elect this 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.030
 cancel selection Salekh than with choose 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.549
 chunky david boxing remove all blocks 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.930
 inside of our selection and so let me 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.900
 snatched more here 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.120
 for birds, it's ours to remove all mobs 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.819
 analysis of this counts us how many blocks 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.040
 inside our selection of some 8 we press and 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.109
 so here is answer but here is a list of all 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.909
 the blocks that we have here are like 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.510
 see here we would get a lot 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.990
 stones left on their stone half block in 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.320
 stone 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.570
 and the boss blocks air a lot in general both 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.270
 see we can also save it all 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.680
 some fell then to see so 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.930
 we can cut this out and then paste 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.890
 some place we can copy we 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.720
 we can also insert it later and we can 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.370
 output as a separate file and 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.560
 which using the import button 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.240
 insert some world so let's 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.960
 Iâ€™ll remove it now 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.790
 click before boxing or keys 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.670
 as you can see we have a replay singles writes and 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.460
 Now for when the red will disappear we 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.040
 we see that our ship is gone 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.010
 let's continue I have here 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.620
 such here as if the ruins let's 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.620
 let's see what kind of block it is with us 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.390
 let's see what kind of block it is 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.700
 let us anvils fine then 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.430
 let's get out here is such a pretty big one 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.530
 interval and then I will tell you about 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.020
 The next tool is Philo Repleis 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.459
 let's select replace select 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.920
 find our anvil m. 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.370
 great oh sorry not clicked there 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.400
 choose what the substitute intel names ok 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.490
 and choose what to replace me in this 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:37.420
 case I choose the air and everything is fine 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:38.920
 click the relay it loads and now 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.910
 if I press deselect 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.310
 where it is gone red you will see that 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.980
 anvil here is no longer left only 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.590
 those that were below the highlight but 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.500
 the remaining blocks are not gone and so we go 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:58.180
 next I want to now forgive the house 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.580
 value knife I want to highlight this one 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:06.300
 region and replace it just fill 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.300
 grass I will come down. down still jealous 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.000
 so take off again phelan dry place 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.550
 I don't choose this tool anymore 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.060
 just choose immediately click on the block 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.610
 I introduce an eye I already have grass here and 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.810
 click fil 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.160
 now come again a little bit 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.650
 time, it will go off and you see that 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.139
 us in the life of the earth and so great save 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.050
 Now let's continue the measures so let's 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.580
 continue on but there is 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.430
 tool tool out. which allows 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:42.870
 us how to arrange the very scope of those 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.880
 the most would be such pyramids about 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.919
 which I said the same way here 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.330
 choose another mode but usually we will 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.450
 use the film so I don't even 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.919
 I will go into details here 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.660
 the hollow parameter if we put here 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.540
 tick then inside our 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.400
 our sphere or pyramid will not be blocks 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.270
 if we remove the internal tick 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.550
 there will be blogs 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.870
 and so let's see here you can 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.610
 choose size and let's say if i 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.560
 I will put this size on 100 how 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.360
 you can see he is getting here is such a 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.449
 Little 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.340
 but if i put here on 100 then 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:16.759
 how to see it becomes even more 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.080
 interesting form and so with this we can 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.879
 experiment very long all 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.099
 depends on what you need let's 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:24.229
 back to our toolbar and 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.340
 let's see what we have here still here 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.080
 we have him play 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.879
 if we don't know where our player is we can 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.969
 go to it by pressing the year player key 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:33.439
 and here is our player 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:36.169
 accordingly we can also come 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:38.360
 see where our player is looking 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:40.129
 looks over here and let's get this one and this one 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.779
 I have a player here I will move from 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.509
 player saint-clemen player 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:46.729
 i click and move it over here 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:49.039
 I moved from there and here also I can 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.580
 pour somewhere here and click 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.710
 the key 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.539
 the line clear the camera I mean 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.969
 I will transfer the player directly to our mind as 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:07:01.159
 see he brought it here let me 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:03.590
 save it and let's see what u 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.180
 We now stands here as if 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.620
 husband 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.470
 you can transfer ask forgot to say 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.510
 we can see this spam in this 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.080
 year spawn and let's see now 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.120
 we are worth 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.070
 spawn on this sphere a bit 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.160
 on the right and let's move it 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.920
 somewhere here press control with 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:25.840
 or click here and select 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.310
 safe that's all fine he keeps with us 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.470
 close and we have the last 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.510
 a tool called chang 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.670
 control emit at once holistic chunks and 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.350
 not very convenient to use in such 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.300
 mode so we press tab and we 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.850
 go to the map of chunks from it 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.700
 so called here is very convenient to see everything 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.890
 chunks that's how you see i can select them 

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.000
 select I can remove the selection by clicking more 

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.460
 times per selection 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.620
 but in principle it doesn't really need it 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.200
 only needed for large-scale work which 

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:57.320
 that is, to go back to 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.150
 to ordinary sight, we again press tab well 

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.880
 that's basically everything we still have 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.620
 tab filter and tab clown them 

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.660
 I will explain in the next lessons and 

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.890
