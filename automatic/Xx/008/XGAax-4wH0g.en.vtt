00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.550 

now<00:00:20.060> I've<00:00:20.210> got<00:00:20.390> a<00:00:20.419> great<00:00:20.869> little<00:00:21.140> riff<00:00:21.349> that

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
now I've got a great little riff that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.290 
now I've got a great little riff that
Jerry<00:00:21.800> Lee<00:00:21.949> Lewis<00:00:22.160> used<00:00:22.520> as<00:00:22.759> well<00:00:22.939> as<00:00:23.029> a<00:00:23.090> lot<00:00:23.270> of

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
Jerry Lee Lewis used as well as a lot of

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.150 
Jerry Lee Lewis used as well as a lot of
other<00:00:23.539> boogie<00:00:23.900> woogie<00:00:24.140> players<00:00:24.410> that<00:00:24.860> just

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
other boogie woogie players that just

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.009 
other boogie woogie players that just
sounds<00:00:25.550> harder<00:00:25.880> than<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:26.150> Dickens<00:00:26.539> and<00:00:26.660> when

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
sounds harder than the Dickens and when

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.599 
sounds harder than the Dickens and when
you<00:00:27.109> play<00:00:27.259> it<00:00:27.349> really<00:00:27.740> fast<00:00:28.009> it<00:00:28.189> kind<00:00:28.310> of<00:00:28.429> is

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
you play it really fast it kind of is

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.189 
you play it really fast it kind of is
but<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.939> actual<00:00:29.240> riff<00:00:29.480> itself<00:00:29.869> is<00:00:30.019> pretty

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
but the actual riff itself is pretty

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.810 
but the actual riff itself is pretty
simple<00:00:30.320> so<00:00:30.890> I'm<00:00:30.980> just<00:00:31.099> going<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.310> blindly<00:00:31.490> give

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
simple so I'm just going to blindly give

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.180 
simple so I'm just going to blindly give
this<00:00:32.000> one<00:00:32.210> away<00:00:32.330> it<00:00:32.629> sounds<00:00:33.080> like<00:00:33.230> this

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.860 

now<00:00:39.850> that<00:00:40.000> would<00:00:40.150> sound<00:00:40.329> like<00:00:40.570> something

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
now that would sound like something

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.940 
now that would sound like something
you'd<00:00:40.989> like<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.140> sit<00:00:41.380> down<00:00:41.470> and<00:00:41.620> play<00:00:41.770> I'm

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
you'd like to sit down and play I'm

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.229 
you'd like to sit down and play I'm
assuming<00:00:42.400> those<00:00:42.520> are<00:00:42.550> fun<00:00:42.850> to<00:00:42.970> do<00:00:43.090> those

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
assuming those are fun to do those

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.000 
assuming those are fun to do those
things<00:00:43.480> let<00:00:43.960> me<00:00:43.989> tear<00:00:44.230> it<00:00:44.350> apart<00:00:44.410> really

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
things let me tear it apart really

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.040 
things let me tear it apart really

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
three chords were going to deal with

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.090

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
because the Boogie will be as a type of

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
just need to slide up off there okay so

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.550 
just need to slide up off there okay so
there's<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.070> start<00:01:15.340> up<00:01:15.780> now<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.840> separate

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
there's the start up now you separate

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:29.190 
there's the start up now you separate
the<00:01:17.710> chord<00:01:23.070> that's<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:27.479> now<00:01:28.479> add<00:01:28.690> that<00:01:28.899> to<00:01:29.080> the

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
the chord that's it now add that to the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.690 
the chord that's it now add that to the
beginning<00:01:29.470> slide<00:01:29.770> I<00:01:29.830> did<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:30.430> sounds<00:01:30.640> like

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
beginning slide I did and it sounds like

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.310 
beginning slide I did and it sounds like
this<00:01:34.440> I'll<00:01:35.440> do<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:35.830> again<00:01:36.899> now<00:01:37.899> you<00:01:37.960> can<00:01:38.170> also

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
this I'll do it again now you can also

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.590 
this I'll do it again now you can also
finger<00:01:38.800> it<00:01:38.860> I've<00:01:39.130> just<00:01:39.160> caught<00:01:40.060> myself<00:01:40.240> doing

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
finger it I've just caught myself doing

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.850 
finger it I've just caught myself doing
and<00:01:40.780> I'm<00:01:40.840> not<00:01:40.960> sure<00:01:41.110> which<00:01:41.289> way<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.470> do<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:41.770> I'd

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
and I'm not sure which way I do it I'd

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.260 
and I'm not sure which way I do it I'd
probably<00:01:41.890> switch<00:01:42.369> back<00:01:42.580> and<00:01:42.610> forth<00:01:43.000> instead

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
probably switch back and forth instead

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.499 
probably switch back and forth instead
of<00:01:43.750> using<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.170> same<00:01:44.349> two<00:01:44.530> fingers<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:45.509> could

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
of using the same two fingers you could

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.710 
of using the same two fingers you could
do<00:01:46.630> it<00:01:46.750> like<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:50.819> so<00:01:51.819> probably<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.569> good

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
do it like this so probably a good

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.240 
do it like this so probably a good
exercise<00:01:53.020> for<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.470> is<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.770> just<00:01:53.950> get<00:01:54.130> your

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
exercise for that is to just get your

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.640 
exercise for that is to just get your
fingers<00:01:54.610> comfortable<00:01:55.179> two<00:01:56.220> or

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.750 

just<00:02:00.650> get<00:02:00.800> comfortable<00:02:01.040> doing<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.460> the

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
just get comfortable doing that the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.700 
just get comfortable doing that the
great<00:02:02.000> news<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.240> that<00:02:02.450> exact<00:02:03.200> same<00:02:03.409> hand

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
great news is that exact same hand

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.110 
great news is that exact same hand
position<00:02:03.770> once<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.400> lock<00:02:04.580> your<00:02:04.729> hand<00:02:04.940> in<00:02:05.030> a

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
position once you lock your hand in a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.440 
position once you lock your hand in a

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
cast you can move it you know now in

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.639 
cast you can move it you know now in
this<00:02:08.570> case<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:08.990> after<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:09.350> have<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.530> play
