the<00:05:19.980> Black<00:05:20.160> Mesa<00:05:20.370> forms<00:05:20.850> but<00:05:21.000> it<00:05:21.090> really<00:05:21.300> goes

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
the Black Mesa forms but it really goes

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.150 
the Black Mesa forms but it really goes
to<00:05:21.510> show<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.960> these<00:05:22.110> developers<00:05:22.680> know<00:05:22.950> what

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
to show that these developers know what

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.040 
to show that these developers know what
they're<00:05:23.310> doing<00:05:23.700> and<00:05:23.820> really<00:05:24.450> care<00:05:24.750> about

they're doing and really care about

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.810 
they're doing and really care about
half-life<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:26.010> reason<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.310> I'm<00:05:26.460> making

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
half-life and the reason that I'm making

with this new updated website there was

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.790 
with this new updated website there was
actually<00:05:57.270> a<00:05:57.300> file<00:05:57.720> added<00:05:58.140> into<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.650> website

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
actually a file added into the website

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.890 
actually a file added into the website
that<00:05:59.160> shows<00:05:59.400> off<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.610> picture<00:05:59.940> of<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.419> updated

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
that shows off a picture of the updated

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.110 
that shows off a picture of the updated
HEV<00:06:01.680> suit<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:02.160> initial<00:06:02.460> reactions<00:06:02.940> were

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
HEV suit the initial reactions were

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.940 
HEV suit the initial reactions were
mixed<00:06:03.150> on<00:06:03.600> facepunch<00:06:04.229> but<00:06:04.440> i<00:06:04.470> think<00:06:04.800> this

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
mixed on facepunch but i think this

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.740 
mixed on facepunch but i think this
looks<00:06:05.220> great<00:06:05.460> as<00:06:05.760> it<00:06:05.880> seems<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.240> combine<00:06:06.540> many

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
looks great as it seems to combine many

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.050 
looks great as it seems to combine many
things<00:06:07.110> from<00:06:07.320> half-life<00:06:07.770> 2<00:06:07.979> and<00:06:08.220> half-life<00:06:08.640> 1

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
things from half-life 2 and half-life 1

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.120 
things from half-life 2 and half-life 1
in<00:06:09.270> the<00:06:09.390> HEV<00:06:09.930> suit<00:06:09.960> and<00:06:10.410> all<00:06:10.620> of<00:06:10.770> this<00:06:10.890> stuff

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
in the HEV suit and all of this stuff

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.770 
in the HEV suit and all of this stuff
really<00:06:11.370> points<00:06:11.820> that<00:06:11.940> the<00:06:12.030> retail<00:06:12.450> full

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780
