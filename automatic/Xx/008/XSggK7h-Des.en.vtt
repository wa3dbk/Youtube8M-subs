Team<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.500> take<00:00:25.710> down<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.039> deadly<00:00:26.340> six<00:00:26.640> so

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
Team up can take down the deadly six so

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.730

since Sonic and Eggman are teaming up

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.349 
since Sonic and Eggman are teaming up
maybe<00:00:29.010> Eggman<00:00:29.550> will<00:00:29.699> factor<00:00:29.970> into<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
maybe Eggman will factor into the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.540 
maybe Eggman will factor into the
gameplay<00:00:30.570> somehow<00:00:31.349> they<00:00:31.619> will<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:31.920> only<00:00:32.070> using

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
on some fashion but we do know that

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.990 
on some fashion but we do know that
Sonic<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> only<00:00:34.950> character<00:00:35.399> players<00:00:35.700> will
