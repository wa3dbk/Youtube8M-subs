I<00:02:25.670> really<00:02:25.940> had<00:02:26.120> with<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.480> previous<00:02:26.690> sir<00:02:27.190> with

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
I really had with the previous sir with

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.500 
I really had with the previous sir with
the<00:02:28.250> previous<00:02:28.430> generation<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:29.180> did<00:02:29.300> feel<00:02:29.450> a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
the previous generation it did feel a

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.230 
the previous generation it did feel a
bit<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:30.080> bit<00:02:30.830> cheap<00:02:31.370> for<00:02:31.610> what<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.790> was<00:02:31.910> but<00:02:32.150> this

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
bit a bit cheap for what it was but this

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.000 
bit a bit cheap for what it was but this
one<00:02:32.420> certainly<00:02:32.660> feels<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.140> lot<00:02:33.200> more<00:02:33.290> rigid<00:02:33.590> lot

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
one certainly feels a lot more rigid lot

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.310 
one certainly feels a lot more rigid lot
