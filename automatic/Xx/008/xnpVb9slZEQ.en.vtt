let's<00:00:04.660> take<00:00:04.840> a<00:00:04.870> look<00:00:05.110> at<00:00:05.260> the<00:00:05.350> 24-yard<00:00:05.860> line

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.130 
let's take a look at the 24-yard line

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.830 
let's take a look at the 24-yard line
and<00:00:06.460> see<00:00:06.640> how<00:00:06.790> the<00:00:06.850> shot<00:00:07.180> differs<00:00:07.600> a<00:00:07.630> little

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:07.840 
and see how the shot differs a little

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.289 
and see how the shot differs a little
bit<00:00:07.990> from<00:00:08.110> here<00:00:08.770> as<00:00:09.670> we<00:00:09.880> shoot<00:00:10.090> this

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:10.299 
bit from here as we shoot this

relative<00:00:23.740> to<00:00:23.949> the<00:00:24.070> yardage<00:00:24.429> that<00:00:24.490> I<00:00:24.670> am

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
relative to the yardage that I am

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.450 
relative to the yardage that I am
shooting<00:00:25.300> as<00:00:25.539> they<00:00:26.380> come<00:00:26.589> back<00:00:26.800> I<00:00:27.009> know<00:00:27.070> that

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
shooting as they come back I know that

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.609 
shooting as they come back I know that
the<00:00:27.580> angle<00:00:27.939> has<00:00:28.089> changed<00:00:28.599> a<00:00:28.660> little<00:00:28.810> bit<00:00:29.050> so<00:00:29.439> my

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
the angle has changed a little bit so my

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.409 
the angle has changed a little bit so my
whole<00:00:29.859> point<00:00:30.130> is<00:00:30.279> going<00:00:30.490> to<00:00:30.580> be<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:30.849> little<00:00:31.210> bit

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
whole point is going to be a little bit

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.080 
whole point is going to be a little bit
lower<00:00:31.689> than<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:32.020> was<00:00:32.200> up<00:00:32.529> there<00:00:32.800> at<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:32.950> 20<00:00:33.430> so

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
lower than it was up there at the 20 so

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.390 
lower than it was up there at the 20 so
be<00:00:34.240> very<00:00:34.510> very<00:00:35.020> cautious<00:00:35.260> and<00:00:35.830> look<00:00:36.070> at<00:00:36.190> that

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
be very very cautious and look at that

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.070 
be very very cautious and look at that
don't<00:00:36.670> keep<00:00:36.910> it<00:00:37.060> up<00:00:37.210> here<00:00:37.390> at<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.600> same<00:00:37.810> height

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
don't keep it up here at the same height

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.170 
don't keep it up here at the same height
as<00:00:38.110> what<00:00:38.920> you're<00:00:39.100> going<00:00:39.310> to<00:00:39.370> do<00:00:39.550> is<00:00:39.700> cause<00:00:39.940> this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
as what you're going to do is cause this

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.060 
as what you're going to do is cause this
gun<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.600> little<00:00:40.840> bit<00:00:40.990> of<00:00:41.200> vertical<00:00:41.590> move<00:00:41.800> and

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
gun a little bit of vertical move and

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.590 
gun a little bit of vertical move and
end<00:00:42.340> up<00:00:42.490> shooting<00:00:42.670> over<00:00:43.090> a<00:00:43.120> lot<00:00:43.330> of<00:00:43.480> these

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
end up shooting over a lot of these

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.470 
end up shooting over a lot of these
targets<00:00:44.080> as<00:00:44.490> we<00:00:45.490> do<00:00:45.670> that<00:00:45.910> we're<00:00:46.330> going<00:00:46.420> to

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
targets as we do that we're going to

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.450 
targets as we do that we're going to
make<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:46.690> good<00:00:46.960> solid<00:00:47.230> setup<00:00:47.710> here<00:00:47.950> we're<00:00:48.370> going

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
make a good solid setup here we're going

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.830 
make a good solid setup here we're going
to<00:00:48.520> shoot<00:00:48.760> a<00:00:48.850> couple<00:00:49.000> let's<00:00:49.330> take<00:00:49.480> a<00:00:49.510> look<00:00:49.750> at

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
to shoot a couple let's take a look at

00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:04.229 
to shoot a couple let's take a look at
one<00:00:56.610> ball<00:01:00.990> again<00:01:02.070> what<00:01:03.070> you<00:01:03.220> saw<00:01:03.430> there<00:01:03.730> was

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
one ball again what you saw there was

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.630 
one ball again what you saw there was
good<00:01:04.479> proper<00:01:04.900> shooting<00:01:05.110> mechanics<00:01:05.740> put<00:01:06.490> to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
good proper shooting mechanics put to

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.150 
good proper shooting mechanics put to
good<00:01:06.790> use<00:01:06.850> on<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.450> target<00:01:07.870> at<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.710> beginning

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
good use on that target at the beginning

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.910 
good use on that target at the beginning
you<00:01:09.280> saw<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.520> good<00:01:09.820> solid<00:01:10.180> still<00:01:10.840> gun<00:01:11.110> eyes<00:01:11.560> were

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
you saw a good solid still gun eyes were

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.730 
you saw a good solid still gun eyes were
still<00:01:12.220> gun<00:01:12.760> burl<00:01:13.000> was<00:01:13.240> still<00:01:13.510> as<00:01:13.720> I<00:01:14.470> made<00:01:14.620> the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
still gun burl was still as I made the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.470 
still gun burl was still as I made the
call<00:01:14.950> for<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.280> target<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:15.820> saw<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.060> target

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
going to do is give me a good field of

going to do is give me a good field of
vision<00:02:40.620> as<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.980> come<00:02:41.220> back<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.640> my<00:02:41.790> left<00:02:42.000> side<00:02:42.239> if
