00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello my name is sebastian 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.550
 and welcome to my test 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.170
 see the olympus xz 10 com camera here 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.790
 we then already the housing of xl 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.500
 have to say especially in black has me 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.179
 very much liked by the design 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.890
 the processing quality is also correct 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.660
 or until now mainly on metal 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.699
 so far we do not have cheap plastic 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.470
 on the front also see here that 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.330
 we have a leathery handle and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 This one is really helpful to me 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.160
 Keep the camera in your hand very well 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.779
 can 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.789
 on the front are then natural 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.439
 even the objective and we have 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.840
 here a 5x optical zoom and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.520
 a 12 megapixel sensor installed 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.320
 Apart from that, we have time here 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.329
 once again a ring around the lens 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.460
 by using manual mode especially the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.230
 Settings can change on the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.320
 right side of the camera then find here 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.520
 behind this door a micro hdmi 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.020
 connection as well as a mini usb connection 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.280
 on the bottom of the camera we have 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.949
 then the connection of course for 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.989
 tripod and then here again a door 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.989
 behind the battery and the SD card 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.940
 the sd card is a whole 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.100
 normal sd card for example here 32 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.869
 years working without problems not 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.680
 micro sd card such as the canon 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.790
 powershot n 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.350
 at the battery that is now seen here 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.080
 olympus on a rechargeable battery with one 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.390
 Capacity of 925 billion per 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.070
 hours - if not the strength eg the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.170
 sony hacks 50 had a clear 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.729
 stronger but in the end it is enough 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.400
 for this little camera and often quite 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.780
 on the top of the camera we find 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000
 then here the lightning this drives 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.470
 automatically off and then again 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.369
 stereo microphones once here 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.560
 of course with left and right 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.180
 are marked and then in and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.590
 this switch also has a ring 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.850
 which is lit when you have the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.740
 Turn on the camera like me once 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.630
 the bright blue can demonstrate 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.850
 apart from that we have here then 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.799
 of course, the trigger button and the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.630
 control then for the zoom 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.280
 as I said at the camera we find 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.750
 a 5x optical zoom 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.759
 so far, he is also very good too 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.470
 press and then of course here 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.570
 main selection advice for the different 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.430
 Modes of the camera a disadvantage of this 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.810
 Camera as far as the hardware is concerned 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.250
 right now the lightning is here 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.380
 One time extended like you do now 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.479
 good from the beginning and I have to 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.280
 say that the positioning bothers me 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.229
 because that's really it 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.840
 Place is where you put your finger off 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.099
 at least that's what in my case so and so 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.540
 the lightning goes out and you have 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.129
 actually afraid to damage him 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.050
 In that sense, it would definitely be one 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.180
 better solution if olympus 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.890
 he would have placed in the middle and then 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.690
 maybe the microphones on the left 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.129
 a really good feature of the camera 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.019
 is the touchscreen so far you can 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.239
 here then simply off if the object 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.129
 and then the camera focuses and does 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.040
 the photo you have to say that 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.690
 olympus the screen really only very 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.580
 has halfheartedly involved insofar can 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.200
 you take two pictures in a focused way 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.640
 however, for example in the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.810
 While you can play between modes 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.180
 also change the photos 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.700
 however, pinch to zoom does not work 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.010
 what you know for example from the smartphones 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.200
 insofar that is not optimally solved 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.819
 also with the menu of the camera one sees 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.980
 then these are really more on 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.510
 control or control of 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.489
 these regular buttons here on the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.750
 done back and not by the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.650
 touchscreen this works 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.060
 not even 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.540
 in that respect the operating concept seems to be 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.829
 the x10 is not completely thought through this 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.780
 most important of a camera is of course 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.280
 the photo and video quality what the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.349
 I have to say the photos have me 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.720
 olympus certainly convinced 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.639
 not enthusiastic insofar were the 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.930
 photos and the results quite in 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.850
 frame from which we had expected 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.630
 medium 12 megapixel sensor fivefold 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.459
 optical zoom 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.500
 Of course it must be said that such a 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.090
 five times optical zoom already really 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.220
 class is if you continue the objects 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.260
 want to pick it up and then 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.000
 also really well scanned insofar is 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
 a huge progress for example too 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.730
 a smartphone camera though the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.470
 Of course, they have become very good as well 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.120
 but a digital zoom is natural 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.099
 never compare with an optical one 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.540
 even the filter already in the camera 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.280
 they are incorporated directly 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.840
 For example, you can apply 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.430
 Landscape photos makes that the colors 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.900
 come across better and crisp 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.880
 I liked that very much 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.620
 You can also in the camera directly 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.880
 create art of collages for example 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.349
 which one liked very much 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.780
 so there are really many here 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.099
 creative possibilities what the video wall 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.049
 I have to say that has me 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.989
 disappointed are relatively little camera 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.010
 to see details despite full hd resolution 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.900
 alternating between light and dark 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.209
 generally a problem for the camera 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.319
 so far, the camera for photos as 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.090
 recommended for videos 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.040
 in the end I have to say that to me 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.349
 olympus xz 10 liked it 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.570
 the design of the processing quality and 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.280
 the image quality in photo right there 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.729
 definitely gives 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.530
 potential for improvement, for example 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.270
 the position of the lightning or 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.340
 synonymous but the video quality in the end 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.139
 I think that one at this 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.060
 Camera a good package for the price 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.260
 so far, thanks for 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.639
 watch if I like the video 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.560
 please give a thumbs up and 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.150
