00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
two sides of my face and then just back

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.429 
two sides of my face and then just back
and<00:01:30.340> forth<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.670> rest<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.149> way<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.840> there

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
and forth the rest of the way and there
