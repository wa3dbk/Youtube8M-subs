00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.090
 hello this is a video tutorial to learn how to use correctly 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.970
 our keyboard 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.149
 they make us think 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:13.439
 the key to the left benoit the key 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:19.830
 especially tactics this key have an asterisk on the top 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.199
 left 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.449
 has today the cycle of more in the lower left and has p the tilde in 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.579
 the bottom right 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.310
 to put on activity ccoo we have to go to that pressure combination 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.390
 arch 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.910
 more the key this case is not going to see because it hinders the cell phone in hand 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 guti as screen notes put you the movies like 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.180
 continue with the key to put the sign of March that this in the part 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.640
 lower left we just press the key 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 and we will get on the others 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.440
 to stand up 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.500
 another character that follows matilde nearby that presented the combination 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.830
 panchi act 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.180
 i the key 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.030
 and with modern 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.320
 sepulveda 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.810
 the tilde character 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.610
 another particular key of the other keyboard is slavic letter q of cancÃºn has the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.880
 lower right the steal 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.390
 like a monster a moment ago with the tilde those keys that character more 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.700
 well could you count the Chinese 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.770
 and the letter q 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.880
 and as good introduces savings 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.010
 this particular form explained that our keyboard still works 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.280
 so with any keyboard that you go only to configure it with the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.300
 rival goalkeeper and they will be able to do this 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.790
 is very useful for programmers or for the end of the campaign write 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.729
 and it's easier to learn in haski code than a single hotel 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.550
 has a linux 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.150
 remember to share them
