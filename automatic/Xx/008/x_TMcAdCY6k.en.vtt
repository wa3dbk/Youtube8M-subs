00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.180
 genius who asked me this question 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.390
 soc but whoever you are and I tell anyone 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:25.759
 you would give me a kiss 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:28.399
 in fact maybe I do it as you could 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.420
 see a genius a damn genius 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.100
 of apple 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.990
 he suggested I read some questions 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.210
 pass choices that possibly the most 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.299
 stupid then it came I had the 400 and a 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.850
 these 500 foolish five hundred of the kind 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.640
 stupid illegible and others that instead 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.920
 I chose a total of 500 for my choice 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.079
 dumb stupid someone on soc 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.729
 and someone instead clever and ea 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.399
 start over common smart for three 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.340
 reasons 1 because if not offended 2 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.869
 because they are more cool offends and three 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.030
 because I want to offend train the 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.899
 surreal but we do it after jerseys 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.899
 that intelligent question 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.830
 they ask me what my youtuber is 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.709
 my favorite then youtuber 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.420
 favorite is undoubtedly soc 383 if i am 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.879

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.290
 dio bull but not from now to lick the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.670
 ass but for a very long time 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.739
 think that I have learned to play at 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.390
 minecraft thanks to it therefore I am 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.980
 eternally grateful to this person who 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.110
 introduced me to the world of a game 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.209
 which I literally loved in these 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.530
 last two more than in fact is considered 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.780
 by many people the best 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.239
 minecraft air of italy not so much for 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.450
 bravura or pro pro nor in pvp oh that 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.640
 I try at random without reading anything or not 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.620
 I understood nothing, I take the big one in my hand 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.329
 I don't know what he does besides 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.340
 discovered that all these things this 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.860
 I pick up at the moment not 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.480
 they serve absolutely nothing and are the 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.709
 tenth position which is the last one enters 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.150
 I didn't understand anything the other time 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.180
 kept losing 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:04.819
 I have no idea how it works because me 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.610
 top us we must go down then 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.600
 there are people who have 20 14 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.480
 not only 6 there is the first one who has 43 not 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.950
 I know not even in the standings we start in three 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.700
 seconds do not know what he understood 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.269
 our wake was not ok 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.269
 fall in 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:37.130
 go or god you have to bend to here I am 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.510
 that I fall and someone won I am not 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:46.160
 not even in the ranking that this time at 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:49.519
 I'm doing, I guess no it's possible 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.269
 But overcoming real sure if someone 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.519
 I go if I go to control wooden blocks 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.269
 he didn't overtake anyone but I have to stop 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:02.030
 go against those blocks jumped 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:08.660
 right in the lava sent me back 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:13.100
 back a are among the first no 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.680
 or what scarcity but to have 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.410
 an experience 500 years of experience 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.820
 truly one was also fundamental 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.940
 of the first youtube was to make videos of 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.640
 minecraft on youtube just from 2005 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.930
 100 is certainly often synonymous experience 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.570
 of skill 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.340
 we now turn to a stupid question I 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.980
 they say ax and you know that you are very much 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.430
 similar brand surreal because it is always 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.290
 Luke's fault already already is always the fault of 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.990
 what actually when it never is 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.370
 was to blame from 7 and because bentley nice 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.500
 more members and then got over 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.900
 alone I don't want to intrude on 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.800
 their affairs, however, we all know that I 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.670
 is passed on uk 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.970
 hello hi yes indeed some 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.590
 similarity, however, you yourself have done 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.560
 the question is forgotten perhaps one thing 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.900
 the most important of this similarity 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.210
 that is another question they ask me what 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.990
 you think brent surreal if only i could 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.570
 have surreal takes if only he could 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.450
 have surreal hands take not 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:18.160
 I would pay for package bull as the pokÃ©mon lg 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.160
 indigo ever signed 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.930
 jokes aside I think they were two 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.820
 worst the main crafter of italy come on 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.810
 one is a white fox with something 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.810
 suspicion between the legs 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.620
 while the other is not a belly I have 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.600
 already said enough gentlemen here is a 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.710
 another question I got passionate about 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.530
 pokemon thanks to you 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.200
 thank you so much who made me do it but 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.590
 who caused me to blame my sisters 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.590
 dispute
