00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:01.639
 I would like to 

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.560
 tell a little about the operating room regiment 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.660
 the system of this device 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.219
 based on the operating system 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.309
 android 2 1 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.869

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.680
 this discovery of the world and a little bit like this 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.119

 here on the interface control 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.730

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.110

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.690

 second empty desktop 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.259

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.460
 one of the desktops on each 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.799

 the main thing in it 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:30.749
 and in order to finally

 he is actually the whole operating system 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.319
 pretty smart works well but about 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.739
