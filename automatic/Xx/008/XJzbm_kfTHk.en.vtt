00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.740 
has the t3 does not come with that my
actual<00:03:34.500> reason<00:03:34.860> for<00:03:35.040> getting<00:03:35.190> this<00:03:36.560> um<00:03:37.560> I

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
actual reason for getting this um I

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.170 
actual reason for getting this um I
realized<00:03:39.750> my<00:03:40.110> t3<00:03:40.620> wouldn't<00:03:40.980> take<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.970> know<00:03:42.120> of

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
realized my t3 wouldn't take you know of

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.180 
realized my t3 wouldn't take you know of
course<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.450> doesn't<00:03:42.599> it<00:03:42.780> into<00:03:43.019> 1080p<00:03:43.680> picture

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
course it doesn't it into 1080p picture

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.990 
course it doesn't it into 1080p picture
I<00:03:44.700> mean<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.209> video<00:03:45.420> counter<00:03:46.250> but<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.430> also<00:03:47.640> could

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
I mean a video counter but it also could

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.630 
I mean a video counter but it also could
take<00:03:48.299> stills<00:03:48.780> in<00:03:49.910> sixteen<00:03:50.910> by<00:03:51.120> nine<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.489> was

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
take stills in sixteen by nine so it was

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.819 
take stills in sixteen by nine so it was
doing<00:03:53.849> I<00:03:54.000> think<00:03:54.060> only<00:03:54.480> 3<00:03:54.930> by<00:03:55.310> 2<00:03:57.410> I'm<00:03:58.410> not<00:03:58.650> sure

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
doing I think only 3 by 2 I'm not sure

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.229 
doing I think only 3 by 2 I'm not sure
that's<00:03:59.040> not<00:03:59.220> that's<00:03:59.430> not<00:03:59.519> resolution<00:04:00.150> of

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
that's not that's not resolution of

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.390 
that's not that's not resolution of
course<00:04:00.450> but<00:04:00.720> um<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.440> think<00:04:01.950> that's<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.250> ratio

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
course but um I think that's the ratio

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.470 
course but um I think that's the ratio
and<00:04:03.170> 3<00:04:04.170> by<00:04:04.319> 2<00:04:04.549> it<00:04:05.549> doesn't<00:04:05.819> come<00:04:05.940> out<00:04:06.000> perfectly

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
and 3 by 2 it doesn't come out perfectly

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.220 
and 3 by 2 it doesn't come out perfectly
on<00:04:06.630> all<00:04:06.840> devices<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.840> wanted<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.959> have<00:04:10.109> the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
on all devices so I wanted to have the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.870 
on all devices so I wanted to have the
option<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.220> know<00:04:11.370> go<00:04:11.850> between<00:04:12.079> 3.3<00:04:13.079> by<00:04:13.230> 2<00:04:13.880> 4

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
option to you know go between 3.3 by 2 4

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.789 
option to you know go between 3.3 by 2 4
by<00:04:15.030> 3<00:04:15.299> or<00:04:15.600> 16<00:04:16.019> by<00:04:16.229> 9<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:17.900> just<00:04:18.900> gave<00:04:19.079> me<00:04:19.260> that<00:04:19.289> so

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
you get I really like the feel of this I

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.710 
you get I really like the feel of this I
like<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.190> grips<00:05:13.100> you<00:05:14.100> can<00:05:14.220> see<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.760> has<00:05:15.270> AV

the remote shutter and let's see the
memory<00:05:31.740> card<00:05:32.040> slot<00:05:32.310> goes<00:05:32.580> over<00:05:32.910> here<00:05:33.000> on<00:05:33.060> the

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
memory card slot goes over here on the

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.060 
memory card slot goes over here on the
