Calvin Jones here we are now indoors
we're<00:00:10.440> going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.889> repeat<00:00:11.340> our<00:00:12.300> experiment<00:00:13.080> on

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
we're going to repeat our experiment on

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.620 
we're going to repeat our experiment on
bending<00:00:14.670> Andrey<00:00:15.179> bending<00:00:15.719> forming<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.830> then

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
bending Andrey bending forming and then

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.929 
bending Andrey bending forming and then
deforming<00:00:18.630> aluminum<00:00:19.760> specifically<00:00:20.760> we're

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
deforming aluminum specifically we're

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.439 
deforming aluminum specifically we're
looking<00:00:20.970> at<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.600> derailleur<00:00:22.140> hanger<00:00:23.449> we're

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
looking at the derailleur hanger we're

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.189 
looking at the derailleur hanger we're
going<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.660> use<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.170> da<00:00:25.740> g2<00:00:26.670> derailleur

enjoying today the temperatures that
we're<00:01:00.539> seeing<00:01:01.609> are<00:01:03.140> approximately<00:01:04.140> 69

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
we're seeing are approximately 69

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.170 
we're seeing are approximately 69
degrees<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:05.939> checking<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.740> surface

degrees we are checking with the surface

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.230 
degrees we are checking with the surface
thermometer<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.510> approximately<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:11.090> 70<00:01:12.090> degree

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240

the<00:01:15.840> coldest<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.700> we've<00:01:17.700> seen<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.150> hanger

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the coldest and we've seen this hanger

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320 
the coldest and we've seen this hanger
and<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.110> warmest<00:01:19.790> these<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and then the warmest these are all the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.810 
and then the warmest these are all the
same<00:01:21.570> brand<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.110> hangers<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.799> let's<00:01:23.009> let's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
same brand of hangers so let's let's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.080 
same brand of hangers so let's let's
repeat<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.320> protocol<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.369> bending<00:01:26.729> Andrey

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
repeat the protocol of bending Andrey

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.030 
repeat the protocol of bending Andrey
bending<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.659> below<00:01:28.020> we'll<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.680> happens

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
bending and below we'll see what happens

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.060 
bending and below we'll see what happens
we're<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.909> use<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.600> our<00:01:30.990> benchmark<00:01:31.680> for

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
we're going to use as our benchmark for

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.929 
we're going to use as our benchmark for
how<00:01:32.130> much<00:01:32.820> deformity<00:01:34.070> about<00:01:35.070> two<00:01:35.340> inches<00:01:35.700> here

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
how much deformity about two inches here

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.200 
how much deformity about two inches here
simply<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> width<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.549> this<00:01:38.549> tape

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
simply the width of this this tape

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.539 
simply the width of this this tape
measure<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.900> we're<00:01:40.860> gonna<00:01:40.950> use<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
measure here we're gonna use it as a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.139 
measure here we're gonna use it as a
go/no-go<00:01:42.299> gauge<00:01:42.840> pull<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.950> out<00:01:44.159> bend<00:01:44.970> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
go/no-go gauge pull this out bend it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.929 
go/no-go gauge pull this out bend it
back<00:01:45.329> pull<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.780> out<00:01:46.079> bend<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.560> back<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.130> now

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
back pull it out bend it back so now

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.030 
back pull it out bend it back so now
let's<00:01:48.119> proceed<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> first<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.860> first

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
let's proceed with the first the first

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.730 
let's proceed with the first the first
bending<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.939> try<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.740> some

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
bending here and try and get some

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.660 
bending here and try and get some
deformity<00:01:53.549> here

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.929 

not<00:01:58.670> quite<00:02:02.259> that's<00:02:03.259> one<00:02:03.859> so<00:02:04.310> we<00:02:04.460> have<00:02:04.579> crashed

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
not quite that's one so we have crashed

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.130 
not quite that's one so we have crashed
once<00:02:05.539> let's<00:02:06.439> bring<00:02:06.829> it<00:02:07.009> back<00:02:07.039> to<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:08.509> good

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
once let's bring it back to a good

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.440 
once let's bring it back to a good
position<00:02:09.769> we're<00:02:10.369> not<00:02:10.550> going<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.910> change<00:02:11.180> our

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
position we're not going to change our

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.780 
position we're not going to change our
gauge<00:02:11.840> we're<00:02:12.830> going<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.040> maintain<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.760> same

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
gauge we're going to maintain the same

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:24.059 
gauge we're going to maintain the same
position<00:02:19.150> get<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.269> back<00:02:20.480> close<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:22.610> start<00:02:22.970> over

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
position get it back close to start over

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.620 
position get it back close to start over
very<00:02:25.069> good<00:02:26.379> once<00:02:27.379> twice<00:02:28.340> here<00:02:29.090> comes<00:02:29.390> the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
very good once twice here comes the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:42.369 
very good once twice here comes the
third<00:02:31.180> Bend<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:38.630> little<00:02:39.079> more<00:02:40.900> third<00:02:41.900> Bend

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
third Bend and a little more third Bend

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.100 
third Bend and a little more third Bend
that's<00:02:42.620> quite<00:02:43.040> quite<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.790> severe<00:02:44.180> crash<00:02:45.040> three

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that's quite quite a severe crash three

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:58.940 
that's quite quite a severe crash three
back<00:02:48.110> makes<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:49.160> four

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.790 

let's<00:02:59.640> proceed<00:02:59.970> with<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.599> fifth<00:03:01.020> one<00:03:01.349> this<00:03:01.590> is

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
let's proceed with the fifth one this is

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.420 
let's proceed with the fifth one this is
the<00:03:01.980> fifth<00:03:02.280> Bend<00:03:03.170> five<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.950> little<00:03:08.310> bit

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
the fifth Bend five and a little bit

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:22.100 
the fifth Bend five and a little bit
more<00:03:12.440> there<00:03:13.440> we<00:03:13.590> go<00:03:14.630> repair<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:17.690> six<00:03:21.110> that

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
more there we go repair this is six that

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:30.070 
more there we go repair this is six that
looks<00:03:22.350> pretty<00:03:22.560> good<00:03:22.739> now<00:03:24.319> we<00:03:25.319> come<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:28.310> seven

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
looks pretty good now we come to seven

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.979 
looks pretty good now we come to seven
seven<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.670> failure<00:03:33.239> on<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.930> seventh<00:03:34.500> we<00:03:34.980> did
