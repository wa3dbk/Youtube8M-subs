00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.369
 new video tutorial with the song of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.510
 I'm not dead of the group do and we're going 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.000
 to start with what is center of the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.000
 song do not tell anymore and it's this 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.190
 part what to say the whole song let's go 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:50.180
 to occupy what is do sharp minor and 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:51.289
 greater the greater and my greater in this order 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.539
 of all we are going to make the changes 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.559
 rapids with rhythmic ballad ok the rhythm 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.559
 it's nonsense yes 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.560
 ok then this would be what is the 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.280
 song filter now let's do 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.360
 the verses 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.360
 these are the verses 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.020
 I'm not dead, I 'm just 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.100
 sleeping 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 I'm not dead, I 'm just 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.520
 sleeping 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.829
 If I look at the sky 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:56.900
 are you I'm tired maybe a little 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.210
 tired I'm not dead but I'm 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.920
 tired 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.180
 to do what are the verses of the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.150
 song let's occupy what is do 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.740
 sustained lesser or equal again we're going to 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.330
 good the same the same actors that 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.250
 we are in the intro but we are going to 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.100
 put what is my greatest good if I already 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.940
 I was going to occupy again what is 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.830
 the best and biggest ok we're just going to 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.480
 occupy those four chords but in 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.370
 different order these are we going to do the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.560
 order for you to check those are 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.980
 the verses I'm not dead just 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.980
 I'm sleeping 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.080
 I'm not dead, I 'm just 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.080
 sleeping 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.380
 in mine or blind 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.540
 if you notice that I already have a dream 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.170
 and if maybe I'm tired 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.000
 maybe a little fatigued 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.700
 I'm not dead, I 'm just 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.849
 tired 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.580
 ok until this part we're doing fine now 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.870
 would follow the other part which is what 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.220
 I could say it's a good chorus no 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.890
 there is precocity not simply it will turn to 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.840
 repeat another another another another form and 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.209
 we will occupy the same this chord 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.739
 then let's see that part 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:23.870
 that we did the first tapes in the 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:29.150
 second through this 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.150
 I just stopped seeing 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.850
 I'm not going to walk anymore 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.510
 my eyes are no longer going to see 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:44.990
 and I no longer have to grow 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.950
 I'm not dead 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.950
 all right 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:58.349
 I'm not dead, I 'm just 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:01.650
 sleeping I'm just called to 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.570
 live life 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:10.800
 yes 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:10.800
 I'm eating 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.940
 I am 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.459
 there followed what is a small 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.500
 intermediate and enable medium more be 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.260
 equal online we do the same thing 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.680
 Enter and start again with the no 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.680
 I am 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.780
 simply 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:43.120
 I have stopped breathing 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.530
 it is not the same anymore and it will be 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.650
 repeat the whole part of the song 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.120
 where he says me but he is not going to 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.620
 to repeat again twice I'm not 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.960
 dead I'm just watching and up 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.240
 the last one this is the end it would be no 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.240
 I'm dead simply 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.560
 I'm a little tired 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.810
 with those chords I hope they have 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.550
 understood this song the truth is not 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.470
 so hard let's make a little 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.229
 summary so you check nothing else 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.599
 how would it be what is the good intro to 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.599
 to see how this would be if I am 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.790
 I'm just watching 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.480
 if you look at your children 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:41.510
 if you notice that I have a dream 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.620
 fifth is that I'm tired 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:50.580
 and maybe a little tired I'm not 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:53.419
 dead I'm just letters 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.419
 simply 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.419
 day 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.390
 I'm not going to walk 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:12.419
 but it's not going to grow 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.419
 I'm not me 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.470

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.940
