00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.200 

so<00:00:01.260> casting<00:00:01.800> on<00:00:01.949> that's<00:00:02.310> pretty<00:00:02.669> important

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so casting on that's pretty important

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.450 
so casting on that's pretty important
because<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.899> can't<00:00:04.080> really<00:00:04.259> knit<00:00:05.069> if<00:00:05.279> you

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
because you can't really knit if you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.089 
because you can't really knit if you
haven't<00:00:05.759> cast<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:06.150> yet<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.770> casting<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:07.919> in

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
haven't cast on yet and casting on in

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.799 
haven't cast on yet and casting on in
lace<00:00:08.340> can<00:00:08.730> be<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.150> little<00:00:09.389> bit<00:00:09.630> daunting

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
lace can be a little bit daunting

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.140 
lace can be a little bit daunting
sometimes<00:00:10.429> but<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.580> really<00:00:11.700> doesn't<00:00:11.910> have<00:00:12.030> to

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
sometimes but it really doesn't have to

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.270 
sometimes but it really doesn't have to
be<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.630> really<00:00:13.259> all<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.469> need<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.710> know<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
be so really all you need to know is the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.890 
be so really all you need to know is the
appropriate<00:00:14.580> way<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.910> cast<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.420> for<00:00:15.719> what

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
appropriate way to cast on for what

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.960 
appropriate way to cast on for what
you're<00:00:16.020> actually<00:00:16.199> going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.529> make<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.980> much

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
you're actually going to make and much

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.269 
you're actually going to make and much
of<00:00:18.000> lace<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.720> made<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.350> flat<00:00:19.710> pieces<00:00:19.949> like

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
of lace is made as flat pieces like

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.759 
of lace is made as flat pieces like
scarves<00:00:20.880> or<00:00:21.150> stools<00:00:21.510> or<00:00:21.960> shawls<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.680> are

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
scarves or stools or shawls that are

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.620 
scarves or stools or shawls that are
square<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.369> they<00:00:23.910> start<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> straight

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
square and they start with a straight

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.779 
square and they start with a straight
edge<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.230> that's<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.800> good<00:00:26.039> place<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.310> start<00:00:26.640> if

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
edge and that's a good place to start if

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.939 
edge and that's a good place to start if
you've<00:00:26.910> never<00:00:27.090> knit<00:00:27.330> lace<00:00:27.539> before<00:00:28.050> because

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
you've never knit lace before because

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.740 
you've never knit lace before because
you<00:00:29.369> kind<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> feeling<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.420> moving

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
you kind of get the feeling of moving

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.999 
you kind of get the feeling of moving
back<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.019> forth<00:00:31.199> without<00:00:31.500> having<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> worry

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
back and forth without having to worry

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.709 
back and forth without having to worry
about<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.399> shape<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> thing<00:00:33.059> changing<00:00:33.600> or

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
about the shape of the thing changing or

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.560 
about the shape of the thing changing or
anything<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:35.670> know<00:00:35.790> there's<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.090> bunch<00:00:36.360> of

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
anything so you know there's a bunch of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.630 
anything so you know there's a bunch of
different<00:00:37.079> difficult<00:00:37.770> cast<00:00:38.040> ons<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.430> you

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
different difficult cast ons that you

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.720 
different difficult cast ons that you
can<00:00:38.820> try<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.980> sweaters<00:00:41.399> there's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
can try you know for sweaters there's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.030 
can try you know for sweaters there's
longtail<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.809> German<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.800> these

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
longtail and German and all these

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.400 
longtail and German and all these
different<00:00:44.460> kinds<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> things<00:00:44.930> but<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:45.989> lace

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
different kinds of things but for lace

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.250 
different kinds of things but for lace
honestly<00:00:47.370> what<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.090> would<00:00:48.360> recommend<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.989> best

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
honestly what I would recommend the best

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.020 
honestly what I would recommend the best
one<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.559> use<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:50.760> tell<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
one to use is the one they tell you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.580 
one to use is the one they tell you
never<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.270> use<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.600> anything<00:00:51.960> which<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
never to use for anything which is the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.250 
never to use for anything which is the
backwards<00:00:53.250> loop<00:00:53.370> cast<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.449> reason<00:00:54.960> is

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
backwards loop cast on the reason is

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.799 
backwards loop cast on the reason is
because<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.610> stretchy<00:00:57.059> because<00:00:57.690> it

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
because it is so stretchy because it

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.709 
because it is so stretchy because it
uses<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.350> much<00:00:58.590> extra<00:00:59.190> yarn<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.000> move<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
uses so much extra yarn you can move the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.569 
uses so much extra yarn you can move the
yarn<00:01:00.840> around<00:01:01.020> from<00:01:01.440> stitch<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.949> stitch<00:01:02.010> which

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
yarn around from stitch to stitch which

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.860 
yarn around from stitch to stitch which
is<00:01:02.609> great<00:01:02.969> when<00:01:03.149> you're<00:01:03.239> doing<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.510> first

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
is great when you're doing your first

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.710 
is great when you're doing your first
row<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.580> pick<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
row and when you have to pick up to do a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.929 
row and when you have to pick up to do a
border<00:01:07.290> or<00:01:07.560> anything<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.610> sew<00:01:08.790> it

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
border or anything like that or sew it

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.390 
border or anything like that or sew it
in<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.240> won't<00:01:09.450> even<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.950> also

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
in you won't even see it I also

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.740 
in you won't even see it I also
recommend<00:01:11.939> very<00:01:12.840> strongly<00:01:13.580> casting<00:01:14.580> on

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
recommend very strongly casting on

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.420 
recommend very strongly casting on
double<00:01:15.750> stranded<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.740> reason<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.310> this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
double stranded and the reason for this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.370 
double stranded and the reason for this
is<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.060> only<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.960> give<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
is that it's not only going to give you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.920 
is that it's not only going to give you
a<00:01:19.619> more<00:01:20.130> solid<00:01:20.700> edge<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.689> especially

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
a more solid edge and this is especially

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.899 
a more solid edge and this is especially
in<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.259> case<00:01:22.439> where<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.860> cast<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
in the case where the cast on is the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.460 
in the case where the cast on is the
edge<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.210> there<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.450> no<00:01:24.600> border<00:01:24.960> after<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
edge and there is no border after that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.649 
edge and there is no border after that
it'll<00:01:26.159> give<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> lot<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.090> drape<00:01:27.450> because

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
it'll give you a lot of drape because

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.090 
it'll give you a lot of drape because
it's<00:01:27.810> gonna<00:01:27.930> add<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.530> bit<00:01:28.979> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it's gonna add just a little bit of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.880 
it's gonna add just a little bit of
weight<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> edge<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.509> shawl<00:01:30.890> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
weight to the edge of your shawl and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.120 
weight to the edge of your shawl and
likewise<00:01:32.840> casting<00:01:33.840> off<00:01:34.020> double<00:01:34.560> stranded<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
likewise casting off double stranded is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.620 
likewise casting off double stranded is
a<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.490> good<00:01:35.640> idea<00:01:35.670> too<00:01:36.150> because<00:01:36.509> it's

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
a really good idea too because it's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.940 
a really good idea too because it's
gonna<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> same<00:01:37.259> thing<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.799> are

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
gonna do the same thing so if you are

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.370 
gonna do the same thing so if you are
doing<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.369> border<00:01:38.790> around<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.810> shawl<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
you've got that nice pretty filleted

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.490 
you've got that nice pretty filleted
edge<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.189> amazing<00:01:45.350> it's<00:01:46.350> gonna

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
edge that is just so amazing it's gonna

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.719 
edge that is just so amazing it's gonna
kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.799> stretch<00:01:46.979> out<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.159> shape<00:01:47.369> if<00:01:47.579> it's

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
kind of stretch out a shape if it's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.210 
kind of stretch out a shape if it's
really<00:01:47.970> lightweight<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.540> adding<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.990> extra

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
really lightweight so adding that extra

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.310 
really lightweight so adding that extra
layer<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.549> yarn<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
layer of yarn it's not going to be that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.050 
layer of yarn it's not going to be that
noticeable<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.280> gonna<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
noticeable but it's so gonna be like the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.139 
noticeable but it's so gonna be like the
crocheted<00:01:54.540> edge<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.920> jannat<00:01:56.549> shawl<00:01:56.790> here

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
crocheted edge on the jannat shawl here

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.850 
crocheted edge on the jannat shawl here
where<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.689> maintains<00:01:58.170> its<00:01:58.320> shape<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.649> little

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
where it maintains its shape a little

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.020 
where it maintains its shape a little
better<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.430> pronounced<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
better and it's more pronounced and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.080 
better and it's more pronounced and
obvious<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.600> also<00:02:01.280> brings<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.460> fabric<00:02:02.969> of

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
obvious and it also brings the fabric of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.880 
obvious and it also brings the fabric of
the<00:02:03.210> shawl<00:02:03.420> down<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> little<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.350> better<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.799> it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the shawl down a little bit better so it

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.310 
the shawl down a little bit better so it
drapes<00:02:05.130> better<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:06.390> we're<00:02:06.840> gonna<00:02:06.960> start<00:02:07.229> with

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
drapes better so we're gonna start with

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.109 
drapes better so we're gonna start with
the<00:02:07.530> backwards<00:02:07.920> loop<00:02:07.979> cast<00:02:08.069> on<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.000> don't

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the backwards loop cast on if you don't

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.020 
the backwards loop cast on if you don't
already<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:09.599> how<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.899> do<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.440> very

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
already know how to do it it's very

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.230 
already know how to do it it's very
and<00:02:11.960> I'm<00:02:12.260> just<00:02:12.500> using<00:02:12.740> some<00:02:13.060> worsted<00:02:14.060> weight

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
and I'm just using some worsted weight

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.120 
and I'm just using some worsted weight
yarn<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.840> big<00:02:15.020> fat<00:02:15.260> needle<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.040> you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
yarn and a big fat needle just so you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.590 
yarn and a big fat needle just so you
can<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.460> my<00:02:16.610> fingers<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:16.970> little<00:02:17.300> bit<00:02:17.450> better

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
can see my fingers a little bit better

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.700 
can see my fingers a little bit better
but<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.380> always<00:02:18.620> start<00:02:18.830> with<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> slipknot<00:02:19.360> so

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
but you always start with a slipknot so

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.530 
but you always start with a slipknot so
there's<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.310> super<00:02:25.970> super

easy what you do you wrap it around your
thumb<00:02:29.890> grab<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.130> little<00:02:31.840> pinch<00:02:32.840> pinch<00:02:33.260> where

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
thumb grab the little pinch pinch where

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.930 
thumb grab the little pinch pinch where
it<00:02:33.560> kind<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:33.950> crosses<00:02:34.130> there<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.820> then<00:02:34.910> just

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
it kind of crosses there and then just

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.090 
it kind of crosses there and then just
pull<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.450> over<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.960> that's<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.650> that's<00:02:36.830> all

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
pull it over and that's it that's all

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.650 
pull it over and that's it that's all
there<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.790> backwards<00:02:38.150> loop<00:02:38.210> cast<00:02:38.330> on

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
there is to the backwards loop cast on

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.630 
there is to the backwards loop cast on
just<00:02:38.900> make<00:02:39.050> sure<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.290> don't<00:02:39.410> do<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.800> too<00:02:40.310> fast

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640

the looseness of it do it on a couple

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.620 
the looseness of it do it on a couple
needle<00:02:56.750> sizes<00:02:56.990> higher<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.330> kind

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
needle sizes higher that and that kind

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.090 
needle sizes higher that and that kind
of<00:02:59.690> goes<00:02:59.840> for<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.170> lot<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.500> different<00:03:00.830> kinds<00:03:01.070> of

of goes for a lot of different kinds of
projects<00:03:01.430> not<00:03:01.550> just<00:03:01.910> lace<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:02.720> in<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.900> case

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
projects not just lace but in the case

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.270 
projects not just lace but in the case
of<00:03:03.080> lay<00:03:03.380> since<00:03:03.650> you're<00:03:03.740> gonna<00:03:03.800> be<00:03:03.920> stretching

of lay since you're gonna be stretching

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.010 
of lay since you're gonna be stretching
it<00:03:04.459> all<00:03:04.580> out<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:04.790> whack<00:03:04.940> anyway<00:03:05.330> no<00:03:05.690> one<00:03:05.870> will

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
it all out of whack anyway no one will

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.320 
it all out of whack anyway no one will
ever<00:03:06.260> know<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.620> difference

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
ever know the difference

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.150 
ever know the difference
so<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.540> next<00:03:08.810> one<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.500> any<00:03:09.890> time<00:03:10.070> you're

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
so the next one and any time you're

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.650 
so the next one and any time you're
doing<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.430> circular<00:03:10.850> shawl<00:03:11.090> from<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.360> center

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
doing a circular shawl from the center

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.910 
doing a circular shawl from the center
out<00:03:11.810> you'll<00:03:12.020> probably<00:03:12.230> see<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:12.709> as<00:03:12.890> a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
out you'll probably see this as a

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.440 
out you'll probably see this as a
circular<00:03:13.250> cast<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:13.970> looks<00:03:14.120> like<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.240> little

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
circular cast on it looks like a little

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.630 
circular cast on it looks like a little
belly<00:03:14.720> button<00:03:15.080> in<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.890> middle<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.310> your<00:03:16.430> work

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
belly button in the middle of your work

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.580 
belly button in the middle of your work
here<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.870> actually<00:03:18.110> kind<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.350> looks<00:03:18.500> like

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
here so it actually kind of looks like

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.320 
here so it actually kind of looks like
one<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:18.800> those<00:03:18.920> old<00:03:19.190> macrame<00:03:19.670> buttons<00:03:20.090> from

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
one of those old macrame buttons from

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.100 
one of those old macrame buttons from
the<00:03:20.450> 70s

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
the 70s

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.979 
the 70s
projected<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.590> kind<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:21.950> crew<00:03:22.630> they<00:03:23.630> can<00:03:23.840> be

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
projected this kind of crew they can be

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.620 
projected this kind of crew they can be
a<00:03:24.019> little<00:03:24.350> bit<00:03:24.739> tricky<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.610> I<00:03:25.820> would<00:03:26.090> highly

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
a little bit tricky and I would highly

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.600 
a little bit tricky and I would highly
recommend<00:03:27.519> practice<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:28.730> one<00:03:29.030> because<00:03:29.930> it's

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
recommend practice this one because it's

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.009 
recommend practice this one because it's
it<00:03:31.610> takes<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:32.000> little<00:03:32.150> bit<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.390> getting<00:03:32.750> used<00:03:32.900> to

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
it takes a little bit of getting used to

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.050 
it takes a little bit of getting used to
especially<00:03:33.230> if<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.130> are<00:03:34.220> not<00:03:34.400> used<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.700> one<00:03:34.940> of

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
especially if you are not used to one of

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.640 
especially if you are not used to one of
these<00:03:35.239> you're<00:03:35.630> going<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.959> need<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.230> crochet

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
these you're going to need a crochet

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.560 
these you're going to need a crochet
hook<00:03:36.680> that's<00:03:37.610> just<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:37.910> little<00:03:38.180> bit<00:03:38.330> larger

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
hook that's just a little bit larger

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.390 
hook that's just a little bit larger
than<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.410> size<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.769> would<00:03:39.830> normally<00:03:40.250> need

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
than the size you would normally need

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.050 
than the size you would normally need
for<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.820> yarn<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.900> this<00:03:42.110> case<00:03:42.350> it's<00:03:42.860> just<00:03:43.310> the

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
for the yarn in this case it's just the

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.930 
for the yarn in this case it's just the
next<00:03:44.269> size<00:03:44.510> up<00:03:45.160> now<00:03:46.160> there's<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.610> couple<00:03:46.820> of

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
next size up now there's a couple of

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.759 
next size up now there's a couple of
different<00:03:47.209> ways<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:47.570> do<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> circular<00:03:48.049> cast<00:03:48.500> on

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
different ways to do a circular cast on

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.210 
different ways to do a circular cast on
the<00:03:49.280> one<00:03:49.489> that<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.820> like<00:03:50.120> best<00:03:50.950> uses<00:03:51.950> the

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
the one that I like best uses the

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.620 
the one that I like best uses the
crochet<00:03:52.549> hook<00:03:52.580> there's<00:03:52.970> another<00:03:53.180> kind<00:03:53.480> that's

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
crochet hook there's another kind that's

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.810 
crochet hook there's another kind that's
more<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:53.840> an<00:03:53.930> invisible<00:03:54.200> kind<00:03:54.890> that<00:03:55.549> is<00:03:55.640> more

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
more of an invisible kind that is more

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.640 
more of an invisible kind that is more
like<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.000> longtail<00:03:56.510> cast<00:03:56.840> on<00:03:57.049> but<00:03:57.290> you<00:03:57.440> do<00:03:57.620> it

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
like a longtail cast on but you do it

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.850 
like a longtail cast on but you do it
with<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.519> loop<00:03:58.730> that<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.120> make<00:03:59.560> the<00:04:00.560> only

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
with the loop that you make the only

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.740 
with the loop that you make the only
thing<00:04:01.100> that<00:04:01.310> I<00:04:01.340> don't<00:04:01.820> like<00:04:01.940> about<00:04:02.330> that<00:04:02.540> one

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
thing that I don't like about that one

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.140 
thing that I don't like about that one
is<00:04:02.959> that<00:04:03.200> if<00:04:03.380> you<00:04:03.500> drop<00:04:03.739> your<00:04:03.799> needle<00:04:04.340> in<00:04:04.549> the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
is that if you drop your needle in the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.820 
is that if you drop your needle in the
middle<00:04:05.180> of<00:04:05.540> doing<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:05.959> cast<00:04:06.170> on<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.590> lose

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
middle of doing that cast on you lose

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.500 
middle of doing that cast on you lose
your<00:04:07.040> stitches<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.610> that<00:04:07.970> just<00:04:08.150> makes<00:04:08.330> me

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
your stitches and that just makes me

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.100 
your stitches and that just makes me
angry

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
angry

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.020 
angry
so<00:04:09.320> I<00:04:09.530> do<00:04:09.860> it<00:04:10.040> this<00:04:10.190> way<00:04:10.400> it's<00:04:10.640> a<00:04:10.730> little<00:04:10.760> bit

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
so I do it this way it's a little bit

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.539 
so I do it this way it's a little bit
bulkier<00:04:11.600> you're<00:04:11.989> gonna<00:04:12.140> notice<00:04:12.440> it<00:04:12.769> but<00:04:13.370> if

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
bulkier you're gonna notice it but if

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:14.979 
bulkier you're gonna notice it but if
you<00:04:13.640> drop<00:04:13.820> your<00:04:13.880> crochet<00:04:14.209> hook<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.660> stitches

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
you drop your crochet hook the stitches

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.390 
you drop your crochet hook the stitches
will<00:04:15.140> stay<00:04:15.350> there<00:04:15.500> because<00:04:15.680> essentially<00:04:16.190> it

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
will stay there because essentially it

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.349 
will stay there because essentially it
is<00:04:16.519> crochet<00:04:17.169> so<00:04:18.430> when<00:04:19.430> doing<00:04:19.609> this<00:04:19.940> kind<00:04:20.239> of

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
is crochet so when doing this kind of

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.260 
is crochet so when doing this kind of
cast<00:04:20.599> on<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:22.280> want<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.520> start<00:04:22.729> with<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.030> yarn

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
cast on you want to start with the yarn

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.780 
cast on you want to start with the yarn
tail<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:24.080> end<00:04:24.260> of

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
tail the end of

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.000 
tail the end of
hanging<00:04:25.790> to<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:25.970> left<00:04:26.470> bring<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.590> loop<00:04:27.800> around

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
hanging to the left bring a loop around

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.570 
hanging to the left bring a loop around
your<00:04:28.310> hand<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:29.060> in<00:04:29.210> front<00:04:29.660> of<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:31.010> other<00:04:31.190> yarn

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
your hand and in front of the other yarn

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.120 
your hand and in front of the other yarn
there<00:04:32.139> so<00:04:33.139> now<00:04:33.260> this<00:04:33.410> going<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.650> be<00:04:33.740> crocheting

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
there so now this going to be crocheting

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.820 
there so now this going to be crocheting
backwards<00:04:34.669> if<00:04:34.850> you're<00:04:35.000> Houston<00:04:35.389> a<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:36.740> is

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
backwards if you're Houston a this is

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.689 
backwards if you're Houston a this is
going<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:37.010> go<00:04:37.130> in<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.310> opposite<00:04:37.610> direction

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
going to go in the opposite direction

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.969 
going to go in the opposite direction
the<00:04:38.030> direction<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.419> knitting<00:04:38.750> so<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.680> just

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
the direction of knitting so you just

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.640 
the direction of knitting so you just
want<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.250> reach<00:04:40.850> underneath<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:42.080> first<00:04:42.380> loop

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
want to reach underneath the first loop

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.530 
want to reach underneath the first loop
grab<00:04:43.460> your<00:04:43.880> working<00:04:44.150> yarn<00:04:44.740> pull<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.889> under<00:04:46.220> and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
grab your working yarn pull it under and

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.000 
grab your working yarn pull it under and
then<00:04:47.540> grab<00:04:47.780> your<00:04:47.990> working<00:04:48.199> yarn<00:04:48.500> again<00:04:48.770> and

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
then grab your working yarn again and

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.040 
then grab your working yarn again and
pull<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.790> through<00:04:49.820> that<00:04:50.030> first<00:04:50.389> loop<00:04:50.690> now<00:04:50.990> you

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
pull it through that first loop now you

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.030 
pull it through that first loop now you
have<00:04:51.290> one<00:04:51.590> stitch<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:54.050> next<00:04:54.080> one<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.800> do<00:04:54.919> the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
have one stitch the next one you do the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.219 
have one stitch the next one you do the
same<00:04:55.220> thing<00:04:55.430> but<00:04:55.550> you<00:04:55.669> go<00:04:55.820> under<00:04:56.090> both<00:04:56.419> strands

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
same thing but you go under both strands

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.140 
same thing but you go under both strands
of<00:04:57.440> this<00:04:57.770> loop<00:04:58.010> you<00:04:58.160> go<00:04:58.280> into<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.550> loop<00:04:58.729> itself

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
of this loop you go into the loop itself

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.010 
of this loop you go into the loop itself
and<00:04:59.449> the<00:04:59.570> tail<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:00.949> go<00:05:01.070> under<00:05:01.630> grab<00:05:02.630> pull

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
and the tail so you go under grab pull

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.790 
and the tail so you go under grab pull
up<00:05:03.199> a<00:05:03.320> loop<00:05:03.580> go<00:05:04.580> back<00:05:04.820> through<00:05:05.210> there<00:05:05.539> and<00:05:05.800> pull

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
up a loop go back through there and pull

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.189 
up a loop go back through there and pull
another<00:05:07.370> loop<00:05:07.490> through<00:05:08.060> now<00:05:08.210> unlike<00:05:08.630> crochet

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
another loop through now unlike crochet

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.560 
another loop through now unlike crochet
you<00:05:10.010> leave<00:05:10.220> all<00:05:10.460> of<00:05:10.520> these<00:05:10.940> stitches<00:05:11.330> on<00:05:11.479> the

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
you leave all of these stitches on the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.909 
you leave all of these stitches on the
needle<00:05:11.840> so<00:05:11.930> it's<00:05:12.080> more<00:05:12.199> like<00:05:12.410> Tunisian

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
needle so it's more like Tunisian

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.100 
needle so it's more like Tunisian
crochet<00:05:13.070> I<00:05:13.340> guess<00:05:13.580> you<00:05:13.699> could<00:05:13.850> say<00:05:14.030> but<00:05:15.020> you

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
crochet I guess you could say but you

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.450 
crochet I guess you could say but you
just<00:05:15.260> keep<00:05:15.470> doing<00:05:15.770> that<00:05:15.889> until<00:05:15.949> you<00:05:16.220> have<00:05:16.370> the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
just keep doing that until you have the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.939 
just keep doing that until you have the
desired<00:05:16.490> number<00:05:17.030> of<00:05:17.210> stitches<00:05:17.800> usually<00:05:18.800> it's

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
desired number of stitches usually it's

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.680 
desired number of stitches usually it's
an<00:05:19.039> even<00:05:19.310> number<00:05:19.340> but<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.000> depends<00:05:20.570> on<00:05:20.630> what

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
an even number but it depends on what

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.040 
an even number but it depends on what
kind<00:05:21.139> of<00:05:21.229> thing<00:05:21.410> you're<00:05:21.560> doing<00:05:22.750> so<00:05:23.750> you<00:05:23.870> just

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
kind of thing you're doing so you just

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.000 
kind of thing you're doing so you just
keep<00:05:24.260> on<00:05:24.470> going<00:05:24.530> keep<00:05:25.460> on<00:05:25.699> trucking<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:27.010> then

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
keep on going keep on trucking and then

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.420 
keep on going keep on trucking and then
when<00:05:28.220> you're<00:05:28.340> done<00:05:28.490> with<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:29.320> you<00:05:30.320> can

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
when you're done with that you can

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.490 
when you're done with that you can
distribute<00:05:31.430> it<00:05:31.520> evenly<00:05:31.760> on<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.810> few<00:05:33.080> needles<00:05:33.380> I

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
distribute it evenly on a few needles I

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.930 
distribute it evenly on a few needles I
would<00:05:33.530> recommend<00:05:34.039> pushing<00:05:34.400> it<00:05:34.490> off<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.760> back

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
would recommend pushing it off the back

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.070 
would recommend pushing it off the back
of<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.240> crochet<00:05:35.599> hook<00:05:35.630> because<00:05:35.900> you're<00:05:35.990> not

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
of the crochet hook because you're not

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.510 
of the crochet hook because you're not
gonna<00:05:36.229> have<00:05:36.349> to<00:05:36.410> worry<00:05:36.590> about<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.919> hook<00:05:37.340> end

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
gonna have to worry about the hook end

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.370 
gonna have to worry about the hook end
getting<00:05:37.849> stuck<00:05:38.120> in<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:38.360> so<00:05:38.960> in<00:05:39.050> this<00:05:39.110> case<00:05:39.289> I

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
getting stuck in it so in this case I

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.920 
getting stuck in it so in this case I
just<00:05:39.410> have<00:05:39.590> four<00:05:39.919> stitches<00:05:40.450> and<00:05:41.450> I'm<00:05:41.780> just

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
just have four stitches and I'm just

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:49.210 
just have four stitches and I'm just
gonna<00:05:42.020> put<00:05:42.320> them<00:05:42.470> evenly<00:05:43.039> on<00:05:43.340> two<00:05:48.160> just<00:05:49.160> gonna

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
gonna put them evenly on two just gonna

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.640 
gonna put them evenly on two just gonna
put<00:05:49.460> them<00:05:49.550> evenly<00:05:50.120> onto<00:05:51.490> two<00:05:52.490> needles<00:05:53.210> and

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
put them evenly onto two needles and

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.290 
put them evenly onto two needles and
then<00:05:54.650> all<00:05:54.860> you<00:05:55.039> do<00:05:55.250> because<00:05:55.970> that<00:05:56.000> looks

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
then all you do because that looks

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.700 
then all you do because that looks
really<00:05:56.599> funny<00:05:56.810> doesn't<00:05:57.080> it<00:05:57.229> you're<00:05:57.470> like<00:05:57.560> how

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
really funny doesn't it you're like how

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.800 
really funny doesn't it you're like how
does<00:05:57.860> that<00:05:58.099> look<00:05:58.280> like<00:05:58.370> a<00:05:58.430> lace<00:05:58.669> cast<00:05:59.000> on<00:05:59.240> you

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
does that look like a lace cast on you

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.760 
does that look like a lace cast on you
find<00:06:00.110> your<00:06:00.260> tail<00:06:00.470> and<00:06:00.889> you<00:06:01.669> pull<00:06:02.620> and<00:06:03.620> that's

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
find your tail and you pull and that's

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.980 
find your tail and you pull and that's
it<00:06:04.030> cinches<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:05.210> up<00:06:05.330> and<00:06:05.570> then<00:06:05.690> you've<00:06:05.840> got

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
it cinches it up and then you've got

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.250 
it cinches it up and then you've got
four<00:06:06.289> stitches<00:06:06.800> on<00:06:07.160> the<00:06:07.400> needles

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
four stitches on the needles

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.080 
four stitches on the needles
now<00:06:09.260> usually<00:06:09.620> you'd<00:06:10.010> probably<00:06:10.220> cast<00:06:10.699> on<00:06:10.910> more

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
now usually you'd probably cast on more

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.480 
now usually you'd probably cast on more
than<00:06:11.270> that<00:06:11.479> because<00:06:12.199> if<00:06:12.710> you're<00:06:12.889> just<00:06:12.919> casting

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
than that because if you're just casting

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.580 
than that because if you're just casting
on<00:06:13.610> four<00:06:13.880> stitches<00:06:14.180> you<00:06:14.599> can<00:06:14.780> easily<00:06:14.930> cast<00:06:15.349> on

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
on four stitches you can easily cast on

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.620 
on four stitches you can easily cast on
flat<00:06:16.190> and<00:06:16.490> just<00:06:16.820> sort<00:06:17.000> of<00:06:17.060> work<00:06:17.210> it<00:06:17.360> like<00:06:17.449> an

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
flat and just sort of work it like an

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.839 
flat and just sort of work it like an
i-cord<00:06:17.990> and<00:06:18.289> use<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:18.979> tail<00:06:19.160> to<00:06:19.400> cinch<00:06:19.639> up<00:06:19.789> the

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
i-cord and use the tail to cinch up the

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.870 
i-cord and use the tail to cinch up the
end<00:06:20.150> so<00:06:20.389> you'd<00:06:20.630> usually<00:06:20.810> be<00:06:21.110> doing<00:06:21.500> eight<00:06:22.160> ten

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
end so you'd usually be doing eight ten

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.700 
end so you'd usually be doing eight ten
twelve<00:06:23.419> stitches<00:06:23.960> like<00:06:24.110> this<00:06:24.169> and<00:06:24.530> that's<00:06:24.650> how

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
twelve stitches like this and that's how

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.710 
twelve stitches like this and that's how
you<00:06:24.800> get<00:06:24.919> that<00:06:25.099> pretty<00:06:25.340> little<00:06:25.520> circle<00:06:26.060> and<00:06:26.270> if

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
you get that pretty little circle and if

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.540 
you get that pretty little circle and if
you<00:06:26.810> don't<00:06:27.020> cinch<00:06:27.260> it<00:06:27.410> up<00:06:27.500> all<00:06:27.710> the<00:06:27.740> way<00:06:27.889> you

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
you don't cinch it up all the way you

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.270 
you don't cinch it up all the way you
actually<00:06:28.760> get<00:06:29.270> an<00:06:29.449> open<00:06:30.080> center<00:06:30.500> and<00:06:30.740> it's

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
actually get an open center and it's

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.559 
actually get an open center and it's
very<00:06:31.550> strong<00:06:31.970> because<00:06:32.210> of<00:06:32.360> the

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:32.569 
very strong because of the

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:34.119 
very strong because of the
crochets<00:06:32.869> just<00:06:33.169> so<00:06:33.469> you<00:06:33.559> don't<00:06:33.589> have<00:06:33.830> to<00:06:33.949> worry

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129 
crochets just so you don't have to worry

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:35.499 
crochets just so you don't have to worry
about<00:06:34.189> it<00:06:34.490> falling<00:06:34.669> apart<00:06:34.849> or<00:06:35.300> getting

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
about it falling apart or getting

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.359 
about it falling apart or getting
snagged<00:06:35.779> on<00:06:35.960> anything<00:06:36.050> now<00:06:36.889> one<00:06:37.099> thing<00:06:37.249> you

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:37.369 
snagged on anything now one thing you

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:39.309 
snagged on anything now one thing you
will<00:06:37.520> have<00:06:37.699> to<00:06:37.879> do<00:06:38.029> is<00:06:38.300> while<00:06:38.659> you're<00:06:38.899> working

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319 
will have to do is while you're working

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:40.570 
will have to do is while you're working
and<00:06:39.439> especially<00:06:39.710> when<00:06:39.949> it's<00:06:40.069> very<00:06:40.279> small

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
and especially when it's very small

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.919 
and especially when it's very small
you're<00:06:40.789> gonna<00:06:40.879> have<00:06:41.119> to<00:06:41.270> tug<00:06:41.449> that<00:06:41.479> end<00:06:41.809> a

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:41.929 
you're gonna have to tug that end a

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:43.659 
you're gonna have to tug that end a
couple<00:06:42.080> times<00:06:42.409> but<00:06:43.039> you<00:06:43.129> can<00:06:43.249> always<00:06:43.490> do<00:06:43.639> that

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
couple times but you can always do that

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.399
