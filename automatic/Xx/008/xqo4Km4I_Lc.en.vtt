so<00:00:00.359> if<00:00:00.630> you<00:00:00.750> have<00:00:00.960> an<00:00:01.079> e46<00:00:01.500> you<00:00:02.070> have<00:00:02.280> probably

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
so if you have an e46 you have probably

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.999 
so if you have an e46 you have probably
dealt<00:00:03.300> with<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.810> cooling<00:00:04.170> system<00:00:04.560> in<00:00:04.680> one<00:00:04.859> way

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
dealt with the cooling system in one way

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.860 
dealt with the cooling system in one way
or<00:00:05.130> another<00:00:05.160> one<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.910> common<00:00:06.270> problems<00:00:06.299> is

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
or another one of the common problems is

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.890 
or another one of the common problems is
that<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:08.010> car<00:00:08.429> will<00:00:08.670> slowly<00:00:09.030> lose<00:00:09.389> coolant

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
that the car will slowly lose coolant

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.780 
that the car will slowly lose coolant
over<00:00:10.139> time<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:11.190> won't<00:00:11.340> be<00:00:11.400> able<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.610> find

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
over time and you won't be able to find

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.209 
over time and you won't be able to find
out<00:00:11.969> where<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.120> leak<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:13.349> I'm<00:00:14.040> going<00:00:14.190> to

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
out where the leak is so I'm going to

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.560 
out where the leak is so I'm going to
start<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.639> what<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.910> think<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.450> most

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
start with what I think is the most

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.000 
start with what I think is the most
common<00:00:16.109> leak<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.470> then<00:00:16.560> I'm<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> tell

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
common leak and then I'm going to tell

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.980 
common leak and then I'm going to tell
you<00:00:17.130> what<00:00:17.369> other<00:00:17.699> places<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.420> look<00:00:18.539> okay<00:00:19.380> so

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
you what other places to look okay so

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.870 
you what other places to look okay so
this<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.439> coolant<00:00:23.430> temperature<00:00:23.609> sensor

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
this is the coolant temperature sensor

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.500 
this is the coolant temperature sensor
or<00:00:24.300> ring<00:00:24.510> as<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.869> see<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.170> cracked<00:00:26.510> I'm

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
or ring as you can see it's cracked I'm

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.640 
or ring as you can see it's cracked I'm
going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.750> tell<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.960> how<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.140> replace<00:00:28.470> this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
going to tell you how to replace this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.109 
going to tell you how to replace this
guy<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.400> first<00:00:29.640> thing<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.880> should<00:00:30.029> do

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
guy is the first thing you should do

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.849 
guy is the first thing you should do
because<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.689> cheap<00:00:30.720> okay<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.650> go

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
because it's so cheap okay so you go

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.910 
because it's so cheap okay so you go
down<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.440> coolant

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
down in here this is the coolant

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.410 
down in here this is the coolant
temperature<00:00:35.100> sensor<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:36.000> pull<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
temperature sensor we pull the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540 
temperature sensor we pull the
electrical<00:00:36.809> cord<00:00:37.050> off<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.410> now<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.280> have

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
electrical cord off and now we just have

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.979 
electrical cord off and now we just have
this<00:00:40.460> temp<00:00:41.460> sensor<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.300> there<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.809> we

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
this temp sensor right there but we

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.090 
this temp sensor right there but we
don't<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.440> yet<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.710> want<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.950> go

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
don't want to do it yet we want to go

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.950 
don't want to do it yet we want to go
over<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> our<00:00:44.489> coolant<00:00:44.940> cap<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> let<00:00:45.750> some

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
over to our coolant cap and let some

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.900 
over to our coolant cap and let some
hair<00:00:46.110> into<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.379> system<00:00:48.860> okay<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.640> tighten

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
hair into the system okay now tighten

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.010 
hair into the system okay now tighten
that<00:00:51.090> back<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.629> you're<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> leak

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that back up or you're going to leak

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.319 
that back up or you're going to leak
coolant<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.620> ground<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.090> here

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
coolant on the ground now I go in here

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.170 
coolant on the ground now I go in here
and<00:00:54.449> pull<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.960> temp<00:00:55.230> sensor<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:57.030> can

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
and pull this temp sensor up as you can

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.779 
and pull this temp sensor up as you can
see<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> out<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.129> these<00:00:59.489> two

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
see to get it out it's just these two

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.930 
see to get it out it's just these two
clips<00:01:00.539> push<00:01:01.410> them<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:02.219> my<00:01:02.460> new<00:01:02.579> o-ring

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
clips push them in that's my new o-ring

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.010 
clips push them in that's my new o-ring
it's<00:01:03.149> already<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.570> there<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.589> old<00:01:04.830> o-ring<00:01:05.220> is

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
it's already on there the old o-ring is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.410 
it's already on there the old o-ring is
right<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.700> here's<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> part<00:01:09.630> number

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
right here and here's the part number

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
right here and here's the part number
now<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.950> use<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.490> orange<00:01:15.060> thick<00:01:15.270> tool<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.930> take

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
now you use a orange thick tool to take

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.700 
now you use a orange thick tool to take
it<00:01:17.009> off<00:01:17.390> put<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> new<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.780> put<00:01:19.500> this

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
it off put the new one on put this

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.899 
it off put the new one on put this
sucker<00:01:19.979> back<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.060> put<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
sucker back in so put it on like that

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.600 
sucker back in so put it on like that
and<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.450> slides<00:01:24.720> into<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.890> slides

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and see that it slides into the slides

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.010 
and see that it slides into the slides
right<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.909> down<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.659> we're<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> go

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
right in down there so we're going to go

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.789 
right in down there so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.229> put<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:29.810> okay<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.470> you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
ahead and put it okay that you can you

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.130 
ahead and put it okay that you can you
can<00:01:31.829> feel<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.220> clip<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.869> lose

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
can feel it clip in that's it you lose

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.280 
can feel it clip in that's it you lose
you<00:01:34.920> know<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.909> little<00:01:36.180> bit<00:01:36.390> cool<00:01:36.689> put<00:01:37.200> the

you know just a little bit cool put the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.490 
you know just a little bit cool put the
electrical<00:01:37.590> clip<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.070> clip<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:39.320> okay<00:01:40.320> it's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
electrical clip and clip it in okay it's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.370 
electrical clip and clip it in okay it's
clipped<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.950> now<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:42.030> over<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.390> check<00:01:43.259> our

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
clipped in now go over here check our

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
clipped in now go over here check our
coolant<00:01:43.649> level<00:01:43.890> see<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.759> didn't<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.060> lose

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
coolant level see we didn't really lose

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.210 
coolant level see we didn't really lose
anything<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.990> we're<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.290> we're<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> go

you have lost going
you<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.479> 50-50<00:01:52.140> mix<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.560> BMW

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you have your 50-50 mix of BMW

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.580 
you have your 50-50 mix of BMW
antifreeze<00:01:53.820> over<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.270> okay<00:01:55.229> now<00:01:55.380> I'm<00:01:55.500> going

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
antifreeze over here okay now I'm going

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
antifreeze over here okay now I'm going
to<00:01:55.680> talk<00:01:55.829> about<00:01:55.860> where<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.700> should<00:01:56.729> look<00:01:56.969> if

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
to talk about where you should look if

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.789 
to talk about where you should look if
that<00:01:57.570> doesn't<00:01:57.930> solve<00:01:58.110> your<00:01:58.229> coolant<00:01:58.619> loss

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that doesn't solve your coolant loss

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.459 
that doesn't solve your coolant loss
problems<00:01:59.310> one<00:02:00.270> thing<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.600> check<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
problems one thing to check for is a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.510 
problems one thing to check for is a
white<00:02:01.829> crusty<00:02:02.549> residue<00:02:03.829> okay<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:04.890> there's<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
white crusty residue okay so there's the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.789 
white crusty residue okay so there's the
white<00:02:05.700> crusty<00:02:06.149> residue<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.409> can<00:02:07.619> check

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
white crusty residue so you can check

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.080 
white crusty residue so you can check
around<00:02:08.069> all<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> hose<00:02:08.459> connection

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
around all the hose connection

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.460 
around all the hose connection
for<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.660> hose<00:02:09.840> connections<00:02:10.229> are<00:02:10.289> really

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
for that the hose connections are really

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.350 
for that the hose connections are really
easy<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.800> connect<00:02:11.099> they<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.489> go<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.270> then

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
easy to connect they just go in and then

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.089 
easy to connect they just go in and then
snap<00:02:12.630> on<00:02:12.870> with<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.110> little<00:02:13.170> clip<00:02:13.440> here's

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
snap on with a little clip here's

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.890 
snap on with a little clip here's
another<00:02:14.400> problem<00:02:15.209> area<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.630> would<00:02:15.750> be<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
another problem area this would be a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.559 
another problem area this would be a
future<00:02:16.290> problem<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:17.220> hose<00:02:17.520> was<00:02:17.940> getting

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
future problem this hose was getting

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.300 
future problem this hose was getting
power<00:02:18.840> steering<00:02:19.230> fluid<00:02:19.349> dripped<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.980> as

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
power steering fluid dripped on it as

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.370 
power steering fluid dripped on it as
you<00:02:20.610> can<00:02:20.700> see<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:21.030> ballooning<00:02:21.390> out<00:02:21.510> at<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
you can see it's ballooning out at the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.589 
you can see it's ballooning out at the
connection<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.340> replace<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.700> before<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
connection so I replace that before it

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.990 
connection so I replace that before it
became<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.930> problem<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.769> water<00:02:26.190> pump<00:02:26.550> has<00:02:26.970> a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
became a problem the water pump has a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.559 
became a problem the water pump has a
bunch<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.450> shaft<00:02:27.690> clay<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:30.090> also

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
bunch of shaft clay in it and also

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.509 
bunch of shaft clay in it and also
another<00:02:30.810> thing<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.680> stock<00:02:32.010> water

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
another thing is that the stock water

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.479 
another thing is that the stock water
pump<00:02:32.760> pulley<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.120> made<00:02:33.269> out<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.420> plastic<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:34.489> I

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
pump pulley is made out of plastic so I

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.949 
pump pulley is made out of plastic so I
replace<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:35.910> with<00:02:36.150> metal<00:02:36.450> one<00:02:36.569> those<00:02:36.810> are<00:02:36.930> a

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
replace it with metal one those are a

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.979 
replace it with metal one those are a
few<00:02:37.519> coolant<00:02:38.519> issues<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.660> might<00:02:39.810> have

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
few coolant issues that you might have

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.360 
few coolant issues that you might have
that's<00:02:40.709> pretty<00:02:40.950> much<00:02:41.010> it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
that's pretty much it

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.970 
that's pretty much it
