this incredible harmonic activated by
the<00:00:44.460> right<00:00:44.700> hand<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> amazing<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.100> never<00:00:50.190> get

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the right hand so amazing I never get

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.010 
the right hand so amazing I never get
tired<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.670> playing<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.030> he's<00:00:51.510> doing<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> here

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
tired of playing this he's doing it here

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.840 
tired of playing this he's doing it here
in<00:00:52.050> F<00:00:52.320> which<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> half<00:00:53.100> step<00:00:53.250> above<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.640> key

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
in F which is a half step above the key

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.950 
in F which is a half step above the key
that<00:00:54.000> makes<00:00:54.210> everything<00:00:54.480> easy<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that makes everything easy and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.290 
that makes everything easy and
convenient<00:00:55.469> therefore<00:00:56.039> Eric<00:00:56.789> does<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> an<00:00:57.180> F

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
convenient therefore Eric does it an F

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090 
convenient therefore Eric does it an F
but<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.140> doesn't<00:00:58.410> matter<00:00:58.530> because<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.949> always

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
but it doesn't matter because it always

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.860 
but it doesn't matter because it always
flows<00:00:59.430> from<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.789> same<00:01:00.000> exact<00:01:00.300> pentatonic

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
flows from the same exact pentatonic

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.889 
flows from the same exact pentatonic
shape<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.680> same<00:01:01.859> basic<00:01:02.399> skeletal<00:01:03.390> structure

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
shape the same basic skeletal structure

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.929 
shape the same basic skeletal structure
and<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.470> course<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.890> shape<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> second

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and of course that shape is the second

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.120 
and of course that shape is the second
position<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.930> pentatonic<00:01:07.320> scale<00:01:10.130> we've

seen this before we hinted that the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
seen this before we hinted that the

second position of the pentatonic scale

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.760 
second position of the pentatonic scale
has<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> special<00:01:15.840> significance<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.470> Eric's

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
has a special significance in Eric's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
has a special significance in Eric's
playing<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> source<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.450> important<00:01:18.900> a

basic<00:01:32.900> structure<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.560> if<00:01:33.650> we<00:01:33.770> take<00:01:33.920> this

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
basic structure of it if we take this

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.770 
basic structure of it if we take this
from<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.520> second<00:01:34.820> position<00:01:35.180> pentatonic<00:01:35.659> here

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
from the second position pentatonic here

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.310 
from the second position pentatonic here
and<00:01:35.900> F<00:01:36.140> would<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.700> this<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:38.720> it's<00:01:39.050> very

and F would is this and it's it's very

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.480 
and F would is this and it's it's very
interesting<00:01:39.560> structure<00:01:40.040> because<00:01:40.250> we<00:01:40.280> have<00:01:40.460> a

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
interesting structure because we have a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.340 
interesting structure because we have a
couple<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.909> notes<00:01:41.090> missing<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:41.960> on<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.140> first

couple of notes missing and on the first
string<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:43.100> only<00:01:43.340> play<00:01:43.700> this<00:01:43.940> note<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:45.290> first

next<00:02:09.259> tune<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:11.269> then<00:02:12.170> we've<00:02:12.620> got<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.130> middle

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
next tune and then we've got the middle

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.990 
next tune and then we've got the middle
finger<00:02:13.580> alone<00:02:14.300> on<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.080> g<00:02:15.200> string<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.940> then<00:02:16.940> we

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
finger alone on the g string and then we

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.080 
finger alone on the g string and then we
move<00:02:17.209> directly<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.959> top<00:02:18.140> two<00:02:18.940> which<00:02:19.940> are

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
move directly to the top two which are

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.550 
move directly to the top two which are
two<00:02:20.209> small<00:02:20.480> shapes<00:02:20.750> again<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.380> whole

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
two small shapes again so the whole

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.520 
two small shapes again so the whole
thing<00:02:21.920> then<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.959> entire<00:02:24.200> six

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
thing then is it's the entire six

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.810 
thing then is it's the entire six
strings<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.040> second<00:02:25.340> position<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
strings are missing one note the first

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.910 
strings are missing one note the first

and<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.730> g<00:02:31.760> string<00:02:34.720> that's<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.900> sequence

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
and the g string that's the sequence

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.410 
and the g string that's the sequence
that's<00:02:36.950> let's<00:02:37.220> call<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.610> skeleton<00:02:38.269> of

that's let's call it the skeleton of

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
this of the basic lick and then from the

kinds<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.000> incredible<00:02:44.570> variations<00:02:45.170> if<00:02:45.380> we

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
kinds of incredible variations if we

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.509 
kinds of incredible variations if we
look<00:02:46.280> at<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.989> shape<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:48.920> its<00:02:49.010> purest

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
look at the this shape and its purest

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.800 
look at the this shape and its purest
form<00:02:49.579> here's<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.090> version<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.630> where<00:02:50.720> he

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
form here's a version of it where he

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:01.250 
form here's a version of it where he
just<00:02:51.079> plays<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.500> skeleton

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.500 

so<00:03:02.260> amazing<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.640> least<00:03:04.060> adorned

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
so amazing this is the least adorned

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.910 
so amazing this is the least adorned
version<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.020> harmonic<00:03:05.170> arpeggio<00:03:05.740> that

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
version of the harmonic arpeggio that

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.860 
version of the harmonic arpeggio that
Eric<00:03:06.130> plays<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:06.850> basically<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.390> straight

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
Eric plays it's basically a straight

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.660 
Eric plays it's basically a straight
line<00:03:08.140> burst<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.680> speed<00:03:08.830> right<00:03:09.220> across<00:03:09.490> the

second position of the pentatonic scale

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.080

as<00:03:11.440> we're<00:03:12.040> moving<00:03:12.160> across<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.580> strings<00:03:12.910> here

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
as we're moving across the strings here

as we're moving across the strings here
picking<00:03:13.360> structure-wise

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
picking structure-wise

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.380 
picking structure-wise
it's<00:03:14.650> very<00:03:14.890> specific<00:03:15.130> but<00:03:15.490> again<00:03:15.700> exactly<00:03:16.120> as

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
it's very specific but again exactly as

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.940 
it's very specific but again exactly as
you'd<00:03:16.540> expect<00:03:16.930> we<00:03:17.050> have<00:03:17.170> two<00:03:17.350> down<00:03:17.500> strokes<00:03:17.860> in

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
you'd expect we have two down strokes in

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.160 
you'd expect we have two down strokes in
the<00:03:17.980> beginning<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.660> very<00:03:19.840> similar<00:03:20.050> to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
the beginning this is very similar to

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.600 
the beginning this is very similar to
those<00:03:20.380> pentatonic<00:03:20.890> pickups<00:03:21.190> that<00:03:21.250> we<00:03:21.430> looked

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
those pentatonic pickups that we looked

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.160 
those pentatonic pickups that we looked
at<00:03:21.760> where<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.390> could<00:03:22.540> either<00:03:22.630> have<00:03:22.720> two<00:03:23.020> down

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
at where you could either have two down

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.470 
at where you could either have two down
strokes<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.980> bounce<00:03:24.220> down<00:03:24.550> strokes<00:03:24.940> or<00:03:25.330> you

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
strokes the bounce down strokes or you

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.000 
strokes the bounce down strokes or you
could<00:03:25.600> just<00:03:25.630> sweep<00:03:26.050> right<00:03:26.200> across<00:03:28.350> now<00:03:29.350> we<00:03:29.860> get

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
could just sweep right across now we get

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.920 
could just sweep right across now we get
to<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.160> second<00:03:30.610> string<00:03:31.300> of<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.540> lick<00:03:31.690> here

we're<00:04:07.780> just<00:04:07.810> blazing<00:04:08.410> right<00:04:08.590> across<00:04:08.920> in<00:04:09.070> a

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
we're just blazing right across in a

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.470 
we're just blazing right across in a
straight<00:04:09.370> line<00:04:09.520> so<00:04:09.550> we<00:04:09.790> just<00:04:09.940> keep<00:04:10.060> going<00:04:10.270> we

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
straight line so we just keep going we

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.510 
straight line so we just keep going we
do<00:04:10.600> that<00:04:10.750> down<00:04:10.930> stroke<00:04:11.290> sweep<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.220> it's<00:04:12.340> down

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
do that down stroke sweep so it's down

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.770 
do that down stroke sweep so it's down
down<00:04:12.790> then<00:04:13.240> the<00:04:13.390> upstroke<00:04:14.790> now<00:04:15.790> we<00:04:16.299> alternate

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
down then the upstroke now we alternate

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.360 
down then the upstroke now we alternate
pick<00:04:16.989> right<00:04:17.200> up<00:04:17.230> to<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.560> high<00:04:17.680> E<00:04:17.710> string<00:04:18.190> and

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
pick right up to the high E string and

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.520 
pick right up to the high E string and
the<00:04:19.150> index<00:04:19.480> finger<00:04:19.750> is<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.960> first<00:04:20.140> note<00:04:20.350> in

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
the index finger is the first note in

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.800 
the index finger is the first note in
this<00:04:20.710> part<00:04:20.980> of<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.130> pentatonic<00:04:21.430> scale<00:04:21.750> now<00:04:22.750> we

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
this part of the pentatonic scale now we

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.160 
this part of the pentatonic scale now we
have<00:04:23.110> one<00:04:23.470> minor<00:04:24.430> pardon<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.270> pun<00:04:25.450> adornment

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
have one minor pardon the pun adornment

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.500 
have one minor pardon the pun adornment
and<00:04:26.290> that<00:04:26.650> is<00:04:26.860> we<00:04:27.100> skip<00:04:27.550> this<00:04:27.850> note<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.360> next

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
and that is we skip this note the next

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.150 
and that is we skip this note the next
note<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:28.990> second<00:04:29.290> position<00:04:29.620> pentatonic

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
note of the second position pentatonic

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.310 
note of the second position pentatonic
and<00:04:30.250> then<00:04:30.730> we<00:04:30.850> add<00:04:31.120> instead<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.900> pinky<00:04:32.290> up

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
and then we add instead the pinky up

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.520 
and then we add instead the pinky up
here

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
here

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.560 
here
and<00:04:34.530> in<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:35.670> doing<00:04:35.700> of<00:04:36.060> course<00:04:36.270> we<00:04:36.390> very

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
and in so doing of course we very

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.770 
and in so doing of course we very
clearly<00:04:37.020> trace<00:04:37.410> out<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:38.220> minor<00:04:39.000> triad<00:04:39.420> and

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
clearly trace out that minor triad and

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.600 
clearly trace out that minor triad and
in<00:04:40.080> combination<00:04:40.650> with<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.860> flat<00:04:41.100> seven<00:04:41.430> right

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
in combination with the flat seven right

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.890 
in combination with the flat seven right

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
before at that other note on the B

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.060 
before at that other note on the B
string<00:04:44.810> we<00:04:45.810> have<00:04:45.840> traced<00:04:46.380> out<00:04:46.560> our<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.830> minor

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070

string we have traced out our a minor
arpeggio<00:04:47.610> just<00:04:48.240> four<00:04:48.480> notes<00:04:48.720> two<00:04:49.200> notes<00:04:49.440> per

string<00:04:49.680> on<00:04:50.100> adjacent<00:04:50.880> strings<00:04:51.180> really<00:04:51.780> easy

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
string on adjacent strings really easy

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.280 
string on adjacent strings really easy
to<00:04:52.140> do<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.790> very<00:04:53.790> much<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.300> subset<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.020> the

to do and very much a subset of the
pentatonic<00:04:55.830> scale<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.310> when<00:04:56.430> we<00:04:56.520> remove<00:04:56.850> that

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
pentatonic scale and when we remove that

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.060 
pentatonic scale and when we remove that
extra<00:04:57.480> note<00:04:57.660> all<00:04:58.170> of<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.500> sudden<00:04:58.740> it<00:04:58.830> brings

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
extra note all of a sudden it brings

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.740 
extra note all of a sudden it brings
that<00:04:59.280> chord<00:04:59.640> color<00:04:59.880> into<00:05:00.150> very<00:05:00.300> dramatic

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
that chord color into very dramatic

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:08.570 
that chord color into very dramatic
relief<00:05:06.350> now<00:05:07.350> I'm<00:05:07.560> doing<00:05:07.800> is<00:05:07.890> just<00:05:07.920> repeating

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
relief now I'm doing is just repeating

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.950 
relief now I'm doing is just repeating
those<00:05:08.700> notes<00:05:08.970> on<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.210> top<00:05:09.360> two<00:05:09.540> strings<00:05:09.870> here

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
those notes on the top two strings here

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.050 
those notes on the top two strings here
and<00:05:10.290> it's<00:05:11.100> just<00:05:11.310> down<00:05:11.430> up<00:05:11.610> down<00:05:11.760> in<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.910> low

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
and it's just down up down in the low

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.100 
and it's just down up down in the low
string<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:13.340> then<00:05:14.340> down<00:05:15.000> up<00:05:15.300> on<00:05:15.480> the<00:05:15.990> high

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
string and then down up on the high

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.250 
string and then down up on the high
string<00:05:17.150> so<00:05:18.150> we<00:05:18.180> have<00:05:18.480> basically<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:18.900> looping

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
string so we have basically a looping

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.420 
string so we have basically a looping
figure<00:05:19.530> with<00:05:19.650> a<00:05:19.680> note<00:05:19.860> missing<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.340> that

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
figure with a note missing and that

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.370 
figure with a note missing and that
gives<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.730> a<00:05:20.790> kind<00:05:21.060> of<00:05:21.090> a<00:05:21.210> an<00:05:21.480> off-kilter<00:05:21.990> feel

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
gives it a kind of a an off-kilter feel

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.900 
gives it a kind of a an off-kilter feel
it<00:05:22.830> sounds<00:05:23.130> pretty<00:05:23.250> cool<00:05:23.430> it<00:05:23.580> makes<00:05:23.730> a<00:05:23.790> cool

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
it sounds pretty cool it makes a cool

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.430 
it sounds pretty cool it makes a cool
exercise<00:05:24.420> of<00:05:24.540> course<00:05:24.720> would<00:05:24.900> also<00:05:25.140> make<00:05:25.410> a

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
exercise of course would also make a

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.590 
exercise of course would also make a
pretty<00:05:25.740> cool<00:05:25.950> phrase<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.520> use<00:05:26.670> as<00:05:26.970> on<00:05:27.300> its<00:05:27.480> own

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
pretty cool phrase to use as on its own

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.390 
pretty cool phrase to use as on its own
right<00:05:27.810> this<00:05:28.260> is<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.470> very<00:05:28.710> common<00:05:29.040> shape<00:05:29.070> for

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
right this is a very common shape for

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.130 
right this is a very common shape for
doing<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:29.790> string<00:05:30.120> arpeggios<00:05:30.720> where<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:30.990> have

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
doing to string arpeggios where you have

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.840 
doing to string arpeggios where you have
the<00:05:31.290> root<00:05:31.500> note<00:05:31.740> and<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.100> flat<00:05:32.310> seven<00:05:32.670> on<00:05:32.760> the

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
the root note and the flat seven on the

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.440 
the root note and the flat seven on the
lower<00:05:33.000> string<00:05:33.560> and<00:05:34.700> then<00:05:35.700> you<00:05:36.000> have<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.240> third

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
lower string and then you have the third

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.990 
lower string and then you have the third
and<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:36.660> five<00:05:36.840> on<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.140> upper<00:05:37.320> string<00:05:38.000> you

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
and the five on the upper string you

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.550 
and the five on the upper string you
have<00:05:39.030> this<00:05:39.180> very<00:05:39.420> strong<00:05:39.780> outline<00:05:40.230> of<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.380> minor

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
have this very strong outline of a minor

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.800 
have this very strong outline of a minor
triad<00:05:40.890> there<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.550> then<00:05:42.120> you<00:05:42.360> have<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:42.630> flat

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
triad there and then you have the flat

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.480 
triad there and then you have the flat
seven<00:05:43.080> right<00:05:43.260> below<00:05:43.500> it<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:43.740> Eric<00:05:44.040> uses<00:05:44.250> this

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
seven right below it and Eric uses this

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.790 
seven right below it and Eric uses this
in<00:05:44.610> both<00:05:44.730> major<00:05:45.000> and<00:05:45.120> minor<00:05:45.240> contexts<00:05:46.140> but<00:05:46.650> in

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
in both major and minor contexts but in

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.370 
in both major and minor contexts but in
this<00:05:46.980> case<00:05:47.250> because<00:05:47.760> we<00:05:48.030> have<00:05:48.060> this<00:05:48.870> very

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
this case because we have this very

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.960 
this case because we have this very
strong<00:05:49.440> outline<00:05:49.890> of<00:05:50.070> a<00:05:50.220> Marne<00:05:50.430> of<00:05:50.580> a<00:05:50.760> minor

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
strong outline of a Marne of a minor

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.630 
strong outline of a Marne of a minor
triad<00:05:51.210> right<00:05:51.570> at<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.780> top<00:05:51.990> and<00:05:52.460> of<00:05:53.460> course

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
triad right at the top and of course

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.130 
triad right at the top and of course
that<00:05:53.820> amazing<00:05:54.360> harmonic<00:05:54.810> note<00:05:54.960> which

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
that amazing harmonic note which

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.680 
that amazing harmonic note which
emphasizes<00:05:55.700> the<00:05:56.750> root<00:05:57.750> of<00:05:58.080> chord<00:05:59.450> right<00:06:00.450> there

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
emphasizes the root of chord right there

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.450 
emphasizes the root of chord right there
that's<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.020> root<00:06:01.290> and<00:06:01.470> so<00:06:01.980> at<00:06:02.100> the<00:06:02.190> very<00:06:02.220> top

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
that's the root and so at the very top

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.300 
that's the root and so at the very top
of<00:06:02.670> this<00:06:02.940> of<00:06:03.240> this<00:06:03.570> line<00:06:04.020> this<00:06:04.380> figure<00:06:04.740> we<00:06:05.160> have

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
of this of this line this figure we have

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.280 
of this of this line this figure we have
a<00:06:05.340> very<00:06:05.640> straight<00:06:06.120> ahead<00:06:06.240> minor<00:06:06.750> arpeggio

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
a very straight ahead minor arpeggio

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.780 
a very straight ahead minor arpeggio
that<00:06:07.350> spans<00:06:07.740> a<00:06:07.860> complete<00:06:08.160> octave<00:06:08.520> with<00:06:08.670> the

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
that spans a complete octave with the

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.670 
that spans a complete octave with the
flat<00:06:08.970> seven<00:06:09.270> below<00:06:09.480> it<00:06:09.630> no<00:06:09.720> very<00:06:09.900> gives<00:06:10.380> us<00:06:10.500> a

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
flat seven below it no very gives us a

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.670 
flat seven below it no very gives us a
very<00:06:11.130> strong<00:06:11.250> minor<00:06:12.240> sensibility<00:06:13.050> it's<00:06:13.440> worth

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
very strong minor sensibility it's worth

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.660 
very strong minor sensibility it's worth
noting<00:06:14.190> that<00:06:14.220> down<00:06:14.580> lower<00:06:14.940> on<00:06:15.980> in<00:06:16.980> the<00:06:17.400> second

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
noting that down lower on in the second

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.880 
noting that down lower on in the second
pen<00:06:18.050> second<00:06:19.050> position<00:06:19.320> of<00:06:19.380> the<00:06:19.470> pentatonic

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
pen second position of the pentatonic

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.520 
pen second position of the pentatonic
scale<00:06:20.100> there<00:06:20.610> is<00:06:20.730> another<00:06:21.030> way<00:06:21.240> to<00:06:21.270> fret<00:06:21.600> a<00:06:21.810> two

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
scale there is another way to fret a two

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.450 
scale there is another way to fret a two
string<00:06:22.860> minor<00:06:23.040> arpeggio<00:06:23.520> and<00:06:23.550> would<00:06:23.730> be<00:06:23.820> this

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
string minor arpeggio and would be this

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.850 
string minor arpeggio and would be this
same<00:06:26.450> exact<00:06:26.780> notes<00:06:27.020> but<00:06:27.560> totally<00:06:27.830> different

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
same exact notes but totally different

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.860 
same exact notes but totally different
sound<00:06:28.220> right<00:06:28.520> this<00:06:28.760> sounds<00:06:29.060> like<00:06:29.210> blues<00:06:29.570> this

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
sound right this sounds like blues this

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.140 
sound right this sounds like blues this
sounds<00:06:30.080> like<00:06:30.140> pentatonic<00:06:30.800> and<00:06:30.920> it's<00:06:31.490> really

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
sounds like pentatonic and it's really

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.610 
sounds like pentatonic and it's really
pretty<00:06:32.360> amazing<00:06:32.840> how<00:06:32.960> powerful<00:06:33.530> the

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
pretty amazing how powerful the

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.650 
pretty amazing how powerful the
contextual<00:06:34.250> element<00:06:34.670> of<00:06:34.790> this<00:06:34.910> all<00:06:35.120> is<00:06:35.330> it's

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
contextual element of this all is it's

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.870 
contextual element of this all is it's
exactly<00:06:35.750> the<00:06:36.320> same<00:06:36.500> notes<00:06:36.770> as<00:06:36.980> a<00:06:37.040> major<00:06:37.490> six

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
exactly the same notes as a major six

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.340 
exactly the same notes as a major six
arpeggio<00:06:38.420> we<00:06:38.540> saw<00:06:38.690> that<00:06:38.840> in<00:06:38.960> that<00:06:39.020> Billy<00:06:39.260> the

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
arpeggio we saw that in that Billy the

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:47.830 
arpeggio we saw that in that Billy the
Kid<00:06:39.560> example<00:06:45.760> the<00:06:46.760> big<00:06:46.940> and<00:06:47.090> the<00:06:47.120> big<00:06:47.330> with<00:06:47.810> a

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
Kid example the big and the big with a

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.180 
Kid example the big and the big with a
smaller<00:06:48.200> gap<00:06:48.440> in<00:06:48.590> between<00:06:48.680> them<00:06:48.980> and<00:06:49.100> that's

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
smaller gap in between them and that's

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.100 
smaller gap in between them and that's
where<00:06:49.370> you<00:06:49.430> have<00:06:49.460> that<00:06:49.670> 1<00:06:49.850> 2<00:06:50.030> 3<00:06:50.210> 5<00:06:50.540> shape<00:06:50.870> on<00:06:51.020> the

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
where you have that 1 2 3 5 shape on the

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.020 
where you have that 1 2 3 5 shape on the
piano<00:06:51.320> keyboard<00:06:51.560> that's<00:06:52.190> exactly<00:06:52.700> the<00:06:52.820> shape

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
piano keyboard that's exactly the shape

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.280 
piano keyboard that's exactly the shape
here<00:06:53.300> but<00:06:53.420> it<00:06:53.510> doesn't<00:06:53.870> really<00:06:53.990> have<00:06:54.230> that

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
here but it doesn't really have that

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.980 
here but it doesn't really have that
very<00:06:54.620> strong<00:06:54.950> minor<00:06:55.730> sensibility<00:06:56.510> to<00:06:56.660> it<00:06:56.690> and

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
very strong minor sensibility to it and

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.050 
very strong minor sensibility to it and
again<00:06:57.980> it<00:06:58.100> has<00:06:58.250> to<00:06:58.280> do<00:06:58.460> with<00:06:58.520> the<00:06:58.640> intervallic

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
again it has to do with the intervallic

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.240 
again it has to do with the intervallic
layout<00:06:59.510> and<00:06:59.720> the<00:06:59.780> fact<00:06:59.990> that<00:07:00.170> up<00:07:00.680> here

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
layout and the fact that up here

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.850 
layout and the fact that up here
we<00:07:01.640> have<00:07:01.850> that<00:07:02.180> triad<00:07:02.720> kind<00:07:03.020> of<00:07:03.080> in<00:07:03.140> a<00:07:03.200> row<00:07:03.410> and

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
we have that triad kind of in a row and

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.680 
we have that triad kind of in a row and
here<00:07:04.160> the<00:07:04.550> interval<00:07:04.970> is<00:07:05.120> actually<00:07:05.540> split

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
here the interval is actually split

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.150 
here the interval is actually split
between<00:07:05.900> the<00:07:06.110> high<00:07:06.260> note<00:07:06.500> of<00:07:06.710> the<00:07:06.830> pattern<00:07:07.100> the

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 
between the high note of the pattern the

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.400 
between the high note of the pattern the
low<00:07:07.370> note<00:07:07.610> so<00:07:08.150> it's<00:07:08.300> almost<00:07:08.510> disguised<00:07:09.080> in<00:07:09.350> a

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
low note so it's almost disguised in a

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.350 
low note so it's almost disguised in a
way<00:07:09.500> and<00:07:09.620> almost<00:07:09.710> doesn't<00:07:10.160> sound<00:07:10.490> like<00:07:11.210> the

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
way and almost doesn't sound like the

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.700 
way and almost doesn't sound like the
same<00:07:11.390> arrangement<00:07:11.780> of<00:07:12.110> notes<00:07:12.320> and<00:07:12.530> we're<00:07:12.620> not

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
same arrangement of notes and we're not

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.980 
same arrangement of notes and we're not
even<00:07:12.920> playing<00:07:13.340> them<00:07:13.610> simultaneously<00:07:14.210> so<00:07:14.960> that

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:14.990 
even playing them simultaneously so that

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.990 
even playing them simultaneously so that
again<00:07:15.410> would<00:07:16.070> make<00:07:16.250> this<00:07:16.370> a<00:07:16.490> little<00:07:16.640> clearer

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 
again would make this a little clearer

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.640 
again would make this a little clearer
you<00:07:17.180> can<00:07:17.210> play<00:07:17.780> on<00:07:17.900> a<00:07:17.960> piano<00:07:18.140> keyboard<00:07:18.410> of

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
you can play on a piano keyboard of

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.670 
you can play on a piano keyboard of
minor<00:07:18.770> 7<00:07:19.130> chord

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.900 

and<00:07:24.680> hit<00:07:24.800> all<00:07:24.920> those<00:07:25.040> notes<00:07:25.280> at<00:07:25.400> once<00:07:25.430> and<00:07:25.820> then

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910 
and hit all those notes at once and then

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.250 
and hit all those notes at once and then
you<00:07:25.940> move<00:07:26.210> through<00:07:26.390> inversions<00:07:26.930> and<00:07:26.990> it<00:07:27.140> all

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.260 
you move through inversions and it all

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.360 
you move through inversions and it all
sounds<00:07:27.530> pretty<00:07:27.590> much<00:07:27.860> the<00:07:28.070> same

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.460 

but<00:07:33.270> here<00:07:33.449> once<00:07:33.630> you<00:07:33.720> start<00:07:33.900> to<00:07:33.990> separate<00:07:34.290> out

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
but here once you start to separate out

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.840 
but here once you start to separate out
the<00:07:34.620> notes<00:07:34.830> and<00:07:35.100> there<00:07:35.220> isn't<00:07:35.460> any<00:07:35.580> bleed

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:35.850 
the notes and there isn't any bleed

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.400 
the notes and there isn't any bleed
between<00:07:36.060> them<00:07:36.419> anymore<00:07:36.630> it's<00:07:37.080> like<00:07:37.260> you're

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:37.410 
between them anymore it's like you're

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:48.450 
between them anymore it's like you're
outlining<00:07:37.530> a<00:07:37.830> whole<00:07:37.979> different<00:07:38.280> chord<00:07:38.490> shape

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.460 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.580 

and
