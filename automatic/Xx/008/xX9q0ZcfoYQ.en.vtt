00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 this video is more of an alert due to a 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.700
 question that appeared to me about size 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.440
 neighborhood 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.630
 we talk a lot you have to buy 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.940
 the right size and sometimes there are people who 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.549
 there are confusing're sucking of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.350
 frame with the size of adopt this 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.350
 video to try and clarify why 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.090
 there are two doubts that arrived for the dollar 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.699
 It's a stupid guy, I want to buy my 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.750
 first bike and sent me the only 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.140
 bike 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.430
 I was clipped 24 years ago just for the photo. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.850
 face looked hard 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.780
 I went there and I think I'm going to do BMX because 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.770
 the 24 is indicated for people below 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.409
 one meter and a half tall is the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.200
 and another person bought a 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.090
 bike used in the 24 there wanted to pass 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.500
 meadow 26 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:30.420
 then do not give when you go to buy one 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.570
 bicycle two sizes the size of the air 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.670
 and frame size are two things 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.070
 different when talking about size of 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.340
 bike the size of the frame is to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.880
 stature of the person accommodated and the legs 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.070
 and here entered these two distances that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.560
 vary in relation to the size of the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.729
 of size in the air and will bike 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.759
 gets closer to the sun or not 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:00.300
 adult walking smaller daily 24 you have 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.250
 bmx are used smaller but are not 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.200
 discarded comfortable only with staff 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.599
 to do what bmx does is a circuit 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.090
 the services of competition cars or 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:17.069
 make them free styles 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:21.510
 the staff to do those demonstrations and 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.510
 a24 rim 20 you find a lot in 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.700
 only in those 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.730
 cycling thiago 16 to 20 in the folded 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.870
 relationship is thought 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.709
 for you are an adult already those of 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.810
 morning 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.110
 however obviously it is not the same 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.209
 comfort of a traditional bicycle in 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.560
 terms of performance 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.480
 leaves a lot to be desired 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.150
 you win on the move you went 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.190
 folded subway and everything else but obviously 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.540
 you will not get performance 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.860
 so when you buy a 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:03.530
 bike you have to look at the student and 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:06.349
 14 mother's court and the rim is to adjust 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.840
 for much smaller people in the case of 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.510
 Brazil, this has the session but there is the court 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.700
 thought to God in the greater peaks but 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.620
 way to drive the bike is 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.780
 different too 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.700
 you will not perform in a 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.819
 daily folding bike and still has a 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.340
 bit but the performance is quite 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.019
 person can accommodate very well has 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.500
 people that I do not particularly 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.940
 I get along very well with bicycles. 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.700
 minor road 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.650
 then look at these two things and 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.810
 possible test if you are going to buy a 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.120
 folding bike goes in the place that you 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.609
 can test for you to feel like 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.060
 bike will be in russia is not a 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:52.310
 alert year oil care is also the 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.620
 size of the board that has others there 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.389
 videos of bike fit will be doing the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.669
 that has on the site a lot of pedaling 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:01.849
 takes a look there whose measure to 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:03.739
 you measure me your legs 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.849
 for you to know the size of the board 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.250
 exact 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.470
 then you have fine adjustments here for 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.870
 do not rule out being perfect for 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.010
 that pleasure for total thirst 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.530
 Good now that you've got one more 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.599
 How to pedal is a pass on the 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.720
 our store Mag shopping della have

 more videos we do not have general support of 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.539
