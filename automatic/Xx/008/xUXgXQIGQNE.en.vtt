00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Hello, this is a pile of suits! 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 I made cheese loaf today. 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.340
 Food that can be easily made without oven at home! 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.120
 First, prepare a glutinous rice cake mix. 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.380
 There's a jam mix, a hoko mix, and an instant-drying yeast inside. 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.860
 First, mix yeast with water and mix well. 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 Then, mix the white snow hawk mix and mix well. 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.860
 Whipped cream 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.320
 You can not even add more water if you are tired! 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.220
 If you have gotten together a bit 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 When the dough is finished, please prepare the cheese. 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.520
 Now, take out the dough a little and put the cheese in it. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
 Put 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
 Omri ki! 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.520
 Please note that if you put too much, you may not get well. 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.780
 Please wrap the dough dough that you made well with the wrap so that it does not dry out. 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.580
 Now you have the oil in your pan 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.060
 I'd like to bake some hotcakes in the fire. 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 Do not forget to turn it over and press it once! 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.180
 Yes, cheese cheesecake is so complimented! 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.700
 I'll see you in the next video, hi.
