00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.640 

that's<00:00:31.150> some<00:00:31.390> of<00:00:31.480> my<00:00:31.570> friends<00:00:31.810> song<00:00:32.260> a<00:00:32.290> little

that's some of my friends song a little
off<00:00:32.860> here<00:00:33.040> so<00:00:33.280> let's<00:00:33.430> see<00:00:33.580> if<00:00:33.700> I<00:00:33.760> can<00:00:33.790> try<00:00:34.120> and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
off here so let's see if I can try and

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:45.270 
off here so let's see if I can try and
get<00:00:34.300> back<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.750> menu<00:00:41.940> fortunately<00:00:44.130> want<00:00:45.130> to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
get back to the menu fortunately want to

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.700 
get back to the menu fortunately want to
just<00:00:45.460> just<00:00:46.390> make<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.720> song<00:00:46.960> here<00:00:49.710> then

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
just just make the song here then

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.090 
just just make the song here then
alright<00:00:51.580> so<00:00:51.760> here<00:00:51.940> we<00:00:52.059> are<00:00:53.040> and<00:00:55.379> see<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:56.800> the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
alright so here we are and see that the

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.580 
alright so here we are and see that the
it<00:00:57.430> has<00:00:57.790> kind<00:00:58.120> of<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.330> coverflow<00:00:58.870> interface<00:00:59.379> on

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
it has kind of a coverflow interface on

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.799 
it has kind of a coverflow interface on
both<00:00:59.830> although<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.970> incredible<00:01:01.510> is<00:01:01.540> much

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
both although the incredible is much

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.430 
both although the incredible is much
more<00:01:02.020> intuitive<00:01:02.379> as<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.690> can<00:01:04.839> see<00:01:05.080> where<00:01:05.320> it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
more intuitive as you can see where it

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.290 
more intuitive as you can see where it
kind<00:01:05.530> of<00:01:05.650> flips<00:01:05.979> around<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.460> album<00:01:06.820> art<00:01:06.970> while

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
kind of flips around the album art while

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.400 
kind of flips around the album art while
the<00:01:07.479> pre<00:01:08.470> plus<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:10.540> just<00:01:10.840> um<00:01:11.259> flips<00:01:12.190> through<00:01:12.550> as

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
the pre plus it just um flips through as

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.900 
the pre plus it just um flips through as
opposed<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.530> actually<00:01:14.830> doing<00:01:15.040> anything<00:01:15.460> with

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
opposed to actually doing anything with

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.570 
opposed to actually doing anything with
the<00:01:16.030> album<00:01:16.390> art<00:01:16.540> in<00:01:16.810> terms<00:01:17.080> of<00:01:17.229> physics<00:01:17.680> so

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
the album art in terms of physics so

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.109 
the album art in terms of physics so
let's<00:01:18.880> go<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.180> same<00:01:20.430> song<00:01:21.430> here<00:01:21.910> and

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
let's go to the same song here and

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:30.480 
let's go to the same song here and
compare<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.350> sound<00:01:24.070> quality<00:01:24.340> on<00:01:26.910> both<00:01:29.490> here

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
compare the sound quality on both here

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.700 
compare the sound quality on both here
we<00:01:30.610> aren't<00:01:30.970> we<00:01:31.180> have<00:01:31.330> been<00:01:32.050> hailing<00:01:32.380> here

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
we aren't we have been hailing here

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.350 
we aren't we have been hailing here
that's<00:01:32.920> good<00:01:33.070> van<00:01:33.399> Halen<00:01:33.759> here<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.090> it's<00:01:34.180> much

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
that's good van Halen here and it's much

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.300 
that's good van Halen here and it's much
faster<00:01:34.630> on<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.200> incredible<00:01:35.470> have<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.100> amend

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
faster on the incredible have to amend

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.359 
faster on the incredible have to amend
so<00:01:37.240> let's<00:01:37.630> first<00:01:37.810> try<00:01:38.020> out<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.410> free<00:01:38.830> flus<00:01:39.100> and

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
so let's first try out the free flus and

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.059 
so let's first try out the free flus and
I<00:01:39.490> got<00:01:39.700> maximum<00:01:40.270> volume<00:01:40.479> here<00:01:40.929> speaker<00:01:41.920> on<00:01:42.039> the

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
I got maximum volume here speaker on the

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:50.460 
I got maximum volume here speaker on the
back

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.770 

and<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:51.649> is<00:01:51.770> decent<00:01:52.280> quality<00:01:52.520> it's<00:01:53.479> loud

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
and it is decent quality it's loud

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.889 
and it is decent quality it's loud
enough<00:01:54.220> but<00:01:55.220> i<00:01:55.250> find<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.610> Equality<00:01:56.240> somewhat

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
enough but i find the Equality somewhat

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.359 
enough but i find the Equality somewhat
better<00:01:57.079> than<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.380> incredibles<00:01:57.920> let's<00:01:58.159> sign

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
better than the incredibles let's sign

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:05.460 
better than the incredibles let's sign
out<00:01:58.579> right<00:01:58.820> incredible<00:01:59.450> on<00:02:00.220> maximum<00:02:01.220> volume

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.779 

definitely<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.500> little<00:02:06.860> bit<00:02:06.950> louder<00:02:07.250> than<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
definitely a little bit louder than the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.940 
definitely a little bit louder than the
pre<00:02:08.090> plus<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:09.140> find<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.500> quality<00:02:09.709> has

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
pre plus and I find the quality has

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.900 
pre plus and I find the quality has
something<00:02:12.950> about<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.370> seems<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.790> be<00:02:13.849> a

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
something about it that seems to be a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.770 
something about it that seems to be a
little<00:02:14.209> bit<00:02:14.420> better<00:02:14.569> than<00:02:14.900> free<00:02:15.170> cross<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:16.190> i

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
little bit better than free cross so i

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.039 
little bit better than free cross so i
would<00:02:17.780> have<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.930> give<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.560> music<00:02:19.040> player<00:02:20.049> to

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
would have to give the music player to

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.190 
would have to give the music player to
the<00:02:21.080> incredible<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.890> android<00:02:23.110> well<00:02:24.110> actually

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
the incredible and android well actually

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.280 
the incredible and android well actually
that<00:02:24.440> that's<00:02:24.860> an<00:02:25.069> HTC<00:02:25.670> Sense<00:02:26.030> skin<00:02:26.569> on<00:02:26.840> top<00:02:26.870> of

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
that that's an HTC Sense skin on top of

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.740 
that that's an HTC Sense skin on top of
the<00:02:27.350> Android<00:02:27.739> media<00:02:28.100> player<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:31.569> let's<00:02:32.569> go<00:02:32.690> to

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
the Android media player so let's go to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.440 
the Android media player so let's go to
another<00:02:33.019> feature<00:02:33.319> here<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.940> now<00:02:35.030> let's<00:02:35.269> try

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
another feature here and now let's try

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.449 
another feature here and now let's try
out<00:02:35.630> google<00:02:35.660> maps<00:02:36.290> just<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.739> show<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:36.980> some<00:02:37.430> of

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
out google maps just to show you some of

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.400 
out google maps just to show you some of
the<00:02:37.549> major<00:02:37.790> processing<00:02:38.660> differences<00:02:39.200> here

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
the major processing differences here

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:48.400 
the major processing differences here
I'm<00:02:39.760> soul<00:02:40.760> go<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:40.970> google<00:02:41.720> maps<00:02:41.750> on<00:02:42.200> both

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.150 

and<00:02:49.000> all<00:02:50.000> right<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:51.170> will<00:02:51.650> run<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.980> same

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
and all right so I will run the same

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.970 
and all right so I will run the same
locations<00:02:52.790> let<00:02:53.060> me<00:02:53.150> zoom<00:02:53.390> in<00:02:53.660> on<00:02:53.930> free<00:02:54.710> Foss

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
locations let me zoom in on free Foss

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.180 
locations let me zoom in on free Foss
and<00:02:55.600> if<00:02:56.600> i<00:02:56.690> zoom<00:02:56.720> in<00:02:57.110> on<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.410> incredible<00:02:57.800> the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
and if i zoom in on the incredible the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.180 
and if i zoom in on the incredible the
processor<00:02:58.910> definitely<00:02:59.630> keeps<00:03:00.110> up<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.620> lot<00:03:00.890> more

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
processor definitely keeps up a lot more

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.230 
processor definitely keeps up a lot more
than<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:02.240> does<00:03:02.300> on<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:03.520> pre<00:03:04.520> plus<00:03:04.790> in<00:03:05.180> my

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
than it does on the pre plus in my

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.510 
than it does on the pre plus in my
opinion<00:03:08.710> so<00:03:09.710> that<00:03:09.830> really<00:03:09.980> gives<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.370> an

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
opinion so that really gives you an

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.030 
opinion so that really gives you an
example<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.690> processor<00:03:12.410> differences

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
example of the processor differences

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.180 
example of the processor differences
between<00:03:13.250> these<00:03:17.320> next<00:03:18.320> let's<00:03:18.470> take<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:18.890> look<00:03:19.100> at

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
between these next let's take a look at

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.680 
between these next let's take a look at
the<00:03:19.250> major<00:03:19.520> differences<00:03:20.270> between<00:03:20.330> the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
the major differences between the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.600 
the major differences between the
operating<00:03:21.140> systems<00:03:21.590> which<00:03:22.130> is<00:03:22.280> how<00:03:22.430> they

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
operating systems which is how they

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.000 
operating systems which is how they
handle<00:03:23.060> multitasking<00:03:23.500> so<00:03:24.500> on<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.740> incredible

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
handle multitasking so on the incredible

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.620 
handle multitasking so on the incredible
open<00:03:25.850> up<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.090> internet<00:03:26.860> YouTube<00:03:28.210> camera

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.650 

messages<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:34.640> on<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.850> pre<00:03:35.060> let's<00:03:35.330> open<00:03:35.540> up

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
messages and on the pre let's open up

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.080 
messages and on the pre let's open up
Pandora<00:03:39.070> that<00:03:40.070> definitely<00:03:40.520> takes<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.940> lot

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
Pandora that definitely takes a lot

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:50.450 
Pandora that definitely takes a lot
longer<00:03:41.270> to<00:03:41.480> load<00:03:41.980> tasks

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.320 

maps<00:03:53.370> all<00:03:54.370> right<00:03:54.520> so<00:03:54.670> now<00:03:54.760> i<00:03:54.790> have<00:03:54.910> three

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
maps all right so now i have three

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.380 
maps all right so now i have three
windows<00:03:56.290> open<00:03:56.680> here<00:03:56.950> these<00:03:57.580> are<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:57.970> deck

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
windows open here these are the deck

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.630 
windows open here these are the deck
this<00:03:58.630> is<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.810> deck<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.230> cards<00:03:59.440> interface<00:04:00.340> that

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
this is a deck of cards interface that

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.660 
this is a deck of cards interface that
level<00:04:01.540> rises<00:04:01.840> oh<00:04:01.990> um<00:04:02.200> here<00:04:02.950> we<00:04:02.980> have<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.490> deck

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
level rises oh um here we have the deck

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.190 
level rises oh um here we have the deck
of<00:04:03.820> cards<00:04:04.090> interface<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:04.930> can<00:04:05.050> just

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
of cards interface and you can just

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.260 
of cards interface and you can just
flick<00:04:05.530> through<00:04:05.800> very<00:04:06.160> seamlessly<00:04:06.760> very

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
flick through very seamlessly very

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.380 
flick through very seamlessly very
elegantly<00:04:07.840> too<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.490> when<00:04:09.490> you<00:04:09.610> don't<00:04:10.030> want

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
elegantly too and when you don't want

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.330 
elegantly too and when you don't want
one<00:04:10.630> opening<00:04:11.110> where<00:04:11.320> you<00:04:11.440> just<00:04:11.650> will<00:04:11.860> flick<00:04:12.190> it

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
one opening where you just will flick it

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.610 
one opening where you just will flick it
off<00:04:12.490> and<00:04:13.590> then<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:14.680> can<00:04:14.800> also<00:04:14.920> shrink<00:04:15.460> them

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
off and then you can also shrink them

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.449 
off and then you can also shrink them
rearrange<00:04:17.620> them<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.780> it's<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> very<00:04:20.260> very

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
rearrange them so it's a very very

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.910 
rearrange them so it's a very very
intuitive<00:04:21.459> way<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.630> handling<00:04:22.930> multitasking

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
intuitive way of handling multitasking

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.530 
intuitive way of handling multitasking
long<00:04:24.160> Android<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:24.940> happens<00:04:25.330> in<00:04:25.450> the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
long Android it happens in the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.090 
long Android it happens in the
background<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.230> you<00:04:26.380> don't<00:04:26.590> even<00:04:26.710> know<00:04:27.070> that

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
background so you don't even know that

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.800 
background so you don't even know that
it's<00:04:27.520> happening<00:04:27.970> especially<00:04:28.030> with<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.630> one

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
it's happening especially with the one

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.890 
it's happening especially with the one
gigahertz<00:04:29.140> Snapdragon<00:04:30.040> processor<00:04:30.700> so<00:04:31.660> here<00:04:31.870> I

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
gigahertz Snapdragon processor so here I

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.510 
gigahertz Snapdragon processor so here I
have<00:04:32.880> advanced<00:04:33.880> task<00:04:34.090> killer<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:35.250> I'll<00:04:36.250> go

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
have advanced task killer and I'll go

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.280 
have advanced task killer and I'll go
ahead<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:36.790> kill<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.360> selected<00:04:37.810> apps<00:04:37.990> and

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
ahead and kill the selected apps and

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.020 
ahead and kill the selected apps and
then<00:04:38.440> it<00:04:38.560> closes<00:04:38.770> everything<00:04:39.280> that's<00:04:39.640> a<00:04:39.760> third

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
then it closes everything that's a third

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.900 
then it closes everything that's a third
party<00:04:40.450> application<00:04:41.200> but<00:04:41.890> i<00:04:41.920> highly<00:04:42.250> recommend

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
party application but i highly recommend

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.030 
party application but i highly recommend
it<00:04:43.060> with<00:04:43.180> any<00:04:43.330> Android<00:04:43.840> device<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:47.380> anyway<00:04:47.800> um

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
it with any Android device so anyway um

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.430 
it with any Android device so anyway um
I<00:04:48.610> know<00:04:49.300> there<00:04:49.600> are<00:04:49.630> a<00:04:49.720> lot<00:04:49.900> of<00:04:49.930> things<00:04:50.170> that<00:04:50.350> I

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
I know there are a lot of things that I

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.960 
I know there are a lot of things that I
could<00:04:50.680> have<00:04:50.800> covered<00:04:50.980> but<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.310> felt<00:04:51.610> those<00:04:51.790> were

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
could have covered but I felt those were

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.670 
could have covered but I felt those were
some<00:04:52.150> of<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.360> main<00:04:52.570> features<00:04:52.600> and<00:04:53.500> I'm<00:04:53.560> not

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
some of the main features and I'm not

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.200 
some of the main features and I'm not
going<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:53.890> bother<00:04:54.010> showing<00:04:54.460> a<00:04:54.730> camera

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
going to bother showing a camera

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.850 
going to bother showing a camera
comparison<00:04:55.540> because<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.169> incredible<00:04:56.650> just

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
comparison because the incredible just

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.840 
comparison because the incredible just
blows<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.550> pre<00:04:57.910> plus<00:04:58.120> is<00:04:58.330> away<00:04:59.669> but<00:05:00.669> anyway

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
blows the pre plus is away but anyway

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.960 
blows the pre plus is away but anyway

terms of winner for me the free plus in
the<00:05:07.060> droid<00:05:07.390> it<00:05:07.780> was<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.020> much<00:05:08.260> different<00:05:08.560> way<00:05:08.980> of

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
the droid it was a much different way of

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.820 
the droid it was a much different way of
comparing<00:05:09.970> them<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.450> I<00:05:10.960> went<00:05:11.350> with<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.620> pre

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
comparing them and I went with the pre

plus because I felt that it was the

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.600 
plus because I felt that it was the
better<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.320> two<00:05:14.470> devices<00:05:14.620> however<00:05:15.130> in<00:05:15.490> this
