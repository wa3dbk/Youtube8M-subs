 These people are people. 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.180
 The actual real people are 40% real people. 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:06.739

 This concentration is graded like this. 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.269
 People are people. 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.599
 It is said that the leaders are people who will work for the people on January 1 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.599
 That's it. 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:59.060
 That 's why people in general are going to happen to us for the people. 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:04.519

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:17.829

 Zhou spiritual people in the heat 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:31.919
 In the midst of strength, you have knowledge and skills. 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.300
 The people will work hard to do their jobs , 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.300
 We'll have it. 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.910
 And when it is time to have all the knowledge, and when the time is at hand, 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:49.310
 I do not have the strength . 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:52.069
 I see why we keep working hard until we raise you guys and get you all set . 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:57.740

00:04:52.069 --> 00:05:06.340
 Yottae with the knowledge you are going exercised the skills of the people 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:06.340

 We must open the way for the people to live happily. 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.460
 Now there's nothing the people can do. 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.980
 If we start to see these people and really start seeing the people 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.320
 this is 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:39.180
