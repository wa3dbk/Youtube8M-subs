there
we've<00:00:24.710> both<00:00:24.890> been<00:00:24.950> heavily<00:00:25.310> involved<00:00:25.610> in<00:00:26.000> the

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
we've both been heavily involved in the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.780 
we've both been heavily involved in the
design<00:00:27.140> and<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:27.410> development<00:00:27.520> of<00:00:28.520> a<00:00:28.640> new

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
design and the development of a new

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.790 
design and the development of a new
material<00:00:28.940> called<00:00:29.420> Centrex<00:00:29.990> which<00:00:30.350> is<00:00:30.470> applied

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
material called Centrex which is applied

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.430 
material called Centrex which is applied
into<00:00:31.039> two<00:00:31.340> of<00:00:31.520> hurdies<00:00:32.419> brand<00:00:32.660> new<00:00:32.780> rod<00:00:32.960> ranges

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
into two of hurdies brand new rod ranges

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.490 
into two of hurdies brand new rod ranges
does<00:00:34.309> any<00:00:34.520> freshwater<00:00:35.180> rod<00:00:35.570> range<00:00:35.809> under<00:00:36.079> and

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
does any freshwater rod range under and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.160 
does any freshwater rod range under and
the<00:00:36.649> pro<00:00:36.829> axis<00:00:37.219> saltwater<00:00:37.550> rod<00:00:37.789> range<00:00:38.059> on<00:00:39.020> the

the pro axis saltwater rod range on the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.370 
the pro axis saltwater rod range on the
freshwater<00:00:39.410> odd<00:00:40.960> basically<00:00:41.960> with<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.230> new

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
freshwater odd basically with the new

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.069 
freshwater odd basically with the new
Centrex<00:00:42.829> material<00:00:43.340> it's<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.150> new<00:00:44.329> resin<00:00:44.690> system

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
Centrex material it's a new resin system

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.920 
Centrex material it's a new resin system
that<00:00:45.230> uses<00:00:45.410> none<00:00:45.860> of<00:00:46.040> silica<00:00:46.670> technology<00:00:47.210> now

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
that uses none of silica technology now

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.290 
that uses none of silica technology now
that<00:00:48.079> technology<00:00:48.290> allows<00:00:48.920> us<00:00:49.030> as<00:00:50.030> Rob

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
that technology allows us as Rob

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.900 
that technology allows us as Rob
designers<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:51.440> basically<00:00:51.860> increase<00:00:52.579> the

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
designers to basically increase the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.760 
designers to basically increase the
compressive<00:00:53.450> strength<00:00:53.720> of<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.050> raw<00:00:54.200> material

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
compressive strength of the raw material

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.530 
compressive strength of the raw material
so<00:00:55.280> we<00:00:55.370> have<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.520> much<00:00:55.790> much<00:00:55.970> stronger<00:00:56.270> raw

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
so we have a much much stronger raw

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.020 
so we have a much much stronger raw
material<00:00:57.050> it's<00:00:57.170> in<00:00:57.320> fact<00:00:57.500> up<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.739> 60%<00:00:58.280> stronger

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
material it's in fact up to 60% stronger

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.139 
material it's in fact up to 60% stronger
now<00:00:59.690> that<00:00:59.899> allows<00:01:00.200> us<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.710> go<00:01:01.370> down<00:01:01.700> in<00:01:01.940> weight

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
now that allows us to go down in weight

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.200 
now that allows us to go down in weight
by<00:01:02.480> up<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.870> as<00:01:03.020> much<00:01:03.140> as<00:01:03.200> 30%<00:01:03.850> so<00:01:04.850> we<00:01:04.939> basically

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
by up to as much as 30% so we basically

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.969 
by up to as much as 30% so we basically
have<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.479> stronger<00:01:05.990> or<00:01:06.140> that's<00:01:06.350> also<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.710> lighter

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
have a stronger or that's also a lighter

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.789 
have a stronger or that's also a lighter
because<00:01:07.430> we<00:01:07.670> can<00:01:07.850> use<00:01:08.180> less<00:01:08.780> material<00:01:09.469> within

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
because we can use less material within

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.840 
because we can use less material within

who developed

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.800 
who developed
this<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.459> most<00:02:16.610> sophisticated<00:02:16.819> fly<00:02:17.540> rod

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
this is the most sophisticated fly rod

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.229 
this is the most sophisticated fly rod
ever<00:02:18.769> designed<00:02:19.250> for<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.580> salt<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.000> fact

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
saltwater fly rods he had to sacrifice

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.770 
saltwater fly rods he had to sacrifice
one<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.069> two<00:02:25.310> things<00:02:25.610> either<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.239> rod<00:02:26.450> was<00:02:26.750> a

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
one of two things either the rod was a

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.380 
one of two things either the rod was a
very<00:02:27.050> nice<00:02:27.260> castable<00:02:27.890> rod<00:02:28.069> lightweight<00:02:28.700> but

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
very nice castable rod lightweight but

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.729 
very nice castable rod lightweight but
it<00:02:29.510> did<00:02:29.629> not<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.230> fish<00:02:30.410> fighting

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
it did not have the fish fighting

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.539 
it did not have the fish fighting
capabilities<00:02:31.400> basically<00:02:32.269> they<00:02:32.390> broke<00:02:33.310> or<00:02:34.310> the

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
capabilities basically they broke or the

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.449 
capabilities basically they broke or the
rod<00:02:34.760> had<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> nice<00:02:35.660> stiff<00:02:36.049> spine<00:02:36.620> on<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.040> but<00:02:37.370> it

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
rod had a nice stiff spine on it but it

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.970 
rod had a nice stiff spine on it but it
was<00:02:37.489> not<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.390> very<00:02:38.569> good<00:02:38.690> casting<00:02:39.290> rod

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
was not a very good casting rod

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.460 
was not a very good casting rod
well<00:02:40.459> with<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.819> new<00:02:41.030> Centrex<00:02:41.750> material<00:02:42.290> we

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
well with the new Centrex material we

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.559 
well with the new Centrex material we
now<00:02:42.620> have<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.310> best<00:02:43.549> of<00:02:43.730> both<00:02:43.760> worlds<00:02:43.940> there

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
now have the best of both worlds there

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.539 
now have the best of both worlds there
was<00:02:44.660> absolutely<00:02:45.080> no<00:02:45.260> sacrifice<00:02:45.920> whatsoever

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
was absolutely no sacrifice whatsoever

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.180 
was absolutely no sacrifice whatsoever
this<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.690> most<00:02:47.870> sophisticated<00:02:48.079> fly<00:02:48.890> rod

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
this is the most sophisticated fly rod

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.220 
this is the most sophisticated fly rod
saltwater<00:02:49.670> fly<00:02:49.940> rod<00:02:50.180> ever<00:02:50.360> designed<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.140> the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
saltwater fly rod ever designed and the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.990 
saltwater fly rod ever designed and the
fact<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.650> we've<00:02:51.769> got<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.980> nice<00:02:52.190> sensitive<00:02:52.640> tip

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
fact that we've got a nice sensitive tip

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.449 
fact that we've got a nice sensitive tip
it's<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.930> lightweight<00:02:54.170> rod<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:54.890> it's<00:02:55.069> easy<00:02:55.250> to

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
it's a lightweight rod so it's easy to

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.190 
it's a lightweight rod so it's easy to
hold<00:02:55.610> in<00:02:55.790> your<00:02:55.849> hand<00:02:56.209> all<00:02:56.450> day<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.900> with<00:02:57.079> the

hold in your hand all day and with the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.710 
hold in your hand all day and with the
soft<00:02:57.470> sensitive<00:02:57.950> tip<00:02:58.370> if<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.239> see<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.480> fish

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
soft sensitive tip if you see a fish

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.869 
soft sensitive tip if you see a fish
close<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.260> boat<00:03:00.440> late<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.860> day<00:03:01.069> with<00:03:01.819> a

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
15 foot leader all of a sudden you can

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.400 
15 foot leader all of a sudden you can
have<00:03:03.860> your<00:03:03.980> fly<00:03:04.160> there<00:03:04.459> immediately<00:03:05.379> with<00:03:06.379> a

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
have your fly there immediately with a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.199 
have your fly there immediately with a
real<00:03:06.620> stiff<00:03:06.950> rod<00:03:07.160> like<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.610> past<00:03:07.849> that

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
real stiff rod like in the past that

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.270 
real stiff rod like in the past that
cast<00:03:08.599> was<00:03:08.900> almost<00:03:09.200> impossible

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
cast was almost impossible

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.630 
cast was almost impossible
now<00:03:10.790> with<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> Centrex<00:03:11.629> material<00:03:12.379> being<00:03:12.680> 65%

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
now with the Centrex material being 65%

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.809 
now with the Centrex material being 65%
stronger<00:03:14.180> now<00:03:14.840> once<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.950> have<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.129> big<00:03:16.340> fish<00:03:16.640> on

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
stronger now once you have a big fish on

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.690 
stronger now once you have a big fish on
you<00:03:17.420> can<00:03:17.599> use<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.989> spine<00:03:18.349> of<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.769> rod<00:03:18.950> now<00:03:19.639> you

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
you can use the spine of the rod now you

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.800 
you can use the spine of the rod now you
can<00:03:20.120> catch<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.450> 150<00:03:21.139> pound<00:03:21.319> fish<00:03:21.709> in<00:03:21.970> 5<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.239> 10<00:03:23.269> 15

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
can catch a 150 pound fish in 5 to 10 15

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.840 
can catch a 150 pound fish in 5 to 10 15
minutes<00:03:24.500> if<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.739> know<00:03:24.889> how<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.130> use<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.670> ride

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
minutes if you know how to use the ride

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.840 
minutes if you know how to use the ride
so<00:03:26.810> with<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.170> said<00:03:27.410> again<00:03:27.739> this<00:03:28.459> is<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:28.700> most

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
so with that said again this is the most

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.879 
so with that said again this is the most
sophisticated<00:03:29.139> saltwater<00:03:30.139> fly<00:03:30.470> rod<00:03:30.680> ever

sophisticated saltwater fly rod ever

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.970 
sophisticated saltwater fly rod ever
designed<00:03:31.370> it's<00:03:31.880> lightweight<00:03:32.470> great<00:03:33.470> casting

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
rod and a great fish fighting machine so

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.049 
rod and a great fish fighting machine so
that's<00:03:37.630> important<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:38.720> asked<00:03:38.840> for
