own<00:01:24.210> thoughts<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> started<00:01:26.909> making<00:01:27.000> these

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
own thoughts so I started making these

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.990 
own thoughts so I started making these
candles<00:01:28.039> was<00:01:29.039> thinking<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.460> making<00:01:29.609> shirts

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
candles was thinking of making shirts

somehow<00:01:35.420> annoyed<00:01:36.420> or<00:01:36.450> eight<00:01:36.659> or<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.590> into

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
somehow annoyed or eight or so it into

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.800 
somehow annoyed or eight or so it into
the<00:01:38.450> fabric<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.780> thought

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
the fabric I thought

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.539 
the fabric I thought
more<00:01:41.110> real<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.590> also<00:01:42.009> would<00:01:42.189> have<00:01:42.220> more
