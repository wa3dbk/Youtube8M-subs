first-ever asus rog after party at PAX
East<00:00:16.910> so<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.940> GTX<00:00:18.660> Poseidon<00:00:19.170> 780<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
East so the GTX Poseidon 780 this is the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.640 
East so the GTX Poseidon 780 this is the
overclockers<00:00:21.150> dream<00:00:21.600> card<00:00:21.900> comes<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.500> two

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
overclockers dream card comes with two

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.429 
overclockers dream card comes with two
ways<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.039> cool<00:00:23.250> first<00:00:24.150> duel<00:00:24.570> fans<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.289> will

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
ways to cool first duel fans that will

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.900 
ways to cool first duel fans that will
drop<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> cards<00:00:26.070> temps<00:00:26.400> by<00:00:26.519> 7<00:00:26.820> degrees

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
drop the cards temps by 7 degrees

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.839 
drop the cards temps by 7 degrees
Celsius<00:00:27.150> compared<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> reference<00:00:28.380> build

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
Celsius compared to the reference build

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.189 
Celsius compared to the reference build
second<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.090> water<00:00:30.269> cooling<00:00:30.570> well<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.050> comes

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
second the water cooling well it comes

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.840 
second the water cooling well it comes
with<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.380> built-in<00:00:31.769> water<00:00:31.949> block<00:00:32.279> also

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
with a built-in water block also

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.209 
with a built-in water block also
sporting<00:00:33.480> standard<00:00:34.200> threading<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.070> will

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
sporting standard threading that will

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.069 
sporting standard threading that will
drop<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> cards<00:00:35.790> temps<00:00:36.120> by<00:00:36.239> 24<00:00:36.780> degrees

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
drop the cards temps by 24 degrees

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.139 
drop the cards temps by 24 degrees
Celsius<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.550> great<00:00:38.760> though<00:00:38.910> about<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
Celsius so it's great though about the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.549 
Celsius so it's great though about the
standard<00:00:39.450> threading<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.260> plug<00:00:40.410> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
standard threading is you can plug it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.190 
standard threading is you can plug it
into<00:00:40.710> any<00:00:41.129> liquid<00:00:41.550> cooling<00:00:41.850> loop<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:43.020> if

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
into any liquid cooling loop now if

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.170 
into any liquid cooling loop now if
you're<00:00:43.350> looking<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.680> build<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.980> new<00:00:44.070> PC<00:00:44.489> or<00:00:44.850> just

swap out an old graphics card and you're
curious<00:00:46.980> about<00:00:47.309> water<00:00:47.579> cooling<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.629> card

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
curious about water cooling this card

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.049 
curious about water cooling this card
will<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.050> great<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.430> use<00:00:50.730> run
