00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
like a grease monkey because they're

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.270 
like a grease monkey because they're
always<00:04:57.810> underneath<00:04:58.260> cars<00:04:58.500> with<00:04:58.800> hydraulic

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
holes which is something I would like to

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.200 
holes which is something I would like to
