some of the brands actually have that in
the<00:01:14.189> package<00:01:14.579> so<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.659> kind<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.899> looped<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the package so I just kind of looped the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.630 
the package so I just kind of looped the
cord<00:01:16.649> around<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.100> bit

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
cord around a little bit

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.190 
cord around a little bit
to<00:01:17.820> keep<00:01:17.969> it<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.149> of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.329> way<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.719> I<00:01:18.780> pop<00:01:19.020> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
to keep it out of the way and I pop it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.920 
to keep it out of the way and I pop it
in<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.369> stays<00:01:20.640> put<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.360> use<00:01:21.719> this

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
in there and it stays put I use this

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.319 
in there and it stays put I use this
clip<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.799> keep<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.219> cord

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
clip to keep the cord

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.569 
clip to keep the cord
you<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.810> extended<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:25.890> we're<00:01:26.070> using<00:01:26.250> it

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
you know extended when we're using it

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.280 
you know extended when we're using it
and<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> doesn't<00:01:27.119> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.450> fall<00:01:27.840> down<00:01:28.079> too

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and so it doesn't kind of fall down too

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010 
and so it doesn't kind of fall down too
far<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:29.490> anyway<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:30.210> what<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.539> do<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
far but anyway that's what I do with a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.330 
far but anyway that's what I do with a
hand<00:01:31.229> blender<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.920> about<00:01:32.009> what<00:01:32.310> you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
hand blender so think about what you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.609 
hand blender so think about what you
could<00:01:32.729> put<00:01:33.000> under<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:33.930> kitchen<00:01:34.170> sink

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
could put under your kitchen sink

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.149 
could put under your kitchen sink
cabinet<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> door<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.159> make

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
cabinet and in the door there and make

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.010 
cabinet and in the door there and make
it<00:01:38.280> handy<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.789> you<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.210> whatever<00:01:39.539> you<00:01:39.810> need

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it handy for you for whatever you need

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.959 
it handy for you for whatever you need
to<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.259> more<00:01:40.469> efficient<00:01:40.829> every<00:01:41.009> day<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.460> also

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
to be more efficient every day I also
