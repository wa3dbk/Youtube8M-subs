00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello I am nicolas creator of the site 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.500
 used his mac points as both 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.050
 latest mac tips have focused on the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.630
 keyboard of this one and well this video 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.960
 is the third and last one addressed this 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.420
 theme 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.539
 we specifically have to see during 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.520
 few minutes how to visualize the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.289
 keys on this keyboard I'm not talking to you 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.010
 of course not read with you what 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.320
 marked them above 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.500
 I think of those who will register 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 on your screen my sentence can you 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.520
 sound a little cryptic but actually 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.809
 on bone 10 you have what the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.020
 mac constructor calls a 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.879
 keyboard viewer this one is not 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.920
 obviously not enabled by default but 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.780
 we will do it together and you 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.820
 understand immediately what I have 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.890
 wanted to say 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.590
 for that as usual we will 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.039
 take a spin in the apple menu in order to 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.320
 start the teeth system preferences 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.340
 I have my nikon keyboard that you need 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.960
 start to know well 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.739
 at least for those who saw my 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.329
 tips number 7 and 9 then designed and as soon 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.890
 the first tab called him 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.159
 also keyboard I have a line that goes 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.200
 strongly interested me to display the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.510
 keyboard and character viewer 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.430
 in the menu bar 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.990
 what does that mean 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.880
 we'll just activate this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.770
 option 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.040
 go to the menu bar and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.259
 discover that an icon has appeared is 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.240
 in my mac offers me to display the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.810
 character viewer but especially the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.549
 Keyboard Viewer I will deal well 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.500
 sure the case of the characters the end of 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.820
 the trick but we will first tested 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.619
 this famous keyboard visualizer and 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.229
 good first sight it's just a keyboard 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.299
 virtual that is displayed which means 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.420
 only if your keyboard does not work anymore 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.189
 breakdown to the problem of batteries you will 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.890
 click with your cursor on his 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.020
 keys to help you out 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.310
 except that in fact it's not just a 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.350
 virtual keyboard that allows you 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.180
 troubleshoot in case of failure it will you 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.490
 especially to visualize the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.250
 keyboard keys 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.920
 hence its name example when you 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.319
 press this key 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.700
 you write an e acute accent but that 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.800
 will happen when you 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.519
 ready would be at the same time the touch 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.940
 capital he will not write an acute accent 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.080
 but 1 2 good of course you know it 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.849
 already his writings on the sidelines 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.980
 I'll take a more example 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.190
 representative is what you know 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.180
 write a left brace 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.920
 well it's not written anywhere on 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.060
 my keyboard but it does not matter 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.830
 look at the alt key 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.950
 I have my answer the left brace 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.049
 is written by the key 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.580
 parenthesis left but maintaining the 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:50.340
 alt key pressed and the hooks I 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.400
 hold my alt key but in addition I 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.950
 press that of capital letters 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.610
 I have my two hooks I synthesize 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.220
 with alt + maj I have my two hooks 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.840
 accessible by relaxing but touch 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.519
 I have my two parentheses now I 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.280
 think you understood the interest of 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.780
 this keyboard viewer if you 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.610
 look for a character and this one 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.920
 is not represented without keyboard 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.030
 that does not necessarily mean that he 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.579
 it is not possible to realize it 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.350
 good of course some of you are going 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.450
 now let me know that 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.090
 guess that press alt keys 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.010
 and maje was going to have an effect on 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.600
 keyboard proposals and they 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.120
 will certainly add that if it is necessary 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.430
 try all the keys on the keyboard 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.630
 bass is anything but intuitive and but in 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.069
 I do not agree at all 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.440
 with these two remarks 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.420
 to prove it to you I will share 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.870
 now with you one of the rules 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.620
 the most important to know about mac 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.380
 listen well this will serve you inevitably 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.810
 on apple computers there are three 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.829
 important keys 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.859
 personally I call them the three 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:04.410
 magic keys these are the keys 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:05.609
 adult and maje orders 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.669
 if you are looking to perform a task 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.799
 there is a good chance that one of 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.470
 its three keys allow you to 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.799
 realize and if we come back to our 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:21.150
 viewer so it was enough to try 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:23.340
 just these three keys the shift key the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.440
 option key 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.730
 a combination of both and that's it 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.350
 in this case present trying to 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.560
 command keys you would have fallen for 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.340
 White 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.130
 can I also checked all 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.080
 press matusz commands and I see 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.570
 that she is well supported but that's all 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.760
 in fact it's logical it's all dear to 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.919
 almost all keyboard shortcuts 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.940
 at apple 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.910
 look if I go in my menu 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.690
 new window finder file 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.550
 orders 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.630
 n new uppercase file command n 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.430
 I will not read everything but as 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.460
 you see there at the command 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:07.229
 all sauces and that whatever 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.630
 menu but it's now time to 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.570
 do a little math so come 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.030
 macbook air owns 79 key i did 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.700
 not counted it's apple that binds in 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.710
 admitting that by pressing on all 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.370
 the keys offers me a new 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.690
 possibility 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.080
 it is far from being the case but little 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.590
 matter when ready without option it's 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:34.590
 the same we continue with a combination 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:36.300
 of the two you must doubt that the 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.400
 number of characters that a mac is 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.180
 able to write do not amount to 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.370
 hundreds but in thousands so there is 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.320
 full of character not accessible to 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.039
 keyboards 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.330
 how to get there very simple we have 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.889
 checked what as a box in the 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.440
 system preferences to activate my 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:02.370
 viewer me go back apple menu 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:04.440
 keyboard system preferences display the 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.830
 viewer two keyboards and 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.849
 character in the menu bar 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:15.570
 everything is said hop display the viewer 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:17.639
 of character and that's it you have everything 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.680
 under the eyes these are actually the famous 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:23.010
 special characters I talked about 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.610
 in my tip number 9 and if I open 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.610
 a text document 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.930
 it's double clicking on the character 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:44.310
 which interests me and he goes directly to 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.750
 the place of my cursor the course of 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.639
 math is over but I summarize 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.000
 quickly what we have seen before 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.340
 leave you 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.530
 if you are looking for a character 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.270
 which is not drawing on your keyboard 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.360
 go for a walk in the preferences 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.699
 keyboard system and activate the 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.680
 keyboard and character viewer 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.570
 which will appear to the right of your bar 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.430
 menus 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.919
 the keyboard viewer will allow you 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.650
 to see what character you will achieve 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:13.770
 oppressing several keys 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:16.440
 mainly uppercase or option with 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.750
 another and the character viewer 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.510
 will give you access to all the others 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.889
 potential 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.300
 this video is now complete and 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:25.889
 it's time for me to leave you and 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.560
 to tell you very soon for 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:30.560
