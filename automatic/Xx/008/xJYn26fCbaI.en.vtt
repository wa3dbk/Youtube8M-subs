try maybe to get some pictures
underneath<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.360> layout<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:44.809> you<00:00:44.930> can<00:00:45.079> see<00:00:45.230> how

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
underneath the layout so you can see how

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.330 
underneath the layout so you can see how
this<00:00:45.500> is<00:00:45.710> all<00:00:45.829> done<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.719> very<00:00:47.719> small<00:00:48.110> lake<00:00:48.559> up<00:00:48.890> in

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
this is all done a very small lake up in

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.010 
this is all done a very small lake up in
here<00:00:49.640> somewhere<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.390> then<00:00:51.199> over<00:00:51.649> in<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:53.020> over

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
here somewhere and then over in the over

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.779 
here somewhere and then over in the over
in<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.199> area<00:00:54.469> between<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.890> two<00:00:55.190> rocks<00:00:55.489> there

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
in the area between the two rocks there

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.700 
in the area between the two rocks there
on<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.239> slope<00:00:56.539> i'm<00:00:56.840> going<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.260> try<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:57.469> make<00:00:57.680> a

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
on the slope i'm going to try and make a

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.270 
on the slope i'm going to try and make a
little<00:00:57.949> village<00:00:58.280> there<00:00:59.500> and<00:01:00.500> it's<00:01:00.920> probably

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
little village there and it's probably

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.880 
little village there and it's probably
going<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.789> be<00:01:02.019> somewhere<00:01:03.019> in<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:03.260> realm<00:01:03.469> of<00:01:03.620> z

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
going to be somewhere in the realm of z

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.710 
going to be somewhere in the realm of z
scale<00:01:04.190> and<00:01:04.430> i'll<00:01:04.489> probably<00:01:04.730> handmade<00:01:05.300> most<00:01:05.570> of

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
scale and i'll probably handmade most of

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.740 
scale and i'll probably handmade most of
the<00:01:05.810> buildings<00:01:06.320> out<00:01:06.620> of<00:01:06.770> wooden<00:01:06.950> blocks<00:01:07.750> and

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
the buildings out of wooden blocks and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.810 
the buildings out of wooden blocks and
nothing<00:01:09.350> has<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.619> be<00:01:09.650> too<00:01:09.920> fancy<00:01:10.130> because<00:01:10.640> it's

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
nothing has to be too fancy because it's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.410 
nothing has to be too fancy because it's
basically<00:01:11.360> distant<00:01:12.140> scenery<00:01:13.119> i'm<00:01:14.119> going<00:01:14.330> to

and here you can see that I've ended the
plaster<00:01:25.369> cloth<00:01:25.520> there<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.329> can<00:01:26.509> actually

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
plaster cloth there and you can actually

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.390 
plaster cloth there and you can actually
see<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.560> plaster<00:01:28.100> cloth<00:01:28.250> I<00:01:30.040> put<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.159> screen

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.300 
see the plaster cloth I put the screen
wire<00:01:31.640> first<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.240> then<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.479> wit<00:01:32.920> newspaper<00:01:33.920> and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
wire first and then I wit newspaper and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.069 
wire first and then I wit newspaper and
leave<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.579> newspaper<00:01:35.030> over<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.600> screen<00:01:35.840> wire

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
what I find is that that generally keeps

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.999 
what I find is that that generally keeps
most<00:01:41.659> of<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.020> credit<00:01:42.259> from<00:01:42.560> falling<00:01:42.979> through

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
most of the credit from falling through

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.910 
most of the credit from falling through
the<00:01:43.399> screen<00:01:43.640> wire<00:01:43.880> onto<00:01:44.210> your<00:01:44.540> lower<00:01:45.049> track<00:01:45.590> i

the edge of the fascia and comes comes
down<00:02:41.000> basically<00:02:41.870> slopes<00:02:42.290> downward<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.980> this

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
down basically slopes downward to this

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.699 
down basically slopes downward to this
area<00:02:43.610> here<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.060> on<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.780> outside<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.470> this

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
area here and on the outside of this

area here and on the outside of this
curve<00:02:46.010> there<00:02:46.280> will<00:02:46.430> also<00:02:46.519> be<00:02:46.790> some<00:02:47.739> raising<00:02:48.739> of

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
curve there will also be some raising of

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.509 
curve there will also be some raising of
the<00:02:49.930> foreground<00:02:50.930> scenery<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.400> looks

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
the foreground scenery so that it looks

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.420 
the foreground scenery so that it looks
like<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.880> track<00:02:53.269> actually<00:02:53.540> was<00:02:53.870> cut<00:02:54.200> out<00:02:54.430> and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
like the track actually was cut out and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.270 
like the track actually was cut out and
it'll<00:02:56.060> slow<00:02:56.450> down<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:57.080> this<00:02:57.230> yard<00:02:57.590> area<00:02:57.830> over

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
it'll slow down to this yard area over

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.930 
it'll slow down to this yard area over
here<00:02:59.680> I'm<00:03:00.680> going<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.950> stop<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.370> for<00:03:01.550> now<00:03:01.670> and
