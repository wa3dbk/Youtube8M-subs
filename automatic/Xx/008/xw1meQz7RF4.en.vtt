really<00:01:06.000> good<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.260> change<00:01:07.560> actually

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
really good one is to change actually

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
really good one is to change actually
the<00:01:08.130> hand<00:01:08.430> ok<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.299> grips<00:01:09.900> what<00:01:10.260> we're

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the hand ok that the grips what we're

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.230 
the hand ok that the grips what we're
going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.740> I'm<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.790> put<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> towel<00:01:14.240> now

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
going to do I'm just put a towel now

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.050 
going to do I'm just put a towel now
what<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.630> does<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.380> changes<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.369> nervous

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
what that does is it changes the nervous

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.969 
what that does is it changes the nervous
system<00:01:18.420> completely<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:19.680> doing

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
system completely from what I was doing

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.980 
system completely from what I was doing
with<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> bar<00:01:20.400> completely<00:01:21.119> changes<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.600> nerves

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
with a bar completely changes the nerves

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.039 
with a bar completely changes the nerves
that<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.650> involved<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.310> holding<00:01:24.150> joint

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that are involved in holding joint

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.020 
that are involved in holding joint
stabilization<00:01:25.860> shoulder<00:01:26.220> stabilization<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
stabilization shoulder stabilization so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.640 
stabilization shoulder stabilization so
now<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> completely<00:01:27.689> different<00:01:27.990> moves<00:01:28.350> so

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
now it's a completely different moves so

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.319 
now it's a completely different moves so
I<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> same<00:01:29.400> thing<00:01:31.759> go<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> line<00:01:33.119> them

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
I just do the same thing go to line them

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.080 
I just do the same thing go to line them
up<00:01:33.630> free<00:01:34.290> standing<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:35.009> no<00:01:35.430> dropping<00:01:35.880> back

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
instead of up so really really simple

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.830 
instead of up so really really simple
always<00:01:43.140> change<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.890> variables<00:01:44.759> okay<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
always change the variables okay the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.319 
always change the variables okay the
next<00:01:46.049> thing<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.220> add<00:01:47.790> some

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
next thing that you can do is add some

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480 
next thing that you can do is add some
instability<00:01:48.899> we're<00:01:49.380> surfers<00:01:49.829> rent

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
instability we're surfers rent
