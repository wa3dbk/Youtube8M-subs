00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.340
 passions by dostoevsky more precisely 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.920
 on the new metro station 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.240
 Dostoevskaya which will be open on May 15 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 users have seriously alarmed her 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.890
 they usually decorate the mosaic 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.529
 stations depict gloomy sons 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.540
 works of a great writer 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.619
 some psychologists say 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.320
 claim that the station can 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.240
 attract if the health of all kaida and 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.000
 caused heavy thoughts usually 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.099
 passengers 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429
 we have a studio psychologist natalya semenova media 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.239
 we will discuss this news tass natalia 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.710
 Metlin Passion-bearers 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.250
 well pictures 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.100
 really enough 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.560
 frighteningly 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.640
 black white light 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.410
 crime value 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.360
 how much do you really it 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.320
 may affect passengers sleep 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.510
 yes it certainly can affect us 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.780
 I would like to speak different aspects 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.430
 subway passengers person this 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490
 they are the object of impact 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.670
 negative silage benzema action 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.410
 enters 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.340
 but interacting with this picture 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.960
 and what we have on the other side of the scale 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.380
 emphasize Dostoevsky 12 minutes 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.210
 this is a school program 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.700
 film adaptation of the cultural clichÃ© 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.340
 Russia Dostoevsky 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.039
 and other things that is associations which 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.240
 his average will be born 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.100
 man the most different school and not seduces and 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.200
 Dostoevsky 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.580
 not so i imagined heroes and then 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.780
 that is, people are very happy we are definitely on 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.810
 certain categories of people 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.759
 snow and internal readiness to leave 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.049
 peasants warehouse this will render 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.049
 certain influences anna ambiguous 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.270
 But in general, that is, take it into account when 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.390
 construction 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.120
 the station this topic is a trial 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.000
 many people 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.570
 factor unfortunately very little 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.320
 opinion of the psychologist is taken into account 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.229
 score when creating commercials there 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.020
 instances three members 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.870
 In this sense 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.930
 obviously not enough as you are right especially 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.520
 in the subway because the subway itself is not 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.130
 about what 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.060
 let's say always a report that with 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.119
 empty with human losses audi hard in 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.390
 anyway how much i know even that way 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.890
 in terms of stressful convening the subway even 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.080
 if we abstract from 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.580
 latest terrorist 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.229
 acts 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.260
 always we change environmental say 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.599
 in some sense represents 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.939
 I am not interested in flame stress 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.499
 closed space 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.259
 below ground level there is no visual support 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.169
 I would like other people 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.999
 further rush hour they and 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.789
 but such moments 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:32.329
 and so here it all does not depend here 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.299
 country and other things some people with 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.859
 certain features they 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:36.759
 just can't 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.749
 physical start-up aas in the subway and on it 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:40.989
 uncomfortable someone afraid of heights someone 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.159
 afraid of the outback 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.279
 and in this sense these pictures of course 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.129
 will listen extra 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.559
 a factor 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.419
 but they are fast stability 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.339
 during the press conference and in general 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.689
 should be what the zenith school stations 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.459
 underground 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.379
 well it is not from technological 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.460
 here the psychologist's assessment is only a part 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.470
 now let's say if you can not identified 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.049
 expert advice here 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.349
 as a representative of the expert council 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.159
 still must be so friendly 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.139
 the environment around the world is held very much 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.079
 great conference calls semejkin 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.169
 networks next we will make cities 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.879
 habitable from the city and not going 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.239
 call them 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.639
 in which force 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.379
 suitable for life where you will not lose yourself 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.019
 I feel very comfortable here is something 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.069
 there is such a Russian word 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.789
 namolennoe something 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:31.849
 they are with the city of colombia contributing 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.869
 discomfort it does not depend on 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.599
 dirty city from living standards here to 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.339
 Unfortunately rarely really exist 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:41.760
 unpleasantly Moscow Tver 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.659
 unfortunately moscow st 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.290
 included in the list of cities is not suitable 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.409
 expects and non-ferrous metals yes me 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.799
 completely fit on pushes 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.749
 Moscow Wednesday Roman on the ground 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:54.409
 Vancouver city location 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.709
 Dvorkovich bank there 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.860
 is it fit not fit 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.269
 our opponents of the year he added 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.260
 I do not know exactly the statistics we recall 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.779
 stayed below 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.779
 add to the list of unfit for life 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.789
 since all the same to be all such design 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:12.720
 meter 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.190
 here right now we see the release is considered to be with us 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.470
 man who are preparing 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.889
 suicide is 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.769
 as it is necessary to change only the fact that the bucket 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.460
 treatment board 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.270
 builders there 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.610
 may be decided will be decided in 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.000
 other instances but what can be said in 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.389
 as psychological 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.169
 ratings 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.610
 as I said man is a certain 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.199
 the subject he interacts with 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.889
 the world and man has a choice 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.719
 if someone is extremely unpleasant 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:42.180
 touching this bill can make 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.469
 the choice 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.539
 take advantage of another metro station 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.529
 a little earlier way to walk to 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.079
 acceptable metro station and then they then 

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:52.279
 there is always the right to choose 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.239
 not on under such a feasible object under 

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:55.529
 Smolensk with a negative 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.619
 more often than not 

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:59.940
 human have a choice of defense mechanisms 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.030
 there are those different things that are on us 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.330
 affects again I will not call them 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.270
 the names of all on the lips but as we 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.590
 jumped out of this counteract 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.449
 to this we reduce our way 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.270
 ata mekena what about those who 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.930
 really suicidal 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.120
 this station will not attract them like that 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.289
 ships 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.490
 so there is such a special topic 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.870
 such a direction 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.719
 psychiatry and 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.419
 forensic psychiatry suicidology 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.729
 her suicidal behavior 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.300
 man in this direction in terms of 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.909
 making yourself life is very difficult 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:35.699
 phenomenon 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.249
 is there a classification statistics 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:39.719
 interest and 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:41.409
 let's say the greatest 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.089
 as a percentage of the number of 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.659
 incidents this is just these people on say 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.379
 there is no longer that dostoevsky 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:49.689
 of this symbolism 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:51.069
 interest one 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.409
 those cases when life threatening 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.960
 diseases severe death of a loved one or 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.960
 others are such experiences above 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.979
 wishing and living people 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.710
 And to me, a small percentage of Kiev is so 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.169
 demonstrative suicide teenage 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.960
 this in prince and prevent 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.599
 should be withdrawn and school psychologists 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.059
 parents then not 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:12.869
 these cases are here congress murder 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:15.809
 as a demonstration not yet ready to lead i am not 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.400
 bind take symbolism beautiful 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.949
 but this is a small percentage here 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.080
 some kind of preventive measures are possible 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.520
 against Russian ballerina 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.819
 yes to people around this kind 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:29.520
 because they can be noticed 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.020
 prompts thoughts behaves 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.949
 corresponding that is necessary here 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:34.669
 batumi poland spend money on 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.610
 preventing such things 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.759
 Dostoev's predator is listening to him 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.389
 what does dostoevsky do with it 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.650
 sales for people inclined us there 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.840
 such people are called constitutional 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.159
 depression is not born such match 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:49.999
 Austria, Dostoevsky, Denmark 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:52.949
 will be as part of the picture of the world all so 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.909
 bad everything is sad it will be some 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:56.149
 aesthetization of their experiences 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:59.079
 reflections and if there is aesthetics 

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:00.120
 reflections only 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.599
 less power remains 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.699
 action itself and millet and here 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.639
 Well, help me at the metro stations any 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.560
 case not worth it
