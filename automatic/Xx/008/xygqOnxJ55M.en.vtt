pretty much bare naked right during the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.330 
pretty much bare naked right during the
scales<00:01:18.050> and<00:01:18.380> he<00:01:18.500> still<00:01:18.770> didn't<00:01:19.040> make<00:01:19.130> weight

he weighed in 144 point2 and yeah and he

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.550 
he weighed in 144 point2 and yeah and he
has<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.250> lose<00:01:25.700> those<00:01:26.030> point<00:01:26.450> two<00:01:26.690> pounds<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:27.440> I

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
has to lose those point two pounds and I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.860 
has to lose those point two pounds and I
think<00:01:27.740> in<00:01:27.830> two<00:01:28.010> hours<00:01:28.340> which<00:01:29.150> shouldn't<00:01:29.660> be<00:01:29.750> a

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
think in two hours which shouldn't be a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.390 
think in two hours which shouldn't be a
problem<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:30.440> should<00:01:30.470> just<00:01:30.650> go<00:01:31.070> out<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.160> have

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
problem you should just go out and have

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.790 
problem you should just go out and have
a<00:01:31.490> drag<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:32.030> jog<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:33.200> know<00:01:33.290> sweat<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.680> off

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
a drag a jog and you know sweat it off

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.080 
a drag a jog and you know sweat it off
and<00:01:34.040> then<00:01:34.160> I<00:01:34.280> think<00:01:34.460> he<00:01:34.520> should<00:01:34.670> make<00:01:34.820> weight

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
and then I think he should make weight

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.399 
and then I think he should make weight
by<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.360> time<00:01:35.690> before<00:01:36.620> you<00:01:37.400> know<00:01:37.490> before<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
by the time before you know before the

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.370 
by the time before you know before the
before<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.680> two-hour<00:01:39.980> limit<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.670> finished

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
before the two-hour limit is finished

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.160 
before the two-hour limit is finished
and<00:01:42.380> um<00:01:42.860> yeah<00:01:43.490> Pacquiao<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.060> looking<00:01:44.750> linear

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
and um yeah Pacquiao is looking linear

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.910 
and um yeah Pacquiao is looking linear
done<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.159> usual<00:01:46.630> he<00:01:47.630> looks<00:01:47.840> much<00:01:48.470> better<00:01:48.740> in

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
done the usual he looks much better in

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.670 
done the usual he looks much better in
my<00:01:49.159> opinion<00:01:49.210> comparison<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.360> let's<00:01:50.600> say<00:01:50.750> last

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
my opinion comparison to let's say last

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.420 
my opinion comparison to let's say last
couple<00:01:52.040> fights<00:01:52.420> at<00:01:53.420> least<00:01:53.600> I<00:01:53.720> think<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.430> Chris

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
couple fights at least I think so Chris

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.170 
couple fights at least I think so Chris
Algieri<00:01:56.350> it's<00:01:57.350> definitely<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.010> best<00:01:58.970> shape

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
Algieri it's definitely the best shape

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.960 
Algieri it's definitely the best shape
I've<00:01:59.390> seen<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.870> Chris<00:02:00.140> Algieri<00:02:00.820> for<00:02:01.820> this

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
I've seen of a Chris Algieri for this

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.240 
I've seen of a Chris Algieri for this
