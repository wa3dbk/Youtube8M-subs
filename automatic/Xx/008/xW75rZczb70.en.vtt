00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello everyone here I am with another video 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.509
 new after this stop cilla the end 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.370
 of the week and good I bring a video in the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.679
 that I teach you how not to start a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.969
 fight it because I've done I've done a 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.670
 very fat fault at the beginning that now 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.080
 I will comment but well we went to 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.590
 comment first the team like 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.930
 we always do 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.290
 well we see that apart from his three 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.900
 pokemon wore unions of crowe and 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.610
 a wi dance so nothing I have put 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.189
 first six or especially thinking about 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.869
 wild because I was pretty scared like that 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.940
 that put first notices by putting 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.910
 fist is worth more than anything that is a bit 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.790
 very fast and I wanted to make sure to attack myself 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.489
 before and good then steam 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.860
 thinking a lot about that spirit about 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.000
 all because they are two pokemon of the walls 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.100
 that I am called a bit with 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.260
 defensive and good for putting up a little 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.149
 and also if a cure was needed 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.530
 team member and good actually 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.739
 also because it suited me against 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.680
 so much with work a boom like that 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.110
 crocco line and good third hollow as 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.100
 I always do dragon there is 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.430
 truth is that in this combat less 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.290
 I thought I was about to get aguiar 2 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.960
 also for to make neon with 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.550
 waterfall both together as well as a 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.990
 crocodile really good with a 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.159
 I could also have hit him with 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.319
 three votes 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.350
 and good also that monster covered him 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:21.640
 with fang and ice but good seen 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.530
 just before deciding and seen that 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.780
 crocodile and intimidation done good 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.179
 I could have come down a bit to the attack 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.819
 so good I prefer and it puts porta 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.189
 sing special than by physical attack as well 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.299
 that everything is why it's the end and good 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.929
 we see that at the beginning of combat 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.939
 start with spirit and x when you 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.799
 has loaded as he commented would have to 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.810
 have changed directly to vapors 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.810
 ok but good instead of changing and 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.069
 opted to make a round trip and clear 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.599
 the truth is that the rival was going to be more 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.789
 fast because 6 hours a little bit 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:54.700
 slow and good we see that it hits us 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.679
 would stand more naturally is the bull 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.550
 ok because the python can not learn 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.250
 the flames 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.350
 so nothing here good seeing that 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.850
 like combat goal and dragon tried 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.310
 hold as much as possible 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.470
 attacking with pulse a verve over everything 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.360
 for trying to push back ground 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.860
 most times do try a 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.819
 first kick and I'm going to hit it hard 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.810
 with with dragon contest pulse so 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.010
 good like this that has changed to 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.590
 spirit although this one is the good 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.360
 l removed roughly half of the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.610
 bar so good was a dragon pulse 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.310
 that does a little more damage than pulse 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.770
 a shine and well I just finished it now 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.840
 it's like putting 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.970
 to the dance group that here did not have very 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.380
 clear if they changed they evaporate for one 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.600
 thought that I would not have any 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.830
 attack so I could do a lot 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.120
 hurt 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.680
 so I opted to have something their 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.930
 budget that I not only expected as 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.480
 as it happens with the majority I have 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.310
 surprised with demolition but 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.720
 is not good either you have me 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.550
 removed a barbarity of life more or 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.920
 minus one third of the bar 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.770
 practically so good I have it 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.940
 hard with his I knock him down again 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.250
 taken off with a focus band or something like that 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.110
 that would have resisted a blow but 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.960
 Well, come on, it's nothing and now 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.020
 how it takes out 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.940
 to do bar and good then here as 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.060
 I have always put to paste with composed 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.990
 a verve trying to make them go back and 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.790
 we see that he has hit me with 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.770
 flamethrower I do not know if with the intention of 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.150
 burn me if you have planned a change the 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.890
 I do not know, but it has 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.690
 surprised quite expected of 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.000
 hit with the truth is that I have not 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.980
 found meaning because good though 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.140
 I would have tried to burn myself 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.670
 special attacker I guess that what 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.569
 only in what I would be thinking is one 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.939
 where the art of life 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.049
 but good, well, maybe it has 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.370
 killing finished and I thought that 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.959
 it would be a little faster but good to 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.609
 at this point I have decided not to change 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.709
 pokemon not being a bit safe because 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.200
 I stayed by Jon and he does not have a 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.459
 attack without strong that can hurt me 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.870
 He has come back to me with grass here 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.849
 also surprising me but good to 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.790
 be 2% a bit like that is not that I thought 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.200
 a lot and has very good life was 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.329
 quiet even if I had that blow 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.370
 I knew I was going to put up with it well and here 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.319
 good was stuck with scalding and I've 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.829
 finished taking it 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.209
 so good especially predicting that 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.939
 sector or arc you have to be very careful 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.450
 with our equipment and not play 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.980
 never know the attacks that usually good 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.729
 who can learn your home that usually 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.769
 carry and we will try to of 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.940
 always surprise us so good 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.009
 I should have changed directly 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.759
 to support but good if we have 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.710
 managed to save the fight and nothing 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.210
 I hope you liked it as always 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.550
 although this combat has been a bit of a 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.400
 little bland in my opinion but good to see 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.380
 if the next one I bring is a little more 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.090
 animated and have some more surprises as well 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.479
 that nothing a greeting and until the next 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.479
 video
