entire<00:06:29.390> screen<00:06:30.580> so<00:06:31.580> it<00:06:31.700> does<00:06:31.850> if<00:06:32.030> the<00:06:32.060> black

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
entire screen so it does if the black

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.150 
entire screen so it does if the black
one<00:06:32.419> does<00:06:32.570> look<00:06:32.600> a<00:06:32.810> lot<00:06:32.930> nicer<00:06:33.050> I<00:06:33.470> mean<00:06:33.919> let's

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
one does look a lot nicer I mean let's

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:48.450 
one does look a lot nicer I mean let's
check<00:06:34.370> it<00:06:34.490> out<00:06:34.610> from<00:06:34.729> the<00:06:34.820> sides

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.180 

I<00:06:48.520> think<00:06:48.759> the<00:06:48.819> sides<00:06:49.060> is<00:06:49.600> silver<00:06:49.990> one<00:06:50.190> looks

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190
