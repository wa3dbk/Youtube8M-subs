00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.220
 you all you have to do 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.320
 If you want to delete it is to click 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.880
 this option to eliminate and give 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.460
 Apply 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.180
 will open another small window that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.340
 you will find the progress of how it is 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.250
 working the program and it will disappear from 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.250
 background a blue screen do not worry 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.520
 which part of the same application and me 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.860
 it took me about a minute and a half 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.229
 in finishing the operation then it appears 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.420
 another window in which he says they have 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.789
 that restart the computer or what 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.530
 otherwise it will close the application closes 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.240
 all the windows of the application and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.459
 manually restart the computer 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.950
 when it is turned on again you will see that 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.319
 they do not have the watermark anymore in the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.649
 windows 8 desktop then if they want 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:13.019
 reset it will have to go back to 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.680
 open the escrow to the application take out the 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:19.319
 tilde and put restore ok but good not 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.630
 I think they want to have her in her 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.270
 computer since it is quite annoying 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.270
