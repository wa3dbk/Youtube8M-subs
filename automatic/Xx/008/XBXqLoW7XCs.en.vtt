00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Good Eveniiing 

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.940
Today, I SPEAK... about my april's favorites

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.720
First, the deep repair mask from Macadamia

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.200
Why I like it? I'll tell you!

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.460
It's super efficient, texture is very nice and smell ...

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.980
Then I loved the Daily Dose Foaming Cleanser from Sampar

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.920
it's doesn't sting the eyes

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.150
(French joke)

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.940
it smells grass, but it's very pleasant to use

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.180
Next, the "Smooth'n shine" line of Schwarzkopf

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.540
Schwar Schw ... Anyway ... you understand!

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.010
This is the new line for afro hair, but as I have thick hair and scorched by bleaching, it suits me very well

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.860
the efficiency is there, smell too and what I love very much is the size !

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.189
look at those monsters !

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.900
let's get serious... food !

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.684
This is a pink smoothie from Innocent

00:00:49.684 --> 00:00:51.229
with apple, pear and beet

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.889
it's scary at first but it's really delicious !

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:55.336
I show you, cause it's so cute 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.100
Look at this ! 

00:00:59.598 --> 00:01:01.598
Next, the new bun they sell at Carrefour

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.000
it's ultra gourmet buns

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.640
it's different from Harry's products for example

00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:11.538
those there are really super good, super sweet

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.858
super big, super FAT ! 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.480
oh! it's very dry it alone!

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.420
and to finish

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.975
already, I will talk about game of thrones

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.420
obliged, the new episodes are released, they are really cool

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.280
(whatsoever)

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.460
then, I talk about Avengers,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.320
ticket was very very expensive cause of IMAX technology

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.720
but sincerely, this is a very good movie !

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.449
go watch it, it's really really cool !

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:39.589
and finally, I'll talk about the "one second everyday" app

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:41.302
I use it since February

00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:43.063
every day I film one second of my life

00:01:43.063 --> 00:01:44.513
