 by specimens which is the best material for pens markers 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.790
 they have material for watercolors, for example a hard cardboard and 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.860
 which is the best material for for example pastel colors the tracks or 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.429
 the charcoal 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.429
 you know, I'll give you a visual clue 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.640
 what is this 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.310
 paperboard 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.330
 so they locate a piece of cardboard like this one that I have here because that 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.480
 ideal surface for it jal with chalk with pastel colors or with charcoal 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.070
 mirror and talking about chalk I think I have here a prepared one that is 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.050
 saying both of them paint draw us peÃ±a bouquets go 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.890
 and now it may be that not so 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 kempes art attack sport boys 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.010
 as you see we will start with white chalk 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 to see if you know what I'm drawing 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.830
 you see how it works to fabulate on cardboard 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.390
 we have already seen that white chalk relates very well to cardboard 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.050
 there but what about 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.600
 pastel colors and charcoal 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.400
 health equally good 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.760
 I want mycenter 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.270
 cricket and who started drawing but will not wait for both payments 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.270
 yes it happened to you 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.540
 the Salesians 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.820
 as you see the charcoal works wonders on the captor 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.940
 now here 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940
 a little green 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.780
 and look how the pastels and adapting and the texture of the cardboard 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.240
 you guessed it already 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 a little bit of red to end 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.650
 and orange 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.370
 but now I'm sure you already know it 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.789
 and to finish a little more red asks black 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.739
 brieva view that the tita the charcoals pastel colors takes 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.830
 very well with the piece of cardboard hey but you think they shuffled site to a 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.349
 sidewalk 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.529
 your moment come to draw we go bad there is nothing 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.079
 the figures that look great with ethics and green cakes 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.260
 the corner is a neutral color perfect for lighter shades and 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.259
 also for the darker ones 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.159
 finally both branches a little with the finger 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.159
 and it seems that the bicycles are and the road 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.189
 well I think we have now that the cardboard osma surface 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.649
 that can be used to use or many materials and yes no 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:38.069
 maybe ferreras pastel colors and up to 'ccc' valley arponcillos and if you want 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.349
 have what you can do is paint the cardboard of a color as done since and 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.169
 then on drawings with the same materials 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.739
 now it's your turn and we're still here in art attack
