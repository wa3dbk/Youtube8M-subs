why<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.030> we<00:00:30.180> need<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.449> better<00:00:30.630> understand<00:00:31.289> a

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
why do we need to better understand a

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.479 
why do we need to better understand a
GES<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.430> exactly<00:00:32.940> are<00:00:32.969> they<00:00:34.219> well<00:00:35.219> we

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
GES and what exactly are they well we

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.010 
GES and what exactly are they well we
need<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> understand<00:00:36.180> how<00:00:36.270> they<00:00:36.420> work<00:00:36.449> because

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
need to understand how they work because

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.319 
need to understand how they work because
eating<00:00:37.350> behavior<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.700> affect<00:00:39.060> our

short term for advanced location end
products<00:00:45.630> these<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.140> compounds<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.800> can

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
products these are compounds that can

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.979 
products these are compounds that can
accelerate<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.610> aging<00:00:47.640> process<00:00:48.120> there<00:00:48.930> are

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
accelerate the aging process there are

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.090 
accelerate the aging process there are
types<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.470> many<00:00:49.620> different<00:00:49.950> health

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
types of so many different health

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490 
types of so many different health
concerns<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.730> Americans<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.210> today<00:00:51.690> so

concerns that Americans have today so
where<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:53.130> afford<00:00:53.640> them<00:00:53.760> from

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
where do you actually afford them from

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.930 
where do you actually afford them from
where<00:00:54.300> where<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:54.809> find<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> they're

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
where where do we find them so they're

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.270 
where where do we find them so they're
actually<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.450> two<00:00:57.899> different<00:00:58.079> places<00:00:58.290> we<00:00:59.160> can

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
actually in two different places we can

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.040 
actually in two different places we can
form<00:00:59.550> them<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.820> our<00:00:59.940> bodies<00:01:00.050> naturally

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
form them in our bodies naturally

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
form them in our bodies naturally
through<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> normal<00:01:02.100> aging<00:01:02.430> process<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.120> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
through the normal aging process this is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.569 
through the normal aging process this is
a<00:01:03.239> normal<00:01:03.540> thing<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:04.979> actually<00:01:05.369> eat

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
a normal thing or we can actually eat

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.550 
a normal thing or we can actually eat
them<00:01:05.820> through<00:01:06.060> foods<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.780> certain<00:01:07.229> foods

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
them through foods because certain foods

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.520 
them through foods because certain foods
contain<00:01:08.100> high<00:01:08.579> amounts<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.270> tes<00:01:09.630> sûr<00:01:10.229> fried

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
contain high amounts of a tes sûr fried

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.399 
contain high amounts of a tes sûr fried
foods<00:01:11.040> sugary<00:01:11.850> foods<00:01:12.150> processed<00:01:12.420> foods<00:01:12.930> foods

that<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.740> brown<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.310> high<00:01:14.520> heat<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.360> for

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that are brown to high heat so for

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.890 
that are brown to high heat so for
example<00:01:15.780> creme<00:01:16.770> brulee<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.369> bacon<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.540> what

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
example creme brulee or bacon now what

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.390 
example creme brulee or bacon now what
ends<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:19.170> happening<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.010> eat<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.190> lot

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
ends up happening is when we eat a lot

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.310 
ends up happening is when we eat a lot
of<00:01:20.430> these<00:01:20.580> foods<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.600> accumulating<00:01:22.140> our

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
of these foods the accumulating our

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.920 
of these foods the accumulating our
bodies<00:01:22.680> enter<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> tissues<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.000> over<00:01:24.659> time

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
bodies enter the tissues and over time

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.020 
bodies enter the tissues and over time
it<00:01:25.290> accelerates<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> aging<00:01:26.130> process<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.970> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it accelerates the aging process and it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.660 
it accelerates the aging process and it
ages<00:01:27.390> us<00:01:27.540> from<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> inside<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.280> ok<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.340> what

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
ages us from the inside out ok so what

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.980 
ages us from the inside out ok so what
tips<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.299> people<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.780> manage

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
tips do you have for people to manage

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.820 
tips do you have for people to manage
ag's<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.630> three<00:01:33.990> tips<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
ag's so I have three tips for you so the

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.240 
ag's so I have three tips for you so the
first<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.549> look<00:01:35.939> slow<00:01:36.509> slow<00:01:36.900> heat<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.770> cooking

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
first is look slow slow heat so cooking

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.219 
first is look slow slow heat so cooking
with<00:01:38.460> low<00:01:38.759> slow<00:01:39.119> heat<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.720> actually<00:01:40.080> reduce

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
with low slow heat can actually reduce

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.530 
with low slow heat can actually reduce
the<00:01:40.680> amount<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.250> GS<00:01:41.490> by<00:01:41.670> almost<00:01:42.000> seventy

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the amount of a GS by almost seventy

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.960 
the amount of a GS by almost seventy
percent<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.830> example<00:01:43.860> using<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.640> slow

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
percent so for example using a slow

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.990 
percent so for example using a slow
cooker<00:01:45.360> or<00:01:45.390> crock-pot<00:01:46.159> can<00:01:47.159> actually<00:01:47.670> reduce

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
cooker or crock-pot can actually reduce

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.020 
cooker or crock-pot can actually reduce
it<00:01:48.420> by<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.630> large<00:01:49.229> amount<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> second<00:01:50.759> tip<00:01:50.909> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
it by a large amount now a second tip I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.319 
it by a large amount now a second tip I
have<00:01:51.060> use<00:01:51.420> lemon<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.170> water<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.270> marinating<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
have use lemon and water so marinating a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.530 
have use lemon and water so marinating a
meat-like<00:01:54.900> with<00:01:55.829> lemon<00:01:56.159> juice<00:01:56.400> lime<00:01:56.820> juice<00:01:56.880> or

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
meat-like with lemon juice lime juice or

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
aging disaster so to anti ages dish

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.939 
aging disaster so to anti ages dish
we've<00:03:37.209> tossed<00:03:37.479> it<00:03:37.659> into<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.959> crock-pot<00:03:38.409> and
