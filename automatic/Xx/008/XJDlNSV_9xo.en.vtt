00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:53.920 
480g for 80 plus 150 for 80 plus 150 ok
so<00:02:48.109> 40<00:02:49.109> plus<00:02:49.769> 150<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.980> look<00:02:53.459> at<00:02:53.609> this

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
so 40 plus 150 is so you look at this

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.819 
so 40 plus 150 is so you look at this
480<00:02:54.930> add<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:56.099> one<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.609> 45<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:58.079> then<00:02:58.500> you

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
480 add that one to the 45 and then you

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.830 
480 add that one to the 45 and then you
add<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.280> plus<00:02:59.639> 5<00:03:00.829> 15<00:03:01.829> so<00:03:02.489> that<00:03:02.939> equals<00:03:03.209> 13

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
add the a plus 5 15 so that equals 13

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.710 
add the a plus 5 15 so that equals 13
and<00:03:04.669> that<00:03:05.669> would<00:03:05.819> equal<00:03:06.409> 538<00:03:07.409> so<00:03:08.220> his<00:03:08.939> te<00:03:09.269> only

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and that would equal 538 so his te only

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.879 
and that would equal 538 so his te only
has<00:03:09.870> 4<00:03:10.169> 80<00:03:10.409> G's<00:03:10.799> were<00:03:10.980> here<00:03:11.280> he<00:03:11.970> has<00:03:12.269> 530<00:03:13.230> each

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
has 4 80 G's were here he has 530 each

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.339 
has 4 80 G's were here he has 530 each
the<00:03:14.400> youngest<00:03:14.819> player<00:03:15.030> goes<00:03:15.239> first<00:03:15.599> right<00:03:15.930> so

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
the youngest player goes first right so

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.039 
the youngest player goes first right so
the<00:03:17.040> person<00:03:17.280> was<00:03:17.639> this<00:03:17.909> first<00:03:18.569> for<00:03:18.930> his

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
the person was this first for his
