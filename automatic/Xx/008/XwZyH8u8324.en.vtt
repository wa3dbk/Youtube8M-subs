initiative<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:15.770> we're<00:02:16.010> going<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.220> do<00:02:16.340> anyway

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
initiative but we're going to do anyway

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.660 
initiative but we're going to do anyway
because<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.930> absences<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.650> both<00:02:19.280> teams

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
because of the absences of both teams

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.980 
because of the absences of both teams
basically<00:02:20.360> it's<00:02:20.480> just<00:02:20.510> going<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.750> be<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:22.990> most

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
basically it's just going to be a most

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.380 
basically it's just going to be a most
of<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.170> absences<00:02:24.530> are<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.739> defensive<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.520> in

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
of the absences are I defensive so in

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.390 
of the absences are I defensive so in
the<00:02:26.510> case<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.690> her<00:02:26.989> by<00:02:27.200> immunity<00:02:27.680> replace<00:02:28.040> that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the case of her by immunity replace that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.500 
the case of her by immunity replace that
with<00:02:29.060> what<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.959> very<00:02:30.560> offensive<00:02:30.950> team

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
with what it is a very offensive team

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.229 
with what it is a very offensive team

mullah and Mario Gomez affront very

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.490 
mullah and Mario Gomez affront very
offensive<00:02:49.640> very<00:02:50.030> impressible<00:02:50.600> but<00:02:51.200> very

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
offensive very impressible but very

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.930 
offensive very impressible but very
offensive<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:54.260> just<00:02:54.950> wonder<00:02:55.190> how<00:02:55.220> they're

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
offensive so I just wonder how they're

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.610 
offensive so I just wonder how they're
going<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.120> manage<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.690> context<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.410> fair

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
going to manage the context of fair

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.070 
going to manage the context of fair
Chelsea<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.220> think<00:02:58.820> job<00:02:59.000> Bob<00:02:59.150> Willis<00:02:59.330> tired<00:02:59.630> but

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
Chelsea I think job Bob Willis tired but

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.630 
Chelsea I think job Bob Willis tired but
Torres<00:03:00.410> will<00:03:00.530> take<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.739> big<00:03:00.980> part<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.549> the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
Torres will take a big part of it in the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.620 
Torres will take a big part of it in the
second<00:03:01.940> half<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:03.680> saw<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.400> hint<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.420> what

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
second half and you saw a hint of what

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.750 
second half and you saw a hint of what
he<00:03:05.780> may<00:03:05.959> happen<00:03:06.230> in<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.680> cup<00:03:06.860> final<00:03:07.220> when

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
he may happen in the cup final when

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.360 
he may happen in the cup final when

Bushido man destroyed by minute 52 he
was<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.760> result<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:11.690> was<00:03:11.780> down<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.959> the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
was the result and it was down to the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.720 
was the result and it was down to the
pressure<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:12.470> busia<00:03:13.100> Thurman<00:03:13.400> were<00:03:13.519> put

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
pressure that busia Thurman were put

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.090 
pressure that busia Thurman were put
into<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.120> by<00:03:14.420> many<00:03:14.630> players<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.350> for

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
into the by many players and for

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.380 
into the by many players and for
covering<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.430> ball<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.790> come<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:17.150> attack

covering the ball and come to attack

covering the ball and come to attack
into<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.810> spaces<00:03:18.049> they<00:03:18.260> were<00:03:18.380> left<00:03:18.560> behind

into the spaces they were left behind

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.780 
into the spaces they were left behind
the<00:03:19.489> defenders<00:03:20.000> now<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:21.340> don't<00:03:22.340> think<00:03:22.549> that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
the defenders now I don't think that

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.310 
the defenders now I don't think that
kind<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:23.000> pressure<00:03:23.180> would<00:03:23.390> be<00:03:23.570> applied<00:03:24.110> by

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
kind of pressure would be applied by

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.910 
kind of pressure would be applied by
Chelsea<00:03:24.709> or<00:03:24.860> won't<00:03:25.100> be<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.489> what<00:03:26.590> our<00:03:27.590> friendly

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920

Chelsea or won't be in what our friendly

themselves<00:03:34.340> quite<00:03:35.120> high<00:03:35.390> up<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.690> pitch<00:03:35.720> but

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
themselves quite high up the pitch but

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.670 
themselves quite high up the pitch but
still<00:03:38.060> will<00:03:38.239> be<00:03:38.329> chances<00:03:38.690> for<00:03:38.840> concert<00:03:39.170> axon

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
still will be chances for concert axon

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.190 
still will be chances for concert axon
and<00:03:39.890> even<00:03:40.850> though<00:03:41.000> I'm<00:03:41.299> saying<00:03:41.540> by<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> minute

and even though I'm saying by a minute

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.720 
and even though I'm saying by a minute
we'll<00:03:42.290> have<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.530> initiative<00:03:42.739> I<00:03:43.190> think<00:03:43.640> it's

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
we'll have the initiative I think it's

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.160 
we'll have the initiative I think it's
something<00:03:43.880> that<00:03:44.209> shocks<00:03:44.630> are<00:03:44.780> getting<00:03:44.989> used

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
something that shocks are getting used

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.520 
something that shocks are getting used
to<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:46.040> fact<00:03:46.190> Benfica<00:03:46.730> did<00:03:46.880> exactly<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.360> same

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
to the fact Benfica did exactly the same

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.809 
to the fact Benfica did exactly the same
that<00:03:48.530> after<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:49.280> did<00:03:49.459> exactly<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.970> same

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
that after I did exactly the same

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.530 
that after I did exactly the same
and<00:03:50.999> they<00:03:51.390> qualified<00:03:51.829> so<00:03:53.120> close<00:03:54.120> encounter

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
and they qualified so close encounter

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.199 
and they qualified so close encounter
when<00:03:55.139> one<00:03:55.920> word<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.579> think<00:03:56.639> it's<00:03:56.999> going<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.150> be

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
when one word I think it's going to be

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.770 
when one word I think it's going to be
goals<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.749> both<00:03:57.989> ends<00:03:58.499> and<00:03:59.510> I've<00:04:00.510> got

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
goals in both ends and I've got

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.020 
goals in both ends and I've got
impression<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.530> he<00:04:02.219> will<00:04:02.370> all<00:04:02.519> depend<00:04:02.730> on

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
impression that he will all depend on

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.020 
impression that he will all depend on
how<00:04:03.329> Chelsea<00:04:04.230> handles<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.189> pressure<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.969> the

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
how Chelsea handles the pressure of the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.670 
how Chelsea handles the pressure of the
last<00:04:06.269> 10-15<00:04:06.569> minutes<00:04:07.019> of<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.200> game<00:04:07.230> when<00:04:07.560> it

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
last 10-15 minutes of the game when it

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.459 
last 10-15 minutes of the game when it
probably<00:04:08.010> would<00:04:08.189> still<00:04:08.400> be<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.730> draw<00:04:09.319> you<00:04:10.319> would

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:10.469 
probably would still be a draw you would

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.869 
probably would still be a draw you would
think<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.769> bio<00:04:10.920> mini<00:04:11.129> will<00:04:11.340> have<00:04:11.459> chances

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879

little touch of a look they may end up
winning<00:04:16.349> it<00:04:16.530> but<00:04:17.039> if<00:04:17.340> they<00:04:17.579> do<00:04:17.639> and<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.329> would

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
winning it but if they do and it would

the<00:04:20.880> impression<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.590> Chelsea<00:04:22.590> deserve<00:04:22.919> more

the impression that Chelsea deserve more
I<00:04:23.430> think<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.270> could<00:04:24.509> be<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.780> kind<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:25.050> game

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
I think it could be that kind of game

I think it could be that kind of game
where<00:04:25.919> Chelsea<00:04:26.250> walls<00:04:26.550> or<00:04:26.820> have<00:04:26.940> chances<00:04:27.300> with
