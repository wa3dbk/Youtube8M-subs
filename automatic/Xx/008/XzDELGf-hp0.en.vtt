00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
contrary to what I said in the previous

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.550 
contrary to what I said in the previous
video<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.510> want<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.840> look<00:00:03.899> at<00:00:04.049> one<00:00:04.319> more<00:00:04.500> thing

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
video I want to look at one more thing

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.309 
video I want to look at one more thing
in<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.130> chapter<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.540> smoothing

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
in this chapter and that is smoothing

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.770 
in this chapter and that is smoothing
and<00:00:07.529> smoothing<00:00:08.040> groups<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:08.970> smoothing<00:00:09.570> is

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
and smoothing groups so smoothing is

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.290 
and smoothing groups so smoothing is
quite<00:00:10.530> simple<00:00:10.860> if<00:00:11.040> we're<00:00:12.030> talking<00:00:12.120> about

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
quite simple if we're talking about

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.110

are you're going to be working with

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810 
are you're going to be working with
smoothing<00:00:52.050> groups<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.530> want<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> strictly

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
smoothing groups and want to strictly

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.810 
smoothing groups and want to strictly
define<00:00:54.329> your<00:00:54.660> edges<00:00:55.020> quite<00:00:55.500> easily<00:00:55.770> well<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
define your edges quite easily well the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.760 
define your edges quite easily well the
way<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.480> done<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.930> blender<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
way that this is done in blender it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.400 
way that this is done in blender it
beyond<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.789> setting<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.870> shading

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
beyond just setting the shading

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.189 
beyond just setting the shading
attributes<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.039> individual<00:01:02.730> faces<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.359> using

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
attributes of individual faces is using

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.500 
attributes of individual faces is using
an<00:01:04.379> edge<00:01:04.530> split<00:01:04.799> modifier<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.850> an<00:01:06.119> edge<00:01:06.240> split

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
an edge split modifier so an edge split

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.789 
an edge split modifier so an edge split
modifier<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.020> found<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> modifier<00:01:07.770> panel

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
modifier is found for the modifier panel

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.130 
modifier is found for the modifier panel
and<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.970> choose<00:01:09.180> edge<00:01:09.479> split<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and you can just choose edge split and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.340 
and you can just choose edge split and
it<00:01:10.799> works<00:01:11.070> based<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.670> either<00:01:11.909> angles<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.840> sharp

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it works based on either angles or sharp

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
it works based on either angles or sharp
edges<00:01:13.530> now<00:01:14.430> unless<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> very

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
edges now unless you have a very

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
edges now unless you have a very
simplified<00:01:15.659> model<00:01:15.869> you're<00:01:16.710> probably<00:01:16.979> not

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
simplified model you're probably not

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
simplified model you're probably not
going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.610> using<00:01:17.850> edge<00:01:18.000> angle<00:01:18.450> since<00:01:19.049> we

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
going to be using edge angle since we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.390 
going to be using edge angle since we
have<00:01:19.259> an<00:01:19.350> organic<00:01:19.530> model<00:01:19.979> we're<00:01:20.159> definitely

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
have an organic model we're definitely

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.070 
have an organic model we're definitely
not<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.150> using<00:01:21.390> edge<00:01:21.509> angle<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.930> this

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
not going to be using edge angle in this

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600 
not going to be using edge angle in this
case<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.770> instead<00:01:23.040> our<00:01:23.189> gonna<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.430> choosing

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
case but instead our gonna be choosing

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.030 
case but instead our gonna be choosing
sharp<00:01:24.180> edges<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.780> sharp<00:01:25.380> edges<00:01:25.530> work<00:01:25.830> by

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
sharp edges so sharp edges work by

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.880 
sharp edges so sharp edges work by
defining<00:01:26.729> those<00:01:27.090> creases<00:01:27.659> basically<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.799> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
defining those creases basically so if I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.399 
defining those creases basically so if I
hit<00:01:29.040> tab<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.400> go<00:01:29.490> net<00:01:29.640> mode<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> I'll<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.049> hit

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
hit tab to go net mode and I'll just hit

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
hit tab to go net mode and I'll just hit
ctrl<00:01:31.770> tab<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> edge<00:01:32.490> select<00:01:32.759> mode<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
ctrl tab going to edge select mode and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.370 
ctrl tab going to edge select mode and
maybe<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.079> want<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.439> add<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.280> split<00:01:36.060> along<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
maybe I want to add in a split along the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.950 
maybe I want to add in a split along the
brow<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.400> well<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.329> all<00:01:39.600> try<00:01:39.750> click

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
brow here well I can just all try click

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.210 
brow here well I can just all try click
to<00:01:40.079> select<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.409> edge<00:01:40.560> loop<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:41.130> I'll

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
to select that edge loop and then I'll

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.620 
to select that edge loop and then I'll
hit<00:01:41.369> ctrl<00:01:41.970> E<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.619> choose<00:01:43.619> mark<00:01:44.369> sharp<00:01:44.970> what

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
hit ctrl E and choose mark sharp what

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.330 
hit ctrl E and choose mark sharp what
that'll<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.320> immediately<00:01:46.829> tell<00:01:47.130> this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that'll do then is immediately tell this

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.819 
that'll do then is immediately tell this
modifier<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.630> should<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.140> seam<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
modifier that that should be a seam and

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
modifier that that should be a seam and
it<00:01:50.220> will<00:01:50.310> actually<00:01:50.640> split<00:01:51.030> those<00:01:51.180> apart<00:01:51.540> and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
it will actually split those apart and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.899 
it will actually split those apart and
this<00:01:52.140> works<00:01:52.409> by<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:53.159> duplicating<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
this works by just duplicating the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.450 
this works by just duplicating the
vertex<00:01:54.240> there<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.930> click<00:01:55.049> apply

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
vertex there so if we just click apply

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.370 
vertex there so if we just click apply
you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.360> now<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.750> duplicate

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you can see that we now have duplicate

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.340 
you can see that we now have duplicate
vertices<00:01:58.799> here<00:01:59.130> to<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.240> nice<00:02:00.719> controlled

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
vertices here to get nice controlled

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.499 
vertices here to get nice controlled
shading<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.000> another<00:02:03.299> way<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
shading so this is just another way to

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.389 
shading so this is just another way to
do<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.930> within<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.890> course<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.250> could

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
do it within this of course you could

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.150 
do it within this of course you could
combine<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:07.110> smooth<00:02:07.590> or<00:02:07.890> flat

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
combine this with your smooth or flat

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.130 
combine this with your smooth or flat
shading<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.910> maybe<00:02:09.000> say<00:02:09.360> shade<00:02:09.899> those

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
shading so I can maybe say shade those

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.940 
shading so I can maybe say shade those
flat<00:02:10.530> or<00:02:11.000> or<00:02:12.000> smooth<00:02:12.480> whatever<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.260> want<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> do

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
flat or or smooth whatever I want to do

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.580 
flat or or smooth whatever I want to do
works<00:02:14.370> quite<00:02:14.970> simply<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:16.170> by<00:02:16.290> using<00:02:16.440> a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
works quite simply just by using a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.290 
works quite simply just by using a
combination<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.520> smooth<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.090> flat

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
combination of the smooth and flat

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.670 
combination of the smooth and flat
shading<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.739> edge<00:02:19.890> split<00:02:20.220> modifier
