 and then the guys live is a new 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.339
 video and well then in this video what 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.899
 I want to talk to you is basically about the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.849
 theme of the creu as you could see 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.860
 in the title that makes it clearer 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.210
 impossible and good, I want to talk to you 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.160
 about the action since good 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.470
 I have abandoned them a long time ago 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.690
 time since the truth is that I have not 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.600
 played with subscribers well so often 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.580
 as before and others and well then I want 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.859
 to take up all this again is worth 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.710
 pick it up to play with all of you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 that's how you know I have three scripts 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.679
 two of play 3 and once play 4 that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.120
 Well, they are always in the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.329
 description of all videos and other 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
 yes, that's true because until good 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.739
 because until today they have all been full and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.600
 other good as last already 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.950
 you know they come right away then there's 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.050
 people who take it off do not put it on 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.670
 main and other good because there are people 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.050
 that she wants her as principal and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.390
 Unfortunately, it can not be 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.940
 use not then good then for 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.879
 this what I have done first is of 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.590
 the two crises of play 3 one that is the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.090
 second that good so from now on 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.220
 in all the videos you will see that the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.400
 decision puts creed of pc 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.010
 since of the two children of play 3 lay / 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.370
 I left one of play 3 the second of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.140
 play 3 bases of computer voucher and 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.880
 the other base play 4 as has been 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.710
 it always so good because as 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.870
 I want to start playing races with 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.850
 subscribers and I also want to do it in 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.250
 the computer and how good now 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.710
 What can I do now? I want to do it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.510
 Well then I want all the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.120
 that you have a computer and of greater tengáis 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.310
 obviously the gta so when you put in 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.080
 the cross is worth it is also I'm going to 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.970
 put on this this time I'm going to 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.380
 put separately from the rest anyway 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.360
 of the description you already know are the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.830
 three together but in this case also the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.450
 I'm going to put down a little bit more 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.190
 separated so that you see it clearly 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.470
 what is the computer 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.960
 so you already know how to be here in play 3 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.330
 that is framed the computer that 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.490
 is the one that gives the second of play 3 now 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.040
 is going to be computer and the play 4 is going 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.479
 to be the usual one if I tell you 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.000
 that as I'm going to start to pick up 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.460
 again the theme of playing with 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.070
 subscribers and others may that some 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.900
 Once you see that they have expelled you in 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.629
 the video and the rest is basically because 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.310
 I do not know if you are in 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.379
 and the truth is that it is a bit of a mess 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.090
 go looking one by one to see if it is 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.250
 can see if there is someone who is in the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.469
 chrono but I do not know if I keep playing 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.269
 gta or no longer although you are in crisis 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.400
 it had the main value but good 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.200
 anyway when you release sites what 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.629
 I'm going to say on twitter I'm going to let you know 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.159
 to free sites in the tribe of play 4 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.680
 for example, if it's the one I'm going to use 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.139
 at that time then I will release from 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.939
 sites and good because if for some house or 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.709
 has been inadvertently dismissed because as 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.599
 I say I do not know who plays who does not 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.629
 play even if you have the main one or 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.609
 is not worth then then others are going to put 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.470
 and already be as simple as that is worth 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.000
 all forms then I will notify by twitter and 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.340
 Well these'll do it every time 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.780
 Let's play with subscribers 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.819
 basically because also what I say 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.260
 that's why I want to have people who 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.230
 be available because there are many times 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.859
 that I have tried without warning of anything 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.419
 look at the gta break play 4 and good 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.219
 well I found that there is a lot 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.900
 own people are also disconnected 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.519
 obviously you can not all 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.680
 be when I'm going to record and so on 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.750
 ok but yes I want to have the maximum 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.660
 as many people as possible for 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.070
 also varying from people and others to 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.930
 that you can have every opportunity to 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.670
 play so you already know to have very 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.470
 important to have the main 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.680
 any of which as something already 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.810
 is it really or that of play 3 or 4 depends 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.640
 of the platform that you play is worth having 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.380
 have the main one and you're already 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.670
 just then be attentive to 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.140
 twitter that you have also here below 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.910
 in the description like all my 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.200
 social networks like facebook install 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.090
 that are also in the description by 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.260
 if you do not follow me you can follow me and good 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.910
 Well, I just wanted to take this 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.610
 video to comment only on the subject 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.370
 of the field and well well also tell you 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.380
 that I'm going to start also going up 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.090

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.190
 twitter and others one of them 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.890

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.540
 channel I want to do a series of is a 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.170

 my adventures and others in that game at 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.260
 just like in so many others that I'm going to 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.570
 start to climb and well I said 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.910
 this simply nothing else also 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.560

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.870
 counter strike good as I said

 there will be two this time 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.910
