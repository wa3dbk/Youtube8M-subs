that<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.679> ultimately<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:03.179> I'm<00:01:03.269> not

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:03.389 
that there is ultimately but I'm not

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:04.389 
that there is ultimately but I'm not
sure<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.569> that's<00:01:03.719> biblical<00:01:03.839> counseling

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399

biblical<00:01:05.399> counseling<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.840> good

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
biblical counseling is a good

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.160 
biblical counseling is a good
conversation<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.030> built<00:01:09.329> on<00:01:09.509> a<00:01:09.570> biblical
