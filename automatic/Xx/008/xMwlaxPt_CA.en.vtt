the<00:00:34.240> Nexus<00:00:34.540> 600<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:35.230> they<00:00:35.770> gave<00:00:35.890> it<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.130> Nexus

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
the Nexus 600 is they gave it the Nexus

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.750 
the Nexus 600 is they gave it the Nexus
mid<00:00:37.000> kick<00:00:37.300> profile<00:00:37.960> so<00:00:38.560> it's<00:00:38.740> gonna<00:00:38.860> be<00:00:39.280> softer

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
mid kick profile so it's gonna be softer

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.880 
mid kick profile so it's gonna be softer
up<00:00:39.970> in<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.180> handle<00:00:40.480> area<00:00:40.630> it's<00:00:41.590> going<00:00:41.740> to<00:00:41.800> get

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
up in the handle area it's going to get

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.440 
up in the handle area it's going to get
stiffer<00:00:42.220> in<00:00:42.400> the<00:00:42.490> mid<00:00:42.670> section<00:00:42.940> where<00:00:43.330> they

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
stiffer in the mid section where they

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.720 
stiffer in the mid section where they
focus<00:00:43.810> the<00:00:43.990> kick<00:00:44.170> point<00:00:44.380> on<00:00:44.590> and<00:00:44.770> then<00:00:45.550> get

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
gave you the feature on the Nexus 1000

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.020 
gave you the feature on the Nexus 1000
so<00:00:59.770> it<00:00:59.890> really<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.280> it<00:01:00.490> is<00:01:00.610> a<00:01:00.640> really<00:01:00.910> good

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
so it really is it is a really good

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.790 
so it really is it is a really good
feature<00:01:01.210> on<00:01:01.450> this<00:01:01.570> stick<00:01:01.810> is<00:01:01.960> they<00:01:02.560> gave<00:01:02.680> it

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
feature on this stick is they gave it

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.580 
feature on this stick is they gave it
the<00:01:02.890> pure<00:01:03.340> shot<00:01:03.700> blade<00:01:03.730> profile<00:01:04.570> they<00:01:04.960> extend

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
the pure shot blade profile they extend

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.010 
the pure shot blade profile they extend
the<00:01:05.679> neck<00:01:05.890> so<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.399> really<00:01:06.670> reduces<00:01:07.329> the<00:01:07.840> amount

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
the neck so it really reduces the amount

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.349 
the neck so it really reduces the amount
of<00:01:08.200> twisting<00:01:09.009> or<00:01:09.159> deflection<00:01:09.729> off<00:01:09.969> the<00:01:10.149> blade

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:10.359 
of twisting or deflection off the blade

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.679 
of twisting or deflection off the blade
giving<00:01:11.079> you<00:01:11.170> more<00:01:11.409> accuracy<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.310> power<00:01:12.700> now

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
giving you more accuracy and power now

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.469 
giving you more accuracy and power now
in<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:14.049> blade<00:01:14.259> they<00:01:15.070> did<00:01:15.280> Bauer's<00:01:15.939> arrow<00:01:16.210> foam

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
in the blade they did Bauer's arrow foam

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.169 
in the blade they did Bauer's arrow foam
to<00:01:16.840> core<00:01:17.109> it<00:01:17.679> really<00:01:18.249> helps<00:01:18.549> balance<00:01:18.759> out<00:01:19.030> the

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
to core it really helps balance out the
