00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.790
 [music] 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.290
 Good day to communication Yaroslav 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.080
 Brin now we will deal with you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.509
 exercise bench dumbbell lying on 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.840
 sloping bench 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:22.320
 exercises this basic it aims to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.330
 the development of our pectoral muscles precisely 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.340
 accented on top 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.490
 each muscle group has its own 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.129
 weak point in biceps is external 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.650
 the triceps head is the long head in 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.769
 infants is the first in almost all 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.280
 people gym all lagged behind 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.900
 pectoral muscles because classic 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.330
 settled what is the most fashionable 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.440
 exercise is bench press lying on 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.120
 horizontal bench 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.670
 or dumbbell bench press lying on a horizontal 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.379
 the bench constantly still asking 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.989
 how much you harvest how much you harvest it 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.540
 pride as well if we hold under 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.750
 angle we will have less weight for marriage and 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.309
 it hurts our run over it all 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.100
 loves the horizontal bench press for more 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.560
 sorry but the horizontal bench press he develops 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.590
 predominantly middle part of the friend and 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.260
 between and it turns out to be cool as we hang 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.020
 about the top 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.990
 Here is the work of the spectacle zone, it is not developed and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 this is the main common mistake for 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.610
 order to eliminate this nasty 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.160
 the moment it is necessary to perform the bench press and presses 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.250
 dumbbells on the incline bench for estimates 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.850
 few years i'm doing bench press only 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.100
 tilt and 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.020
 Tatyana horizontally and not at all doing 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.740
 managed to overcome themselves not to chase 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.229
 behind the scales 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.259
 and concentrate on work 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.470
 muscle groups what should google 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.869
 optimum angle of 30 degrees 30 degrees 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.350
 the way to work out optimally and the top 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.259
 part 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.920
 do not dare and lower that is 30 degrees 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.810
 We do in the event that you do not have 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.759
 road accentuated 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.189
 engages to be nervous that is if you 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.140
 don't do horizontal bench press from your 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.299
 angle of 30 degrees if you do 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.030
 horizontal bench press meaning at 30 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.500
 degrees no we do 45 degrees and 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.930
 higher than higher 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.450
 angle the more shifted the load on 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.520
 the first part of the pectoral muscles and the stronger 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.390
 shifts to the mug on your kids on 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.489
 front bundles 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.040
 so choose an angle for yourself 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.769
 so that the load was exactly up and 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.739
 naturally make priority to you 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.400
 it is necessary to distribute the load as much as possible 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.290
 all over the chest area or as much as possible 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.150
 concentrate load and develop 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.549
 upper divisions ie if you need 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.060
 top do it a 45 degree angle and 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.340
 above 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.400
 if you need to be completely out of stock 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.670
 chest evenly this 30 degrees well 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.769
 the lower head is still negative 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.710
 the angle the greater the weight forward because 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.840
 that activated them liked 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:00.510
 their pineapple anatomical muscles are stronger 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.400
 it was on an inclined bench for that 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.010
 to evenly records all pectoral 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.620
 muscle and a little stress work 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.370
 it is hired the starting position themselves 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.460
 pride here they love me but when 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.020
 speak wives and not hands 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.330
 that is, if you go in and teach 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.150
 yourself went to bed a lot of strength to spend 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.390
 it is on this movement that is wrong 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.550
 need to throw not under your feet 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.830
 so once threw either i 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.320
 I throw one word ruzaikin myself 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.540
 on the shoulder and then when you lay down the second 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.010
 when cards or big last 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.140
 approach is better all the same with one interior 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.370
 fun in the second ask you to 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.690
 then fall, therefore, lose less and 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.230
 do more work in the very 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.460
 exercise is extremely important to remove the bridge 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.980
 so that there is no gap between the max back 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.350
 for this we raise legs you can 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.610
 legs put any of course if not 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.580
 put on a bench 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:08.880
 book the position of the eternal driver was 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:11.010
 pressed then the advantage of this 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.870
 exercise is that we can lower 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.320
 hands as low as possible because between 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.239
 hands there is no jumper here it increases 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.680
 our amplitude than in general some topics 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.209
 more work done 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.230
 accordingly it is positive 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:29.640
 It effects on hypertrophy in this time 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:33.480
 second there is no jumper and our hands go 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.010
 here and there for beginners very bad 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.830
 developed stabilizing muscles 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.570
 bad communication brain muscles here 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.690
 right here this movement is noticeable 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.790
 the one who is more engaged in 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.980
 he can already control it 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.140
 equilibrium position is controlled by 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.880
 through the work of stabilizing muscles it 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.280
 small muscle groups with one 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.700
 side well the more muscle works 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:02.490
 the more our body develops from the point 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:04.070
 view of physiology and health the more 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:10.100
 muscle work 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.100
 smaller the less work we can 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.729
 smaller and lower it can be produced 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.850
 so the weight of the dumbbells will have you much 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.800
 less than no pants and accordingly you 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.040
 will not be able to increase the weight 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.020
 characteristics of scales influence 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.270
 muscle hypertrophy here 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.340
 and bad, that is , there are pluses and 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:34.550
 cons you decide what more pros 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:38.250
 or minuses that is the initial position 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:42.629
 at the bottom maximally stretched 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:46.020
 on top of possible poo 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:48.120
 survived lifted sweets met and 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.550
 additionally statically strain your 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.610
 chest muscles 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:58.550
 lowered burglary raised 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.300
 movement occurs on the trapezoid that is 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:05.430
 based on widely developed 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.199
 dumbbells brought to the top 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.960
 added static at dividing 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:13.229
 two modifications have this exercise as 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.909
 in principle, all the dumbbell presses are 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.400
 supination and pronation of a professional 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:22.919
 doing supination that is the original 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:27.199
 position here and when they raise 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.199
 dumbbells spin them inside 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.670
 this additionally puts a strain on 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:41.310
 internal divisions of the pectoral muscles and 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:44.310
 makes these particular places worked 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.940
 the second option is pronation when 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:54.150
 not twisted inside 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:56.040
 twisted any bid each other 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.850
 In this case, we distribute the load 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:02.070
 evenly over the entire pectoral muscle this time 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.230
 and secondly we can additionally 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.410
 static on the shoulder of the entire chest 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.790
 muscle at the end that is sweetie 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.560
 met each other and not 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.560
 look extra concentrated 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.390
 what option do everything depends dangerous 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.580
 try that is that more like it 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:32.090
 where better big media feel 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.720
 then perform well actually itself 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.770
 motion 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.770
 dumbbell bench press in the slope 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.360
 [music] 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.110
 [music] 

00:07:58.219 --> 00:08:03.379
 This exercise dismantled go to 

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.379
 the next
