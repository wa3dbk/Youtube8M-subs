the tabs to organize your different
classes<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.780> don't<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
classes and then if you don't want to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.190 
classes and then if you don't want to
use<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> whole<00:01:28.710> binder<00:01:29.869> idea<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.140> would

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
use the whole binder idea that I would

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200 
use the whole binder idea that I would
recommend<00:01:31.530> doing<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.130> matching<00:01:32.520> notebook

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
recommend doing the matching notebook

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
recommend doing the matching notebook
and<00:01:33.360> matching<00:01:33.750> folder<00:01:34.079> idea<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.650> way

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
and matching folder idea and this way

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.230 
and matching folder idea and this way
you<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:35.009> super-bright<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.820> nodes<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.150> your

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
you can super-bright your nodes in your

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.690 
you can super-bright your nodes in your
notebook<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.860> then<00:01:37.860> keep<00:01:38.159> all<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.310> papers

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
notebook and then keep all your papers

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.310 
notebook and then keep all your papers
in<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.909> folder<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.600> recommend<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.140> if

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
in the folder and I recommend that if

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.690 
in the folder and I recommend that if
you<00:01:40.409> don't<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> locker<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.159> way<00:01:41.549> it's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you don't have a locker that way it's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.280 
you don't have a locker that way it's
going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.150> bit<00:01:42.240> light<00:01:42.509> lighter

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
going to be a little bit light lighter

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.660 
going to be a little bit light lighter
weight<00:01:43.590> carrying<00:01:44.070> around<00:01:44.189> you're<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.549> going

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
weight carrying around you're not going

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.889 
weight carrying around you're not going
to<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.820> carrying<00:01:45.030> around<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.450> weight<00:01:45.659> but

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
to be carrying around as much weight but

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.210 
to be carrying around as much weight but
if<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> locker<00:01:46.500> I'd<00:01:46.740> highly

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
if you have a locker I'd highly

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.520 
if you have a locker I'd highly
recommend<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:48.540> binder<00:01:48.869> idea<00:01:49.110> because<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
recommend the binder idea because I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.600 
recommend the binder idea because I
think<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.369> keep<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.579> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
think that it's going to keep you a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.980 
think that it's going to keep you a
little<00:01:50.670> bit<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:51.000> organized<00:01:51.450> than<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
little bit more organized than the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.980 
little bit more organized than the
folder<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.649> notebook<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.630> next

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
folder and notebook so my next

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.170 
folder and notebook so my next
organization<00:01:55.979> tip<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.670> some<00:01:56.850> kind<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
organization tip is to get some kind of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.709 
organization tip is to get some kind of
a<00:01:58.110> plan<00:01:58.140> her<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.689> show

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
a plan her this is what I have to show

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.740 
a plan her this is what I have to show
you<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.530> um<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.130> think<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.490> planner<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:03.000> totally

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
you but um I think a planner is totally

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.510 
you but um I think a planner is totally
an<00:02:03.869> essential<00:02:04.350> thing<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.100> school

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
an essential thing to have for school

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.219 
an essential thing to have for school
because<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.850> really<00:02:06.030> will<00:02:06.210> keep<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.509> really

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
because it really will keep you really

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.290 
because it really will keep you really
organized<00:02:07.799> so

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
organized so

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.650 
organized so
my<00:02:09.810> first<00:02:10.080> tip<00:02:10.290> for<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.770> planner<00:02:11.010> is<00:02:11.660> to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
my first tip for the planner is to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.930 
my first tip for the planner is to
basically<00:02:12.870> draw<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.410> line<00:02:13.740> down<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.430> middle<00:02:14.610> of

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
basically draw a line down the middle of

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.670 
basically draw a line down the middle of
every<00:02:15.270> single<00:02:15.540> day<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.110> left<00:02:16.500> hand

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
every single day and on the left hand

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.140 
every single day and on the left hand
side<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.040> write<00:02:17.160> your<00:02:17.280> homework<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
side to write your homework and the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.610 
side to write your homework and the
right<00:02:18.300> hand<00:02:18.510> side<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.900> right<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.170> have<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.440> do

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
right hand side to right we have to do

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.920 
right hand side to right we have to do
if<00:02:19.830> that's<00:02:20.010> laundry<00:02:20.580> running<00:02:21.450> errands<00:02:21.810> at

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
if that's laundry running errands at

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.580 
if that's laundry running errands at
target<00:02:22.410> cleaning<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:24.390> dishes<00:02:24.510> whatever<00:02:25.440> it

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
target cleaning the dishes whatever it

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.980 
target cleaning the dishes whatever it
is<00:02:25.710> for<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:27.270> write<00:02:27.720> down<00:02:27.870> your

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
is for you and then write down your

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.300 
is for you and then write down your
homework<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:28.470> whenever<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.860> teacher<00:02:29.040> says

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
