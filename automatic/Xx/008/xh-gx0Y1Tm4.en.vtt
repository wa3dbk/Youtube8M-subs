00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:11.259
 we need to add 7,056 plus 605.7 more 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.539
 5.67 when adding any 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.950
 numbers should always align the numbers 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.930
 especially when dealing with 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.700
 with decimal numbers the easiest way 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.450
 to do this is to align the decimals 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:26.680
 comma under comma, come on 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:33.660
 the first number here is 7,056 the second 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.660
 number is 605.7 hence the last number is 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:40.929
 5.67 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:43.929
 now we have everything aligned everything that is 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.819
 unit is above or below the 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.859
 below everything in the house of the 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.569
 all units that are in the 10th 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.879
 is above or below everything that is 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:57.969
 in the house of the 10th c thereafter 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:01:01.719
 So we can add, let's add you. 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.710
 should start with the smallest house then 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.430
 start here 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.759
 those are tenths hundredths 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.159
 this is six thousandth and you must add 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.079
 this with the other thousandth has no other 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.759
 thousandth then we can think of two 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:20.380
 ways we can bring these six to 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:25.119
 low or we can see this 605.7 as 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.610
 being equal to 605,700 we can add 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.039
 so many zeros to the right of this evil 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.170
 right from 7 as long as you want since 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.070
 we are to the right of this evil without changing 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.460
 its value 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:40.149
 we can also do here this 5.67 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.929
 you can write as the 5,670 when 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:48.789
 you write like this and you have 6 + 0 to 0 is 6 and 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:52.479
 still going 560 but 7 is 12 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:59.759
 you write two in the evil synthesis house and 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:03.729
 rises 11 + 0 but 7 and 8 but six is ​​14 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:13.260
 write 4 under one of the units' homes 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:14.680
 1 plus 788 plus 5 13 13 + 5 18 and if it is 18 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.650
 climb 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:24.280
 from 11 to 0 gives a final we have the 6 in the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.430
 houses in thesis evil nothing adds up with this 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.650
 So you can come down here, and here you are. 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.590
 you should not forget the comma when 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:40.450
 we added the numbers we have 600 and 18.4 26 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.290
 or 618 and 426 thousandths 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.290
 we finish
