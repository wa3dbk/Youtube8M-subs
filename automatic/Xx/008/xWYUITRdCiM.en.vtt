00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.200
 Hello 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.049
 today i want to talk a little bit 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.259
 on the glass which is applied 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.009
 in top watch models invicta 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:26.430
 and I want to do a little experiment 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:30.210
 I will spend it on my watch model 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.649
 so what are the experiments 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.930
 what is it for 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:37.620
 well let's start with what 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.449
 glass is used in the lens means in 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 invicta watch glass applied 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.629
 made by unique technology flame 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.440
 fusion method 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.539
 tempering glass wherein 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.640
 manufacturers claim glass 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 This type is not less durable than 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.820
 sapphire and in essence it is 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.670
 sapphire critics invicta claim that 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.780
 not some kind of sapphire what is it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.600
 ordinary mineral water means how people here 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.660
 checked sapphire glass or 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.190
 mineral the simplest way is 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.560
 take and apply a drop to the surface 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.259
 glass 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.910
 if a drop keeps its own 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.670
 round beautiful shape if she is not 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.170
 spreads it means that it is considered that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.830
 this is sapphire crystal 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.800
 if the drop instantly spreads either 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.140
 that's when it rolls on the glass 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.000
 leave ugly irregular shape 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 trace means that mineral glass here 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.479
 yesterday I came under rain and had 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.080
 opportunity to observe 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.270
 the shape of a drop on the watch glass 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.810
 were really beautiful round 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.989
 forms and today i want to reproduce this 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.989
 rain on the clock at home for 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:02:01.890
 I will use this cure 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:06.539
 which we spray flowers and let's 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:13.850
 Here I take and sprinkled on the glass 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:19.600
 so let's see 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:23.900
 on droplets one can see that the drops have 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.730
 beautiful round shape while not 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.330
 spread out here are in place while 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.550
 if i tilt the clock a little bit 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.920
 drops will shift but forms 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.920
 its not going to lose let's see 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.810
 little by little here one moved 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.720
 it absorbs other droplets but when 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.720
 this look keeps its round 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:03.650
 beautiful shape so i find here 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.310
 unnecessary words do not need, in principle, every 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.070
 can see the result with my own eyes and 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.830
 make the right conclusions about glass 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:17.270
 which is used invicta watch 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.280
 well and on it all thanks that 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.280
 watched the karosh of his day
