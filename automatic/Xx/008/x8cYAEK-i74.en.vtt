00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
well as well as the striations you know

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.610 
well as well as the striations you know
like<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> lines<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.780> your<00:00:42.870> shoulder<00:00:43.350> and

like the lines in your shoulder and
whatnot<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.399> also<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> vascularity<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:47.039> when

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
whatnot and also the vascularity so when

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.610 
whatnot and also the vascularity so when
you<00:00:47.460> tan<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.480> literally<00:00:48.989> looks<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.410> you're

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
you tan it literally looks like you're

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.410 
you tan it literally looks like you're
putting<00:00:49.770> five<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> ten<00:00:50.460> pounds<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.030> pure

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
putting five to ten pounds of pure

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.650 
putting five to ten pounds of pure
muscle<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.199> body<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:54.420> that's

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
muscle on your body so I think that's

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.709 
muscle on your body so I think that's
the<00:00:55.050> most<00:00:55.500> important<00:00:56.010> thing<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.160> go<00:00:56.520> tan<00:00:56.820> go<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the most important thing so go tan go to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
the most important thing so go tan go to
tanning<00:00:58.109> booth<00:00:58.260> go<00:00:58.590> outside<00:00:58.949> whatever<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
tanning booth go outside whatever you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.680 
tanning booth go outside whatever you
need<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:02.180> number<00:01:03.180> two<00:01:03.420> is

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
need to do just go to it number two is

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.800 
need to do just go to it number two is
you<00:01:04.409> should<00:01:04.680> condition<00:01:05.519> yourself<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.299> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you should condition yourself and this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.289 
you should condition yourself and this
one<00:01:07.049> can't<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.770> done<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.670> quickly

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
one can't really be done as as quickly

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.660 
one can't really be done as as quickly
maybe<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.830> maybe<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.640> two

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
maybe if you have to maybe one or two

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
maybe if you have to maybe one or two
weeks<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.270> advance<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.810> whatever<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.380> need<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
weeks in advance of whatever you need to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.370 
weeks in advance of whatever you need to
look<00:01:13.710> good<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.659> then<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
look good for then you can do this and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.200 
look good for then you can do this and
what<00:01:16.619> conditioning<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> mean<00:01:18.060> by<00:01:18.180> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
what conditioning is what I mean by that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.570 
what conditioning is what I mean by that
is<00:01:18.390> cardio<00:01:19.020> conditioning<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.430> you're

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580

running every day for 30 minutes your
body<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.520> conditioned<00:01:24.150> more

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
body is going to get conditioned more

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240
