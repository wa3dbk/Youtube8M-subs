00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
on the deck these are the stairs and

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.130 
on the deck these are the stairs and
what<00:00:14.969> you're<00:00:15.150> seeing<00:00:15.389> here<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.929> each<00:00:18.140> stair

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
what you're seeing here is each stair

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.830 
what you're seeing here is each stair
has<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.130> have<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> support<00:00:20.789> underneath<00:00:21.119> each<00:00:21.539> of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
has to have a support underneath each of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.970 
has to have a support underneath each of
the<00:00:22.490> Azek<00:00:23.490> decking<00:00:23.880> that's<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.740> had<00:00:25.740> we

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the Azek decking that's going in had we

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.500 
the Azek decking that's going in had we
planned<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.609> little<00:00:26.670> better<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.150> could<00:00:27.359> have

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
planned a little better we could have

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.960 
planned a little better we could have
shrunk<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.380> gap<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.010> 29<00:00:29.519> inches<00:00:29.789> or

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
shrunk the gap that are 29 inches or

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.759 
shrunk the gap that are 29 inches or
below<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.660> wouldn't<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> do<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.380> we

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
below and we wouldn't have to do this we

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.380 
below and we wouldn't have to do this we
just<00:00:32.009> could<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.250> put<00:00:32.399> an<00:00:32.489> extra<00:00:32.610> stringer<00:00:33.210> in

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
just could have put an extra stringer in

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.780 
just could have put an extra stringer in
but<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.860> fine<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> little

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
but it's just fine so is this a little

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.160 
but it's just fine so is this a little
bit<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.059> work<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.870> so<00:00:39.870> far<00:00:40.140> i

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
bit of work so what we have is so far i

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.010 
bit of work so what we have is so far i
have<00:00:40.670> finished<00:00:41.670> two<00:00:42.059> sections<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.719> working

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
have finished two sections and working

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.360 
have finished two sections and working
on<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> third<00:00:43.789> this<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:46.370> right

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
on the third this right here this right

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.049 
on the third this right here this right
here<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> prototype<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.530> light<00:00:50.070> it's

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
here is a prototype of the light it's

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.680 
here is a prototype of the light it's
going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> go<00:00:52.370> up<00:00:53.370> there<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
going to go up there like that and the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.189 
going to go up there like that and the
reason<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.170> ahead<00:00:56.600> these<00:00:57.600> enough<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.020> head

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
reason it's ahead these enough to head

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.760 
reason it's ahead these enough to head
to<00:00:58.440> make<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.460> need<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.760> know<00:01:00.109> how<00:01:01.109> far

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
to make that is I need to know how far

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.920 
to make that is I need to know how far
backwards<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.860> how<00:01:04.860> far<00:01:05.159> back<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
backwards here the how far back the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.539 
backwards here the how far back the
bracing<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.110> one<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.560> needed<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.340> so

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
bracing this one here needed to be so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.280 
bracing this one here needed to be so
this<00:01:08.700> could<00:01:08.880> screw<00:01:09.180> into<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
this could screw into it and then the

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.140 
this could screw into it and then the
the<00:01:13.290> actual<00:01:13.500> decking<00:01:14.189> itself<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:17.150> two

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the actual decking itself will be two

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.060 
the actual decking itself will be two
rows<00:01:19.430> laid<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.000> scrap<00:01:21.330> piece<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.840> show<00:01:22.740> you

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.490 

will<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.490> piece<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:28.170> isn't

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
will be one piece up in here this isn't

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
will be one piece up in here this isn't
the<00:01:28.590> color<00:01:28.880> or<00:01:29.880> maybe<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> color<00:01:30.630> but

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the color or maybe it is the color but

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.880 
the color or maybe it is the color but
anyway<00:01:31.140> there's<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.310> piece<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:34.140> then

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
anyway there's one piece there and then

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.460 
anyway there's one piece there and then
another<00:01:35.490> piece<00:01:36.200> just<00:01:37.200> grab<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.920> here

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
another piece just grab this one here

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.859 
another piece just grab this one here
color<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:41.490> piece<00:01:41.820> will<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.360> front<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
color this piece will be in front of it

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.639 
color this piece will be in front of it
with<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> gap<00:01:46.159> that's<00:01:47.159> how<00:01:47.340> she's<00:01:47.610> gonna<00:01:47.759> look

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
with a gap that's how she's gonna look

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.980 
with a gap that's how she's gonna look
not<00:01:49.649> two-tone<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.579> though<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.720> again

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
see the nails so those steps won't go

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.890 
see the nails so those steps won't go
anywhere<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:32.190> tomorrow<00:02:32.760> i<00:02:33.060> already<00:02:33.750> had
