00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
equivalent to a US eight it holds an

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.620 
equivalent to a US eight it holds an
edge<00:01:40.160> nicely<00:01:40.400> I<00:01:40.850> know<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.060> lot<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.240> people<00:01:41.510> say

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630

well<00:01:41.870> it<00:01:41.960> doesn't<00:01:42.080> hold<00:01:42.380> an<00:01:42.500> edge<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:42.980> you

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
well it doesn't hold an edge and you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.740

1/8<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.299> an<00:03:42.810> inch<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:45.720> hole<00:03:46.079> diameter

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
1/8 of an inch and the hole diameter

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.590 
1/8 of an inch and the hole diameter
here<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.600> a<00:03:48.600> half<00:03:48.780> an<00:03:48.930> inch<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.090> think<00:03:51.359> that's

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
here is a half an inch so I think that's

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.110 
here is a half an inch so I think that's
pretty<00:03:51.720> much<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.989> for<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.430> specs<00:03:53.820> on<00:03:54.030> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
pretty much it for the specs on the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.720 
pretty much it for the specs on the
blade<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.410> got<00:03:55.980> up<00:03:56.070> nice<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.430> close<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.670> you

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
blade the I got up nice and close to you

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.300 
blade the I got up nice and close to you
guys<00:03:56.850> gonna<00:03:57.000> take<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.150> better<00:03:57.329> look<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:58.859> handle

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
guys gonna take a better look the handle

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.449 
guys gonna take a better look the handle
here<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.910> lined<00:04:00.480> with<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.560> skeleton<00:04:02.100> steel

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
here is lined with the skeleton steel

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.430 
here is lined with the skeleton steel
which<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.060> really<00:04:03.390> cool<00:04:03.600> so<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.109> just<00:04:04.260> makes

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
which is really cool so it just makes

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.640 
which is really cool so it just makes
the<00:04:04.590> handle<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.040> much<00:04:05.220> stronger<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:07.410> I

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
the handle that much stronger and I I

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.170 
the handle that much stronger and I I
was<00:04:07.859> reading<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.250> review<00:04:08.400> on<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:08.910> like<00:04:09.150> a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
was reading a review on this like a

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.090 
was reading a review on this like a
while<00:04:09.420> back<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.989> somebody<00:04:10.320> was<00:04:10.530> complaining

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
while back and somebody was complaining

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.979 
while back and somebody was complaining
about<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.850> steel<00:04:12.090> liners<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.660> saying<00:04:12.870> that

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
about the steel liners and saying that

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.990 
about the steel liners and saying that
it<00:04:13.079> makes<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.410> knife<00:04:13.590> heavy<00:04:13.920> but<00:04:14.549> this<00:04:14.820> weighs

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
it makes the knife heavy but this weighs

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.360 
it makes the knife heavy but this weighs
four<00:04:15.299> ounces<00:04:15.750> it's<00:04:16.169> not<00:04:16.380> heavy<00:04:16.620> at<00:04:16.769> all<00:04:16.979> I<00:04:17.310> mean

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
four ounces it's not heavy at all I mean

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.979 
four ounces it's not heavy at all I mean
I<00:04:17.609> don't<00:04:18.000> think<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.359> is<00:04:18.479> it's<00:04:18.660> nice<00:04:18.780> and

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
I don't think it is it's nice and

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.750 
I don't think it is it's nice and
lightweight<00:04:19.140> feels<00:04:19.560> very<00:04:19.769> comfortable<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.430> I

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
lightweight feels very comfortable and I

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.120 
lightweight feels very comfortable and I
like<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.120> steel<00:04:21.329> liners<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:22.860> makes<00:04:23.010> a

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
like the steel liners it just makes a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.580 
like the steel liners it just makes a
handle<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.490> much<00:04:24.000> stronger<00:04:24.630> so

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
handle that much stronger so

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.550 
handle that much stronger so
let's<00:04:26.800> see<00:04:26.919> what<00:04:27.130> else<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:28.000> is<00:04:28.510> g10<00:04:29.169> it's

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
let's see what else it is g10 it's

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.740 
let's see what else it is g10 it's
textured<00:04:30.190> so<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.669> have<00:04:30.790> a<00:04:30.820> nice<00:04:31.030> grip<00:04:31.360> feels

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
textured so you have a nice grip feels

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.580 
textured so you have a nice grip feels
very<00:04:31.960> comfortable<00:04:32.200> nice<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:32.919> grippy<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:34.590> I

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
very comfortable nice and grippy and I

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.310 
very comfortable nice and grippy and I
think<00:04:35.889> that's<00:04:36.250> pretty<00:04:37.180> much<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:37.450> for<00:04:38.020> all<00:04:38.169> the

think that's pretty much it for all the
specs<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.710> everything<00:04:39.040> on<00:04:39.130> this<00:04:39.280> knife<00:04:39.520> I

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
it as well let's see it's got a nice

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.090 
it as well let's see it's got a nice
finger<00:06:28.180> coil<00:06:28.510> in<00:06:28.690> here<00:06:28.990> so<00:06:29.530> it<00:06:29.740> feels<00:06:29.950> very

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
finger coil in here so it feels very

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.950 
finger coil in here so it feels very
very<00:06:30.729> comfortable<00:06:32.940> hmm<00:06:33.940> let's<00:06:34.419> see<00:06:34.539> let's<00:06:34.840> see

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
very comfortable hmm let's see let's see

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.999 
very comfortable hmm let's see let's see
let's<00:06:35.080> see<00:06:35.940> think<00:06:36.940> that's<00:06:37.780> pretty<00:06:38.260> much<00:06:38.560> it

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
let's see think that's pretty much it

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:42.999 
let's see think that's pretty much it
oh<00:06:41.009> and<00:06:41.729> the<00:06:41.819> weight<00:06:41.939> on<00:06:42.090> this<00:06:42.210> is<00:06:42.330> five<00:06:42.539> ounces

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
oh and the weight on this is five ounces

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.049 
oh and the weight on this is five ounces
so<00:06:44.009> a<00:06:44.039> little<00:06:44.340> bit<00:06:44.490> heavier<00:06:44.789> than<00:06:44.849> the

00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:45.059 
so a little bit heavier than the

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:47.989 
so a little bit heavier than the
Spyderco<00:06:46.069> um<00:06:47.069> I<00:06:47.159> think<00:06:47.520> that's<00:06:47.759> pretty<00:06:47.879> much

00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:47.999 
Spyderco um I think that's pretty much

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:50.510 
Spyderco um I think that's pretty much
it<00:06:48.330> I<00:06:48.659> think<00:06:48.870> it<00:06:48.930> went<00:06:48.990> over<00:06:49.139> everything<00:06:49.520> this

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
it I think it went over everything this

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.790 
it I think it went over everything this
uh<00:06:50.819> this<00:06:51.360> has<00:06:51.539> the<00:06:51.659> steel<00:06:51.930> liners<00:06:52.349> and<00:06:52.499> this<00:06:52.650> as

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
uh this has the steel liners and this as

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.779 
uh this has the steel liners and this as
well<00:06:52.979> which<00:06:53.789> is<00:06:53.909> really<00:06:53.939> nice<00:06:55.490> love<00:06:56.490> it

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
well which is really nice love it

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.969 
well which is really nice love it
so<00:06:57.300> I<00:06:57.330> mean<00:06:57.689> this<00:06:57.809> was<00:06:57.990> designed<00:06:58.349> for<00:06:58.589> comfort

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979
