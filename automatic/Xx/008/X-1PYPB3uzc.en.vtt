00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.459
 you find that sell antoine on the 

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:03.879
 guardians of the galaxy it's a little 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.870
 easy 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.870
 that's good too 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.559
 you probably know there are five 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.480
 names in the running to achieve the news 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.520
 new spider man solo adventure 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.720
 five more or less prestigious names that 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.730
 allow us to draw the profile 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.020
 searched by marvel first the studio has 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.460
 look for someone who is 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.960
 comfortable with comedy and that is 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.609
 also a certain sensitivity 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.990
 that explains why we find 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.330
 the candidates the directors of 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.660
 hilgers saint vincent and napoleon dana 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.550
 white 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.960
 another trend that emerges someone 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.790
 who is obviously comfortable with 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.500
 the most experienced adventurer in 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.970
 this category seems to be johnatan 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.710
 level to gentleman who comes from 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.149
 independent cinema and which had been 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.129
 revealed by all the boys like mandy 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.930
 lane who had especially propelled amber 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.570
 heard at the rank of star and sex symbol 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.789
 since he realized warm bodies a movie 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.739
 romantic and funny epic zombies 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.370
 and he just finished a comedy with 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.440
 seth rogen 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.050
 in short, the gentleman knows how to handle adventure 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.340
 humor and love that makes it a little bit of 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.079
 ideal cv in any case what emerges 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.820
 with this list is that marvel does 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.960
 not necessarily looking for a name known as 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.190
 he could do it for example in 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.350
 stealing kenneth branagh for the 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.820
 first wrong he seems to focus on 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.070
 someone from rather young candidates 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.080
 between 35 and 45 years who have someone 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.390
 grown up in the 70s by reading the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.500
 comic book spectacular spider man and that 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.360
 falls well because one of the very first 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.340
 potential titles announced by 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.610
 rumors would be spectacular spider 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.649
 man 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.090
 as a reminder of this series of comic books 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.479
 followed the campus years of peter 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.610
 parker 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.050
 the marvel would seek to relocate all that 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.880
 in a high school since let's remember 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.500
 the idea is to rejuvenate the bride then 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.179
 that he will realize this new reboot that 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.009
 remember it is a different project from the 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.599
 animated spider man that will be written by the 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.039
 authors of the great adventure legal and 

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:40.840
 well we will have the answer at the end of 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.780
 next week on the web of course 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.520
 spider man and in this area too 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.140
 badass that tom hardy declaring he 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.789
 wants to play the punisher and we too 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.800
 here are the news in short you 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.239
 like the goonies you like to transform 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.860
 that's good because you do not know 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.720
 maybe not but there is a project of 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.459
 to make a movie monster trucks a bit in 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.080
 this mind there the movie will mix true 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.580
 vehicle and computer graphics and 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.959
 paramount hopes it will be the beginning 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.310
 from a franchise like transformers 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.390
 anyway the movie took from 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.160
 delay it is in post production 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.569
 intensive but new scenes are 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.459
 being turned and who says 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.260
 delay say port and monster trucks do not 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.090
 will come out more current 2015 but well into 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.860
 march 2016 in the united states you will tell me 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.420
 that trucks like that it's going to mean the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.830
 dream but wait to see after all 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.670
 it can be funny there will be plenty of 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.590
 faking 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.240
 rotax ah it's not good that it feels the end
