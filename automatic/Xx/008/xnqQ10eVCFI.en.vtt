00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello today I want to put a lot of comfort again 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.070
 play this time 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.900
 and all are of course again available for free in the App Store 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:17.460
 100 shape must be same again later which normally does not cost 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:23.499
 all right 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.499
 Crazy first 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.490
 the game 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.490
 now these little males 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.490
 and get those scoundrels to score 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.180
 she would have to jump for example 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 There are sometimes failures you can use 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.350
 or objects that he has to decide somewhere else 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.790
 that's definitely a lot of fun 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.440
 first is double 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.440
 that usually costs the euro or something 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.780
 Esser Document 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.940
 free 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.610
 that's what it's about 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.610
 this cut 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.770
 so high is possible 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.770
 to stop again until the morning 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.900
 that of qe2 atom of course 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600
 and you have to climb 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 That we build as straight as possible is not happening 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.190
 Brandy Zizmann she can do it 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.320
 and that was it 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 Jolie came 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.430
 that's definitely fun too 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.430
 That's about this little car 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.439
 To disturb minimum goal 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.859
 you have to stop it 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.209
 he overcomes such obstacles 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.209
 that could make the car big too 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.739
 "He's a bit weird with the controls sometimes 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.249
 sometimes it's not quite true about physics though 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.249
 "It's definitely a lot of fun 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.779
 then as I am going to give you Trees for 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.929
 here you could 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:49.359
 and if he was gone she would do it herself 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.359
 we can control ourselves people here so 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.309
 - let use 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.469
 The goal is always 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.939
 in the sun there 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.139
 too long 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.909
 You have to build bridges 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.569
 paint or 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.799
 which stairs 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.090
 then it comes from the difficulty was in the end it will be 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.479
 definitely quite difficult 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.609
 as a class war already
