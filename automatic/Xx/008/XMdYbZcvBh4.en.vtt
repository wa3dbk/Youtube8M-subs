00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
you're going to be able to perform the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.370 
you're going to be able to perform the
same<00:04:22.610> pace<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.240> normally<00:04:23.360> do<00:04:23.720> but<00:04:24.200> you

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
same pace that you normally do but you

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.409 
same pace that you normally do but you

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
basically just work the same system and

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.670 
basically just work the same system and
got<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.060> same<00:04:32.300> benefits<00:04:33.140> without

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
got the same benefits without

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.770 
got the same benefits without
overworking<00:04:34.370> yourself<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:35.120> ended<00:04:35.330> up<00:04:35.419> you

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
overworking yourself and ended up you

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.740 
overworking yourself and ended up you
know<00:04:35.810> sick<00:04:36.200> in<00:04:36.380> two<00:04:36.560> days
