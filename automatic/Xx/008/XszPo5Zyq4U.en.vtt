00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.220
 a video on call of duty so in 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.610

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.140
 assault in dimon no need to explain 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.630

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.149
 world of you this is how aja 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.370
 see so we will not dwell on it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.309
 and I intend to send this video to coast 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.110
 this subject because apparently I say well 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.300
 apparently in the world of youtube 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.430
 there are not a lot of people who 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.190
 have made videos on rifles 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.480
 assault diamond for my part I 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.510
 saw that about 3 tabs and americans d 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.090
 to have a diamond and a french but this 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.430
 was not commenting so that's why 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.600
 that I propose to you 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.880

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.580

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.590

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.560
 so here as you can see from 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.140
 just now I'm lying games shows 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 sorry the camouflage on the weapons 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.710
 like what I have them all 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.400
 obviously to have it north and a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.869
 times all after having them in diamonds 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.189
 so I also want to clarify that this is 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.140
 not me who did the congratulations and 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.180
 diamonds it's a little bit of my team a friend 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.920
 my friend legend it was well done 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.110
 crave all the gold coins for 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.280
 to have them in diamonds carlina anyway 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.000
 nine assault rifles 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.130
 the nanos and 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.110
 so there I speak I speak less we are 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.470
 already on the example of the late hem it is 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.180
 already finished pretty stylish with diamonds 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.620
 do not go bad finally that's it you want that 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.229
 the on the tipp 20 rooms that has it 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.460
 a lot of it is frankly the most 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.610
 bling bling and that's the one that 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.470
 I appreciate the most a diamond the very 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.630
 stylish look will naples 1 on the side 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.209
 there it would really class a small 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.920
 killcam with and all that is all 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.920
 the people they want after the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.510
 pick up is all really very stylish 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.150
 now the swat 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.980
 arma burst complicated not to ta 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.300
 beauty of doing t-shirts and doing 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.040
 burst jets it's more or less 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.600
 to heat up after that depends on whether we have the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.850
 shot selector has subsequently 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.060
 but here's so much charge gina 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.680
 some on the load I find 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.910
 this weapon is a little less stylish 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.270
 that others there are a lot less of 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.540
 diamonds 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.540
 it's my personal opinion now 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.880
 is on the fal guns blow to blow by 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.310
 coup I know more exactly very stylish 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.680
 to the worker kodjovi currencies there are full 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.709
 of diamonds is really very stylish f 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.910
 well full of diamond along with tears 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.590
 also to a stylus and now the m 27 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.840
 weapons for me that looks a lot like 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.239
 the modern warfare greenhouse 3 levels 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.590
 retreat after I say that's what 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.269
 impressions I do not know to say 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.370
 that she has already left etc 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.830
 I just say like that she makes me 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.380
 think of her this while at the bottom sailing 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.410
 also on it as on each 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.890
 weapon with the gold that stands out the diamonds 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.480
 and others alas lascars h 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.150
 arndt a lot of noise I find brief 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.980
 it's simple a simple parenthesis 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.560
 believe there are a lot of diamonds she 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.560
 also very stylish like all the others 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.380
 weapons of course after now we're going 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.160
 pass on the m14 of modern warfare 3 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.459
 for my taste it's just starting 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.560
 his mother is so it's the smr trees 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.549
 piecemeal and there you see that 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.880
 since just now I'm trying to 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.989
 shoot on the sun poor sun so 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.260
 that's when they really recharge 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.290
 very stylish and everything is now the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.760
 Hague mutare weapons by gusts of 4.6 I 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.700
 do not me 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.319
 do not count sf for my opinion the second 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.930
 most stylish weapon in diamond we see 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.610
 it does not really hurt at all 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.959
 almost like a level 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.650
 diamonds he has almost as much as the 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.239
 tipp 25 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.129
 it's really a style is very 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.090
 pleasant to the eyes and so on 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.489
 really happy 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.100
 frankly I have to my buddy he's gonna I him 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.470
 have respect so here we come to 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.079
 the last weapon a diamond of the n 94 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.669
 the video is already finished I hope she 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.800
 Thank you for putting a gem 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.080
 for the work of my friend to myself 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.400
