00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 I got people and I'm more today. 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.470
 illuminated as you can see first 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.910
 photographing with my soft boxes 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.800
 so I want your opinion of you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.540
 they think lighting is better than 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.530
 This angle is better, then, fine, how? 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.299
 nobody here for me 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.730
 A lot of people have already asked me to talk about 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.869
 the blue stain that I have at the moment the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.279
 check noted and today I solved 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.720
 to record a video for you guys saw some 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.670
 doubts about my hair that I am 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.109
 doing my hair that had a tower 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.109
 touching the wick at last 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.250
 so come on 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.350
 when I chose my hair to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.719
 what was my idea was 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.210
 I wish I had painted sorry to leave 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.730
 grow healthier to stop painting 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 so it's not that the dark brown btg 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.210
 to grow without having 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.770
 what to change that I am a person 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.739
 I can not keep my hair 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.230
 normal for me brown hair 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.840
 totally dark is normal 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.120
 so I was a little agonized wanting 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.640
 change soon and I decided to make the wick 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.640
 which is something that would not change in that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200
 decision to grow naturally is 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.960
 it is also different from the way I 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.840
 I like table continues growing natural 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.659
 cet-rio touches the root and at the same time has 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.549
 the wick that leaves a little more of the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.400
 my hair's personality 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.479
 When I started to paint my hair this time. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.290
 blue stain 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.810
 I started with the ink hardy colors 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.340
 diesel green that she is the most turquoise 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.590
 I cry for green 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.000
 Yeah, I have a video on the channel that goes 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.439
 leave in the information bank when 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.079
 It was today I tried all my 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.380
 Tips with this paint look wonderful 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.990
 and I love this ink that I got a good one 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.270
 My wick time just starts from here. 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.220
 there was passing the time passing the time 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 and always playing bad 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.070
 the online room sent this ink here 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.350
 It's light blue. I tried a couple of times. 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.189
 with the article turned blue it looked good 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.829
 pretty 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.829
 I even had the idea of mixing the two tones 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.310
 since there is bad is half pulled by 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.979
 Sometimes because I love you 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.959
 resulted in a phase nor the blue I solved 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.530
 mix both of them every time I 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.180
 would retouch to see what it gave and gave 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.770
 Some people lately what I most 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.890
 I'm using a couple of mixes 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.010
 middle folders is a medium blue 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.709
 turquoise that when turn is 1 from the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.940
 It all premieres at last the two feints I 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.040
 I'm using it now on the wick. 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.099
 lock it takes a little here 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.610
 fringe a little here the side 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.600
 right as I did this wick I separated 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.860
 here o 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.400
 in the ear line also separates here in the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.400
 ear row more or less separate 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.650
 this part is a little bit of fringe here 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.269
 I went here 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:00.019
 so I share this part that all I 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:03.349
 I did not get to this I left the two three 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.260
 from their roots and cover all 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.769
 parts with the x 40 discolor all this 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.870
 part and there is the attention that when playing 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.239
 fred on this side has a little bit of 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.280
 fringe and continues here on the side is 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.900
 Fan that I like to paint my hair I 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.359
 I like to leave this way this way. 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.310
 So I 'm going to touch up my hair since 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.890
 he's kind of green voting here in 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.420
 magazine spot between then will dinho 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.380
 play with you so you can see how 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.859
 It looks good after I touch how I do it. 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.139
 to touch up people I do it already already 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:40.250
 I just used to separate and do well 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:44.950
 Quickly, bring some fringe here. 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.540
 I separate that it is not the same thing here 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.180
 always take a little more of the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.700
 hair that is brown but does not have 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.069
 problem we do not reach another one 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.190
 brown hair that leaves the green for 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.620
 touch them up because there's no problem 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.560
 because hair that is not discolor the 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.600
 hair that is dark does not take ink 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.850
 fantasy is unless we do 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.030
 a farm to look blonde and then 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.370
 we pass an attack and colorful 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.530
 so if I'm going to get this from here, everything 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.480
 including the root for example 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.609
 but will not get the only part going 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.000
 pick up is part already colored because 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:27.200
 it's discolored then put a 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.830
 Here in the little pot of toning 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.990
 of the online room that is blue and coloco 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.220
 also a little of the diesel green dan 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.880
 hardy colors is a little darker 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:46.070
 I put it - and then I move all this 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:49.100
 mix will get 1 blue much more 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.280
 The color in the hair is beautiful. 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.240
 people 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.880
 O 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.590
 I mixed the two and that quantity and 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.310
 Missouri, it 's what I do for my wick. 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.730
 OK 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.730
 no secret, I do everything 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.740
 dinho 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:25.540
 Are you there, I'm in a roll, son so for some 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:28.370
 10 15 minutes in chagos eco evolta 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.789
 so we rinse the law 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:35.840
 You can already see how the marquinhos 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:40.370
 If you want somebody happy 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.700
 the intruder is already what you want 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.700
 now 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.530
 just know that kay is not a very medium bowls 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.830
 and what does not happen try to do nothing I found 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:20.940
 The more you see it, the more it stays. 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.130
 so it turns blue with a little 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.370
 turquoise and do not know whether to give in to see 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.510
 video is how much he is turquoise more 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.630
 personally it is a little 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.310
 why so here on this bottom 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.820
 always gets a bit bluer because the 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:38.330
 sheet to discolor back there first 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.280
 when I started to discolor hair 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.720
 discolored first that mechinha there I 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.910
 I got carried away, I liked it 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.340
 the other day I said it was everything then 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.260
 which was a little clearer but 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.139
 No problem for me it also differs. 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.430
 Because I like the result, it's going to 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:57.419
 chapinha that leaves me just a little bit 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.130
 more cute, ready people , just like that 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.289
 not to be too rebellious also gives 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.090
 to see a little more video and stayed 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:06.240
 so that's what I am doing my 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.849
 hair in the last months is for who 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.950
 I wondered why I was wearing it? 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:13.919
 two together lately at first no 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.479
 start green only and now use both 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.630
 Together, I know you have enjoyed it. 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:21.000
 do not forget to visit the 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.610
 blog also forgot about badges 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.840
 neshat for us to get more intimate 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.960
 close 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.840
 it also highlights everything so exotic 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.510
 So that 's it with a kiss until the next 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.349
 21 suggestions mother in the middle I commented 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.349
 here below such
