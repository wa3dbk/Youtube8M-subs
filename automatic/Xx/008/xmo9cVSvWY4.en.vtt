00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
something that's magnetic or you can use

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.590 
something that's magnetic or you can use
the<00:01:02.100> magnetic<00:01:02.399> mounts<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.910> come<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the magnetic mounts that come with it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.560 
the magnetic mounts that come with it
to<00:01:03.899> adjust<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.920> angles<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:05.970> set<00:01:06.479> up

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to adjust the angles as you like set up

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.330

was<00:01:06.720> also<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.320> easy<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:07.920> thing<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
was also really easy with this thing I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.090 
was also really easy with this thing I
don't<00:01:08.520> really<00:01:08.670> fancy<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.330> big<00:01:09.869> square<00:01:10.470> plastic

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
don't really fancy a big square plastic

don't really fancy a big square plastic
box<00:01:11.369> next<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> my<00:01:11.970> router<00:01:12.210> especially<00:01:12.810> because

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
box next to my router especially because

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.109 
box next to my router especially because
my<00:01:13.260> router<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.860> centrally<00:01:14.340> located<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.939> my

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
my router is centrally located in my

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.510 
my router is centrally located in my
living<00:01:15.330> room<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.740> kind<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.189> necessity

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
living room but it's kind of a necessity

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.850 
living room but it's kind of a necessity
because<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.110> provides<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
because this is what provides the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
because this is what provides the
constant<00:01:20.460> connection<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.479> allows<00:01:21.750> these

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
constant connection that allows these

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.649 
constant connection that allows these
things<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.950> several<00:01:23.909> feet<00:01:23.970> away<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
things to be several feet away up to

things to be several feet away up to
several<00:01:25.170> hundred<00:01:25.530> feet<00:01:25.560> away<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:26.130> thing<00:01:26.159> I'd

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
several hundred feet away one thing I'd

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.130 
several hundred feet away one thing I'd
also<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.909> looking<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.720> kind<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
also be looking for with this kind of

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.469 
also be looking for with this kind of
hub<00:01:28.350> set<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.009> third<00:01:29.520> party<00:01:29.759> connectivity

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
hub set up is third party connectivity

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.719 
hub set up is third party connectivity
and<00:01:30.990> while<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.259> isn't<00:01:31.560> an<00:01:31.619> option<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:31.979> now

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
and while that isn't an option right now

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.060 
and while that isn't an option right now
Netgear<00:01:33.180> did<00:01:33.390> say<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.960> ZigBee<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> z-wave

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
Netgear did say that ZigBee and z-wave

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130 
Netgear did say that ZigBee and z-wave
integrations<00:01:35.970> could<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> thing<00:01:37.020> that's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
integrations could be a thing that's

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.630 
integrations could be a thing that's
happening<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> future<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.280> stay<00:01:38.310> tuned

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
happening in the future so stay tuned

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.550 
happening in the future so stay tuned
for<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.060> thing<00:01:39.390> these<00:01:39.720> don't<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.320> that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
for that one thing these don't have that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
I kind of wish they did is audio so

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.330 
I kind of wish they did is audio so
there's<00:01:42.960> no<00:01:43.110> audio<00:01:43.470> trigger<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.159> hears
