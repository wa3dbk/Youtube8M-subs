00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
over here we can see a new biome which

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.469 
over here we can see a new biome which
is<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.409> roof<00:01:28.770> forest<00:01:29.460> which<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.329> my

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is the roof forest which is in my

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.469 
is the roof forest which is in my
opinion<00:01:30.509> very<00:01:30.990> very<00:01:31.560> cool<00:01:31.920> because<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:33.000> has

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
opinion very very cool because it has

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.550 
opinion very very cool because it has
all<00:01:33.810> these<00:01:34.140> cool<00:01:34.950> strats<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.110> trees<00:01:37.110> not

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
all these cool strats and trees not

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.730 
all these cool strats and trees not
these<00:01:37.799> normal<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:39.240> block<00:01:39.570> trees<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.350> this

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
these normal one block trees like this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.670 
these normal one block trees like this
one<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.640> kind<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.390> bigger<00:01:42.659> ones<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.439> also

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
one but kind of bigger ones and it also

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.389 
one but kind of bigger ones and it also
is<00:01:44.220> good<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.000> rain<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:46.470> example<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.250> have

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
is good for rain for example if you have

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.060 
is good for rain for example if you have
lots<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.000> lots<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.420> rain<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.899> your<00:01:49.079> world<00:01:49.380> you

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
lots and lots of rain in your world you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
can just go underneath these trees and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.249 
can just go underneath these trees and
the<00:01:52.560> rain<00:01:52.829> does<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.700> matter<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.540> anymore

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so um yeah this is a biome which is

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.889 
so um yeah this is a biome which is
really<00:02:01.469> really<00:02:01.740> cool<00:02:02.070> located<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.060> DC<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
really really cool located in DC and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.840 
really really cool located in DC and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.449 
it there's this swamp biome and this one
biome<00:02:27.550> features<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.390> which<00:02:28.900> up<00:02:29.170> right<00:02:29.800> next<00:02:30.310> to

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
biome features a which up right next to

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.729 
biome features a which up right next to
the<00:02:30.640> roof<00:02:30.940> forest<00:02:31.450> isn't<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.110> cool

the roof forest isn't that cool

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.310 
the roof forest isn't that cool
it<00:02:33.160> sure<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:33.730> let's<00:02:34.180> see<00:02:34.450> if<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.810> witch<00:02:35.110> is

not so yeah there you got it
which<00:02:48.040> had<00:02:48.280> at<00:02:48.519> these<00:02:48.790> coordinates<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.810> let's

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
which had at these coordinates and let's

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.540 
which had at these coordinates and let's
move<00:02:51.100> on<00:02:51.630> okay<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:52.900> now<00:02:53.410> that<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.920> found<00:02:54.190> that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
move on okay so now that we found that

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.390 
move on okay so now that we found that
we<00:02:55.000> can<00:02:55.180> go<00:02:55.360> on<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.900> do<00:02:56.170> our<00:02:56.410> little<00:02:56.709> x-ray

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
we can go on and do our little x-ray

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.509 
we can go on and do our little x-ray
test<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:58.390> check<00:02:58.660> for<00:02:58.720> dungeons<00:02:59.560> being<00:02:59.950> or<00:03:00.160> not

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
test to check for dungeons being or not

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.750 
test to check for dungeons being or not
being<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.320> showed<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:02.980> another<00:03:03.310> video

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
night vision so you can actually see

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.460 
night vision so you can actually see
what<00:03:17.799> is<00:03:17.950> going<00:03:18.519> on<00:03:18.700> okay<00:03:19.570> lots<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.170> lots<00:03:20.320> of

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
caves and mobs a ravine over there a

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.819 
caves and mobs a ravine over there a
ravine<00:03:25.239> over<00:03:25.570> there<00:03:25.780> if<00:03:26.049> there<00:03:26.350> would<00:03:26.590> be<00:03:26.620> a

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
ravine over there if there would be a

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.840 
ravine over there if there would be a
dungeon<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.459> would<00:03:27.700> have<00:03:27.940> this<00:03:28.350> square<00:03:29.350> shape

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
dungeon it would have this square shape

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.830 
dungeon it would have this square shape
is<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:31.660> one<00:03:32.019> back<00:03:32.260> there<00:03:33.060> nope<00:03:34.060> that's<00:03:34.420> just

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
is that one back there nope that's just

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.080 
is that one back there nope that's just
mine<00:03:35.200> shaft

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
mine shaft

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.789 
mine shaft
does<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.239> seem<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:37.600> there<00:03:37.900> are<00:03:38.049> any<00:03:38.079> dungeons

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
does it seem like there are any dungeons

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.940 
does it seem like there are any dungeons
around<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.700> slime<00:03:40.000> over<00:03:40.450> there<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.049> let's

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
around just a slime over there and let's

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.340 
around just a slime over there and let's
check<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.760> other<00:03:43.000> direction<00:03:44.850> at<00:03:45.850> the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
check in the other direction at the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.300 
check in the other direction at the
direction<00:03:47.350> okay

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
direction okay

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.080 
direction okay
so<00:03:50.040> doesn't<00:03:51.040> seem<00:03:51.340> like<00:03:51.549> there<00:03:51.820> are<00:03:51.970> any

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
so doesn't seem like there are any

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.110 
so doesn't seem like there are any
dungeons<00:03:52.780> bar<00:03:53.130> therefore<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.280> got<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.790> witch

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
dungeons bar therefore you got the witch

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.569 
dungeons bar therefore you got the witch
hut<00:03:55.360> which<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.049> can<00:03:56.200> use<00:03:56.410> for<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.799> witch<00:03:57.250> farm

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
hut which you can use for a witch farm

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.750 
hut which you can use for a witch farm
because<00:03:57.820> it's<00:03:58.090> perfectly<00:03:59.070> located<00:04:00.070> all<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.640> a

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
because it's perfectly located all in a

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.140 
because it's perfectly located all in a
swampland<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.570> thus<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.859> can<00:04:03.280> spawn<00:04:03.640> which<00:04:03.970> is

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
swampland and thus it can spawn which is

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.500 
swampland and thus it can spawn which is
all<00:04:04.359> over<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.959> place<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.820> can<00:04:07.000> for

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
all over the place so you can for

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.870 
all over the place so you can for
example<00:04:07.989> start<00:04:08.380> two<00:04:08.620> layers<00:04:08.920> one<00:04:09.340> layer<00:04:09.370> being

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
example start two layers one layer being

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.270 
example start two layers one layer being
here<00:04:10.209> for<00:04:10.810> spawning<00:04:11.109> witches<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.130> other

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
here for spawning witches and the other

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.660 
here for spawning witches and the other
one<00:04:12.549> being<00:04:13.180> up<00:04:13.510> here<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.350> then<00:04:15.010> they'll<00:04:15.220> spawn

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
one being up here and then they'll spawn

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.300 
one being up here and then they'll spawn
fall<00:04:16.209> down<00:04:16.510> into<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:17.049> pit

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
fall down into a pit

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.210 
fall down into a pit
that's<00:04:18.700> another<00:04:19.120> thing<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:20.290> check<00:04:20.769> out<00:04:20.980> other

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
that's another thing so check out other

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.510 
that's another thing so check out other
rich<00:04:22.090> farm<00:04:22.450> tutorials<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:23.500> haven't<00:04:24.130> done<00:04:24.250> one

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
rich farm tutorials I haven't done one

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.240 
rich farm tutorials I haven't done one
because<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.150> don't<00:04:25.870> really<00:04:26.020> meant<00:04:26.500> them<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:26.950> I

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
because I don't really meant them and I

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.360 
because I don't really meant them and I
don't<00:04:27.340> think<00:04:27.639> that<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.300> too<00:04:28.630> good<00:04:28.900> but<00:04:29.680> as<00:04:30.100> you

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
don't think that is too good but as you

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.879 
don't think that is too good but as you
can<00:04:30.520> see<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:31.030> roof<00:04:31.270> forest<00:04:31.750> is<00:04:31.960> going<00:04:32.410> on<00:04:32.650> from

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
can see the roof forest is going on from

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.840 
can see the roof forest is going on from
here<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.340> goes<00:04:34.000> up<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.360> there<00:04:35.200> up<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:36.070> that

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
here and goes up to there up to that

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.430 
here and goes up to there up to that
little<00:04:37.450> hill<00:04:37.750> right<00:04:38.080> there

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
little hill right there

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.280 
little hill right there
so<00:04:39.070> lots<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.700> roof<00:04:39.940> forests<00:04:40.450> to<00:04:40.630> explore<00:04:41.020> and
