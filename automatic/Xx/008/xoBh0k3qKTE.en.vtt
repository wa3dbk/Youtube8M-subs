got<00:01:32.400> scorpion<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> think<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.110> can

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
got scorpion so I think what we can

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.160 
got scorpion so I think what we can
expect<00:01:34.890> from<00:01:35.400> black<00:01:35.790> ops<00:01:35.970> free<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.390> sort<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
expect from black ops free is sort of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.719 
expect from black ops free is sort of
the<00:01:37.380> same<00:01:37.650> sort<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:37.979> prestige<00:01:38.310> emblems<00:01:38.670> which

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the same sort of prestige emblems which

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.160 
the same sort of prestige emblems which
I'm<00:01:38.939> actually<00:01:39.060> quite<00:01:39.240> happy<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.630> because<00:01:39.900> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I'm actually quite happy with because I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.319 
I'm actually quite happy with because I
am<00:01:40.290> very<00:01:40.829> content<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.820> blackhawks<00:01:42.180> won

a<00:01:42.390> black<00:01:42.600> ops<00:01:42.780> 2<00:01:42.899> prestige<00:01:42.930> emblems<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.619> think

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
a black ops 2 prestige emblems I think

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.749 
a black ops 2 prestige emblems I think
there<00:01:43.890> are<00:01:43.979> some<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> best<00:01:44.430> prestige

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
there are some of the best prestige

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.850 
there are some of the best prestige
emblems<00:01:45.149> from<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> call<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.470> duty's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
emblems from all of the call of duty's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.160 
emblems from all of the call of duty's
so<00:01:47.759> what<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.180> expect<00:01:48.299> from<00:01:48.540> black<00:01:48.810> ops<00:01:49.020> 3

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
so what we can expect from black ops 3

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.139 
so what we can expect from black ops 3
prestige<00:01:49.320> emblems<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.130> go<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.340> black<00:01:50.909> ops<00:01:51.060> 1

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
get that from black ops 3 because ala

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.140 
get that from black ops 3 because ala
said<00:02:40.300> i<00:02:40.450> really<00:02:41.170> really<00:02:41.380> do<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.910> black

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150
