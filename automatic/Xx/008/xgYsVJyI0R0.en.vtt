the<00:01:35.970> similarity<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.720> Randall<00:01:37.470> Cobb<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.920> does

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the similarity to Randall Cobb and does

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.590 
the similarity to Randall Cobb and does
that<00:01:38.220> maybe<00:01:38.460> work<00:01:38.700> against<00:01:39.119> him<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.509> bit

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that maybe work against him a little bit

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.420 
that maybe work against him a little bit
because<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:40.110> I'm<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.770> offensive<00:01:41.220> coordinator

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
why run a play for ty Montgomery when I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.780 
why run a play for ty Montgomery when I

more<00:01:46.320> proven<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> look<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:47.640> Randall

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
more proven you have a look at Randall

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.999 
more proven you have a look at Randall
Cobb<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> different<00:01:48.479> way<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
Cobb a different way now I think is you

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.080 
Cobb a different way now I think is you
know<00:01:50.100> he<00:01:50.220> came<00:01:50.490> into<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.729> league<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.970> this

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
know he came into the league is this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.510 
know he came into the league is this
kind<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.390> X<00:01:51.780> fun<00:01:52.229> fact<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:52.860> kind<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
kind of like X fun fact or kind of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.399 
kind of like X fun fact or kind of
developed<00:01:53.939> into<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.270> second<00:01:54.899> wide<00:01:55.020> receiver

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
developed into that second wide receiver

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.679 
developed into that second wide receiver
now<00:01:56.100> he's<00:01:56.310> got<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.579> step<00:01:56.759> into<00:01:56.969> unless<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:57.600> do

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
now he's got to step into unless they do

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.789 
now he's got to step into unless they do
something<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:58.049> were<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.200> put<00:01:58.350> Davante<00:01:58.770> Adams

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
something we were to put Davante Adams

a<00:02:01.079> lot<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> attention<00:02:01.680> paid<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.920> Cobb<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.640> he's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
a lot of attention paid to Cobb so he's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.960 
gonna be blanketed I think Montgomery's
gonna<00:02:07.350> follow<00:02:07.619> into<00:02:08.039> Cobbs<00:02:08.280> footsteps<00:02:08.789> Oh

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
gonna follow into Cobbs footsteps Oh

gonna follow into Cobbs footsteps Oh
honestly<00:02:09.179> that's<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.229> way<00:02:10.379> Montgomery's

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
more passing yards I think what happens

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.200 
more passing yards I think what happens
is<00:03:24.710> when<00:03:24.830> he<00:03:24.890> goes<00:03:25.040> over<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.310> 300<00:03:25.790> yard<00:03:25.940> mark

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
is when he goes over that 300 yard mark

is when he goes over that 300 yard mark
he<00:03:26.360> makes<00:03:26.540> such<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.720> big<00:03:26.810> splash<00:03:27.230> it'll<00:03:28.100> be<00:03:28.160> it

won't just be like 301 you know it'll be

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.260 
won't just be like 301 you know it'll be
like<00:03:30.050> 400<00:03:30.740> with<00:03:30.890> three<00:03:31.100> touchdowns<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:32.060> I

pasta to Russell Shepard of that game as

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.640 
pasta to Russell Shepard of that game as
well<00:04:55.690> unfortunately<00:04:56.690> at<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:57.230> end<00:04:57.380> of<00:04:57.440> it<00:04:57.530> he

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
well unfortunately at the end of it he

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.410 
well unfortunately at the end of it he
was<00:04:57.860> hobbling<00:04:58.100> off<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.550> field<00:04:58.760> as<00:04:58.970> well<00:04:59.120> so<00:04:59.300> we

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
was hobbling off the field as well so we

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.730 
was hobbling off the field as well so we
have<00:04:59.540> to<00:04:59.630> kind<00:04:59.870> of<00:04:59.990> go<00:05:00.080> both<00:05:00.260> ways<00:05:00.500> but

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
have to kind of go both ways but

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.620 
have to kind of go both ways but
assuming<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.520> Jameis<00:05:01.820> is<00:05:01.970> healthy<00:05:02.330> coming

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
assuming that Jameis is healthy coming

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.540 
assuming that Jameis is healthy coming
out<00:05:02.750> of<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:02.870> were<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:03.890> impressed<00:05:04.130> with<00:05:04.400> him

coordinator last three years he was in

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.090

Atlanta<00:05:22.760> he<00:05:23.450> was<00:05:23.600> like<00:05:23.750> six<00:05:24.080> ninth<00:05:24.380> and<00:05:24.650> sixth

and<00:05:25.220> passing<00:05:25.550> attempts<00:05:25.910> years<00:05:26.480> before<00:05:26.780> that

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
and passing attempts years before that

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.840 
and passing attempts years before that
in<00:05:27.020> Jacksonville<00:05:27.620> he<00:05:27.950> was<00:05:28.100> top<00:05:28.370> ten<00:05:28.670> in

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.030 
in Jacksonville he was top ten in
rushing<00:05:29.510> attempts<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:30.050> think<00:05:30.620> four<00:05:30.800> or<00:05:30.830> five

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
rushing attempts I think four or five

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.520 
rushing attempts I think four or five
times<00:05:31.310> this<00:05:32.120> guy<00:05:32.270> knows<00:05:32.720> how<00:05:32.930> to<00:05:32.960> be

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
times this guy knows how to be

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.050 
times this guy knows how to be
successful<00:05:33.740> either<00:05:34.220> as<00:05:34.430> a<00:05:34.460> runner<00:05:34.730> or<00:05:35.030> a

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
successful either as a runner or a

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.090 
successful either as a runner or a
passing<00:05:35.480> coordinator<00:05:35.960> and<00:05:36.200> Jameis<00:05:36.770> Winston

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
passing coordinator and Jameis Winston

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.650 
passing coordinator and Jameis Winston
can<00:05:37.220> do<00:05:37.310> both<00:05:37.490> so<00:05:38.150> I<00:05:38.210> think<00:05:38.300> he's<00:05:38.450> going<00:05:38.570> to

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
can do both so I think he's going to

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.540 
can do both so I think he's going to
play<00:05:38.750> into<00:05:38.960> his<00:05:39.080> strengths<00:05:39.560> der<00:05:40.010> cutters<00:05:40.340> been

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
play into his strengths der cutters been

for her b 22 your point you know of

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:44.579 
for her b 22 your point you know of
course<00:07:42.459> there<00:07:42.669> are<00:07:42.789> cases<00:07:43.779> on<00:07:44.079> either<00:07:44.229> side

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:45.969 
but you could maybe make the argument

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:48.029
