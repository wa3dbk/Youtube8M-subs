00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.430
 in the past videos of this series 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.660
 we have been discussing each of these 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.180
 sets of numbers that make up 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.100
 our numerical system we have gone 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.020
 discussing their properties and what are 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.000
 the methods that have been developed for 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.560
 do math with them in the past 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.200
 election we discussed the numbers 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.970
 imaginary and one of the most 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.160
 important that we mentioned is that the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.650
 imaginary numbers are like any 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.119
 another of those groups has reality 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.130
 they came to emerge to explain 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.189
 situations not explained until that 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.159
 moment specifically the incognito of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.499
 which was the square root of minus 1 and 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.999
 that that number was called and he could 

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:41.550
 have the call of any other 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:43.640
 way that's really irrelevant what 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.179
 what is truly relevant is the 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.760
 properties that have been developed 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:50.159
 around these numbers and the methods 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.559
 that have been developed to integrate them 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.839
 to the rest of our numerical system in 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.839
 this video we are going to concentrate on the 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.789
 group that is at the top of our 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.370
 numerical system that is the group of the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.850
 complex numbers 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.540
 a complex number has the form to more 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.580
 beautiful where a is the real part and go and be 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.580
 know as the imaginary part and now 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.850
 see is a real number that means 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:22.970
 which can be any number like 05 - 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.180
 31.8 radical of 2 a quarter any 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.830
 number that is real now how about a 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.930
 number like 5 5 a complex number if you 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.869
 it's because remember that the numbers 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.090
 complexes are at the top of our 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.340
 numerical system or that all the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.100
 numbers we use are complex numbers 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.720
 in the case of 5 for example we know that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.210
 belongs to the set of numbers 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.380
 natural that is also a number 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.220
 whole that is a rational number and that 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.860
 it's a real number but above all it's a 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.390
 complex number what happens is that the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.979
 imaginary part is zero 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.950
 that is, all the numbers that we 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.729
 we have been using are actually 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.569
 complex numbers the most with the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.640
 imaginary part to zero now that they 're 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.010
 important about complex numbers 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.830
 so look at the complex numbers first 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.790
 that nothing is like any other kind of 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.060
 numbers 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.400
 its function is basically to expand 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.260
 our number system when you will 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.450
 add that imaginary part to a number 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.550
 real basically what you are doing is 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.520
 that is converting a number that is 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.970
 traditionally one-dimensional in a 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.070
 two-dimensional number and maybe that does not 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.489
 make so much sense now but agree 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.070
 let's go through the course let's go 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.459
 seeing examples of how to get numbers 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.010
 complexes dramatically expands our 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.290
 numerical system and our ability 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.790
 to solve problems that we see in the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.010
 world around us 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.049
 just as it happens with the numbers that 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.239
 they only have a real part 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.430
 complex numbers have properties 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.930
 and methods now have a series of 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.409
 properties that as I mentioned 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.640
 previously expand dramatically in 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.239
 our numerical system 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.379
 I can with complex numbers add 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:22.650
 subtract multiply divide search 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.269
 magnitude direction and many things 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.569
 more than as I told you, let's go 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.879
 learning through these courses 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.090
 now an important thing about the 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.310
 complex numbers is that they have what 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.109
 it's called a geometric interpretation 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.239
 I'm going to talk a little bit about this now 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.700
 without going into much detail only 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.840
 so that you have an idea when I 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.579
 I'm working with the numbers 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.169
 negative for example one thing that I 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.480
 I can do with a negative number is 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.519
 change the address if I'm 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.470
 pointing to one side and multiplied by 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.340
 negative one I go diametrically 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.720
 opposite 180 degrees 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.530
 now in the case of numbers 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.019
 complexes when I multiply by that 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.750
 imaginary part instead of causing a 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.810
 rotation of 180 degrees causes me a 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.940
 rotation of 90 degrees and it can be no 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.069
 only 90 degrees but of any 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.410
 angle in between that is extremely 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.180
 important when we are working with 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.430
 some situations of nature 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.079
 where we will traditionally solve them 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.289
 using trigonometric functions 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.389
 in that sense the complex numbers are 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.639
 extremely useful and much more 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.710
 compact to solve a series of 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.599
 problems for the moment we're going to 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.370
 leave here we will see it on the 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.560
 march now what I do want 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.840
 you will take away from this lesson is that 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.789
 when they talk about the imaginary part 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.400
 of a number or when they talk to you about 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.620
 complex numbers and give your mind 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.469
 that idea is retrograde that we are 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.319
 talking about an exoteric thing 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:54.690
 mysterious that out of this world nothing 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:57.509
 what to see, we're really talking about 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.639
 numbers like any others that have 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.349
 properties and they have methods that we 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.810
 help to solve certain type of 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:07.610
 problems in fact always remember 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.280
 all numbers are complex numbers 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.449
 because that is the most general set of 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.449
 our numerical system
