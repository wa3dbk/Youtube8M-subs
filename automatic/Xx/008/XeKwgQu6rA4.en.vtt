 leave this or do not worry 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.420
 this is a bookstore that asks us to 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.739

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:08.099
 dragged to create a folder and what 

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:11.429
 they match the file folder 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:14.960
 compressed we open the folder and we give it 

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:16.880
 right click and extract here ok 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.830
 already send us what is the bookstore this 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.050
 what matters to us that the bookstore 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.020
 we click right to copy and that what 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.289
 let's do now we're going to go to the 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.020
 route where we installed our game that 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.930
 local disk will be program files and 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.710
 here the game folder and we're leaving 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.349
 to the plugins folder and here we paste this 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.319
 the bookstore we closed everything we opened 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:44.979
 and now if we double click and do not 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.979
 have to open 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.560
 good now this since it opened it if we 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.020
 he is missing since that bookstore do 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.520
 those steps well now I'm going to teach you 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.370
 to open it also with what is the 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.800
 playstation 1 emulator this is used 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.800
 a lot for other games is this 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.210
 important that if you have this emulator 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.430
 because I have several tutorials from others 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.760
 games were going to need this emulator ok 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:47.920
 well, they usually open it with the 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.400
 emulator we are going to double-click 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.490
 and of course on the emulator we are going to open 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:59.500
 the game that we're going to go file and run 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:01.720
 ok image but now we are going to go to 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.420
 where we install the game that is 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.080
 place program files a 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:11.110
 folder and it is important that it be the one that 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.280
 finish at point came ok that is this and 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.230
