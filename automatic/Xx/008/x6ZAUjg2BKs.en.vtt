00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:11.400
 We comment on sports trauma disorder of first-class player 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.210
 You are Nagata, the right thigh meat was separated, and the news that it was totally wiped out for six weeks came a while ago 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.850
 Ne 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:22.800
 Inter Milan for the muscle strain of the right Futoshimomoura of a say, but Japanese representative defender 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:27.210
 As a result of mri examination, it was announced that it was diagnosed in total injury for six weeks by the second stage injury 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.320
 There was news , I say this stage 2 grade 2 stage 2 well 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.480
 But well 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.290
 8 hey this whey 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.079
 I think that I do not use that much of the page classification that has been said and explained 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:43.650
 Well, there is no need to worry too much 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:49.320
 It is a so-called physical experience master It is also worth losing if speaking of Nagato players 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:52.100
 It is famous as a strong player of the landlord, but it is Nagatomo who has a strong sense of experience . 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 There are a lot of feelings, actually 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:01.699
 It has been repeated to say that the thickness of the thigh meat apart, and it has also hurt the ankle 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:07.009
 There is also a case that I went to the level that I might become meniscal injury surgery in a monkey 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:11.420
 There you this I why Well repeatedly we'll also Eeee of dislocation after shoulder to only 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.120
 I would like to consider a little bit about whether there are many art masters of experience masters 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.630
 Physical sensation 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.780
 What I'm First Performance up and say whether the purpose of the Tteyuu tiles 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:26.090
 Well if you can win a blur no trunk 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:31.039
 It is possible to go even if there is a strong physical condition with a piece of football , which is an interpersonal football , and then 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:36.790
 Just ride the speed and you can cope with various movements and turning. 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:39.770
 It has also been told to Fu that show a significant effect on disability prevention 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:45.710
 In I think this saving is the point where Tteyuu demand 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:51.920
 At the same time , the stability of the trunk, which is the basis of the work, is required when training the trunk 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:58.640
 It is a cat of the trunk that want regular aim Nante you want become this foundation is stable by Pas 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.700
 Because the upper body lower body power can be exercised more and said foundation is stretched 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.759
 Arm or 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:10.380
 It's a foot, so it's easy to demonstrate this power and it's still stable so it's a precise move 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:15.120
 If the accuracy is coming up I think it would that of this course 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.800
 But if you're just doing it, don't take care of a bit about what it means to be stable in the trunk 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.780
 I think I should not 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.930
 In fact yeah feeling specific also is it take torso training trunk in the data, but Tteyuu what point 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.290
 Though it is a problem that it is different depending on the person of Maya from the place 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.370
 I will do trunk training . Preventive effect of various hunger 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.460
 Say there is 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:39.770
 There is data that there is not data, too 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:44.510
 So it is a hand but I often do not know still 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:49.090
 Well it's that say the trunk Vic and such of whether or supple should be big tree does not even 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:53.390
 I think I know the point where I would like you to consider all means it is the words that say which should be such whether the length 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.240
 Is currently the Hey of the trunk training core training 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.200
 a 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.230
 Well as a big big way 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.410
 But still the Tteyuu experience is I say large tree answering 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.030
 Catch the trunk as a rigid body 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:13.560
 a very little I bad words little Katchikachi are trying to make experience 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:18.280
 the a Inner to say that no matter how I'm such training is often Kowakowa 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:22.670
 While saying that it is going to train for a more flexible and flexible trunk . 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:26.959
 After all training behavior itself is good 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.550
 There are many things in the same pretty tight posture 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:36.690
 a 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:41.430
 It seems to be a side plank , and various er training holds the trunk in its tight condition 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:45.370
 It after It's breakthrough is inter alia a balance ball 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:51.460
 Hold the trunk in that unstable 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:56.440
 There are many such trays or the lower body and upper body do not move the physical sensation 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:59.800
 Isn't it almost that training to keep this attitude ? 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.870
 This is the trunk as a rigid body 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:09.700
 It becomes training that imagines such a big tree of Kutchikachi 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:15.010
 Yes I'm right I'm still right 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:21.579
 But it is ridiculous that it okay if the in large tree as was really 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:23.270
 You can make the motion more flexible and it will not move the sensation itself in response to the momentary movement 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.190
 It is not good 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:31.060
 That the Tteyuu attitude of a desirable body stem in the 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.810
 It takes in every moment 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:40.600
 I can say I a supple bamboo I think the kana not the kind of image 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.080
 Wind that trunk training to train such a trunk is still more developed 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.530
 To 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:49.480
 It feels like it actually feels like there is still a point ahead even if you say the experience master 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.080
 I am thinking of myself 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.120
 Nagatomo players par 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.319
 Well, the staff is really just running, but it also runs at a great speed and turns back 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.479
 And 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:04.009
 Such as against a great wing and cider Tucker as a defense 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.060
 If you have a performance 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:09.840
 It may be inevitable that there is a lot of progress 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.410
 Still 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:19.639
 I think I'm a what if there is still experience is of was come up the ne performance so far 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.639
 But it is my own current view that there is still more 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:28.949
