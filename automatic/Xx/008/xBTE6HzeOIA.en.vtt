00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
corn seed then you can trade you could

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.560 
corn seed then you can trade you could
do<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.600> seed<00:04:07.110> exchange<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.950> pretty<00:04:08.700> soon<00:04:09.030> if

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
do a seed exchange and pretty soon if

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.780 
do a seed exchange and pretty soon if
everybody<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.560> mean<00:04:10.740> everybody<00:04:11.130> used<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.490> save

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
everybody I mean everybody used to save

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.910 
everybody I mean everybody used to save
their<00:04:12.000> own<00:04:12.030> seeds<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:13.440> it's<00:04:13.650> getting

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
their own seeds now it's getting

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.800 
their own seeds now it's getting
difficult<00:04:14.100> because<00:04:14.640> most<00:04:14.940> plants<00:04:15.330> are<00:04:15.420> hybrid

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
difficult because most plants are hybrid

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.020 
difficult because most plants are hybrid
and<00:04:15.960> most<00:04:16.440> seeds<00:04:16.680> are<00:04:16.890> hybrid<00:04:17.280> or<00:04:17.489> or

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
and most seeds are hybrid or or

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.650 
and most seeds are hybrid or or
genetically<00:04:18.660> modified<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:20.270> it's<00:04:21.270> all<00:04:21.450> about

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
genetically modified and it's all about

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.950 
genetically modified and it's all about
back<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:21.930> basic

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.680 

these<00:04:25.960> are<00:04:26.380> from<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:26.920> pumpkin<00:04:27.430> that<00:04:27.850> in<00:04:28.300> that

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
these are from that pumpkin that in that

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.310 
these are from that pumpkin that in that
you<00:04:28.900> saw<00:04:29.110> me<00:04:29.520> can<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:30.880> that<00:04:31.180> video<00:04:31.360> that<00:04:31.870> when<00:04:32.290> I

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
you saw me can in that video that when I

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.890 
you saw me can in that video that when I
was<00:04:32.620> canning<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.130> pumpkin<00:04:33.700> tubes<00:04:34.000> now<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.720> know

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
was canning the pumpkin tubes now I know

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.250 
was canning the pumpkin tubes now I know
these<00:04:35.290> worked<00:04:35.590> because<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.280> got<00:04:36.460> these<00:04:36.640> seeds

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
these worked because I got these seeds

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.430 
these worked because I got these seeds
from<00:04:38.310> last<00:04:39.310> year's<00:04:39.640> pumpkin<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:41.110> think

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
from last year's pumpkin and I think

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.260 
from last year's pumpkin and I think
that<00:04:41.620> was<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.890> jack-o'-lantern<00:04:42.580> pumpkin<00:04:42.610> so

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
that was the jack-o'-lantern pumpkin so

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.110 
that was the jack-o'-lantern pumpkin so
I'm<00:04:43.360> going<00:04:43.540> to<00:04:43.570> wait<00:04:43.690> until<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:44.020> do<00:04:44.170> my<00:04:44.560> a<00:04:45.130> couple

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
I'm going to wait until I do my a couple

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.730 
I'm going to wait until I do my a couple
of<00:04:46.240> sugar<00:04:46.480> baby<00:04:46.720> pumpkins<00:04:47.290> and<00:04:47.440> I'll<00:04:47.530> take

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
of sugar baby pumpkins and I'll take

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.190 
of sugar baby pumpkins and I'll take
seeds<00:04:48.010> from<00:04:48.220> them<00:04:48.400> which<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:48.790> took<00:04:48.850> from<00:04:49.200> plants
