00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hi everyone and only the block that dictates me 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.330
 record another video showing that 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.010
 news has arrived in the last weeks 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.929
 this time do not have a lot has only 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.580
 three types of partnerships and two books 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.559
 I bought start as usual with the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.030
 partnership books and received in partnership with 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.420
 with the company of letters 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.430
 book High fidelity or nick hornby 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.769
 food will not know how good it is as 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 pronounced is a well-known book by the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.820
 author is already considered if I am not mistaken 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.250
 a contemporary classic already makes a 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.920
 time he wrote, he had already 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.500
 been released earlier if I did not 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.770
 mistake was by Rocco publisher is this 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.570
 The book is from 1,195 already seen from fado by 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.730
 rocco editor I even think that a cover that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.040
 has two vinyl records and now the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.840
 company launched with this 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.950
 step that is also very beautiful and 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.410
 tells the story of a man he 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.660
 ended up having a relationship and he 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.879
 begins to list his girlfriends and has 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.309
 much to do with the music world if I 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.440
 I'm not mistaken on the book's night program. 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.420
 is a record store owner that seems to be a 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.379
 Very good book I only listen to talk super 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.030
 well of him 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.400
 I intend to read it possible to think in 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 In September I received in partnership with 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.840
 archer book publisher do not play 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.909
 with the fire of john gordon i adore 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.200
 exalted the two other books that he 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.150
 His that I do not know what you are 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.710
 thinking I closed my eyes 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.320
 wonderful for romance lovers 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.840
 he is very good he circulated 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.210
 we showed quite electrifying full of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.490
 suspense, all very well, I have connected 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.110
 end their books are very good, I 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.700
 I loved the first two and clean and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.740
 leaves that is the third of the same series 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.150
 but police are throwing independence 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.610
 so it does not matter which man you 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.950
 reads the most all of them are starred 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.450
 by the detective and say it here he goes 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.979
 talk about a serial killer who kills 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.649
 a person already registered 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.600
 if he was called the good shepherd, and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.420
 I was never caught after many years I 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.310
 I think the case will be reopened and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.570
 this shows that the profile traced in 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.400
 up to know what is completely 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.159
 different it seems that they have committed 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.110
 some crazy mistake, crazy crazy to read 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.060
 in review of his other two books 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.710
 on the blog even resends it or if you 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.360
 Thinking is the first resale or in 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.880
 partnership with the publisher is 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.229
 Old even when on 5 blog I go 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.909
 leave both times down here 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.800
 sometimes connected to whoever interests 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.170
 but who likes a detective novel by 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.940
 rails are suspect but today a lot 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.100
 can be sure that the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.470
 truth does not disappoint 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.940
 I intend to read and in September I also receive 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.090
 in partnership with Galera record label 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.360
 the book every day of dave liebman the latvian 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.370
 I do not know, I'm protected because I loved you. 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.170
 the il that the author wrote in co-authoring 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.970
 with a green 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.769
 I loved the narrative of the author I loved 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.530
 the narrative of the two is true 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.480
 will be the team's friend this part of 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.160
 river payne is written by jon hamm and the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.650
 part of the other item that should always be 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.330
 I need more that is inscribed by the light 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.030
 regardless of the two reasons 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.709
 The athlete's lawyer I loved both 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.989
 same then I know I got crazy 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.730
 to read here even does not know the notes 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.070
 or anything but I was crazy back and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.870
 I ended up seeing good phrases that left me a 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.269
 scared because I imagined that 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.790
 was a contemporary novel so without 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.140
 many fantasies the novel but like me 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.790
 I discovered that the reason for the book was 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.920
 will call every day precisely because the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.450
 The protagonist of the book wakes up every 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.030
 body of a different person I found 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.620
 strange surreal but anyway I'm 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.570
 eager to read a book is 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.420
 being super well received and everyone sees 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.359
 now year and ends it is wonderfully 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.000
 beautiful and a show apart on stage is 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.270
 very very beautiful even see the contact 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.010
 with the wide had of the publisher 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.900
 and every day is also a book that I 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.490
 I really do want the tv, I hope 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.080
 you can read all the books during the 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.300
 September as I intend to do now 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.230
 I will show you with flashes made by site 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.700
 from the hail 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.260
 today they know about eight 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.520
 have been well marked so will 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.410
 able to resist asking for 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.880
 delivered in the famous physical store that 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.740
 would you like to allow it to my side of my house? 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.480
 because that way you do not pay freight then 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.330
 was well into account 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.030
 one of them was the husband 22 of milan dijon 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.830
 God forbid, remember me and it may be that 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.390
 It has nothing to do but it happens to me. 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.640
 feeling reminds me a little book 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.140
 model appeared free that I love 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.240
 I totally want to look 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.640
 and this one also has to do with 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.330
 with technology from the modern world having a 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.940
 case them a facebook and twitter 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.650
 mean he can not speak for 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.360
 I've seen that there are some chapters that 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.680
 are counted by the normal narrative 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.380
 running 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.030
 not every e mail is not little 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.500
 internet language or anything else 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.910
 It seems very good, it went well. 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.669
 received too many times 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.260
 positive aspects of this book was released and I 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.190
 problem, I do not 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.830

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.710
 A certain mystery if I'm not mistaken. 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.600
 replied from the two ships that 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.520
