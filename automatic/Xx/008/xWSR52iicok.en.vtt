a<00:00:34.699> really<00:00:34.910> big<00:00:35.120> buffer<00:00:35.629> you<00:00:35.960> can<00:00:35.989> keep

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
a really big buffer you can keep

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.759 
a really big buffer you can keep
shooting<00:00:36.949> for<00:00:37.280> like<00:00:37.399> 40<00:00:37.760> 50<00:00:37.940> frames<00:00:38.449> with<00:00:39.050> 5d

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
shooting for like 40 50 frames with 5d

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.430 
shooting for like 40 50 frames with 5d
or<00:00:39.800> 70<00:00:40.489> you<00:00:40.730> might<00:00:40.879> be<00:00:40.969> with<00:00:41.090> you<00:00:41.180> 1012<00:00:42.109> shots

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
or 70 you might be with you 1012 shots

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.200 
or 70 you might be with you 1012 shots
and<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.829> buffer<00:00:43.160> needs<00:00:43.309> time<00:00:43.609> to<00:00:43.760> catch<00:00:43.910> up

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
and the buffer needs time to catch up

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.330 
and the buffer needs time to catch up
it's<00:00:44.420> really<00:00:44.870> good<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.530> shoot<00:00:45.710> sports<00:00:46.190> with

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
it's really good to shoot sports with

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.060 
it's really good to shoot sports with
this<00:00:46.519> because<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.239> need<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:48.289> have<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.679> camera

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
this because you need to have the camera

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.639 
this because you need to have the camera
always<00:00:49.449> ready<00:00:50.449> because<00:00:50.989> that<00:00:51.140> that<00:00:51.289> buffer

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
always ready because that that buffer

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.040 
always ready because that that buffer
sometimes<00:00:52.070> if<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:52.730> use<00:00:52.760> older<00:00:53.629> cameras

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
sometimes if you use older cameras

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.329 
sometimes if you use older cameras
you're<00:00:54.320> like<00:00:54.469> waiting<00:00:54.920> you're<00:00:55.070> watching

took<00:01:08.030> their<00:01:08.240> photo<00:01:08.479> it's<00:01:09.200> not<00:01:09.530> full<00:01:10.159> 35<00:01:10.670> sensor

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
took their photo it's not full 35 sensor

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.240 
took their photo it's not full 35 sensor
this<00:01:11.479> is<00:01:11.630> slightly<00:01:12.049> smaller<00:01:12.380> sensor<00:01:12.890> with<00:01:13.070> you

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
this is slightly smaller sensor with you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.219 
this is slightly smaller sensor with you
you<00:01:13.909> won't<00:01:14.030> notice<00:01:14.210> them<00:01:14.540> what<00:01:14.960> about<00:01:15.049> the

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
you won't notice them what about the

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.710 
you won't notice them what about the
megapixels<00:01:15.890> like<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:16.520> is<00:01:16.700> 16<00:01:17.060> megapixels

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
megapixels like this is 16 megapixels

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.749 
megapixels like this is 16 megapixels
like<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.020> t2i<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:18.619> twenty<00:01:19.009> two<00:01:19.159> megapixel<00:01:19.700> I

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
like a t2i is twenty two megapixel I

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.280 
like a t2i is twenty two megapixel I
mean<00:01:19.909> they<00:01:20.060> keep<00:01:20.329> adding<00:01:20.750> more<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:21.140> like

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
mean they keep adding more is like

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.859 
mean they keep adding more is like
there's<00:01:21.530> more<00:01:21.740> information<00:01:22.329> but<00:01:23.329> it's<00:01:23.689> not

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
there's more information but it's not

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.020 
there's more information but it's not
necessarily<00:01:24.229> better<00:01:24.860> information<00:01:25.729> if<00:01:25.909> you've

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
necessarily better information if you've

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.940 
necessarily better information if you've
got<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.240> small<00:01:26.750> sensor<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.649> you've<00:01:27.740> got<00:01:27.920> a

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
got a small sensor and you've got a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.770 
got a small sensor and you've got a
shitty<00:01:28.310> lens<00:01:28.549> it<00:01:29.270> doesn't<00:01:29.509> make<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.630> difference

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
shitty lens it doesn't make a difference

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.260 
shitty lens it doesn't make a difference
what<00:01:30.439> megapixel<00:01:31.009> you<00:01:31.100> have<00:01:31.219> you<00:01:31.579> need<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:32.119> have

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
what megapixel you have you need to have

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.819 
what megapixel you have you need to have
a<00:01:32.329> good<00:01:32.450> piece<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.659> glass<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.320> front<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.740> the

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
a good piece of glass in front of the

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:34.959 
a good piece of glass in front of the
sensor<00:01:34.040> or<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:34.430> doesn't<00:01:34.670> really<00:01:34.759> mean

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
sensor or it doesn't really mean

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.310 
sensor or it doesn't really mean
anything<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.509> difference<00:01:35.810> between<00:01:36.020> getting

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
anything the difference between getting

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.050 
anything the difference between getting
a<00:01:36.500> low-end<00:01:36.860> camera<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:37.280> high-end<00:01:37.579> cameras<00:01:37.850> is

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
a low-end camera and high-end cameras is

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.230 
a low-end camera and high-end cameras is
using<00:01:38.719> a<00:01:38.930> higher<00:01:39.469> high<00:01:39.710> or<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.880> it

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
using a higher high or so and and it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.029 
using a higher high or so and and it
doesn't<00:01:41.600> get<00:01:41.689> grainy<00:01:42.079> so<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.590> lot<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.829> photo

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
doesn't get grainy so a lot of photo

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.760 
doesn't get grainy so a lot of photo
journalists<00:01:43.579> use<00:01:44.360> these<00:01:44.630> because<00:01:45.289> they<00:01:45.560> can

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
journalists use these because they can

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.550 
journalists use these because they can
go<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.250> war-torn<00:01:46.759> area<00:01:47.450> or<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.140> desert

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
go to a war-torn area or in the desert

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.410 
go to a war-torn area or in the desert
with<00:01:48.770> minimal<00:01:49.280> moonlight<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.119> get<00:01:50.270> some

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
with minimal moonlight and get some

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.029 
with minimal moonlight and get some
incredible<00:01:50.780> images<00:01:51.110> because<00:01:51.409> they're<00:01:51.680> really

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
incredible images because they're really

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.740 
incredible images because they're really

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
pushing the limits of the sensitivity of

pushing the limits of the sensitivity of
the<00:01:53.869> sensors<00:01:54.259> for<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.950> while<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.159> was<00:01:55.820> afraid<00:01:55.850> to

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
the sensors for a while I was afraid to

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.080 
the sensors for a while I was afraid to
push<00:01:56.570> anything<00:01:57.530> above<00:01:57.799> 3200<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.820> then<00:01:58.939> all<00:01:59.060> of

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
push anything above 3200 and then all of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.120 
push anything above 3200 and then all of
