00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.960
 Y 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.559
 beautiful people welcome to this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.010
 channel today I bring you this makeup already 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.640
 finally returning to the normality of 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.680
 makeups obviously after 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.540
 have fought three videos blogs I hope 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.790
 which they have liked to had very 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.579
 good response and also to get out of 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.470
 the daily routine of make-up by 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.329
 the make-up because I did not want 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.000
 this channel from the beginning was like 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.800
 a whole that would have everything stick 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.149
 I bring you this makeup I was 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.840
 asking for makeup for the day of san 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.640
 valentine's day lovers and for 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.800
 I decided to do this recreate this 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.380
 makeup with a little bit of tones 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.990
 very subtle roses trying not to be not 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.640
 fall as in exaggeration because good 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.860
 Well, we do not want our partner to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.410
 stay with the makeup and we are 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.420
 kissing us pampering I do not expect it to be 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.000
 of your liking if you are interested that they should 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.390
 know I'm going to start by applying a tone 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 cream on the brow bone this I'm going 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.009
 to bring towards the fixed eyelid this 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.580
 will help all the others 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.970
 shadows diffuse 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.350
 easier beforehand apply a test 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.270
 if you already know that I always tell you that it is 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.340
 important to apply a test so that 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.590
 last us as long as possible 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.100
 shadows in this case I'm occupying the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:33.140
 Today's naked 3 pallet I sold key 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:37.460
 and I continued with the limit tone that is a 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 pink tone or a very short rosewood and 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.549
 I tell them that they do not necessarily have 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.640
 to use these same shadows 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.560
 you play with your shadows like this is 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.890
 the makeup I'm doing this with 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.090
 the 40 sigma brush is losing 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.140
 I will continue with the lunar tone 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.450
 what is a brown tone 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.640
 mate with a sector not 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.950
 I see him as a fright no more said 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.680
 but well, I'm not going to do it with the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.179
 brush lying down but I'll try to 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.119
 apply the shadow 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:14.459
 with this movement doing as I eat 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.459
 curve ando the fixed eyelid 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.880
 so that there is a trace there as 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.300
 different not that it is not the same always 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.110
 then I continue with the rolling tone and this 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.050
 I'm applying it with the broach 239 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.620
 of mac and I'm just going to do it in the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.620
 eyelid mobile 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.310
 I will continue with the express shadow of 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.390
 mac and I'm going to apply it with a brush 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.810
 make it in pencil 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.180
 this is 30 sigma and I'm going to apply it 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.489
 only in the basin but also what 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.709
 I'm going to take it to the fold this is going to 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.870
 be very subtle because remember that this 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.599
 makeup we are trying to make it 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.700
 as subtle as can be true because 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.710
 know that I am not subtle I changed from 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.050
 brush and diffuse this stroke 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.600
 and return with the one that applies the tone of 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.640
 transition is simply I give it a 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.300
 lightly passed so that everything is more 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.790
 integrated and more blurred 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.660
 I'm going to use this shadow in mousse 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.410
 the brand 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.070
 it's called long lasting lustro eyeshadow 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.940
 and that I'm going to apply with my fingers 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.940
 only on the mobile eyelid 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.420
 and I wanted to add a little glitter 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.700
 because if not, it would not be to me if I 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.310
 like the brightness he likes the thing well 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.319
 as too folkloric you already know and 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.720
 well, these shadows are very subtle 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.390
 but very adoc apart is super economic 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.860
 then I will take from the same palette 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.980
 the naked 3 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.470
 the tone 2 that is a kind like mini 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.629
 compacted glitter that comes in the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.870
 palette and with your finger 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.349
 I'm going to apply it on the shadow in 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.349
 mousse of him 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.870
 line with a coffee tone in gel format 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.060
 and now I'm cleaning any 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.300
 shadow residue that has fallen to the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.099
 skin 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.319
 and here I realized that I was not 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.659
 recording neither the delineated but neither 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.759
 recorded how to apply the lashes I did 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:34.970
 with the technique below the 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:37.370
 eyelashes now I'm going with the delineated 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.970
 the bottom part I use 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.040
 this brand pencil was out in tone 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.270
 coffee too and what I'm going to do is 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.210
 Mark the lower lashes a little 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.370
 and the girl everything happened today 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.350
 and with the waste that remained of the 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.270
 shade of roses that we put on the eyelid 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.569
 mobile on the top only 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.969
 I'm going to blur 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.990
 but this is going to be very very subtle because 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.610
 it's the only thing we're going to do 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.100
 later on the water line I'm going to 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.590
 Apply this flesh-colored tone that is 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.370
 the brand rimmel london the nuts environment 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.370
 I think it's 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.150
 and applied a little bit of lighting in the 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.050
 part of the lacrimal 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.030
 this is a champagne tone I do not have it to the 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.520
 hand and is the tone I think it's 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.350
 illuminator that I used at this time and 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.840
 the makeup of the eyes is finished 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.870
 a subtle makeup but at the same time 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.910
 it does not stop being romantic and elegant with 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.550
 a touch of brightness that you already know is 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.860
 something that I like if I continue with 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.650
 the lips and line with the ink line 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:53.870
 number 10 of lips that of visu and this 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:57.080
 Nix labial is called angel or angel 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.800
 English is everything the day gives 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.389
 from today 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.060
 how I saw it is a little strong 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.830
 I just grab a nude tone this is 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.199
 one of my favorites 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.780
 the nude katrice tone I love because 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.120
 it's very creamy but I like it because I 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.090
 the tonality of any 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.020
 lipstick that I put him was already much 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.930
 best of blush I used the mauve tone of 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.360
 mac and I'm applying it with the brush 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:29.960
 of almost always clear angle contour of 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.960
 marifer on the apples of my cheeks 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.669
 with this brush of the brand I saw her is the 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.699
 number one I'm going to give you one pass for 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:41.280
 that everything is very integrated later with 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.860
 this illuminator of the pk mark on the 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.370
 mon stone tone and royal brush 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.139
 techniques serÃ­n bros I will apply in 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.139
 the upper part of my cheeks 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:59.240
 finally this way we got this makeup 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.160
 something subtle elegant without leaving the 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.980
 shine that is something that I personally 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.480
