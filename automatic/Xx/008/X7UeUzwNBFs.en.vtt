00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
I'm really excited to be driving this

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.610 
I'm really excited to be driving this
this<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.570> fantastic<00:00:04.250> now<00:00:05.299> when<00:00:06.529> could<00:00:07.529> I

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
this is fantastic now when could I

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.570 
this is fantastic now when could I
actually<00:00:07.830> buy<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.340> car<00:00:09.410> if<00:00:10.460> assuming<00:00:11.460> you

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
actually buy this car if assuming you

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.600 
actually buy this car if assuming you
mean<00:00:11.730> everything<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:13.080> track<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.740> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
mean everything is is on track and and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.670 
mean everything is is on track and and
when<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> 10,000<00:00:15.780> people<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> one<00:00:16.529> of

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
when the 10,000 people in the one of

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.490 
when the 10,000 people in the one of
your<00:00:16.830> photos<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.609> bar<00:00:18.270> finished<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.020> when<00:00:19.350> can

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
your photos of bar finished and when can

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
your photos of bar finished and when can
I<00:00:19.619> actually<00:00:19.830> get<00:00:20.420> it<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:22.970> realistically<00:00:23.970> yeah

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
I actually get it is realistically yeah

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.540 
I actually get it is realistically yeah
any<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.810> think<00:00:25.109> it'd<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> ways<00:00:25.590> out<00:00:25.800> now<00:00:26.310> what

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
any I think it'd be a ways out now what

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.320 
any I think it'd be a ways out now what
what<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:27.510> expect<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.699> many<00:00:29.699> people<00:00:30.150> have

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
what you can expect is many people have

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.260 
what you can expect is many people have
interest<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> first<00:00:31.410> cars<00:00:31.850> but<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> think

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
interest in the first cars but I think

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.660 
interest in the first cars but I think
realistically<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.800> start<00:00:35.010> production<00:00:35.370> end

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
realistically is we start production end

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
realistically is we start production end
of<00:00:35.790> 2010<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> first<00:00:37.680> half<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.660> 2011<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.469> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of 2010 in the first half of 2011 so you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.240 
of 2010 in the first half of 2011 so you
probably<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.640> then<00:00:41.879> buy<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.660> kind<00:00:43.250> 2011

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
probably can then buy this kind 2011

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.340 
probably can then buy this kind 2011
this<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.879> slower<00:00:45.149> than<00:00:45.270> Anna<00:00:45.600> normal<00:00:45.989> program

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
this is slower than Anna normal program

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.650 
this is slower than Anna normal program
because<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.309> F<00:00:47.910> dealerships<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> have

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
because of the F dealerships you have

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.270 
because of the F dealerships you have
training<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.289> other<00:00:49.590> things<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:49.980> need<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
training with other things that need to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.069 
training with other things that need to
happen<00:00:50.460> how<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.000> roll<00:00:51.270> out<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> stick<00:00:51.809> then

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
happen how you roll out the stick then

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
happen how you roll out the stick then
you<00:00:52.289> stopped<00:00:52.620> us<00:00:52.920> first<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:53.730> Europe<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
you stopped us first and then Europe and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.470 
you stopped us first and then Europe and
China<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.949> takes<00:00:56.190> some<00:00:56.480> some

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
China so as you are it takes some some

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
China so as you are it takes some some
time<00:00:58.070> but<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.460> expect<00:00:59.910> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.870 

after<00:01:03.180> roughly<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.960> year<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:05.159> are<00:01:05.280> meeting<00:01:05.700> then

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
after roughly a year we are meeting then

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.899 
after roughly a year we are meeting then
full<00:01:06.270> production<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.170> selling<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
full production now are you selling a

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.810 
full production now are you selling a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
very quickly how I have a very simple

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.670 
very quickly how I have a very simple
concept<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> battery<00:01:28.140> half<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.470> size

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
concept for the battery half the size

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.670 
concept for the battery half the size
half<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.159> price<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.610> next<00:01:29.790> generation

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
half the price and the next generation

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.960 
half the price and the next generation
some<00:01:31.680> people<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.070> said<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.399> electric<00:01:32.790> car

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
some people have said the electric car

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.940 
some people have said the electric car
is<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.149> disruptive<00:01:33.600> technology<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.649> usually

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
is a disruptive technology and usually

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.820 
is a disruptive technology and usually
with<00:01:35.070> disruptive<00:01:35.610> technologies<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
with disruptive technologies you get it

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.370 
with disruptive technologies you get it
foothold<00:01:38.550> in<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:38.880> market<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.929> can<00:01:40.110> evade

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
foothold in the market and you can evade

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.190 
foothold in the market and you can evade
upward<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.690> don't<00:01:42.690> know<00:01:42.750> how<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.929> feel<00:01:43.140> about

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
upward I don't know how you feel about

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.669 
upward I don't know how you feel about
that<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.280> I'd<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.550> curious<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.940> know<00:01:45.210> okay

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
that but I'd be curious to know okay

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.050 
that but I'd be curious to know okay
somebody<00:01:46.679> has<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:46.860> explain<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.490> me<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
somebody has to explain to me if you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.940 
somebody has to explain to me if you
think<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:48.720> current<00:01:48.929> automotive

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.819 

business<00:01:53.939> concept<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.659> being<00:01:54.899> completely

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
business concept of being completely

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.429 
business concept of being completely
dependent<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.759> petroleum<00:01:57.750> whether<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.259> think

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
dependent on petroleum whether you think

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.279 
dependent on petroleum whether you think
this<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.680> sustainable<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.969> think<00:02:00.509> everybody

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
this is sustainable I think everybody

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.690 
this is sustainable I think everybody
would<00:02:01.469> agree<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.890> definitely<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.579> is

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
would agree it is definitely it is

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.300 
would agree it is definitely it is
definitely<00:02:02.909> not<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.560> me<00:02:04.710> electrification

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
definitely not so for me electrification

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.609 
definitely not so for me electrification
is<00:02:05.909> not<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.799> new<00:02:07.799> propulsion<00:02:08.190> system<00:02:09.619> it's

is not just a new propulsion system it's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
end it is a way of making an automotive

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.140 
end it is a way of making an automotive
industry<00:02:16.080> sustainable<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.800> future<00:02:17.150> so

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
industry sustainable in the future so

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.670 
industry sustainable in the future so
whether<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.599> disruptive<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.470> see

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
whether this is disruptive I see

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.440 
whether this is disruptive I see
anything<00:02:20.010> else<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.400> only<00:02:20.700> say<00:02:20.940> all<00:02:21.209> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
anything else I can only say all the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.800 
anything else I can only say all the
technologies<00:02:22.049> that<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.290> am<00:02:22.560> seeing<00:02:23.810> currently

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
technologies that I am seeing currently

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.880 
technologies that I am seeing currently
I<00:02:26.209> think<00:02:27.209> extended<00:02:27.840> range<00:02:27.930> electric<00:02:28.110> vehicles

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
I think extended range electric vehicles

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.069 
I think extended range electric vehicles
have<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.400> highest<00:02:29.910> volume<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.569> level<00:02:31.049> you

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
have the highest volume this level you

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.610 
have the highest volume this level you
see<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.709> such<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.700> huge<00:02:32.970> cost<00:02:33.360> advantage<00:02:34.140> for

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
see a such a huge cost advantage for

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.970 
see a such a huge cost advantage for
this<00:02:34.799> concept<00:02:35.400> compared<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.530> pure<00:02:37.530> electric

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
this concept compared to a pure electric

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.699 
this concept compared to a pure electric
vehicle<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.849> firmly<00:02:39.599> believe<00:02:40.079> this<00:02:40.560> is

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
vehicle that I firmly believe this is

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.680 
vehicle that I firmly believe this is
not<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.340> technology<00:02:41.970> for<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.239> next<00:02:42.480> five

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
not just a technology for the next five

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.509 
not just a technology for the next five
to<00:02:43.019> ten<00:02:43.200> years<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.709> mean<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.950> seems<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.280> there

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
to ten years I mean it seems like there

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:45.650 
to ten years I mean it seems like there
are<00:02:44.549> two<00:02:44.790> different<00:02:45.120> approaches<00:02:45.450> here

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
are two different approaches here

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.970 
are two different approaches here
there's<00:02:47.000> Tesla<00:02:48.000> Motors<00:02:48.780> type<00:02:49.410> approach<00:02:49.769> which

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
there's Tesla Motors type approach which

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.809 
there's Tesla Motors type approach which
is<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.250> make<00:02:50.400> something<00:02:50.610> that's<00:02:50.730> extremely

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
is to make something that's extremely

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.759 
is to make something that's extremely
expensive<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.720> then<00:02:51.900> you'll<00:02:52.110> expand<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:52.739> that

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
expensive and then you'll expand on that

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.979 
expensive and then you'll expand on that
and<00:02:53.069> decrease<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.519> price<00:02:53.670> there's<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
and decrease the price there's the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.580 
and decrease the price there's the
plug-in<00:02:55.410> idea<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.700> then<00:02:57.000> there's<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.600> range

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
plug-in idea and then there's the range

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.620 
plug-in idea and then there's the range
extended<00:02:59.130> option<00:02:59.639> which<00:02:59.819> is<00:03:00.030> more<00:03:00.359> of<00:03:00.480> a

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
extended option which is more of a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.220 
extended option which is more of a
stepping<00:03:01.290> stone<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:02.400> we<00:03:02.850> will<00:03:03.120> see<00:03:03.450> then<00:03:04.200> you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
stepping stone is we will see then you

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.789 
stepping stone is we will see then you
will<00:03:04.470> see<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.579> emphasis<00:03:06.090> here<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.799> pure

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
will see the emphasis here is pure

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.129 
will see the emphasis here is pure
electric<00:03:08.340> driving<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:09.090> important<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.810> I

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
electric driving is important and I

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.500 
electric driving is important and I
don't<00:03:10.440> want<00:03:10.799> my<00:03:11.370> engine<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.180> start

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
don't want my engine to start

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.050 
don't want my engine to start
just<00:03:14.170> because<00:03:14.590> my<00:03:14.920> electric<00:03:15.370> drive<00:03:15.580> system<00:03:15.610> is

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
just because my electric drive system is

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.899 
just because my electric drive system is
not<00:03:16.209> powerful<00:03:16.540> enough<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:17.290> drive<00:03:18.010> like<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.760> do

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
not powerful enough to drive like you do

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.059 
not powerful enough to drive like you do
now<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.360> don't<00:03:19.930> want<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.379> see<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.620> engine<00:03:20.890> come

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
now I don't want to see the engine come

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.190 
now I don't want to see the engine come
up<00:03:21.220> when<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.549> distance<00:03:21.909> the<00:03:22.659> accelerator

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
up when you distance the accelerator

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.770 
up when you distance the accelerator
pedal<00:03:23.319> because<00:03:23.950> our<00:03:24.610> studies<00:03:25.090> clearly<00:03:25.390> shown

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
pedal because our studies clearly shown

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.960 
pedal because our studies clearly shown
you<00:03:26.500> will<00:03:26.680> do<00:03:26.829> this<00:03:27.010> within<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.370> first<00:03:27.640> three

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
you will do this within the first three

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.149 
you will do this within the first three
to<00:03:28.180> five<00:03:28.480> minutes<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.959> your<00:03:29.079> driving<00:03:29.349> you<00:03:30.010> will

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
to five minutes of your driving you will

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.369 
to five minutes of your driving you will
immediately<00:03:30.489> see<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:31.870> come<00:03:32.079> into<00:03:32.230> a

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
immediately see that you come into a

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.649 
immediately see that you come into a
situation<00:03:32.680> where<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.459> need<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.030> vehicle

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
situation where you need the vehicle

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.360 
situation where you need the vehicle
performance<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.799> engine<00:03:36.069> will<00:03:36.220> start

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
performance and so the engine will start

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.740 
performance and so the engine will start
and<00:03:36.700> we'll<00:03:36.849> run<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.450> Heidi<00:03:38.670> yeah<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:40.239> just

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
and we'll run and Heidi yeah it is just

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.630 
and we'll run and Heidi yeah it is just
conceptually<00:03:41.140> I<00:03:41.560> don't<00:03:41.920> agree<00:03:42.129> and<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.459> said

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
conceptually I don't agree and I said

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.309 
conceptually I don't agree and I said
because<00:03:42.790> then<00:03:43.120> I'm<00:03:43.269> in<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.540> situation<00:03:43.989> yes<00:03:44.140> i

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
because then I'm in the situation yes i

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.649 
because then I'm in the situation yes i
can<00:03:44.560> use<00:03:44.769> electricity<00:03:45.340> as<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> supplemental

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
can use electricity as a supplemental

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.050 
can use electricity as a supplemental
power<00:03:46.900> don't<00:03:47.709> have<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.040> engine<00:03:48.310> start<00:03:48.579> we<00:03:48.879> ate

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
power don't have the engine start we ate

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.940 
power don't have the engine start we ate
the<00:03:49.209> noise<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.450> don't<00:03:49.989> create<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.319> emissions

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
the noise and don't create the emissions

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.720 
the noise and don't create the emissions
in<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:51.970> not<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.299> idea<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:53.170> i<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:54.310> i<00:03:54.489> can

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
in it's not the idea that i that i can

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.550 
in it's not the idea that i that i can
really<00:03:55.000> create<00:03:55.329> this<00:03:55.599> independence<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.500> i

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
really create this independence that i

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.009 
really create this independence that i
want<00:03:56.950> you<00:03:57.609> if<00:03:57.879> you<00:03:58.030> were<00:03:58.150> going<00:03:58.359> down<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.629> six

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
want you if you were going down a six

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.460 
want you if you were going down a six
percent<00:03:59.409> downgrade<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:01.269> could<00:04:01.450> regenerate<00:04:01.989> a

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
percent downgrade you could regenerate a

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.430 
percent downgrade you could regenerate a
fair<00:04:02.980> amount<00:04:03.069> of<00:04:03.280> power<00:04:03.459> with<00:04:03.730> this<00:04:03.909> well<00:04:04.299> yeah

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
fair amount of power with this well yeah

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.290 
fair amount of power with this well yeah
it's<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.770> mean<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:07.920> it's<00:04:08.459> striking<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.030> you

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
it's I mean it's it's striking but you

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.030 
it's I mean it's it's striking but you
know<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:09.600> some<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.260> other<00:04:10.380> electric<00:04:10.770> cars

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
know so some of the other electric cars

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.730 
know so some of the other electric cars
have<00:04:11.990> considerable<00:04:12.990> manner<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.350> regenerative

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
have considerable manner of regenerative

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.500 
have considerable manner of regenerative
braking<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.550> without<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:15.060> option<00:04:15.480> to

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
braking like this without the option to

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.479 
braking like this without the option to
switch<00:04:15.750> out<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.919> have<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.130> make<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.400> a

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
switch out of it you have to make it a

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.390 
switch out of it you have to make it a
choice<00:04:18.049> how<00:04:19.049> big<00:04:19.380> do<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.620> guys<00:04:19.829> think<00:04:20.130> the

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
choice how big do you guys think the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.170 
choice how big do you guys think the
market<00:04:20.910> share<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:21.570> for<00:04:21.959> these<00:04:22.169> vehicles<00:04:22.560> I

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
market share is for these vehicles I

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.600 
market share is for these vehicles I
mean<00:04:24.180> hi<00:04:24.900> I'm<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.260> mom<00:04:25.440> feelings<00:04:26.040> about<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:26.400> but

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
mean hi I'm a mom feelings about it but

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.110 
mean hi I'm a mom feelings about it but
very<00:04:27.180> difficult<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.780> predict<00:04:28.110> because<00:04:29.120> we

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
very difficult to predict because we

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.690 
very difficult to predict because we
have<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.510> assume<00:04:31.169> this<00:04:31.620> market<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.370> a

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
have to assume this market is a

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.990 
have to assume this market is a
distorted<00:04:33.419> market<00:04:33.870> for<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> while<00:04:34.860> what<00:04:35.700> I<00:04:35.730> mean

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
distorted market for a while what I mean

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.420 
distorted market for a while what I mean
with<00:04:36.150> distorted<00:04:36.660> there<00:04:37.320> is<00:04:37.530> not<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.010> simple

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
with distorted there is not the simple

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.930 
with distorted there is not the simple
market<00:04:38.790> mechanism<00:04:39.450> where<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.720> just<00:04:39.960> take

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
market mechanism where you just take

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.180 
market mechanism where you just take
here<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.150> segment<00:04:42.540> CR<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.840> needs<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.770> here's

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
here the segment CR the needs and here's

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.490 
here the segment CR the needs and here's
a<00:04:44.250> certain<00:04:44.550> fuel<00:04:44.760> price<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.150> that's<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.510> this

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
a certain fuel price and that's it this

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.170 
a certain fuel price and that's it this
one<00:04:46.680> here<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:46.890> more<00:04:47.100> cost<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.490> political

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
one here is more cost the political

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.960 
one here is more cost the political
environment<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:49.350> stimulate<00:04:49.950> sales<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.820> this

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
environment to stimulate sales of this

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.230 
environment to stimulate sales of this
future<00:04:51.330> technology

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.300
