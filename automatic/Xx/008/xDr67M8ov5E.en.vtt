car<00:00:37.350> we've<00:00:37.499> designed<00:00:37.769> ourselves<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:39.269> a<00:00:39.329> fun

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
car we've designed ourselves it's a fun

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.319 
car we've designed ourselves it's a fun
car<00:00:39.719> great<00:00:40.289> to<00:00:40.409> drive<00:00:40.530> nice<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.670> look<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:41.999> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
car great to drive nice to look at that

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.810 
car great to drive nice to look at that
very<00:00:42.420> nice<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.809> look<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.379> underneath<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
very nice to look at but underneath the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.360 
very nice to look at but underneath the
skin<00:00:45.089> it's<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.809> standard<00:00:46.199> forward<00:00:46.859> mechanics

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
skin it's all standard forward mechanics

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.220 
skin it's all standard forward mechanics
so<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.909> idea<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.359> what<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.659> buy<00:00:48.780> yourself<00:00:49.109> an

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
so the idea is what you buy yourself an

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.130 
so the idea is what you buy yourself an
old<00:00:49.319> Fiesta<00:00:49.859> yeah<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:51.600> one's<00:00:51.780> based<00:00:51.989> around

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
old Fiesta yeah this one's based around

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.939 
old Fiesta yeah this one's based around
the<00:00:52.260> mark<00:00:52.409> 3<00:00:52.620> Fiesta<00:00:53.100> which<00:00:53.249> is<00:00:53.370> 1995<00:00:54.239> sorry

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
the mark 3 Fiesta which is 1995 sorry

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.189 
the mark 3 Fiesta which is 1995 sorry
1992-95<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.359> could<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.629> buying<00:00:57.809> something

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
1992-95 so you could be buying something

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
1992-95 so you could be buying something
that's<00:00:58.319> only<00:00:58.440> got<00:00:58.649> say<00:00:58.829> 20,000<00:00:59.460> miles<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.760> the

that's only got say 20,000 miles on the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:00.590 
that's only got say 20,000 miles on the
clock

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
clock

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.349 
clock
three<00:01:01.289> four<00:01:01.499> years<00:01:01.530> old<00:01:01.889> and<00:01:02.249> you'd<00:01:02.579> use<00:01:02.909> a<00:01:02.940> lot

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
three four years old and you'd use a lot

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.759 
three four years old and you'd use a lot
of<00:01:03.389> the<00:01:03.539> components<00:01:03.989> from<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.290> almost

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
of the components from it almost

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.310 
of the components from it almost
everything<00:01:05.339> yeah<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.850> then<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.509> by<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> body

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
everything yeah and then what by a body

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.870 
everything yeah and then what by a body
shell<00:01:07.590> from<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.009> and<00:01:08.250> bolt<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.729> together

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
shell from you and bolt it all together

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
shell from you and bolt it all together
as<00:01:09.329> simple<00:01:10.079> as<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.320> yes<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:13.409> takes<00:01:13.590> something

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
as simple as that yes it takes something

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.800 
as simple as that yes it takes something
to<00:01:13.979> build<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:15.240> does<00:01:15.390> vary<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.689> lot

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
to build one it really does vary a lot

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.310 
to build one it really does vary a lot
we<00:01:15.990> quote<00:01:16.200> around<00:01:16.500> 200<00:01:16.920> hours<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.939> mean

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
we quote around 200 hours but I mean

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.990 
we quote around 200 hours but I mean
someone<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.500> me<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:19.829> I'm<00:01:20.009> not<00:01:20.189> confident<00:01:20.850> in

someone like me if I'm not confident in

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.660 
someone like me if I'm not confident in
my<00:01:21.149> skills<00:01:21.539> to<00:01:21.810> build<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:23.250> i<00:01:23.280> buy<00:01:23.460> one

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
my skills to build one can i buy one

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.760 
my skills to build one can i buy one
ready-made<00:01:24.090> yes<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.810> mean<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.079> do<00:01:25.289> like<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.649> do

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
ready-made yes I mean we do like to do

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
ready-made yes I mean we do like to do
that<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.070> well<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.820> probably<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.270> thrift<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:27.719> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that as well we probably do thrift for a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.929 
that as well we probably do thrift for a
month<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.140> built<00:01:28.590> cars<00:01:28.860> where<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> big

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
month of built cars where the big

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.340 
month of built cars where the big
advantage<00:01:30.359> of<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> customer<00:01:31.229> could

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
advantage of that is the customer could

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.349 
advantage of that is the customer could
come<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.740> get<00:01:31.890> involved<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.270> he

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
come in and get involved a lot if he

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.789 
come in and get involved a lot if he
wants<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.109> at<00:01:34.229> all<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.469> he<00:01:34.530> doesn't

wants to or not at all if he doesn't

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.429 
wants to or not at all if he doesn't
want<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.520> cost<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.869> does<00:01:37.140> vary

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
want to the cost of that it does vary

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.249 
want to the cost of that it does vary
about<00:01:38.189> twelve<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.090> fifteen<00:01:39.390> thousand<00:01:40.140> we

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
about twelve to fifteen thousand we

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.709 
about twelve to fifteen thousand we
