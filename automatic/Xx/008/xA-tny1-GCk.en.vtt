00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:13.120
 so we have a client pitch depth 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.779
 roots at the level of seven 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:22.480
 at the level of seven the length is on the level 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:24.790
 also sevens and a shade about 773 already 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.210
 maybe a little copper with the same boys 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.960
 sew 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.329
 our task is to lighten all 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.350
 hair and achieve blonde 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:38.260
 at least at the level of eight now gal 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.860
 dilutes the powder with oxide and we will 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.890
 the canvas 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.489
 over the entire length of stepping back from the root 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:51.429
 powder here we are already part of the process 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:53.579
 the hair we have done is applied at the beginning on 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.579
 tip because there is the greatest 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.359
 the accumulation of color was and then we will be 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.780
 distribute 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:07.170
 on higher by length and already depending on 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.770
 what we have at the end 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.770
 lighten up will pick up a recipe 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 farther 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.909
 and paint the end we already went there 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:30.670
 reaction and we are going to paint now 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.670
 length departing from the root 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:41.320
 we will breed a new portion of paint so here we are 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.090
 inflicted on the second part of the hair now 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.600
 will be applied to the root 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.330
 dilute another spoonful of powder with 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.140
 oxide and will apply here we have 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.560
 went the reaction we have already reached somewhere 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.960
 83 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.850
 Well , there is a little copper tablet gives 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.760
 such an orange shade on the very 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:11.200
 In fact, there is a golden tide in 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.160
 In general, the color rises, I thought it would be 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.820
 worse climb 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.380
 so the process continues here 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.300
 staining and stepping back from the root 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.320
 full length 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.520
 we are already well good enough 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.520
 a voice rose 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.620
 so here we have the process the process goes 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.560
 very well, we have now developed 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.170
 Powder thinner and more straight to the process 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 whip up a little more inflicted on 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.940
 straight hair liquid liquid powder 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.190
 Now the process is still safe to sit 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:56.110
 15-20 minutes you can safely sit here with us 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.810
 flushing process we wash off 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.580
 Be sure to deep clean shampoo 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:09.290
 after the powder always use only 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:10.670
 this shampoo balm hair process 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.270
 we will not because we continue 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.290
 there will be a dyeing process 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.280
 slightly- wet car to do 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.900
 roots mostly dry 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.959
 so here what is happening with us is whether 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.470
 you we washed 2 but painted over the roots and already 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:34.300
 paint the film on wet hair 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.300
 we put training 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.770
 and here we have girls finished almost 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.800
 paint now we make the gift he 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:50.800
 Fedor fell on this 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:53.380
 we have the process of flushing gryadochki 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.260
 have not yet arrived see it so 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.130
 good enough beige straight good 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.700
 walking was a good block I think 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:06.840
 879 7 we have achieved with him he is still on 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.840
 tom will become lighter 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:30.430
 the average turned out to be a fairly even color 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.640
 I was afraid that they would be stained enough 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.100
 It will turn out even on the tablet looks 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.570
 In general, a beautiful mad fox tablet then 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.570
 there is not enough violet yet 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.940
 protonate the violet we will generally
