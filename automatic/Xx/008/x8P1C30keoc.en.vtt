but<00:01:53.000> usually<00:01:53.330> it's<00:01:53.479> called<00:01:53.659> pastry<00:01:54.170> flour<00:01:54.290> or

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
but usually it's called pastry flour or

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.580 
but usually it's called pastry flour or
cake<00:01:54.830> flour<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:56.720> reason<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.200> has<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.350> low

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
cake flour and the reason it has a low

gluten content it comes from a different
kind<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.570> wheat<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.110> don't<00:02:00.380> want<00:02:00.710> that

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
kind of wheat but you don't want that

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.560 
kind of wheat but you don't want that
protein<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.610> don't<00:02:01.759> want<00:02:01.909> those<00:02:02.000> glutens<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
protein you don't want those glutens to

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.020

is that comes from that process removes

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.149 
is that comes from that process removes

just about any remaining nutrients there

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.819 
just about any remaining nutrients there
are<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:20.669> if<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.849> can<00:03:21.209> look<00:03:21.750> for<00:03:22.079> unbleached

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
are so if you can look for unbleached

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.390

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
little bit more dense so maybe start

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.119 
little bit more dense so maybe start
with<00:03:47.939> replacing<00:03:48.689> say<00:03:48.900> 40%<00:03:49.379> of<00:03:49.829> your<00:03:49.919> white

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
with replacing say 40% of your white

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.979 
with replacing say 40% of your white
flour<00:03:50.400> with<00:03:50.909> wheat<00:03:51.120> flour<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.629> see<00:03:51.780> if<00:03:51.870> you

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
flour with wheat flour and see if you

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.379 
flour with wheat flour and see if you
like<00:03:52.169> it<00:03:52.229> the<00:03:52.949> benefit<00:03:53.609> of<00:03:53.639> that<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.299> you

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
like it the benefit of that is that you

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.240 
like it the benefit of that is that you
get<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.720> goodness<00:03:55.109> of<00:03:55.259> the<00:03:55.379> whole<00:03:55.590> grain<00:03:56.009> you

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
get the goodness of the whole grain you

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.399 
get the goodness of the whole grain you
get<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.549> germ<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.000> bran<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.479> the<00:03:58.019> endosperm

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
get the germ the bran and the endosperm

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.069 
get the germ the bran and the endosperm
which<00:03:58.769> means<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.790> get<00:03:59.909> more<00:04:00.180> fiber<00:04:00.449> more

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
which means you get more fiber more

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.899 
which means you get more fiber more
protein<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.560> more<00:04:01.889> vitamins<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.579> minerals

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
protein and more vitamins and minerals

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.270 
protein and more vitamins and minerals
one<00:04:03.870> thing<00:04:04.049> about<00:04:04.259> white<00:04:04.500> flour<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:04.919> think<00:04:05.189> I

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
one thing about white flour I think I

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.949 
one thing about white flour I think I
mentioned<00:04:05.669> they<00:04:05.759> might<00:04:05.970> call<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.389> enriched

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
mentioned they might call it enriched

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.349 
mentioned they might call it enriched
because<00:04:07.799> they've<00:04:08.040> taken<00:04:08.310> out<00:04:08.669> that<00:04:08.939> brand<00:04:09.239> in

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
because they've taken out that brand in

the<00:04:09.449> German<00:04:09.780> most<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.229> good<00:04:10.379> stuff<00:04:10.650> that's

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
the German most of the good stuff that's

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.640 
the German most of the good stuff that's
in<00:04:11.069> wheat<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:12.000> USDA<00:04:12.750> government<00:04:13.500> has

in wheat the USDA government has

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.830 
in wheat the USDA government has

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
required that white flour have things

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.800 
required that white flour have things
added<00:04:16.259> back<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.530> it<00:04:17.060> niacin<00:04:18.060> thiamine

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
added back to it niacin thiamine

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
to white flour you don't need to do that

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.920 
to white flour you don't need to do that
if<00:04:23.849> you<00:04:23.970> use<00:04:24.150> whole<00:04:24.360> wheat<00:04:24.389> because<00:04:24.780> it's

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
if you use whole wheat because it's

have any gluten and they're processed in

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.070 
have any gluten and they're processed in
a<00:04:56.400> completely<00:04:56.910> separate<00:04:57.240> facility<00:04:57.720> so<00:04:57.900> you'll

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
a completely separate facility so you'll

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.760 
a completely separate facility so you'll
be<00:04:58.230> safe

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
be safe

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.820 
be safe
finally<00:04:59.730> with<00:04:59.940> whole<00:05:00.240> wheat<00:05:00.270> flour<00:05:00.630> it<00:05:01.320> tends

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
finally with whole wheat flour it tends

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.280 
finally with whole wheat flour it tends
to<00:05:01.980> go<00:05:02.190> rancid<00:05:02.670> faster<00:05:03.390> than<00:05:03.690> regular<00:05:03.930> flour

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
to go rancid faster than regular flour

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.470 
to go rancid faster than regular flour
because<00:05:04.770> it<00:05:04.800> still<00:05:05.310> has<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.730> brand<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.210> germ

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
because it still has that brand and germ

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.700 
because it still has that brand and germ
so<00:05:06.690> there's<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.900> little<00:05:07.020> bit<00:05:07.110> more<00:05:07.350> fat

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
so there's a little bit more fat
