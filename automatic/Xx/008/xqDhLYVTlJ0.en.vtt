as you can see the buttons will slide

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.760 
as you can see the buttons will slide
right<00:01:04.519> into<00:01:05.000> here<00:01:05.449> they'll<00:01:06.049> fit<00:01:06.350> right<00:01:06.560> in

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770

which then you can push this from the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.709 
which then you can push this from the
outside<00:01:09.950> now<00:01:10.280> my<00:01:10.520> downside<00:01:10.969> with<00:01:11.179> this<00:01:11.359> is<00:01:11.569> you

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
outside now my downside with this is you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.779

don't really get the feedback of a click
from<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.749> buttons<00:01:15.079> as<00:01:15.289> you<00:01:15.469> would<00:01:15.649> without<00:01:15.920> a

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
from the buttons as you would without a

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.859 
from the buttons as you would without a
case<00:01:16.280> on<00:01:16.490> it's<00:01:16.729> more<00:01:16.969> of<00:01:17.090> just<00:01:17.119> you<00:01:17.420> push<00:01:17.689> it

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
case on it's more of just you push it

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.480 
case on it's more of just you push it
and<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.229> happens<00:01:18.649> you<00:01:18.829> don't<00:01:18.979> really<00:01:19.159> get<00:01:19.429> the
