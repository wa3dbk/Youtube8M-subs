00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.740 
how he ended up yeah a lot of people
have<00:01:37.920> also<00:01:38.070> asked<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.700> he's<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> stormtrooper

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
have also asked if he's a stormtrooper

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.260 
have also asked if he's a stormtrooper
why<00:01:40.200> doesn't<00:01:40.470> he<00:01:40.710> look<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.189> Jango<00:01:41.939> Fett

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
why doesn't he look like Jango Fett

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.700 
why doesn't he look like Jango Fett
that's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> fair<00:01:42.840> point<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.470> clear<00:01:43.680> that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
that's a fair point but I can clear that

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.499 
that's a fair point but I can clear that
up<00:01:43.860> there's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.490> big<00:01:44.729> difference<00:01:45.149> between<00:01:45.299> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
up there's a big difference between a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.810 
up there's a big difference between a
storm<00:01:45.840> trooper<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.740> clone<00:01:47.070> trooper<00:01:47.280> clone

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
storm trooper and a clone trooper clone

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.370 
storm trooper and a clone trooper clone
troopers<00:01:48.180> were<00:01:48.270> mainly<00:01:48.509> used<00:01:48.659> during<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
troopers were mainly used during the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.929 
troopers were mainly used during the
Clone<00:01:49.619> Wars<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.100> we're<00:01:50.220> gradually<00:01:50.549> phased

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
Clone Wars but we're gradually phased

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.490 
Clone Wars but we're gradually phased
out<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> number<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> reasons

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
out for a number of reasons

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.319 
out for a number of reasons
after<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> Kamino<00:01:53.250> uprising<00:01:53.790> which<00:01:53.939> I'm<00:01:54.119> not

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
after the Kamino uprising which I'm not

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
after the Kamino uprising which I'm not
gonna<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.659> into<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.430> just

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
gonna get into because it's it's just

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.340 
gonna get into because it's it's just
clones<00:01:56.880> fighting<00:01:57.270> clones<00:01:57.540> let's<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.259> a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
clones fighting clones let's just it's a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.630 
clones fighting clones let's just it's a
whole<00:01:58.380> other<00:01:58.680> thing<00:01:58.770> who<00:01:59.219> cares

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
whole other thing who cares

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160 
whole other thing who cares
anyways<00:02:00.030> after<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.689> Emperor<00:02:00.990> then

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
anyways after that the Emperor then

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.050 
anyways after that the Emperor then
decided<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.130> too<00:02:02.250> dangerous<00:02:02.460> to

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
decided that it was too dangerous to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.300 
decided that it was too dangerous to
just<00:02:03.329> use<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:03.540> template<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.710> every<00:02:04.860> soldier

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
just use one template for every soldier

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.160 
just use one template for every soldier
due<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.969> possibility<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.509> corruption

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
due to the possibility of corruption

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.660 
due to the possibility of corruption
also<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.829> there<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.129> conflicting

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
also and there is conflicting

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.460 
also and there is conflicting
information<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.390> clones<00:02:09.899> are<00:02:10.080> sometimes

regular dudes john boyega's character is
most<00:02:28.799> likely<00:02:29.129> not<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.580> clone<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:30.299> merely

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
most likely not a clone but merely

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.869

I'd<00:02:33.750> say<00:02:33.930> also<00:02:34.200> these<00:02:34.379> new<00:02:34.620> stormtroopers

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
I'd say also these new stormtroopers

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.580 
I'd say also these new stormtroopers
here<00:02:35.430> they're<00:02:35.790> probably<00:02:36.180> also<00:02:36.599> recruits<00:02:37.230> you
