00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.049
 analogue to be over and to end this thing 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.509

 You can play to her will until that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.960
 controversy many people do not like how 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.680
 too many people may not like the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.770
 my set 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.180
 a lot of people love in all my people 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.399
 loves and hates 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.939
 I like football, I think it's a 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.659
 face that at least what I saw in that 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.460
 dvd is a guy that he can be 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.009
 electronic and commercial at the same time 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.320
 that a lot of people do not like cops 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.500
 I'm all dj at parties so I 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.500
 to adapt to any situation understood 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.080
 any style of audience 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.420
 You need to play a ballad. 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.180
 electronics I can turn around if the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.110
 To party for 15 years, I'll do it. 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.180
 there's marriage 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.710
 I turn also what others of jesus 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.920
 maybe it does not fit and I think I 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.520
 I can solve this in several 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.590
 situations 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.590
 I think this is my seal. 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.300
 was not highlighted in the 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.490
 had access to the media was simply 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.739
 another operator in the marriage as 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:47.030
 bartender there is the geninho knows one more 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:52.000
 today was not a star the sound is a stage 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:56.200
 to know $ 400,000 to play 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.640
 understood then it is absurd the price of a 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.150
 of an international band show 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.160
 face comes have disc weight and snake 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.709
 values ​​so takes multitudes more than 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.020
 famous rock band understood of 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.610
 pop singers understood then today is 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.980
 highlight in the media today of propaganda 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.750
 mounts tracks is a producer 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.750
 I never imagined it would come to that much 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.930
 I think it's all valid but I think everything 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.540
 have to have a limit is still this 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.250
 digital technology I still like that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.019
 it merges with the emergence of 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.480
 everything is poison so I like to ride 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.000
 playing with a considered country with 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.769
 these technologies that you use vinyl 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.810
 so you have everything to stay 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.510
 carrying one of the extremely heavy cases 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.209
 You handle with the wine you like 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.790
 to see the DJ playing covenant for 19 being 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.860
 so you see what this ring has received 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.170
 who receives a paycheck for back and forth with 2 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.850
 It takes patients and, you know, I think 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.459
 devalues the self 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.739
 I really like vinyl marketing where 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.870
 You see that you fight a lot to grow here more 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.420
 today 's pointing has also become a 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.090
 reliable appliance I think the 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.110
 trend should be stronger still 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.010
 for this line 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.900
 of lap top 1000 understood yield of 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:27.800
 so I do not like it very much I do not think much 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:30.410
 cold humility creativity seek what 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.460
 people have not yet done without 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:38.540
 innovative try to be the first to persist 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.370
 in your dream be a chaos and neither you 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.320
 wants to be a dj 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.340
 like me playing in multiple segments 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.550
 congratulations 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.230
 however doing this maybe you will 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.030
 to be the DJ to play my English will 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.590
 I played house understood I think you get 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.050
 because you do with love and it 's with love 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.050
 You will touch various styles as well. 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.130
 made the start is very difficult is 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.750
 humiliating 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.090
 You have to go through many situations. 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.490
 that maybe you have to exist more 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.010
 think one thing everyone is there one 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.669
 hour yesterday that always in the new harvest 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.669
 understood then
