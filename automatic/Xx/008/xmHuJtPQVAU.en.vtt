00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.509 
tastes nuts I'm going to show you guys
the<00:00:09.120> trick<00:00:09.360> which<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:10.019> variation<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:11.160> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the trick which is a variation on a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.220 
the trick which is a variation on a
trick<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.759> already<00:00:12.120> exists<00:00:12.509> called<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
trick that already exists called the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.279 
trick that already exists called the
typhoon<00:00:13.820> it's<00:00:14.820> also<00:00:14.969> known<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.480> vortex<00:00:16.020> break

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
typhoon it's also known as vortex break

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.210 
typhoon it's also known as vortex break
it<00:00:16.740> looks<00:00:16.890> like<00:00:17.010> this

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.519 

and<00:00:24.849> my<00:00:25.240> immersion<00:00:25.480> instead<00:00:26.080> of<00:00:26.170> having<00:00:26.349> the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
and my immersion instead of having the

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.040 
and my immersion instead of having the
great<00:00:26.769> bottom<00:00:27.460> of<00:00:27.669> the<00:00:27.789> vortex<00:00:28.150> you<00:00:28.779> have<00:00:28.930> the

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
great bottom of the vortex you have the

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.319 
great bottom of the vortex you have the
break<00:00:29.259> at<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.500> top<00:00:29.740> of<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.099> cortex<00:00:30.519> so

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
break at the top of the cortex so

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.910 
break at the top of the cortex so
because<00:00:31.750> it's<00:00:31.899> a<00:00:31.960> reversal<00:00:32.439> of<00:00:32.619> a<00:00:32.710> trick

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
because it's a reversal of a trick

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.260 
because it's a reversal of a trick
called<00:00:33.100> tycoon<00:00:33.340> I'm<00:00:33.760> going<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.000> call<00:00:34.149> it<00:00:34.210> the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
called tycoon I'm going to call it the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.090 
called tycoon I'm going to call it the
great<00:00:34.449> game<00:00:34.629> or<00:00:34.899> you<00:00:35.470> can<00:00:35.620> just<00:00:35.739> call<00:00:35.920> it<00:00:35.949> a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
great game or you can just call it a

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.850 
great game or you can just call it a
reverse<00:00:36.399> or<00:00:37.239> text<00:00:37.510> break<00:00:37.750> but<00:00:38.079> that's<00:00:38.620> kind<00:00:38.829> of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
reverse or text break but that's kind of

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.460 
reverse or text break but that's kind of
a<00:00:38.949> mouthful<00:00:39.309> so<00:00:39.989> yeah<00:00:40.989> I'll<00:00:41.199> just<00:00:41.230> show<00:00:41.440> you

okay and let's do that again use the

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:14.080 
okay and let's do that again use the
motion<00:01:00.840> maybe

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.930 

yeah<00:01:15.090> let<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:15.390> break<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.690> down<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:16.940> you're

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
yeah let me break it down now you're

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.690 
yeah let me break it down now you're
here<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.510> me<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.960> hope<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.620> left<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.580> I'll

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
here with me I hope to the left but I'll

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.480 
here with me I hope to the left but I'll
show<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.360> right<00:01:21.570> let's<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.190> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
show you to the right let's do it up and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.700 
show you to the right let's do it up and
then<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.180> your<00:01:24.270> other<00:01:24.420> hand<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:25.260> that<00:01:25.560> you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
then with your other hand it's that you

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.410 
then with your other hand it's that you
would<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.950> pulling<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:26.760> with<00:01:27.000> usually

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
would be pulling it down with usually

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.050 
would be pulling it down with usually
grab<00:01:28.260> on<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.470> outside<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.980> the<00:01:29.070> hoop<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.730> stop

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
grab on the outside of the hoop and stop

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.440 
grab on the outside of the hoop and stop
it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.920 
it
and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.170> pull<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.440> back<00:01:31.470> down<00:01:32.690> let's<00:01:33.690> do<00:01:33.810> them

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and then pull it back down let's do them

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:59.720 
and then pull it back down let's do them
the<00:01:34.080> other<00:01:34.200> direction<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.610> not

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
the other direction and it's not

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.970 
the other direction and it's not
starting<00:01:59.970> for<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.320> pretty<00:02:01.320> much<00:02:01.470> like<00:02:01.620> every

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
starting for you pretty much like every

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.070 
starting for you pretty much like every
vortex<00:02:02.430> move<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.910> can<00:02:03.060> make<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.330> easier<00:02:03.840> by

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
vortex move you can make it easier by

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.470 
vortex move you can make it easier by
turning<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.190> same<00:02:05.250> direction<00:02:06.800> so<00:02:08.480> I'll

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
turning in the same direction so I'll

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:18.200 
turning in the same direction so I'll
demonstrate<00:02:09.690> that

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.220 

I<00:02:18.270> hope<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.350> guys<00:02:20.630> appreciated<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:22.050> this

I hope you guys appreciated that if this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.990 
I hope you guys appreciated that if this
