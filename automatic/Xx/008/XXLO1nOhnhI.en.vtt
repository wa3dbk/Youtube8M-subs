 0 victory of the cfc has seen her 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:03.589
 assessment to the 90 minutes our 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.619
 game we also have in this game 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.210
 seen our car drivers 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.119
 the flap location we have a good one 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.640
 possibility shoot no goal cashed 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.190
 according to standard situation 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.649
 and then you're back in our old one 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.860
 pattern expire 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.450
 the enemy was worse we are too 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.770
 slowly in danger because on the offensive 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.490
 or on the defensive and yes if the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.030
 say music 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.030
 for tenants win break and then went 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.640
 come into play 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:48.040
 every cell to lie down because as 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.110
 condition i want you on behalf of 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.850
 Team still 40 especially for us 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.790
 Thanks for the guys like this 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.460
 stadium because he reports to and 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.440
 above all things even sg 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.560
 crafts rabenstein us thoughts like that 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.610
 then spontaneously because there is no room to do it 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.190
 has sucked her place 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.360
 bus driver drove two broken by name 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.380
 Suggestions to compliance only 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.040
 quickly a flight and then falls to me 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.770
 not yesterday 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.190
 find football itself that was 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.590
 important at this point again 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.140
 from actions of the guys to the game 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.380
 so much and already clear that 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.540
 friedrich struck by the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.660
 last games he would come 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.790
 It was very important for us that we from 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.470
 start and that's what we find 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.010
 quite impressively made very early 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.040
 disturb and that happen from our gate 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.580
 Keep away from it but a preview is out of it 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.230
 still appears 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.890
 that's right otherwise we have 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.110
 stop now I think I want to or 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.510
 very strong and the game enforced 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.710
 been very aggressive and disturbed early 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.400
 very compact in front of everything and that 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.860
 we puzzle over the last game 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.340
 standard situation was prone to have that 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.300
 we probably did not record 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.620
 Second half we wanted to go 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.510
 refill the third gate 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.600
 Of course, the riester will then 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.900
 again some pressure from the pressure 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.770
 Cabin come but we have dancing 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.420
 nothing allowed 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.920
 we had two three really good ones 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.830
 We unfortunately do not do that 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.700
 used in the end I think there is that 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.760
 popular Swiss view no doubt 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.230
 we are very happy about that 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.250
 not just because it was somehow, but 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.900
 because as we said, yes, you come too 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.280
 below we have no goals to react 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.370
 already on side and 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.370
 very beautiful
