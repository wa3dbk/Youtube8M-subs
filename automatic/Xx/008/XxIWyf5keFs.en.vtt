review on my new and improved
cool-looking<00:00:11.250> blue<00:00:12.380> drift<00:00:13.380> pipe<00:00:14.299> it's

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
cool-looking blue drift pipe it's

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.920 
cool-looking blue drift pipe it's
actually<00:00:15.660> called<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.049> tuning<00:00:16.560> pipe<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.930> America

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
actually called a tuning pipe in America

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.450 
actually called a tuning pipe in America
but<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.439> country<00:00:19.590> they<00:00:19.859> call<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> drift

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
but in my country they call it a drift

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.420 
but in my country they call it a drift
pipe<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.910> had<00:00:21.660> mentioned<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.619> previous

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
pipe I had mentioned this in my previous

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.960 
pipe I had mentioned this in my previous
video

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
video

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.240 
video
well<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.480> motovlog<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.680> if<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.830> guys<00:00:25.920> want

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
well it's a motovlog so if you guys want

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.730 
well it's a motovlog so if you guys want
you<00:00:26.369> guys<00:00:26.400> could<00:00:26.730> check<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.090> out

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
you guys could check that out

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.040 
you guys could check that out
so<00:00:29.869> basically<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.740> exhaust<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.640> uh

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
so basically this exhaust is uh

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.920 
so basically this exhaust is uh
currently<00:00:34.550> purely<00:00:35.550> Japanese<00:00:36.030> made<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.600> Japan

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
currently purely Japanese made in Japan

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.260 
currently purely Japanese made in Japan
it<00:00:37.890> uh<00:00:39.829> it's<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.980> free<00:00:41.219> flow<00:00:41.520> exhaust<00:00:41.879> so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it uh it's a free flow exhaust so

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
it uh it's a free flow exhaust so
there's<00:00:42.480> less<00:00:42.629> restriction<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> engine

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
there's less restriction for the engine

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.810 
there's less restriction for the engine
too

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
too

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.690 
too
so<00:00:45.440> all<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.680> fumes<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.190> everything<00:00:47.550> could

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
so all the fumes and everything could

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.990 
so all the fumes and everything could
exhale<00:00:48.210> very<00:00:48.450> very<00:00:49.320> awesomely<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.070> faster

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
exhale very very awesomely and faster

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.569 
exhale very very awesomely and faster
and<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> bike<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:52.770> more<00:00:52.980> torque<00:00:53.280> here

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
and make the bike a lot more torque here

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.000 
and make the bike a lot more torque here
some<00:00:54.030> more<00:00:54.300> better<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:55.680> stuff<00:00:55.949> like

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
some more better you know stuff like

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.150 
some more better you know stuff like
that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.270 

as<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.640> guys<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.940> tell<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.180> had<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> factory<00:01:01.469> X

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.359 
it will be clean next week I'll be doing
oil<00:01:50.310> change<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.880> transmission<00:01:51.509> oil<00:01:51.750> change

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
oil change and transmission oil change

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.700 
oil change and transmission oil change
because<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.759> 300<00:01:54.689> miles<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.110> every<00:01:55.290> 300

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
because it's 300 miles and every 300

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.530 
because it's 300 miles and every 300
miles<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.130> an<00:01:56.369> oil<00:01:56.490> change<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.119> thing<00:01:57.360> I

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
miles I do an oil change on this thing I

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.539 
miles I do an oil change on this thing I
want<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> keep<00:01:58.409> my<00:01:58.530> thing<00:01:58.740> running<00:01:59.009> strong<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
want to keep my thing running strong and

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.810 
want to keep my thing running strong and
clean<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.750> hopefully<00:02:01.649> give<00:02:01.860> me<00:02:02.040> 3,000<00:02:02.670> miles

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
clean and hopefully give me 3,000 miles

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.100 
clean and hopefully give me 3,000 miles
because<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.329> my<00:02:03.450> only<00:02:03.630> source<00:02:03.990> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
because it's my only source of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.150 
because it's my only source of
transportation<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> moment

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
transportation at the moment

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.210 
transportation at the moment
so<00:02:07.160> it's<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.970> free-flow<00:02:08.450> exhaust<00:02:08.810> with<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.220> 2.5

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
so it's a free-flow exhaust with a 2.5

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.290 
so it's a free-flow exhaust with a 2.5
