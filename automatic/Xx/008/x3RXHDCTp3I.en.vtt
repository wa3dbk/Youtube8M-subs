in<00:00:19.009> the<00:00:19.340> library<00:00:19.970> on<00:00:20.180> mob<00:00:20.450> of<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:20.599> dead<00:00:20.689> now

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:21.649 
in the library on mob of the dead now

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.760 
in the library on mob of the dead now
the<00:00:22.360> library<00:00:23.360> itself<00:00:23.450> has<00:00:23.960> four<00:00:24.410> different

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
the library itself has four different

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.240 
the library itself has four different
books<00:00:25.250> which<00:00:25.520> are<00:00:26.050> legible<00:00:27.050> although<00:00:27.829> the<00:00:28.040> one

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
books which are legible although the one

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.280 
books which are legible although the one
on<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.460> far<00:00:28.489> left<00:00:28.939> I<00:00:29.059> can<00:00:29.270> actually<00:00:29.630> read<00:00:29.809> the

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
on the far left I can actually read the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.650 
on the far left I can actually read the
art<00:00:30.500> of<00:00:30.739> something<00:00:31.369> not<00:00:31.550> too<00:00:31.730> sure<00:00:31.969> what

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
art of something not too sure what

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.690 
art of something not too sure what
actually<00:00:33.080> says<00:00:33.320> but<00:00:33.560> the<00:00:33.650> next<00:00:33.890> one<00:00:34.070> along<00:00:34.340> is

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
actually says but the next one along is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.820 
actually says but the next one along is
mine<00:00:35.330> spelunking<00:00:35.900> after<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.530> cooking

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
mine spelunking after that is cooking

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.220 
mine spelunking after that is cooking
with<00:00:36.950> me<00:00:37.160> time<00:00:37.790> management<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.540> Alcatraz

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
with me time management and the Alcatraz

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.710 
with me time management and the Alcatraz
swim<00:00:39.440> team<00:00:39.950> yearbook<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:40.790> I<00:00:41.330> think<00:00:41.540> that

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
swim team yearbook and I think that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.570 
swim team yearbook and I think that
that's<00:00:41.750> that<00:00:42.290> itself<00:00:42.740> is<00:00:42.920> just<00:00:43.100> a<00:00:43.190> reference

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
that's that itself is just a reference

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.340 
that's that itself is just a reference
to<00:00:43.820> because<00:00:44.360> it<00:00:44.480> was<00:00:44.630> there<00:00:44.870> are<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.080> lot<00:00:45.320> of

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
to because it was there are a lot of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.650 
to because it was there are a lot of
stories<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.010> stuff<00:00:46.190> that<00:00:46.460> people<00:00:47.150> escape

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
stories and stuff that people escape

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.569 
stories and stuff that people escape
alcatraz<00:00:47.870> by<00:00:48.170> swimming<00:00:48.620> even<00:00:49.280> though<00:00:49.400> the

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
alcatraz by swimming even though the

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.069 
alcatraz by swimming even though the
water<00:00:49.760> is<00:00:49.940> absolutely<00:00:50.300> freezing<00:00:50.540> cold<00:00:50.900> you

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
water is absolutely freezing cold you

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.020 
water is absolutely freezing cold you
would<00:00:51.200> die<00:00:51.380> in<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:51.650> get<00:00:51.860> ipad<00:00:52.160> thermium<00:00:52.520> die

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
would die in it get ipad thermium die

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.180 
would die in it get ipad thermium die
and<00:00:53.810> also<00:00:54.020> time<00:00:54.320> management<00:00:54.800> i<00:00:54.860> think<00:00:55.070> that's

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
and also time management i think that's

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.440 
and also time management i think that's
kind<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:55.460> like<00:00:55.610> a<00:00:55.670> little<00:00:55.790> bit<00:00:56.030> of<00:00:56.090> a<00:00:56.180> stab

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
kind of like a little bit of a stab

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.500 
kind of like a little bit of a stab
towards<00:00:56.989> um<00:00:57.520> yeah<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.730> zombie<00:00:59.030> team<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.420> how

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
towards um yeah the zombie team and how

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.720 
towards um yeah the zombie team and how
the<00:00:59.570> story<00:01:00.260> is<00:01:00.380> progressed<00:01:00.800> now<00:01:00.980> because<00:01:01.280> it's

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
the story is progressed now because it's

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.400 
the story is progressed now because it's
at<00:01:01.880> a<00:01:01.910> point<00:01:02.180> now<00:01:02.300> where<00:01:02.450> anything<00:01:03.230> can

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
at a point now where anything can

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.250 
at a point now where anything can
fucking<00:01:03.770> happen<00:01:04.129> because<00:01:04.579> time<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:05.780> magic

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
fucking happen because time and magic

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.670 
fucking happen because time and magic
and<00:01:06.470> blur<00:01:07.180> teleportation<00:01:08.180> magic<00:01:08.630> shit<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.350> it

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
and blur teleportation magic shit and it

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.310 
and blur teleportation magic shit and it
is<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:09.920> kind<00:01:10.400> of<00:01:10.520> annoying<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.120> and<00:01:11.390> that's<00:01:11.930> just

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
is a kind of annoying so and that's just

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.770 
is a kind of annoying so and that's just
why<00:01:12.470> I<00:01:12.530> think<00:01:12.800> Coco<00:01:13.310> V<00:01:13.640> Meath<00:01:14.030> means<00:01:14.360> nothing

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
why I think Coco V Meath means nothing

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.469 
why I think Coco V Meath means nothing
with<00:01:14.930> me<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:16.130> art<00:01:16.340> of<00:01:16.549> something<00:01:17.299> I<00:01:17.390> have

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
with me and the art of something I have

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.539 
with me and the art of something I have
no<00:01:17.630> idea<00:01:17.780> but<00:01:18.680> probably<00:01:18.979> irrelevant<00:01:19.190> but<00:01:19.460> the

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
no idea but probably irrelevant but the

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.890 
no idea but probably irrelevant but the
main<00:01:19.729> thing<00:01:19.760> that<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.120> want<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.360> look<00:01:20.479> at<00:01:20.720> is

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
main thing that I want to look at is

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.590 
main thing that I want to look at is
mine<00:01:21.650> spelunking<00:01:22.490> now<00:01:23.030> there<00:01:23.180> is<00:01:23.299> actually

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
mine spelunking now there is actually

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.820 
mine spelunking now there is actually
quite<00:01:23.690> a<00:01:23.780> lot<00:01:23.990> going<00:01:24.170> around<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.680> community

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
quite a lot going around the community

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.940 
quite a lot going around the community
that<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.640> next<00:01:25.940> map<00:01:26.090> is<00:01:26.240> going<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.570> be<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:27.409> dig

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
that the next map is going to be a dig

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.160 
that the next map is going to be a dig
site<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.370> some<00:01:28.640> kind<00:01:28.880> or<00:01:29.210> it's<00:01:29.900> going<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.080> be

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
site of some kind or it's going to be

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.380 
site of some kind or it's going to be
underground<00:01:30.650> or<00:01:31.280> it's<00:01:31.549> going<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.700> be<00:01:31.880> some

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
underground or it's going to be some

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.980 
underground or it's going to be some
kind<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.770> buried<00:01:33.770> area<00:01:34.220> but<00:01:34.880> that's<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.840> main

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
kind of buried area but that's the main

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.359 
kind of buried area but that's the main
thing<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.320> I<00:01:36.380> want<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.650> look<00:01:36.830> at<00:01:36.979> is<00:01:37.130> mine

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
thing that I want to look at is mine

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.399 
thing that I want to look at is mine
spelunking<00:01:38.000> because<00:01:38.330> they<00:01:38.900> do<00:01:38.960> throw<00:01:39.260> in

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
spelunking because they do throw in

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.070 
spelunking because they do throw in
these<00:01:39.530> little<00:01:39.770> tiny<00:01:39.950> hints<00:01:40.430> in<00:01:40.640> which<00:01:41.080> they

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
these little tiny hints in which they

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.510 
these little tiny hints in which they
reference<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.650> next<00:01:42.860> maps<00:01:43.040> like<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
reference to the next maps like the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.870 
reference to the next maps like the
escape<00:01:43.880> from<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.840> tomb<00:01:45.110> poster<00:01:45.799> it<00:01:46.610> just

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
escape from the tomb poster it just

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.670 
escape from the tomb poster it just
seems<00:01:47.030> very<00:01:47.270> very<00:01:47.659> arbitrary<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.470> well

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
seems very very arbitrary and well

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.359 
seems very very arbitrary and well
detailed<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.460> be<00:01:49.689> anything<00:01:50.689> but<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:51.189> hint<00:01:52.189> to

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
detailed to be anything but a hint to

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.620 
detailed to be anything but a hint to
something<00:01:52.850> or<00:01:52.970> a<00:01:53.000> reference<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.600> something

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
something or a reference to something

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
pretty much what it is is just like you

something<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.709> just<00:02:21.830> jump<00:02:22.099> down<00:02:22.159> the

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
something and you just jump down the

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.000 
something and you just jump down the
abseiling<00:02:23.150> or<00:02:23.590> whatever<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.650> want<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:24.830> call

it<00:02:25.069> but<00:02:25.340> there<00:02:25.849> is<00:02:25.970> as<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.420> say<00:02:26.540> quite<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.810> lot<00:02:26.959> of

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
it but there is as I say quite a lot of

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.539 
it but there is as I say quite a lot of
stuff<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.440> speculation<00:02:28.010> going<00:02:28.159> around<00:02:28.459> that

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
stuff and speculation going around that

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.550 
stuff and speculation going around that
the<00:02:28.670> next<00:02:28.940> map<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.239> going<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.540> be<00:02:29.720> underground

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
the next map is going to be underground

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.960 
the next map is going to be underground
or<00:02:31.010> buried<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.579> some<00:02:31.760> kind<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.799> think<00:02:34.670> that's

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
or buried of some kind so I think that's

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.569 
or buried of some kind so I think that's
a<00:02:35.090> reference<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.110> we<00:02:37.099> might<00:02:37.340> be<00:02:37.459> able

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
a reference to that so we might be able

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.520 
a reference to that so we might be able
to<00:02:37.670> see<00:02:37.849> that<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.180> next<00:02:38.299> DLC<00:02:38.870> we<00:02:39.110> might<00:02:39.319> not

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
to see that in the next DLC we might not

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.990 
to see that in the next DLC we might not
we'll<00:02:39.769> have<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.040> see<00:02:40.190> about<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.489> or<00:02:40.849> you'll

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
we'll have to see about that or you'll

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.449 
we'll have to see about that or you'll
have<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.209> see<00:02:41.510> about<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:42.049> I<00:02:42.590> do<00:02:43.040> know<00:02:43.430> that

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.069 
have to see about that I do know that
