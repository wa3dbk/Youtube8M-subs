your pitch what I found with these shows
broadly<00:00:36.450> speaking<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.320> start<00:00:37.590> from

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
broadly speaking is that you start from

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.150 
broadly speaking is that you start from
the<00:00:37.980> title<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.760> work<00:00:38.969> backwards<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.590> title

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the title and work backwards the title

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.150 
the title and work backwards the title
itself<00:00:41.420> has<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.840> enough<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.410> draw<00:00:43.739> us<00:00:43.950> in

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

which<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> why<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.390> things<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.780> dog

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
which is why you get things like dog

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
title and work my way backwards so my

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.849 
title and work my way backwards so my
suggestion<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.610> blaze<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.960> granny<00:01:00.770> there<00:01:01.770> was

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
suggestion is blaze of granny there was

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.619 
suggestion is blaze of granny there was
a<00:01:01.890> show<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.579> long<00:01:02.699> ago<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.059> dealt

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
a show not that long ago that dealt

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
a show not that long ago that dealt
sensitively<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> issue<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.129> euthanasia

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
sensitively with the issue of euthanasia

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.830 
sensitively with the issue of euthanasia
but<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> believe<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.419 

the<00:01:12.840> British<00:01:13.289> television<00:01:13.560> public<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.310> now

the British television public have now
had<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.880> dealt<00:01:15.149> with<00:01:15.270> sensitively<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
had that dealt with sensitively and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.419 
had that dealt with sensitively and
they're<00:01:16.020> ready<00:01:16.289> for<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.710> slightly<00:01:17.100> more

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429 
they're ready for a slightly more

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.830 
they're ready for a slightly more
prime-time<00:01:18.240> Saturday<00:01:19.200> night<00:01:19.439> style<00:01:19.890> approach

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
prime-time Saturday night style approach

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
prime-time Saturday night style approach
