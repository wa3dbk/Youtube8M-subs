he hoped they'd find a skull or part of
one<00:01:44.510> a<00:01:48.820> jawbone<00:01:49.820> is<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.180> real<00:01:50.510> find<00:01:50.900> in

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
one a jawbone is a real find in

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.249 
one a jawbone is a real find in
sauropods<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:53.030> neck<00:01:53.240> bone<00:01:53.509> is<00:01:53.690> not<00:01:53.869> firmly

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
sauropods the neck bone is not firmly

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.890 
sauropods the neck bone is not firmly
anchored<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.100> skull<00:01:55.369> so<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.240> jaw<00:01:56.570> can

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
anchored to the skull so a jaw can

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.080 
anchored to the skull so a jaw can
easily<00:01:57.350> become<00:01:57.530> detached<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.820> teeth

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
easily become detached and the teeth

easily become detached and the teeth
lost<00:01:59.840> or<00:02:00.229> crushed<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:01.100> think<00:02:02.060> this<00:02:02.150> is<00:02:02.330> really<00:02:02.509> a

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
lost or crushed I think this is really a

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.290 
lost or crushed I think this is really a
wonderful<00:02:02.990> discovery<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:04.190> really<00:02:04.759> is<00:02:05.030> going
