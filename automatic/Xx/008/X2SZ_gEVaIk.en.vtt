00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.470 
and I you know I think the coaches for
the<00:02:39.700> regimens<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:40.760> they<00:02:40.910> have<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.120> sign<00:02:41.390> you

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
the regimens that they have a sign you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.160 
the regimens that they have a sign you
know<00:02:41.710> it's<00:02:42.710> supposed<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.160> be<00:02:43.340> perfect<00:02:44.270> as<00:02:44.570> it

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
know it's supposed to be perfect as it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.310 
know it's supposed to be perfect as it
can<00:02:45.290> be<00:02:49.540> before<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.570> went<00:02:50.810> out<00:02:50.900> there<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.230> know

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
can be before I went out there you know

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.990 
can be before I went out there you know
I<00:02:51.350> was<00:02:51.530> thinking<00:02:51.860> what<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.430> teams<00:02:52.640> were<00:02:52.790> was

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
I was thinking what the teams were was

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.380 
I was thinking what the teams were was
but<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:54.110> thought<00:02:54.710> I<00:02:55.490> can<00:02:56.060> only<00:02:56.210> control

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
but I just thought I can only control

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:23.100 
but I just thought I can only control
what<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:56.840> control<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.530> was<00:02:57.980> my<00:02:58.100> match
