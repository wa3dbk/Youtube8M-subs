00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.660
 munich / berlin balcony gardener i am 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.059
 again the Christians from balkonien halli 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.280
 Hello, I have one here today 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.820
 Special fertilizer back from the household 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.109
 for you already knew our grandparents 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.840
 but he is getting more and more 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.930
 reapplied because we all have to 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.140
 save and live sustainably yes what have 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.550
 Here we have coffee grounds as fertilizer I have 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.329
 now here, no coffee grounds 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.730
 because I have quite a bit here now 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.820
 freshly ground coffee so that is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.210
 Of course still rich in valuable 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.280
 Ingredients all the minerals 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.910
 in the one plant needs to be stuck in 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.510
 this café set in it in this 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.980
 coffee powder so to speak 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.780
 I did not have any coffee myself now 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.120
 because we do not actually drink like that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.650
 a lot of coffee but I had one more 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.530
 old pack found 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.479
 in the kitchen cabinet that was already 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.210
 Expired and I thought so 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.080
 how do I open now and use 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.900
 just this powder here as fertilizer yes 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.170
 but if you now have old coffee grounds 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.950
 then it is very important that he 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.070
 which dries before because otherwise it forms 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.380
 namely mold should already find 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.380
 reason to be finished 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:43.300
 and therefore just take your café 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:47.500
 bags filter filter bags and pours 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.270
 in a flat in a vessel made of or 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.750
 on a plate that puts in the sun 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.490
 a few days and so you can yours 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.820
 simply dry the coffee grounds 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.220
 very simple and if you are now on 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.510
 then you can start the gardening season 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.060
 you this powder then powder this 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.390
 already in the earth mission if 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.530
 you then plant your plants in the pots 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.450
 Now you can set the retrospectively 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.430
 coffee set here just like that and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.110
 sprinkle over it and pull while watering 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.980
 then, of course, the nutrients in the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.350
 one of the coffee grounds is natural 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.690
 a long-term fertilizer because he of course 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.290
 not all nutrients immediately 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.220
 releases and is thus really suitable 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.180
 very good as a fertilizer on for zucchini 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.820
 and will plant tomatoes here now 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.230
 I have a tomato plant here with me 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.200
 coffee exist or sprinkle the earth 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.989
 and then I will, of course 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.060
 somehow label it after that 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.090
 I know this plant now 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.050
 coffee grounds fertilized and we'll see 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:10.620
 then whether the tomatoes on real 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.630
 red and ripe and tasty 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.530
 In any case, coffee grounds as only 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.170
 I want a really great product 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.209
 Do not tell me though 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.110
 great fertilizer the man from the household 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.270
 Everyone has and before 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.670
 he throws it in the garb give it to them 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.220
 but just plant yours and 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.610
 especially in that a pretty soft one 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.090
 have water with which he pours is suitable 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.890
 just this coffee is very good 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.190
 he rather has something sour 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.580
 ph and thus resembles the then 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.489
 back on earth and yours 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.190
 plants can grow tall and healthy high in 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.040
 the height grow 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:03.549
 yes, that was it from me 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.019
 balconies and I have assigned it a 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.600
