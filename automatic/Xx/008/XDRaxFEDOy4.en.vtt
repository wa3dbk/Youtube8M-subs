at<00:00:13.549> least<00:00:13.760> I<00:00:16.300> don't<00:00:17.300> know<00:00:17.480> how<00:00:17.660> you<00:00:17.690> beat<00:00:17.990> this

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
at least I don't know how you beat this

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.410 
at least I don't know how you beat this
game<00:00:18.350> I<00:00:18.710> don't<00:00:19.189> know<00:00:19.279> what<00:00:19.339> the<00:00:19.460> story<00:00:19.699> is<00:00:19.789> and

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
game I don't know what the story is and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.200 
game I don't know what the story is and
I<00:00:20.480> don't<00:00:20.539> know<00:00:20.720> what<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:20.929> difference<00:00:21.109> is<00:00:21.410> and

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
I don't know what the difference is and

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.290 
I don't know what the difference is and

know what's going on this in first of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.750 
know what's going on this in first of
all<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:36.770> main<00:00:36.949> thing<00:00:37.129> kind<00:00:37.370> of<00:00:37.399> sucks<00:00:37.550> about

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
all the main thing kind of sucks about

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.560 
all the main thing kind of sucks about
this<00:00:38.000> is<00:00:38.059> that<00:00:38.350> when<00:00:39.350> you<00:00:39.469> jump<00:00:39.829> if<00:00:40.730> you<00:00:41.239> jump

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
this is that when you jump if you jump

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.110 
this is that when you jump if you jump
straight<00:00:41.870> up<00:00:41.930> like<00:00:42.739> you<00:00:42.949> can't<00:00:43.250> move<00:00:43.520> most<00:00:43.879> in

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
straight up like you can't move most in

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.060 
straight up like you can't move most in
time<00:00:44.329> i<00:00:44.690> can<00:00:45.050> only<00:00:45.109> move<00:00:45.320> like<00:00:45.530> at<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.770> peak<00:00:45.980> of

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
time i can only move like at the peak of

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.220 
time i can only move like at the peak of
the<00:00:46.190> jump<00:00:46.399> most<00:00:46.910> of<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.180> time<00:00:47.329> it<00:00:47.719> seems<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.079> be

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
the jump most of the time it seems to be

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.910 
the jump most of the time it seems to be
only<00:00:48.350> that<00:00:48.620> way<00:00:48.800> though<00:00:50.109> jumping<00:00:51.109> to<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.620> left

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
only that way though jumping to the left

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.020 
only that way though jumping to the left
for<00:00:52.309> some<00:00:52.460> reason<00:00:53.320> well<00:00:54.320> no<00:00:54.440> it's<00:00:54.620> all<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:55.789> said

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
not a true triangle jumps assuming but

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.800 
not a true triangle jumps assuming but
anyways<00:01:18.730> so<00:01:19.730> as<00:01:19.850> far<00:01:19.970> as<00:01:20.030> i<00:01:20.120> telled<00:01:20.360> objectives

of and nothing hurts those guys nothing
hurts<00:01:54.230> the<00:01:54.440> majority<00:01:54.860> of<00:01:54.890> enemies<00:01:55.220> in<00:01:55.340> this

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
hurts the majority of enemies in this

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.130 
hurts the majority of enemies in this
game<00:01:55.460> they<00:01:55.730> can<00:01:55.850> hurt<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.150> so<00:01:56.810> I'm<00:01:56.990> assuming

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
game they can hurt you so I'm assuming

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.070 
game they can hurt you so I'm assuming
that's<00:01:57.560> intentional<00:01:57.980> and<00:01:58.940> I<00:01:59.720> guess<00:01:59.900> we've<00:02:00.050> got

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
that's intentional and I guess we've got

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.890 
that's intentional and I guess we've got
Santa<00:02:00.560> Claus<00:02:00.800> or<00:02:01.240> something<00:02:02.240> there<00:02:02.540> on<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
Santa Claus or something there on the

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.900 
Santa Claus or something there on the
side<00:02:03.370> Zeus<00:02:04.370> and<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:07.220> not<00:02:07.340> really<00:02:07.490> obvious

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
side Zeus and it's not really obvious

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.639 
side Zeus and it's not really obvious
what<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.239> can<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.720> can't<00:02:08.750> jump<00:02:09.110> on<00:02:09.259> like<00:02:09.440> this

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
what you can and can't jump on like this

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.839 
what you can and can't jump on like this
you<00:02:09.830> would<00:02:09.950> think<00:02:10.069> would<00:02:10.190> be<00:02:10.310> obvious<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.729> can

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
you would think would be obvious you can

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:11.290 
you would think would be obvious you can
jump<00:02:11.000> on

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
jump on

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.350 
jump on
but<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.540> can<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.140> here<00:02:13.130> you've<00:02:13.280> got<00:02:13.310> busy<00:02:14.240> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
but you can and here you've got busy the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.690 
but you can and here you've got busy the
egg<00:02:14.510> or<00:02:14.810> something<00:02:15.080> flipping<00:02:15.590> around<00:02:15.680> we<00:02:16.520> can

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
egg or something flipping around we can

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.400 
egg or something flipping around we can
oh<00:02:16.990> um<00:02:18.340> there<00:02:19.340> you've<00:02:19.520> got<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:20.080> woman<00:02:21.080> singer

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
oh um there you've got a woman singer

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.590 
oh um there you've got a woman singer
apparently<00:02:22.010> pretty<00:02:22.790> much<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.120> objective<00:02:23.510> is

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
apparently pretty much the objective is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.850 
apparently pretty much the objective is
to<00:02:23.660> continue<00:02:23.990> getting<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.350> like<00:02:24.470> energy

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
to continue getting is like energy

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.290 
to continue getting is like energy
things<00:02:25.160> like<00:02:25.400> that's<00:02:25.610> pretty<00:02:25.790> much<00:02:25.940> like<00:02:26.120> what

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
things like that's pretty much like what

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.340 
things like that's pretty much like what
most<00:02:26.450> was<00:02:26.630> built<00:02:26.870> around<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:29.140> getting<00:02:30.140> items

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
most was built around and getting items

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.660 
most was built around and getting items
and<00:02:30.740> stuff<00:02:30.830> like<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.070> sometimes<00:02:31.490> you<00:02:31.580> think

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
and stuff like that sometimes you think

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.260 
and stuff like that sometimes you think
you<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.210> climb<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:32.600> those<00:02:32.810> but<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.530> can't

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
you can climb on those but you can't

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.690 
you can climb on those but you can't
which<00:02:35.270> again<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.660> kind<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.050> weird<00:02:36.200> um<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:37.490> here

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
which again is kind of weird um so here

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
to do in this game now I had that key

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.449 
to do in this game now I had that key
before<00:04:40.779> I'm<00:04:41.739> going<00:04:41.889> to<00:04:41.949> try<00:04:42.069> and<00:04:42.099> get<00:04:42.309> that

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:42.459 
before I'm going to try and get that

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:44.329 
before I'm going to try and get that
again<00:04:42.789> and<00:04:42.909> see<00:04:43.089> if<00:04:43.119> that<00:04:43.209> does<00:04:43.509> anything<00:04:43.539> I
